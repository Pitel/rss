        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Switch version is a Kickstarter stretch goal.
Hoo boy, strap yourselves in for this one folks, because it looks like a doozy. Developer Whatnot Games has revealed Star Racer, a retro sci-fi racing game that takes inspiration from F-Zero and Star Fox. If that's not all, it also boasts the musical talent of Grant Kirkhope, famous for his work on classics like Banjo-Kazooie and GoldenEye 007.
The game is currently being funded via Kickstarter, with a Switch version earmarked as a stretch goal, so if this one looks like it's up your street, you might want to consider backing it sooner rather than later. At first glance, Star Racer looks very similar to F-Zero (which is not a bad thing in our books), with multiple pixel-art sprite vehicles zooming around elaborate tracks. You can battle with your opponents using a familiar circling ground attack, or you can engage your inner Star Fox and launch an aerial assault.

Aloy's Forest is part of Sony's commitment to the UN's Playing for the Planet alliance which seeks to plant 1 million trees in conjunction with the gaming industry. The gaming industry has overshot this goal, and by 2022, 2.5 million trees had been planted globally. 


As part of the project, Sony challenged Horizon Forbidden West players to unlock the "Reached the Daunt" trophy, and for every player who achieved this, a tree would be planted. So far, over 600,000 trees have been planted thanksseveralr of initiatives Sony has taken part in, including the following:

If you were watching today's Level-5 Showcase and were hoping for a lot of news on the incredible-looking detective RPG DECAPOLICE, you may have come away a little bit disappointed.
Originally slated for a 2023 release, Level-5 today announced that it will be taking "a bit more time" to work on the game", meaning it's being pushed to a "post-2024" release. That could mean 2025, but it could also mean 2026, technically.

Sega Sammy has released its financial results for FY2024 Q2, confirming that sales for Sonic Superstars, released earlier this year on October 17th, 2023, were "slightly weaker" than the firm had anticipated (thanks, VGC).
Despite this, Sega remains confident in the title, emphasising that the Sonic IP tends to sell much better during the months of November and December, and so it has ramped up marketing for the game to facilitate this.

Despite having been revealed in the February Nintendo Direct earlier this year, it looks like we are going to have to wait a while before we get our hands on Professor Layton and the New World of Steam as Level-5 has today revealed that the title is now scheduled to release in 2025.
Featuring in today's Vision Showcase, the publisher and developer shared a new gameplay trailer for the upcoming entry in the beloved DS puzzle series. This has provided our first idea of what the title will actually look like (remember, we have only seen cutscene footage so far) and it is all looking really rather neat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not quite Ten Hag out of Ten though.
Football Manager is an obsession for a rather large demographic each year, the sort of game that is nibbling away at the back of your mind when you're supposed to work, do taxes, or just be a grown-up. For some of us the obsession dates back to its Championship Manager days in the early/mid-1990s, and the core of manipulating a massive spreadsheet is still here. That said, the series has evolved a lot in terms of depth and design, with Sports Interactive also finding ways to take the game from its full-fat home on PC to various platforms and formats. For Switch, this means Football Manager 2024 Touch — as opposed to the 'Console' version on PlayStation and Xbox — the iteration of the game that simplifies some areas and strives to retain depth to hook players, all while being accessible on a touch screen.
This year is an interesting entry for another reason; it's an end of an era. As an annual series, it has sometimes been accused of not advancing or changing enough each year, so Sports Interactive opted to change less in this entry with a true sequel/step forward due next year. In a quirky turn of events, however, that approach of simply polishing the heck out of last year's game — while fixing some oddities and irritations — has made this year's PC entry arguably the best in years. Who knew that devoting enough time to one product could make it better?

Stuart is optimistic about what AI can do and sees it as a tool that can simplify developers' lives. Several aspects of game development can be automated with AI, such as localization and game testing. He also gives the following hypothetical scenario: "you now say 'I need the player to get from A to B' and instead of having to write thousands of lines of scripting or code, you just have the AI get you from A to B."

Od ledna příštího roku tak již nic nebrání tomu, aby si každý mohl stáhnout svou občanku do mobilní aplikace. Úřady budou eDoklady přijímat postupně, zpočátku půjde o tzv. Ústřední orgány státní správy, postupně se pak během roku přidají úřady práce, pošty či například policie. Projekt nyní finalizuje Digitální a informační agentura (DIA).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RPG Maker and indie horror games have an amazing symbiotic relationship. The engine is relatively cheap and easy to use, even for those who have little experience with coding games. It also has enough flexibility to let creators create wonderful 2D adventures, either as an RPG or another genre. Horror itself also remains ripe for interesting and experimental stories that best suit a medium like gaming. 


Many RPG Maker horror gems receive the recognition they deserve while others remain highly underrated. Both camps deserve recognition for their respective contributions, no matter how deeply buried the hidden gems are.


Whether you're a newcomer or familiar with horror games in RPG Maker, here are some I think you should check out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom held a new showcase for Dragon’s Dogma 2, showing off more of the game’s fantastical action but giving fans the one thing they’ve wanted most: a release date. The hotly anticipated sequel is coming on March 22.
If that date looks familiar, that’s because it was accidentally leaked not once but twice. The first instance occurred earlier this month, thanks to a PEGI rating that revealed the March 22 date. The second leak occurred just hours before today’s presentation courtesy of the game’s Steam page. But if you missed both early reveals, today is probably a nice surprise. 
A new trailer shows off more of the game’s story while also offering up new gameplay footage. The trailer showcases the new Trickster Vocation alongside new enemies, such as the towering statue, mythical beasts, and, naturally, dragons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crossover skins are extremely commonplace for in-game stores in 2023, and Among Us is no different. Their latest collaborative effort introduces skins from a list of popular indie games; Undertale, Celeste, A Hat in Time, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Untitled Goose Game, Alien Hominid Invasion, and Castle Crashers. The cosmetics from all seven games will be included in a Cosmicube, which can be purchased with 7000 beans. The crossover includes 25 hats, 18 skins, 12 nameplates, 9 visors, and 6 pets. You can see a gallery of the featured skins below.

The update will also include a series of patches (which you can read right here) and will notably deprecate 2021 versions of the game, pushing players to use updated versions instead. "We’ve been supporting a lot of older versions of the game, and as it continues to grow and get new features, it gets harder to keep up," the patch notes read. "We have to remove older versions so we can focus on improving our system for everyone. Make sure you update your game and thanks for understanding!"
This is the first update to Among Us since they added The Fungle, a new map that takes place in a fungus-infested jungle. You can watch the launch trailer right here.
Are you planning on trying out the new cosmetics in Among Us? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

This entry is done by a different developer The Station, whose previous work was also called The Station. So, SteamWorld Build is a bit of a departure for both the developer and for the series as a whole.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Action game developer Action Square revealed an open playtest for their extraction PvPvE dungeon crawler title, Dungeon Stalkers, starting today. The multiplayer extraction game is the first of three to be showcased during their currently ongoing Action Square Steam Fest. Those interested in participating in the playtest simply need to visit the Dungeon Stalkers Steam page and click the green Request Access button.




A fun take on the extraction dungeon crawler genre


Dark and Darker mashed the dungeon crawling and extraction genres together, and Dungeon Stalkers looks to expand on that. I had the opportunity to delve into a few dungeons in Dungeon Stalkers a couple of weeks ago and had a good time slicing up other players to take their loot before trying to extract. Dungeon Stalkers is very clearly inspired by Dark and Darker, but it also adds its own touch as well.


Perhaps the most obvious change is the art style. Even though the dungeons are still dark—and honestly at the build I played, VERY dark, though I was told that would change—the characters and enemies in the dungeon have a more animated style to them. This is amplified by the skillset of the characters. While Dark and Darker utilizes more methodical Dungeons and Dragons style skills, Dungeon Stalkers leans more into big crazy skills. One of the characters wields a two-handed sword that you can charge up to essentially whirlwind around. Overall it feels like an improvement on the genre, and I'm excited to see where Dungeon Stalkers ends up.


There's no release date for Dungeon Stalkers yet, but the open playtest runs through December 4.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you like bears, breakfast, and management sims, boy do we have some wildly specific news for you. Armor Games Studios and Gummy Cat announced that Bear and Breakfast is coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on December 12, 2023.


It's been a little over a year since Bear and Breakfast made its debut on PC. It first hit Steam on July 28, 2022, with a Nintendo Switch port following on September 15, 2022. The game's PlayStation Store page is now live with the ability to add to wishlists. Armor Games Studios shared a new trailer to go along with the update.




Bear and Breakfast has made a name for itself and garnered very positive reviews on Steam for many reasons. First of all, its art direction is just as adorable as its concept, which is exactly what the title implies. You play a bear who is attempting to run a bed and breakfast in the middle of the forest, eventually turning an abandoned shack into a one-stop tourist destination. You can personalize the heck out of your cozy inn, from gathering basic resources to choosing and placing furniture and fixtures. 


As detailed in a recent message, the team at Gummy Cat has been through quite a lot lately. Art director Ioana Șopov was diagnosed with Stage 4 Metastatic Breast Cancer, so the team has rallied together to focus efforts on her treatment and well being. As a result, an upcoming expansion has been delayed. 


The team is clearly grateful for everyone's continued support, and frankly it's amazing that the game is coming to PlayStation so soon under these circumstances. We wish them all the best and hope they take the time they need to continue prioritizing their health above all else.

        <updated>2023-11-28T18:57:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda, the developer behind Starfield, has started to respond to negative reviews of the game on Steam with reasons why players are misguided in their assessment. At the time of writing, I've counted over 100 negative reviews on Steam that have received a response from the developer. 


Bizarrely, in some responses, Bethesda representatives have taken to telling players what they can do in the game. "You can fly, you can shoot, you can mine, you can loot! Starfield is an RPG with hundreds of hours of quests to complete and characters to meet." Which was the response to xellas84 who left a detailed review and has 224 hours recorded in the game. 


A lot of the responses seem to be toeing the line of saying the review is wrong while then plugging the game, which is a bold move under a negative review. 


Screenshot via Steam.


If you want to check out some of the other 100+ Besthesda responses, you can do so on the Steam review page. You'll find that a lot of them are repetitive, which is understandable, given that a lot of negative reviews point to similar issues with the game, such as not being able to fly ships, empty planets, and mediocre quests. 


Starfield currently sits at a "Mixed" Steam rating from both recent and overall reviews. Despite the Bethesda representatives assuring players that the game is being constantly improved, the effect of that is yet to show up in the reviews.


If the goal from Bethesda was to limit the damage that negative reviews cause, perhaps they should have looked up the Streisand effect first.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've known that Amazon's Fallout TV series has been in the works since July 2020. Today, we get our first good look at the series' live-action world thanks to a brand new batch of images. 


Vanity Fair released the first set of promotional images from the upcoming video game adaptation. In addition to that, the outlet also had a chance to pick the brains of Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, the power couple who are showrunners of the Fallout TV series, just as they were on HBO's Westworld.


In the new images, we get to see quite a bit of the Amazon Prime Video series' vibe. There are images of one of the series leads, Lucy (Ella Purnell), both inside and outside her home of Vault 33. We get several looks at The Brotherhood of Steel and their iconic Power Armor Suits. As well as a couple of looks at Walter Goggins' Ghoul character, who looks fiendishly fantastic.

The Vault, uniforms, Power Armor Suits, and of course the post-apocalyptic world, all look incredibly accurate to the video game series from Bethesda Softworks and Interplay. And from what Nolan and Joy have conveyed, the story will be faithful to the game franchise too. 


Prior to today, the only glimpse of the world we've had was a tease from Amazon back in October 2022. Now, we have a bit more to go on. Like the game series, the TV world takes on the aesthetic look of 1940s or 1950s American culture. But, similar to the game series, the show begins with a nuclear war that devastates Earth in 2077. Following the nuclear event, the story jumps a whopping 219 years where the core of the Amazon series is set.


The Fallout TV show is scheduled to begin streaming on Amazon Prime Video in April 2024. Variety's piece is the beginning of what's likely to be a few months of publicity as we near the show's launch. With initial images shared, hopefully a trailer is likely to follow sometime soon.

In a game full of memorable moments, one of Mario Wonder's more out-there sequences has to be the 'Piranha Plants on Parade' musical number. This Wonder effect completely took us by surprise on our first playthrough and has certainly stuck in our heads ever since. Fortunately, it looks like we were not alone in our admiration as some talented players have managed to recreate the musical moment in Super Mario Maker 2.
In case the sequence in question has slipped your mind, this is the moment where your standard platforming level turns into an all-singing and (some) dancing routine thanks to some very well-choreographed Piranha Plants. How exactly could that exist in Mario Maker? you might ask. Well, a couple of different ways, actually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, something odd happened in the streets of Gotham. With no prior announcement or fanfare, people booting up Batman: Arkham Knight were greeted with a skin from 2022's The Batman starring Robert Pattinson. But then, as quickly as it appeared, it was removed, all without comment from the developers. While we still don't know exactly why the skin was added accidentally, we know exactly why it was created: it's a timed-exclusive suit launching with the Batman: Arkham Trilogy on Switch.


The collection brings Rocksteady's beloved trio of Batman games to Nintendo's hybrid console, complete with all previously released DLC. The trilogy will also include the aforementioned suit from The Batman, but it won't be limited to the Switch forever – other platforms will get access to the suit "at a later date."
Game Informer, much like the rest of the gaming community, is a big fan of the trilogy, with all three games appearing on our list of best superhero games of all time. While it's been eight years since the last game, Rocksteady has been hard at work ever since working on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which is set to come out on February 2, 2024. If you want to stick to the classics, Batman: Arkham Trilogy launches this Friday, December 1.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jack of all trades.
One of the Switch's greatest strengths is that it knows exactly what it is. You've got a small handful of streaming apps, sure, but there's no denying that Nintendo Switch is a game console, through and through. Could its eventual successor be more, though?
Back in 2013 when Microsoft revealed the Xbox One, the company was widely ridiculed for its focus on delivering an 'all in one' device; a console that could not only play the latest games, but could stream movies, broadcast live TV, and let you control everything with gestures or your voice. Microsoft's desire for an always-online Xbox One to be the only piece of tech you'll ever need in your living room didn't sit well with gamers, not least because games seemed to be an afterthought, with the firm more concerned about ensuring you were connected to its entertainment ecosystem at all times. 10 years on, however, the landscape for gaming and other media is somewhat different. While Microsoft undoubtedly botched the messaging a decade ago, was it really such a bad idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only... compromise, calculation and license to misbehave. In Owlcat's forthcoming RPG Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, you play the free-wheeling head of an interstellar merchant's dynasty. Operating on the fringes of uncharted space, you're the owner of a Warrant of Trade that essentially lets you run your own miniature empire within the Imperium, deciding the fates of planets, amassing vast wealth and recruiting a motley crew of xenos, heretics and assorted weirdos. It's the kind of behaviour that'd get you vaporised if you were some run-of-the-mill Space Marine Chaplain, but out here on the frontier, you're allowed to act with impunity, providing you fulfil your overall mandate of adding to the God Emperor's glory and kicking the odd Eldar's head in.


Rogue Traders are arguably the only characters in Games Workshop's brutal and decrepit table-top setting that lend themselves to the role of CRPG protagonist, because they are the only characters in Warhammer 40K's Imperium who enjoy anything like the plot agency of a Commander Shepard. And with that, I think, comes an interesting transformation of the character alignment systems the game shares with other CRPGs such as Baldur's Gate 3.

I know, Eliminate Down sounds like a weird medical term for a bowel movement, and it doesn’t help that you may not have heard of it before. It was only released on the Mega Drive in Japan and South Korea, and it’s believed that the production run only consisted of a few thousand units. It’s one of the few releases from developer Aprinet. It has never been released digitally, and actually snagging a cartridge from its first run will run you upwards of $500. Some sort of re-release is well overdue.

Since Bungie's been going through a rough patch recently, it shouldn't be surprising that Joe Blackburn would chime in, too.


For one, the fact that The Final Shape is being pushed back by a few months means that the Season of the Wish will be a fair bit longer than initially expected. This was the biggest concern that Blackburn appears to have wanted to alleviate, and he did just that by announcing not only the all-new Dungeon, Warlords' Ruin, but also a bunch of other free content, slated for early 2024.

That's partially due to the changes made to Starfield's game engine, but there's hope on the horizon.


Notably, while the Vortex mod launcher hasn't been able to handle Starfield's mods all that well due to them needing to be installed into several different directories, depending on their file format, an alternative has now sprung up. The legendary Mod Organizer 2 now officially supports Starfield "with some general caveats," according to the announcement, which should be a huge boon for those who haven't been able to get mods to work just yet.

The Vanity Fair article goes on to give us the first concrete details of the show, thanks to an interview with co-creators Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan, who also created Westworld. The series will star Ella Purnell as Lucy, a "doe-eyed" woman who emerges from her vault with naivete and optimism but is forced to face the horrors of the wasteland.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Independent can mean different things to different people".
Earlier this month, we got our first look at the nominees for The Game Awards 2023. While we were pleased to see Nintendo getting some much-deserved love (including two titles in the GOTY category), much of the conversation online in the ensuing days has been around the Best Indie Game category and, specifically, Dave The Diver's inclusion in it.
Despite the game's lo-fi aesthetic and mechanics, the title was actually developed by MintRocket — a subsidiary of the billion-dollar South Korean publisher Nexon. If games like this are now deemed 'indie' then where do we draw the line? This is the precise question that Mr TGA himself, Geoff Keighley, attempted to tackle in a recent Twitch Q&A and his answer was... expectedly balanced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Leave it to the modding community to combine things from well-known franchises into one package. We've already seen Doctor Who's Daleks come to Doom, and now someone is creating something that will please fans of both Morrowind and World of Warcraft.


As spotted by DSO Gaming, Nexus Mods user Tel Shadow is in the midst of what sounds like a pretty lofty project. Called "World of Morrocraft," it does exactly what it says on the tin, in that it brings in aspects of WoW into TES3.

As the description says: "This project aims to add the world of Azeroth to Tamriel," with the continent of Northrend being the first to be developed. Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor are seemingly next on the list. The mod will, in its totality, be a new landmass, complete with "handcrafted exteriors and interiors, new NPCs, creatures, and quests."


Adding custom weather as well


You can download the mod in its current state if you want to check it out. Looking at the images, World of Warcraft fans will likely recognize the areas that have been recreated in Morrowind. I haven't played WoW myself (I know, I know..."where have I been," etc.) so I can't say how accurate they are to the source material.


In any case, it's a pretty big project for one person to take on, especially in an unofficial capacity. The modding community is simply teeming with a lot of dedicated people willing to pull off things like this. It's honestly pretty impressive.


While The Elder Scrolls 3 is now more than 20 years old, people like Tel Shadow show there's still a lot of love to give. On top of that, there's the unofficial remake Skywind to look forward to as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom already has a busy 2024 planned, with several big games scheduled. It has just been revealed that Dragon's Dogma 2 will launch on March 22, 2024. 


The information appears on Steam, where you might see the release date as March 21 depending on what timezone you're in. It's not available to purchase, but you can add it to your wishlist. To find out more about the upcoming game, be on the lookout for the showcase which will air on Tuesday, Nov. 28th, at 1 PM PT.

Dragon's Dogma 2 is finally almost here


The 15-minute showcase will feature gameplay, as well as information directly from director Hideaki Itsuno and producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi. Throughout 2023, Capcom has given players a few teases of the game, and during a hands-on event, Destructoid's Timothy Monbleau got to spend some time with the Dragon's Dogma 2 demo, and he "really vibed with what Dragon’s Dogma 2 put on the table. Whether it was great gameplay or a juicy looking steak."


The sequel has been anticipated since the release of Dragon's Dogma in 2012. Though Itsuno has discussed creating a sequel for years, there was no official announcement until June 2022. With the release date revealed, fans now know that their wait, which has lasted over a decade, is almost over. 


There's plenty to expect from Capcom in 2024. In addition to DD 2, Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy is set to release next year. We may also see more of the elusive Pragmata which has been delayed several times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No matter how old it gets, people still seem to flock to Skyrim and its chilly world of fantasy possibilities. The fact that there are so many interesting NPCs to interact with arguably makes it that extra bit appealing. But what happens when you grow tired of this slice of Tamriel being full of characters and wildlife?


Why, you go on a killing spree, of course. That's what Reddit user amelix34 did at least (thanks GamesRadar). A post on the Skyrim sub shows sheer dedication when it comes to attempting to kill every possible thing in the game.




According to the user, they've managed to kill 3,310 people, 693 animals, 401 creatures, 947 undead, 55 Deadra, and 98 Automatons (such as the Dwarven Spider). That's over 5,500 characters, animals, and enemies killed, which may or may not be the maximum figure across the whole of the RPG.


Sounds tiring


Obviously, that's not counting characters that can't be killed, such as children or those pertinent to the main quest. However, this could well represent the maximum number of murders that can be done in The Elder Scrolls 5.


Another image shows that amelix34 has managed to amass a lifetime bounty of 267,140. But then again, if all the guards in the game have been killed, who exactly is going to retrieve that? Exactly.


Despite the attempt to pretty much wipe any sign of life off the face of Skyrim (non-killables notwithstanding, of course), the user did say they made an exception when it came to Paarthurnax and Shadowmere. Good to see they're not a total psychopath then.


All-in-all, it's just one of the many ways that TES5 remains in the gaming limelight more than 12 years after its release. Its legacy is hard to surpass, despite the issues it has (perhaps even because of them). Even Bethesda's own Starfield can't match such a legendary status.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy is known for its meta-narratives and intricately detailed worlds. Fans are familiar with this, and a hidden QR code demonstrates just how forward-thinking the Finnish developers are. 


In Alan Wake, there are QR codes that can be scanned to gain additional content and plot information. They're not essential, but they're nice to find if you're interested in knowing all the details of the Remedy Connected Universe. Alan Wake Remastered, released in 2021, features the same gimmick, though there are new codes thrown in. 


Some of the new QR codes describe Alan's time in the Dark Place, foreshadowing what we've seen of the location in Alan Wake 2. The code found in Chapter 4 links you to Vision 03 which appears to perfectly narrate the opening sequence of the sequel. 


Alan describes a dark forest where a nude man walks, terrified. He sees a deer carcass on the ground, his fear heightens, and he runs deeper into the forest. This is exactly what happens at the start of the sequel which has you controlling Nightingale, naked, as he finds his way through the woods. A YouTuber has played the QR audio over the scene to illustrate the parallels. 




This isn't the only Easter egg that Remedy has hidden in prior games. If you visit the Oceanview Motel in Control, you'll spot a door with a spiral on it, which is one of the main motifs of Alan Wake 2. Go as far back as Quantum Break and you'll find live-action scenes featuring Alex Casey and a female FBI agent, which seems to foreshadow Alex and Saga's role in Remedy's latest game. 


Screenshot by Destructoid.


There are likely plenty more secrets hidden within Alan Wake 2 which we'll get to explore more with the upcoming release of NG+. There are also two DLCs set to arrive in 2024, with Night Springs arriving in Spring and Lake House arriving later.

While the world continues to wait in vain for Konami to release another 2D Castlevania, plenty of indie game developers have stepped up to try filling the gap with their own take on the famed formula. Some of these games have almost copied the gameplay beat for beat, such as in Timespinner or Chasm, while others have taken things in a more unique direction, such as Blasphemous’ 2D Soulslike take set in a Spanish-inspired world. The Last Faith falls more into this latter camp, and while it does stumble a bit in its execution and performance on Switch, this is an overall compelling game that’s certainly worth your consideration.
The Last Faith follows the story of Eryk, a grim man with amnesia who’s been afflicted with a mysterious curse that’s slowly consuming him. Eryk awakens on the edge of a massive gothic city called Mythringal, and it doesn’t take long for him to recognize that something has gone horribly wrong, as its many inhabitants have become mutated beasts that attack on sight. As he searches for someone who can cure him, Eryk slowly pieces together the details of the civil war that led to the fall of Mythringal and the role that he played in it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its launch, Baldur's Gate 3 has been celebrated, though some players have been complaining about bugs and poor performance. Larian recently explained why this is happening and what the plans to fix it are. 


Many players have been experiencing reduced framerates in Acts 2 and 3 of the game. According to a Larian developer, this has partially been caused by Patch 4 which ironically was released to fix bugs. It was meant to "prevent the Scrying Eyes in Moonrise Towers from immediately calling the guards on you when stealing, even if you were sneaking, or invisible." 


It achieved this, but a side-effect is that it kept the game continually storing your past acts of vandalism, violence, and theft well past the point when it's necessary. As the developer explains in layman's terms, "your ‘DM’ - in a real-world sense - constantly thinks about the acts of theft & violence the player keeps doing." This bogs down the game, eventually affecting performance. 


Now that developers are aware of what is causing the problem, there are plans to have it mended in Patch 5 scheduled for this week. Though frustrating, the occurrence of the bug is somewhat hilarious, as it seems to punish those who are the most mischievous.


Larian is still hard at work on Baldur's Gate 3, and a physical release is scheduled for early 2023. The team may enjoy the fruits of their labor soon, as the game has snatched the most number of nominations at this year's The Game Awards, tying with Alan Wake 2.

No, it's got nothing to do with teeth. According to Larian, the slowdowns are actually connected to the game's understanding of crime and morality: Patch 4 left it unable to "forget" player thefts and acts of vandalism that haven't been detected by NPCs, meaning that BG3 players who break the rules often and get away with it have been saddling their simulations with unfinished tasks. That's right, the game's latest technical crisis is in fact a crisis of conscience. Oh the  humanity!

Then, a surprise sight fills my heart with glee. A small cabin, open and inviting. Its dilapidation a thing of beauty. Its broken roof, a veritable stronghold.

Wall Street Kid is actually known as The Money Game II: Kabutochou no Kiseki in Japan, meaning that, yes, it’s the second in a series, with the first game never seeing a release outside of Japan. You could also look at the games as a spin-off of another Sofel series, Casino Kid, but they’re not actually related aside from sharing a developer.

        <updated>2023-11-27T22:17:34.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A surprise hit from Shonen Jump + is getting its anime adaptation. The supernatural-and-extraterrestrial action-comedy manga Dandadan will be adapted into a TV anime series next year.


If you haven't heard of Dandadan, the elevator pitch is simple but effective. Two students, Ken Takakura (a.k.a. Okarun) and Momo Ayase, are at odds. The latter believes in ghosts, hailing from a family of spirit mediums. Takakura is obsessed with the occult—aliens, cryptids, and such. Both stubbornly agree to visit locations where the other believes supernatural experiences have occurred. 


So, naturally, both of them are correct.


What ensues is Yukinobu Tatsu's Dandadan, an energetic and action-filled manga with a surprising amount of heart. It seems incredibly well-suited for an anime adaptation, and even more, it's being produced by Science Saru.




Dandadan Takes Off


Science Saru has quickly become a familiar name in animation, thanks to some incredible feature and series work. The studio, helmed by Masaaki Yuasa and Eunyoung Choi, was behind films like The Night Is Short, Walk On Girl and Inu-Oh, as well as series like Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!, Devilman Crybaby, and the recent Scott Pilgrim Takes Off.


Look at those series, and you see a particular knack for comedy, monsters, and surrealism that seems like a perfect fit for Dandadan. Fuuga Yamashiro is taking the director's chair on this series.


This series has been one I've absolutely adored reading through the backlogs of, as it manages to balance out emotional story beats with good laughs and action. Add in some stellar monsters and character design as the stakes escalate, and this could be hit for 2024. Considering the year we've already had in anime, it's a good time to be following it all.

By the time the N64 hit, the NES felt old to me, so the idea of a console even older than that was exciting. This was before you could jump onto YouTube to look up gameplay. I wanted to see it for myself.


It wasn’t until college, around the time that the retro gamer identity really became a thing, that I finally found myself a 2600 Jr. Since then, I keep tripping into 2600 games. I own around 60, which isn’t as impressive as some of my other libraries, but considering I never actively tried to find Atari 2600 games, it says something.


A major issue with this, however, is that every model of the 2600 uses an RF output, and modern TVs hate it. Even late-model CRTs will sometimes refuse to display an Atari 2600…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since premiering in late October, Five Nights at Freddy’s has become a big box-office success. It’s already the highest-grossing horror film of 2023, and it has now become horror production company Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film of all time.
The film adaptation of the popular 2014 horror game hit theaters on October 27, grossing a strong $80 million in its opening weekend, the best for any horror film this year. That’s even more impressive given that it premiered on the streaming service Peacock the same day it was released in theaters (becoming the most-watched title on Peacock during its first five days). 
Five Nights At Freddy’s has continued to gain traction over the past few weeks and has now grossed over $295 million ($136 million domestically, $160 million overseas) during the month it's been in theaters. That ranks it at the top of Blumhouse’s highest-performing films, a record previously held by M.Night Shyamalan’s Split, while also climbing over top performers such as Halloween (2018), Get Out, and Glass. 
FNAF is the BIGGEST @blumhouse film of ALL-TIME. Just passed SPLIT. thanks to Emma Tammi, Scott Cawthon, cast & the New Orleans crew, the Henson team, & our partners @universalpics & @peacock. @jhutch1992, @matthewlillard, @Piperrubios, @elizethdlail
November 27, 2023


First announced in 2015 (roughly a year after the first game’s release), Five Nights At Freddy’s stars Josh Hutcherson (The Hunger Games series) with actors such as Elizabeth Lail and Matthew Lillard in supporting roles. The film is directed by Emma Tammi and produced by Blumhouse. The film joins the ranks of other highly successful video game adaptations to release in 2023, such as the other box office juggernaut The Super Mario Bros. Movie and HBO's critically-acclaimed The Last of Us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s kind of amazing how much influence Mother 3 has had on game design in the West, despite never being released here. It’s a bit hard to describe the difference between Earthbound influence and Mother 3 influence, but it’s there. Knuckle Sandwich seems to be in the Mother 3 camp.


Actually, Knuckle Sandwich is a bit of a mash-up of Mother 3, Undertale (which was also inspired by Mother 3), and WarioWare. At times, it seems to push the concept to the extremes. Other times, it wallows in it.


Knuckle Sandwich is mixed. How much you enjoy it is going to depend on your tolerance for its pacing, and if its weirdness and humor are enough for you to overlook some glaring flaws.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The core premise of manga-turned-anime series Attack on Titan has always been fantastic: humans armed with swords and equipped with mechanical grapple guns that basically turn them into Spider-Man take on enormous naked giants who are trying to eat them. With the series’ action built around the incredible manoeuvrability and momentum of the Omni-Directional Mobility gear, the genuine unnerving threat of the titans, and the relatively fragility of its human heroes, it’s just primed to be mined for video game inspiration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps the most underrated entry in the Assassin's Creed franchise, Assassin's Creed Syndicate, is free on PC through December 6. Those interested in living out the life of an Assassin in London during the Industrial Revolution can do so at the Syndicate giveaway page. As long as you claim your free copy before December 6, you will be able to play even after the promotion ends. Unfortunately, it looks like the promotion is only available on PC via the Ubisoft Connect launcher.




At the time Assassin's Creed Syndicate was released, I was very much feeling the AC franchise burnout. I purchased Syndicate but never actually got around to playing it for more than just a few minutes. However, a little over a year ago I had some free time and played through the whole game and was very pleasantly surprised. In fact, I think Syndicate may be one of the best Assassin's Creed titles in the franchise.


Syndicate was the last classic Assassin experience in the franchise before it started exploring more open-world narratives in Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla. The series recently returned to its roots with Mirage, but I'd still argue that Syndicate was overall the most polished assassin simulator we've gotten so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Those looking for a smoother Dragon Ball FighterZ online experience can soon try it out with Rollback Netcode. Bandai Namco has locked in a Public Beta Test for the feature from November 30 through December 10.


The announcement came via the official Dragon Ball Games Twitter and Bandai Namco Entertainment producer Tomoko Hiroki. Just in time for the lead up to the Power Tournament finals in January, everyone is invited to take part in the beta on Steam. You can see the full message in the announcement video below.




For those interested in participating, the Steam announcement page has all the details. The test will be open to everyone who bought the Steam version of Dragon Ball FighterZ. All you have to do is go to the game in your library, open the Properties window, and select public-beta-test from the Betas tab. There are a few troubleshooting notes for anyone who has an issue finding the option. If you'd rather go back to the normal version during the test period, you'll be able to switch by selecting 'None' in the Betas tab. 


Dragon Ball FighterZ first launched for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in January 2018, followed by a release on Nintendo Switch that September. At the time of this writing, the Public Beta Test for Rollback Netcode is just going to be available for the Steam version. For what it's worth, all versions of the full game are heavily discounted on the platform right now. Any further updates during the test period will be made through the official Bandai Namco Esports Twitter account.

Originally slated to launch on February 27, The Final Shape now launches on June 4. In a blog post, Bungie states that the expansion “needs more time to become exactly what we want it to be”.
“The Final Shape is the culmination of the first ten years of Destiny storytelling and, for Guardians everywhere, countless hours spent together,” Bungie writes in the post. “We want to honor that journey, so we’re taking the time we need to deliver an even bigger and bolder vision, one that we hope will be remembered and treasured for years to come.”

One of those companies is Nuverse, a game publisher best known in the West for its work on Marvel Snap. Fans of the superhero card-battler had reason for concern this morning, as an article from Reuters reported that ByteDance had plans to leave the gaming space entirely, with intentions to "divest from titles already launched." This seemed to spell doom for Marvel Snap.
However, the official Marvel Snap X account issued a statement today that this would not be the case.
Dear SNAPPERS,
November 27, 2023
It's unclear exactly why the PC and mobile game will be exempt from any changes, but we're happy to hear that one of the best games from 2022 isn't going anywhere. However, the fates of the workers at Nuverse and the company's other games are unclear, as Reuters reports that "the decision is likely to impact hundreds of employees." The report states that ByteDance will announce this restructure sometime today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though the delay was leaked amidst monumental layoffs at Bungie not even a month ago, Bungie has now officially confirmed that Destiny 2: The Final Shape has been delayed until June 4, 2024. According to the blog post, Season of the Wish which begins tomorrow will serve as the major content loop until The Final Shape releases in June.




New content planned for April


This equates to a roughly four-month delay, which while isn't the longest amount of time, sets Destiny 2 up for running with the same content loop for half a year which is a pretty long time. In an effort to break down the repetitiveness, Bungie plans to release a new content update in April titled Destiny 2: Into the Light. The two-month-long content update will prepare players for their journey into the Traveler.


Destiny 2 Game Director Joe Blackburn also posted a video update on YouTube in which he broke down the content players can expect between now and the release of The Finale Shape.


As someone who hasn't played Destiny 2 in a while, I was genuinely interested in returning with The Final Shape. It seemed like a great opportunity to jump back on board with the newly added system to play through specific important story missions to get caught up on things. However, with the layoffs and now hefty delay, I have to admit I find the interest waning. 


For those who are actively playing, is the updated content window for Season of the Wish too long? Six months can seem like a lifetime when playing the same content over and over. Hopefully, the new content scheduled for April is enough to freshen things up until June.


Destiny 2: The Final Shape releases on June 24, 2024.

And, unlike buying the combined labours and livelihoods of the entire RPS team, there’s no months-long bidding process for this curved screen – you can just order it off Currys.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dredge was pretty weird to begin with. The indie hit somehow melded fishing with cosmic horror - seamlessly - to create an enthralling adventure where you can never be sure if what you're about to haul out of the depths will have a normal amount of eyes or tentacles. The new Pale Reach DLC gets even weirder, a masterpiece of show-don’t-tell horror that manages to evoke some of the more inspired Bloodborne monsters as well as some of icy, supernatural scares from The Terror. And it's all centred on a big whale. 


Spoilers ahead, friends, but in The Pale Reach, a massive icy landscape has suddenly appeared in the southern, well, reaches of Dredge's world, so naturally we’re off to see what that’s all about, ploughing along in our faithful fishing boat to the hostile new climate. Every path into the landmass is barricaded by imposing ice walls. It's a slog.


It’s also a great setup. We're made to instantly wonder what the hell hides in this treacherous ice field, and the answer is equally great: a massive corrupted narwhal with bulbous glowing eyes. The huge beast dwarfs your tiny ship, but mercifully it’s frozen solid in an even bigger chunk of ice, with only those very angry eyes poking out at us. Four angry eyes on one side of its head, to be very precise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Talk about adorable! Two new Pokémon Squishmallows are available for preorder and they’re the cutest thing ever. The two new Squishmallows recently went live for pre-order the Pokémon Center website after an announcement of the new plushies earlier this year.


The Pokémon joining the Pokémon Squishmallow family are Clefairy and Teddiursa, two earlier-introduced species. Long-time fans of the franchise will be happy to see Generation I and Generation II characters as adorable plushies. Some of the other Pokémon that have been featured as Squishmallows are Snorlax, Togepi, Piplup and various versions of Pikachu.


Clefairy is a Fairy type Pokémon introduced in the first generation of Pokémon in 1996 ('98 for North America). Teddiursa is a Normal type Pokémon introduced to the franchise in Generation II, through Pokémon Gold and Silver. 


Something fans may not know about Clefairy is that it’s an extraterrestrial Pokémon, meaning that it isn’t from Earth. The bubbly pink Pokemon is best known for being cute, among many other creatures in the franchise. Teddiursa, on the other hand, is very down to earth. The little bear Pokémon is known to have paws drenched in honey. For comfort when nervous, Teddiursa will lick its paws (cuteness overload, am I right?).

Squishmallows are a California-based stuffed toy business that specializes in turning popular video game and anime characters into adorable plushies. In 2022, the Pokémon Company partnered with Jazwares to bring their franchise to Squishmallows. Since then, they’ve released loads of cute Squishmallows.


Currently, the Squishmallows are only available for preorder on the official Pokémon website in the US for $29.99 apiece. Once live, the Squishmallows will take around 5-9 business days to ship. These 12-inch cuties also come with an embroidered Pokémon Center Poke Ball logo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a new Tribes FPS in development, eight years since the last Tribes game, Tribes: Ascend, went skeeting off into the no-further-updates hereafter. It's the work of former Hi-Rez subsidiary and nowadays independent studio Prophecy Games, and going by SteamDB listings, it's called Tribes 3: Rivals.
New to the Tribes series? It once went by the unofficial title of "the world's fastest shooter". On the one hand, I'm not sure that claim holds as true in the era of Titanfall 2 or DOOM Eternal or Hyper Demon or heck, even latter-day Fortnite with its rocket-powered rams. On the other hand, and to pick up the tune from Matt Cox's (RPS in peace) 2019 retrospective - WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Here's a compilation of footage from a recent playtest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloober Team has unexpectedly provided a light update on its upcoming remake of Silent Hill 2, ensuring fans that its development is “progressing smoothly”. You'll just have to wait for Konami to share more details. 
In an X post, the team behind The Medium and Layers of Fear asks for fans’ patience in regard to new information on the game while stating that development is going according to schedule. Konami announced the Silent Hill 2 remake last October with a lengthy trailer showcasing the 2001 classic’s updated presentation. The game currently has no release window but will launch on PlayStation 5 and PC. 


Here is Bloober Team’s full update: 
Silent Hil 2 remake was one of many new Silent Hill projects announced last October. The first one to arrive was Silent Hill Ascension, an interactive streaming series that premiered on Halloween. Other projects in the pipeline include Silent Hill f, a new mainline entry set in 1960s Japan, and Silent Hill Townfall, a mysterious title published by Annapurna Interactive and developed by No Code, the creators of Observation. A new live-action film called Return to Silent Hill is also in production by original Silent Hill director Christophe Gans.]]></summary>

Last Train Home has an intriguing premise: taking the Czechoslovak Legion home from the Eastern front via an armoured train directly through the chaos of the Russian Civil War. Its unusual mixture of survival sim, RPG, tactical skirmishes, and narrative history holds together, I think, precisely because your efforts to make it all work provide such a contrast to what an incredible mess the world around you is becoming.

Now, a decade later, SteamWorld Build has reimagined Dig's core ideas as a handsome citybuilder, placing equal focus on managing your rustbucket town up top, while plundering its depths via an abandoned mineshaft to find treasure, resources and (most importantly) rocket parts, so you can escape your crumbling planet and find a new homestead up in the stars.
Despite the threat of annihilation hanging over the horizon, however, SteamWorld Build is one of the most relaxed and easy-going building games I've ever played. This is a game that's more concerned with keeping your economy running like a well-oiled, uhh, machine than turning a profit, for example, and it merely dips its toe in the genre's wider, ongoing obsession with building up defences to fend off oncoming hordes of malicious town hall-eating nasties. If the scales do get thrown out of equilibrium, the worst that will happen is you get lots of angry little red robot faces appearing above your houses. You won't go bankrupt, you won't get turfed out for being incompetent, and you definitely won't see any kind of game over screen if the aforementioned nasties end up running amok in your mining levels. The stakes, then, are quite low, which is probably a good indication of whether you'll get on with SteamWorld Build, and how much you'll get out of it.

The most endearing aspect of the SteamWorld series is how each of its games relates to one another despite their disparate genres. From tower defense to turn-based RPG, each title offers a unique spin on a specific gameplay experience while adhering to a shared mythos, resulting in a fun collection of games that coalesce thematically. SteamWorld Build, Thunderful's city-builder/RTS hybrid, serves as the latest iteration of this formula. Sporting streamlined genre mechanics, intuitiv…]]></summary>

It is a dreadful god of gossip and reportage, a hideous, paradiscursive entity of boundless appetite, whose Number is Infinity+1 and whose Sign is the Serrated Spiral. It's one of many abyssal denizens of a dungeon dimension outside of Time, where nothing changes and there is accordingly an apocalyptic hunger for News. My ancestors, the Brigante Celts who once ruled the misty valleys of Yorkshire, called it keno-augā-brājat, or “the cave that will never be filled”. But nowadays, we call it the Maw.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon doesn't specifically list this as a Black Friday deal. But it's certainly a bargain that you can take advantage of this Black Friday weekend. AMD's Ryzen 5 5600X processor is available for just either side of half-price, depending on which side of the pond you live on. Regardless, that's a big chunk off one of the best gaming CPUs around.


When Katharine reviewed the 5600X back in 2020, she called it "a stonkingly fast gaming CPU". It's a six-core, twelve thread processor, with each of its Vermeer processors providing speedy single-core performance, making it an ideal CPU for playing both modern multithreaded games, and older single-thread titles. There are of course plenty of faster CPUs around these days, but you'll pay significantly more for those, and it's only prudent to do so if you're looking to get the highest framerates at 1080p. If you're gaming at 4k, then it's your GPU that'll be doing most of the heavy lifting, and your funds are better spent there.


It's also worth noting that the 5600X is highly power efficient, with a TDP of just 65 watts. This makes it both more economical and more environmentally friendly that a lot of CPUs, an important consideration if your energy bills are making you wince.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RAM is rarely the first consideration when upgrading a PC, as it has a much smaller impact on performance compared to a better processor or a spanking new GPU. But you also won't get without far it, and we are slowly heading toward the point where more RAM is preferable. This year brought a scare when Star Wars: Jedi Survivor seemingly needed a minimum 32GB of RAM. Luckily that turned out to be an error in the system requirements, but as the size and detail of video game worlds exerts greater demand on load times, RAM will become more important. And if you want to get ahead of the game(s), you can get 32GB of rock solid ram for less than £50 this Black Friday weekend.

Basic details pertaining to a novel aspect of the injunction were reported but little seemed wildly out of the ordinary. It transpires that the High Court initially had reservations concerning the order, with unusual descriptions given to the type of content Sky aimed to block.

By slicing off the rarely used numpad keys, a TKL board gives you a little extra room to wiggle your mouse, or actually put a cup of coffee to one side rather than jamming it somewhere between your keyboard and your monitor. The only problem with TKL boards is they tend to be slightly more expensive than their bulkier counterparts, meaning you often end up paying extra money for less keyboard overall. But if you are in the market for a slimmer typing solution, then right now you can get £100 off one of the best TKL keyboards this Black Friday.

In addition to capturing them and harnessing their abilities in battle, you can also wield realistic firearms and other weapons to blast them apart or, more hilariously, arm your cuddly critters with some serious heat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Videogames are full of loops. Often, the loop isn't just a loop in space but a loop of labour, a loop in time. It's a repeated task with a touch of variation from cycle to cycle, typically associated with a character progression system of some kind. The classic one is the town-dungeon loop in an action-RPG such as Diablo 4. You sally forth into the depths with sword and shield, slaughter a bunch of blameless goblins, then orbit triumphantly back to the village square with its 24/7 forge and bustling adventurer's guild. Then off you go, once again, with a Sword +1 and a shield now bearing a Goblin Magnet. There are straightforward equivalents in multiplayer, especially in the wake of Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare - sign in, play a few matches, harvest some XP, unlock a new laser sight, equip it, play a few more matches with +5% to your aim.

Miles Morales is a comic book character created to represent people of color.
Leading up to the 2008 election, which resulted in the United States’ first African American president, Barack Obama, Marvel wanted to "take a good look" at one of their icons to reimagine as African American. A few years later, when an internet campaign pushed Community actor Donald Glover to play Spider-Man, the icon was chosen, and writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli created Miles. Every iteration of the character continues this legacy of representation, and Insomniac Games’ Spider-Man 2 is no different.

Little Goody Two Shoes is a life simulator adventure dating game hybrid full of secrets and mutually exclusive options that encourage replays. Going into it blind definitely heightened the sense of enjoyable confusion, and the joy of gradually going from "is... is this gay?" to "oh this is super gay" and "is this a game about hiding secret gay relationships from the backwards villagers" to "oh this is totally about being secretly gay and also automatically covering for a witch because these people can eat it".

Our predictions are in fact not as outlandish as you might think, although there are gorillas, obviously.


Alongside this we talk about the games we're playing right now (largely Darktide, it turns out), and dish up some recommendations. We also spent like a third of our recording time playing a deranged Age Of Empires 2-themed RPG using an abbreviated D20 system of Nate's devising, but don't worry, I edited it down quite a lot. Apologies for my poor mic quality!

You can listen above, or on on Spotify, iTunes, Stitcher, or Pocket Casts. You can find the RSS feed here, and you can discuss the episode on our Discord channel, which has a dedicated room for podcast chat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is admittedly unfair of me, but any time a video game reveals itself as free-to-play, my interest immediately dissipates. Free-to-play games are not universally bad; plenty of brilliant design ideas, engaging stories, and fun mechanics can be found in games with no upfront admission fee. But once a game’s goal shifts from singular experience to long-term engagement, any excitement I may have folds in on itself and disappears like Pac-Man.
It all stems from my desire for experiences, not obligations.
In free-to-play and comparable models, success is marked by player engagement. The more rounds a player queues into and the longer they play, the more likely they are to engage with the monetized elements. And the best way to encourage that engagement is to incentivize players to return. Dai…]]></summary>

Black Friday now provides the chance to grab one for even less, with good-quality partner cards having fallen as low as £550 in the UK and $515 in the US.

No time like the present, then, to net yourself a top-quality storage extender for your Steam Deck or Steam Deck OLED.


It is of course possible to swap out the Deck’s internal SSD for something bigger, and if it were a desktop PC, normally that would be the way to go. But replacing components in a tightly-designed, hyper-compacted machine like Valve’s handheld is a far trickier business, and just doesn’t have the same appeal when a fast microSD like the Pro Plus is right there. Now, you can get plenty of extra space, an incomparably easier "installation," and performance that still comes remarkably close to NVMe SSD level, all for up to £38 off.

But it can be especially challenging if the giftee in question is a younger child who wants to play games, but is perhaps too young or inexperienced with the hobby to know what they might enjoy.

One of the most notable features is how RGG rethought its classic brawler combat. Protagonist Kazuma Kiryu now has two fighting stances, Yakuza and Agent, the latter of which comes with a host of new secret-agent tools, such as an exploding cigarette, a Spider-Man-like cable he can use to whip enemies around, and so on. 
We recently had a chat with RGG series chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto – who we spoke with last year about the future of the studio – to learn how Gaiden's new combat together, maintaining the series' identity despite how much has changed over the years, and why RGG doesn't look to…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cheap graphics cards are practically mythical these days, which is great news for gaming obsessed unicorns and centaurs, less so for us mere mortals trapped in boring old reality. But there is one last torchbearer of the budget GPU, and weirdly enough that's Intel. If you happen to live in the US, then you can get your hands on the best cheap 1080p  graphics card for a smidge more than $200 for Black Friday.


Now I know the idea of Intel making graphics cards sounds almost as preposterous as horses with horns, but they've been at it for a while. Granted, they've not been especially good at it for most of that time. The original launch of the Arc series was pretty disappointing. But Intel have worked to imrprove the performance of their GPUs, and now the Arc A750 is an excellent 1080p offering.


It's also a perfectly acceptable card for those looking to make their first-steps into the world of Ray-tracing. As James notes in his review "if you’re specifically looking to try ray tracing on the cheap, know that the Arc A750 turns the tables on the RX 6650 XT with these kinds of settings. Where the A750 produced 47fps in Hitman, the RX 6650 XT could only manage 29fps, an even steeper drop from its respective rasterised performance."

We talk about some video games, too. Charles Harte talks about Chants of Sennaar, a puzzle game about language, and Kyle Hilliard talks about Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, a game about beating up people on the streets of a fictional Japanese city. Kyle also touches on Assassin's Creed VR before the duo moves on to the main course: ranking fictional video game birds on criteria like how tasty do they look and how bad would we feel about eating them. After that, we finish out the show with some gestures of gratitude and reader questions.

It's a time of year for gratitude, togetherness, repeatedly attempting to explain my job to older relatives, and most importantly, a time when a lot of people come together to eat one really big bird. But here's the thing. Why do we always eat the same kind of bird? I mean, turkey is fine and all, but why not branch out a bit? Why not chicken, or quail, or pheasant?
And that got me thinking – why limit my daydreaming to real-life birds when there's so much delicious-looking poultry in video games? Sure, not every video game bird would be tasty, but it's worth assessing in case I ever get Jumanji-ed into a game one day.
Here's my rating of video game birds based on how good they'd be for Thanksgiving dinner.

There’s a small handful of 13th-gen chips at good prices, but nothing on par with the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X or Ryzen 7800X3D that Will highlighted earlier this week.


I have, however, spotted a surprise £20 discount on the Intel Core i7-14700K, which just happens to be the only CPU in the new 14th-gen lineup that actually is worth buying. And so, just as it carried the Raptor Lake Refresh launch, so too must it redeem Intel’s Black Friday showing.

At least, that's what I think.
I find all this nostalgia stuff interesting, mainly because it's coincided with three other events in my own personal timeline (Chapter 29 Season 11, you could say): A League Of Legends pro-player called Faker, the resurgence of a badminton star, and Fortnite's own OG event. The thing that separates them all from COD? A plan.

Developed by Polish team Frozen Way, whose other projects include, erm, Hairdresser Simulator, it casts you as Hennessy, a human xenobiologist who is starting afresh on the alien planet of Sota7.
As in Unknown Worlds’ survival sim, you’ll search various biomes for resources, build solar-powered habitats on stilts with nice, wide windows, and gradually amass a database of local animals and plants. Unlike in Subnautica, you won’t be constantly at risk of suffocation.

It might have more entries in it than any other series out there and it won’t be slowing down anytime soon. On top of that, thanks to its anthology-like nature, if one Final Fantasy game doesn’t click for you, there’s a good chance another one will. As a result, ranking the Final Fantasy series can be highly contentious. Everyone has a lot of love for the first entry they played, and then there are heavy hitters like Final Fantasy X and VII, too. 
However, the staff here at Game Informer did the seemingly impossible: we ranked all 19 mainline numbered Final Fantasy games, including their direct sequels, from worst to best. As a reminder, this ranking is the sum of collective thoughts of the Game Informer staff and your own pers…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Both the Steam Deck and Steam Deck OLED come bundled with cases – new and improved ones, if you get a 1TB OLED – so it wouldn’t initially make sense to invest in a third-party one. But Steam Deck accessories can take many forms, and I’ve been particularly convinced by the case style that combines a space-saving protective skin with a tougher removeable cover. Since the Dbrand Project Killswitch isn’t playing Black Friday ball, it falls to my other favourite, JSAUX’s ModCase, to provide the bargains.


It works thusly: instead of taking your Steam Deck in and out of a zip-up sarcophagus every time you want to play it on the move, you simply leave the handheld wrapped in the ModCase’s snug, rubbery skin, simultaneously protecting it and adding grip as you hold it. The front cover simply snaps on and off as needed. It’s a lighter, more compact alternative to a full case that, I can say from experience, absolutely shields the precious Deck effectively enough for everyday bag duty. As the name suggests, it’s modular as well, so you can mount other accessories (like kickstands, power banks and even a secondary cooling fan) to the back of the skin.


Just want the case? No bother, that’s down from $30 from $26. There’s no UK version of the JSAUX store, unfortunately, though JSAUX ships internationally. Just click through the link below, and select which kit you'd like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this is the second Crucial P5 Plus deal we’ve posted about in two days, but hey, it’s Black Friday week. ‘Tis the season. Besides, this time there’s something for us Britain-dwelling lot as well, as the 2TB P5 Plus’s price has been slashed 60% to £88 on Amazon UK – the lowest it’s ever been.


This is, to be clear, an almost mystifyingly small amount of money for a 2TB NVMe SSD that’s also capable of real high-end transfer speeds and game load times. Maybe not to the standards of its successor, the Crucial T500, but this is still a competitively quick-acting drive with oodles of space for game installations. The same goes for its heatsink-equipped edition, which also happens to be on sale in the US at $88, making it (currently) cheaper than the non-heatsink 2TB model. Good deals all round, then – told you ‘twas the season.

Its main hook? Turn-based battles are filled with WarioWare-style minigames, many of which are unique to the kooky residents or rats you come up against. Unfortunately, I'd say its main hook is actually its most painful barb, and one you're barely able to extract by flicking some switches in the settings menu. A shame then, as exploring its strange world and absorbing its bonkers story beats is a wonderful thing marred by dire fights.

Announced just today and created by small Brazilian team MadMozer, it's a first-person, multiplayer-focussed, Unreal Engine deathgame that traps you in a randomly generated mansion with a bunch of archetypal horror movie munsters - demon clowns, cursed puppets, toothy ghouls and hooded axe-murderers.

Now the 27GL83A is back once again, and at a new low price - $200, a nice $100 reduction from its usual asking price.

In Spider-Man’s case, that’s only true some of the time.

What’s the best second Spider-Man game? The answer may mildly surprise you.

Alongside animation studio Illumination, it had teamed up with Red Wing Shoes to make Mario’s shoes from the movie, not as a line of shoes for sale, but rather a hyper-realistic version of the boots – odd proportions and all – to be displayed at the official Nintendo Store in New York City.

The interest in Mario’s shoes began with the movie’s first teaser poster, where the fidelity of Mario’s footwear blew fans away. People wanted to know more about them, which led Nintendo and Illumination to contact Red Wing Shoes, a Minnesota company specializing in work boots, about making some. “We got the call, and naturally, we’re like, ‘Well, Mario is the world’…]]></summary>

Modern consoles might be able to provide great visuals and a wide library of games (though still both inferior to the PC) but no controller can match the precision and reactivity of your keyboard's smaller, nimbler sidekick. Whether you're playing fast-paced RTS' like StarCraft 2 or twitchy shooters like Apex Legends, a great mouse can be the difference between virtual life and death. And for Black Friday, one of the very best gaming mice is going cheap, rather than squeak.

It’s been struck down from £3800 to £2100 in the UK, a saving to the tune one £1700 – one very Big Number indeed. 
Another Omen 17 variant, still with an RTX 4080 GPU (but trading an even more powerful Intel chip for less RAM and storage), is also getting the Black Friday treatment in the US. Albeit with a $500 saving, which I understand is not as Big a Number, and is thus less deserving of going in the headline.

If you miss 8 or 16-bit platformers like Shinobi or the original Ninja Gaiden, I also recommend trying the demo for Ninja Issen. If you liked The Messenger - classique Ninja Gaiden's greatest heir - but wished it was More Cyberpunk with cheesy PG-rated holographic dancing girls and Comix Zone-style story panels, I also also recommend trying the demo for Ninja Issen. 


Out today, it's the work of solo Korean dev Asteroid-J, and based on the first level, is pretty decent. It does have quite a lot of dialogue for a ninja platformer, but the dialogue is tongue-in-cheek, and hopefully it'll fall by the wayside as you push beyond the tutorial sections.

The word “adult” doesn’t likely come up when you ponder games on Switch, but that’s seemingly about to change. The company is adding a new 18+ app to its subscription service, Nintendo…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the death throes of last December, I wrote about all the games I wanted to review in 2022 but eventually ran out of time for when we finally packed up the Treehouse for Christmas and took our annual turkey nap. It was quite a long list, all things considered, I will probably still end up making another one by the time this year's annual meat snooze rolls around, too. 2023 has arguably been stuffed with even more good games than we had last year, and I will be the first to admit that my eyes are, indeed, frequently too big for what I can feasibly hope to play in any given month.
But I also thought it would also be fun to get ahead of the game slightly by turning some of my remaining supporter posts for the year into a kind of extended I'M SORRY: 2023 Edition series, talking about games I have actually liked and played, but which a) didn't end up making it onto my personal GOTY list (just to keep you Advent Calender guessing gamers on your toes), and b) we also weren't able to review on the site, either due to lack of time, code or, well, no, it's really just time. Time is our eternal enemy. And the first game I'd like to talk about is Tron: Identity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online's highest tier, the expansion pack, have access to an ever-growing catalog of modern and classic games, including a small library of N64 games. In December, that expansion pack is expanding a little more, as Jet Force Gemini is coming to the service.
First released in 1999, Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter developed by Rare, the studio originally known for the Banjo-Kazooie games, but most recently known for Sea of Thieves. It's set on a sci-fi alien world, where players blast through hordes of insect-like creatures.
The most recent way players could experience the game on modern consoles was through Rare Replay, a compilation of classic Rare games released on the Xbox One in 2015.  For a refresher on the game, check out this 60-second rundown Rare put out a few years back.


The Switch Online currently includes 26 other N64 games, including the recently added Excitebike 64. It also includes Game Boy Advance games, Sega Genesis games, and DLC content for popular Switch titles, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing. For the full list, check out our rundown here.]]></summary>

That’s less, by the way, than most last-gen RTX 3060 cards are currently going for, even those partaking in Black Friday themselves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the first ways Fortnite was able to prove its mainstream success was by introducing popular real-world people into the game. Whether it's Travis Scott, Lebron James, or Patrick Mahomes, it's become a sort of Hollywood Star of Fame to be featured in Epic Games' hit shooter. Today. Marshall Mathers joins the club – Eminem is coming to Fortnite. 
The Grammy winner will be added to the game's item shop on November 29. The image above shows the three versions of the rapper that will be available for purchase. From left to right, they're called Rap Boy, Slim Shady, and Marshall Never More. This release comes a few days ahead of Fortnite's Big Bang event, which is set to happen on December 2 at 2 PM Eastern. Alongside whatever world-altering event phenomena Epic plans to introduce, Eminem will be performing a live concert. Attendees will receive the Big Bang loading screen, featured at the head of this article.
Fortnite has been in gaming news a lot recently, thanks to the rollout of Fortnite OG, a record-setting new season that throws players back in time to the earliest maps in the game. It's also come under fire for new rules about which skins are allowed in certain creator-made worlds: you can see their response to this controversy here.

Alongside the streaming explosion and a system unchanged for a decade, one that critics describe as "dysfunctional", the levy now faces renewed scrutiny.

I've just finished (well, reached a grisly end within) the demo for Chiyo, a first-person horror game from Nimbus Games, set in Edo era Japan, in which you are a plucky young mystic sent by the Tokugawa Shogunate's Magical Arcane Division to investigate and cleanse a spooky abandoned mansion on the coast. 


Much like the protagonist of fellow Japan-set exor-simulator Ghostwire: Tokyo, you have a brace of occult, gesture-based powers with which to explore and, hopefully, vanquish any lurking spirits, but so far, the only ones I've gotten access to are a funky finger torch, the ability to unseal cursed doors, and the ability to see glowing puzzle props through surfaces. I very much do not feel like an Edo era John Constantine. I don't even feel like an Edo era Scooby Doo. I mean, at least he was good at running away: the titular Chiyo waddles about like she's worried her trousers are about to fall down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After four seasons of brand new content, Epic Games injected a healthy dose of nostalgia into Fornite Chapter 4's fifth season, officially called Season OG, by bringing back the Chapter 1 map for players to experience once more. Season OG has included weekly updates to add items from Chapter 1's various seasons, too, making it a fun romp through what Fortnite was like years ago. However, Season OG ends on December 2, which is also when Fortnite's next live event, The Big Bang, goes live. 
The Big Bang begins on Saturday, December 2, at 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, and Epic says, "This event marks a new beginning for Fortnite." 
✅ Unforgettable event

November 21, 2023
Before the event begins, Epic says players will see The Big Bang in the Battle Royale tile in the Discover section of Fortnite 30 minutes prior to its start; that way, you can jump in before the event starts to link up with friends and get your cosmetics in order. And speaking of friends, The Big Bang will support parties of up to four players. 
The Big Bang will be available anywhere you play the most current build of Fortnite, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. If you won't be near a dedicated gaming device during the event, you can check it out using Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Amazon Luna services to play Fortnite via cloud streaming on your computer or mobile device. 
"To prepare for The Big Bang, Fortnite experiences made by Epic will be disable starting 12 p.m. ET on December 2," Epic writes in a blog post. "Creator-made experiences will remain enabled until downtime for Fortnite v28.00 starts at 11:30 p.m. ET."
While waiting for The Big Bang event, read up on everything you need to know about Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG, and then read about how Epic says it's aware it missed the mark with a recent cosmetic restriction update for Fortnite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt Red released Phantom Liberty, the first and last expansion for its 2020 RPG, Cyberpunk 2077, in September. We loved it – find out why in Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review here – and if you enjoyed the base game, it's not an expansion to miss. Currently, it's only available for purchase as an add-on to Cyberpunk 2077, but if you haven't yet picked it up, it might be worth waiting just a couple more weeks. That's because CDPR has revealed Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion in one single package.
Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 5, and will be released in both a digital format and physical. Check out the box art below: 
Big news… Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition arrives on December 5th in digital AND physical form for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC!

November 21, 2023
All that CDPR has shared about this new edition is the tweet above so it remains to be seen if the Ultimate Edition includes any new goodies or enhancements. Given Phantom Liberty and the Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 update improved the game in big ways, reworking and revamping several of its mechanics in the process, it's unlikely the Ultimate Edition will include any changes in that vein. Only time will tell, though. 
For more, read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review and then read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review. After that, read about the things to remember and know before starting Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, and then check out this feature about how the team behind the expansion created its spy-thriller soundtrack. Read about this live-action Cyberpunk 2077 project that's now in the works, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yakuza: Like A Dragon was a very silly game in spite of its dramatic narrative, but its follow-up, Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, looks to give it a run for its money. Between letting Ichiban ride a dolphin and its Animal Crossing-style city-building mode, fans of the franchise’s goofball nature should be in for a treat, and a new batch of screenshots highlight this.
The images provide looks at Ichiban, Kiryu Joryu, and their returning friends, such as Nanba, Adachi, and Saeko, kicking butt in a variety of classes and looking absurd doing so. Other familiar faces will be playable party members for the first time, such as Seonhee, who is shown brutalizing opponents with a whip in the images. It's clear that Hawaii will never be the same once these guys are done with it. 


Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 26. You can learn more about the game and see it in action in this pair of trailers. Be sure to also read our review of its direct predecessor, Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, here.]]></summary>

The Talos Principle II often left me staring at my screen in awe. Sometimes, from sheer intimidation in the face of a seemingly formidable puzzle. Other times,  from my incredulous pride after unraveling said problem. But most of all, the experience regularly gave me pause as I pondered a philosophical idea or argument that challenged my viewpoints on the nature of existence and humanity’s place in the cosmos. These moments spurred me to solve the game’s 100+ puzzles in search of answers, and I’m largely satisfied with what I discovered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth arrives in February, which isn’t too far on the horizon, so Square Enix is getting players prepared with a cinematic refresher of its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake. The company pairs that with a batch of fresh screenshots and art, including the first glimpse of the Highwind airship. 
The video sees Red XIII narrate the broad strokes of the 2020 adventure. While it doesn’t touch on the finer details and background of the characters, it provides a decent summary that's perhaps better served as a reminder for fans who played Remake rather than someone coming into Rebirth completely fresh. Unfortunately, the recap doesn’t touch on the events of the Intermission expansion that introduces Yuffie, who joins the party in Rebirth, so unfamiliar players will have to do their own homework on that. 


Square has released some new images, including a piece of art depicting Aerith in front of the Highwind. The screenshots show off the town of Kalm, the summon Kujata, the abandoned Mythril Mine, and a few side characters. Oh, and Chadley is there too. 

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on February 29 for PlayStation 5. You can watch us play two demos of the game in this video and read our hands-on impressions here. You can also get the answers to some of Rebirth's burning questions in this interview with Square Enix.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 11/20/23:
Last week, developer Epic Games updated Fortnite to include a new rating restriction that applies to certain skins. Depending on a Fortnite skin, it might only be useable on a creative island with a T rating, meaning the Resident Evil Claire Redfield skin, which features a pistol in a holster on her thigh, can't be used on islands rated less than Teen. Players were upset with this change as it made skins they paid real money for (often $10 to $20 per skin) unusable in all the ways they might have previously been usable. 
Epic said only 7 percent of Fortnite skins are only usable on Teen-rated islands, at the time, but it's clear enough skins are affected to have the community unhappy with this update.
Over the weekend, Epic released a statement through the official Fortni…]]></summary>

Back in the '90s, Nintendo played faster and looser with its library of characters. Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward.

Arguably the most interesting secret boss of the original game was Culex. He is not a Final Fantasy character, but he looks and feels like one and features Final Fantasy music and sound effects.
Culex appears in Super Mario RPG remake as he did in the original game, which is to say he is a pixelated, 2D creature. He also features the original throwback soundtrack and sound effects. You access him the same way, too – by buying fireworks and trading them with the little girl nearby in Moletown for a shiny stone. You then use that shiny stone in Monstro Town on the locked door.
However, upon defeat, Culex teases another encounter in the future, which is where thin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck OLED releases today, providing a new avenue for game players (especially those with big Steam libraries) to take their gaming experience on the go. The new OLED models (one at 512 GB and another at 1TB storage) effectively replace the original release as the new Steam Deck flagship hardware. The older 64 GB and 512 GB LCD models are being phased out, while the 256 GB LCD will remain available at a reduced price.
Steam Deck OLED is not a fundamentally new platform. In many ways that matter, our review of the original still stands, and snagging one of the older LCD screen models is now an even more substantial value at the lower price. However, several of the concerns that surfaced in that review have been remedied by the new model – enough that a new evaluation is warranted.

And then, in a bit of a meta twist, we hung out with Humanity co-developer and publisher Enhance and discussed how we made our making-of documentary. Even cooler, we made a Game Informer level within Humanity – and you can play it now.
All this happened on the "HUMANITY Hub Community Stream," where myself (Blake) and Alex Van Aken discussed why we decided to make a documentary on Humanity, how we crafted the video, and even cutting-room floor content that didn't make the final product. We closed the show by putting our collective brains together to make a level based on the GI logo.
You can check out an archived version of the stream below:


By no means is our Humanity level an official partnership between Enhance and GI, but it's certainly a fun way to end a project that was a months-long labor of love.

The original Super Mario RPG, released for Super Nintendo in 1996, felt like it was meant to be your first RPG. In an era when Final Fantasy tried its best to tell mature stories within the medium's limitations and Dragon Quest demanded hours and hours of your time, Mario’s adventure felt much brighter and more manageable. Familiar characters, a lighthearted story, a reasonable length, and timed button-pressing during combat made it stand out against the competition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Digital Bros Group, the parent company to publisher 505 Games, has announced plans to lay off 30 percent of its staff. It says it is doing so to align with "the new competitive market." 505 Games is the publisher behind games like Ghostrunner 2, Control, Payday 2, the PC version of Death Stranding, and more; it's unclear how much of that team will be affected by Digital Bros' overall plan. 
"Digital Bros has reviewed its projects to align with the new competitive environment," it writes in a press release. "This is expected to represent a reduction of approximately 30 percent of the global workforce, but no significant effect of restructuring costs is expected on the annual project results for [Fiscal Year 2024]."

Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution was arguably the most interesting title. Developer WayForward began development on the game 20 years ago, but never completed it. Next year, the game will finally make its way to Switch, but retain the Game Boy Advance aesthetic it was always meant to have.
Outer Wilds: Archaeologist Edition is bringing the excellent space-exploring mystery game to the handheld console and will include the Echoes of the Eye expansion. The game releases December 7 and a physical versio…]]></summary>

Persona 5 has become its own sort of mini-franchise within the Persona series. With many spin-off titles released over the years, such as Persona 5 Strikers, Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight, and Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth, Atlus seems to love using Persona 5’s popularity to explore new stories and gameplay ideas. However, I applaud Atlus for making all of these spin-offs in completely different genres from each other. The latest, Persona 5 Tactica, delivers an entertaining story, a colorful cast of charact…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Put your sleuthing caps on, detectives—it’s time to solve some mysteries! We are proud to announce that a whole batch of HeR Interactive’s Nancy Drew games are now ready for public testing:
In Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. 
Nancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.
In Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.
And if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.
The games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!
Kingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. 
Escape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.
Both games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.
To play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!
