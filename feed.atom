While the start and end dates of the next closed beta haven't been unveiled just yet, we do know that there's going to be a new character to play, a new faction, new missions, and overhauls to the game's combat and exploration. I'd imagine it's worth a look if you're into Genshin Impact, or are into your anime fights. Either one will suffice.

Being able to play a game away from my PC can be handy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stardew Valley features a lot of consumables which can either be made or purchased. One of these, Pale Ale, has a rather funny side effect when consumed and while it’s not difficult to make, there are some steps that need to be followed. 


If you don’t want to make your own Pale Ale, and you’ve unlocked the Ginger Island Resort, you can purchase it there for 1,000 Gold. This is a slightly easier, less time-consuming, though more expensive option if you really just want to get tipsy (Note: being tipsy reduces movement speed). 


How to make Pale Ale in Stardew Valley

Before you can make Pale Ale, you’ll need a Keg, which can be crafted using the following resources once you’ve reached Farming level 8:



30 Wood


1 Copper Bar


1 Iron Bar


1 Oak Resin



Once you’ve crafted and placed your Keg, you’re also going to need some Hops to put in it. You can purchase a Hops Starter from Pierre’s General Store for 60 Gold, and once planted you’ll need to wait 11 days before you can harvest. 


Okay, you’ve got your Keg and your Hops, now for the easy part. Put the Hops into the Keg and after one to two days, you’ll have some Pale Ale! 


What is Pale Ale used for?


Image by Destructoid


The most important use for Pale Ale is for furthering the progress of the Community Center. Pale Ale is part of the Brewer’s Bundle in the Pantry (Revised).


Other than this, Pale ale is a pretty commonly liked gift for the Villagers, with Pam particularly loving it. In fact, Pam requests a Pale Ale on the 14th of Summer as part of the “Pam is Thirsty” quest. Most other villagers like receiving Pale Ale as gift aside from the children (why would you give alcohol to a child?) and the following two adult Villagers:



Sebasitan


Penny



You can put Pale Ale into the spool of the Sewing Machine in order to create a Black Leather Jacket, or it can be used as a yellow dye in the dye pots at Emily and Haley’s house.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Castform variants are a tricky bunch to get due to their reliance on weather conditions. Even more so, those who don't live in snowy regions often miss out on the chance to see the creature's rarest form (with the exception of the Shiny). So, if you aren't sure how to catch Snowy Castform in Pokemon Go, here's what you can do. 


Where to find Snowy Castform in Pokemon Go


If you don't live in a snowy region or are having difficulty finding Snowy Castform, the only way to get it is by completing Weather-themed Field Research tasks. The objectives primarily involve catching Pokémon with Weather Boosts, which activate with specific forecast conditions. However, the Weather Week event ends on March 18, 2024, at 8 PM local time, taking off the required tasks for the Snowy Castform. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


Even if it isn't snowing in your area, Snowy Castform appears when the event is active, regardless of weather conditions. Unfortunately, catching the creature in Pokémon Go is still very rare, so try to complete as many Field Research tasks as possible. In the case that there are no Weather-themed objectives on the board, delete a current task and spin a PokéStop to unlock them. 


One assignment, in particular, requires the capture of multiple variants through the Weather Week Collection Challenge: Castform. This includes Normal, Sunny, Rainy, and Snowy. All types may also be captured through Field Research until the event ends. Those lucky enough to find them earn an Elite Collector medal, incense, and 5,000 Stardust. But if you miss your chance, don't worry; there will likely be another Weather Week or opportunity in the near future.

        <updated>2024-03-18T14:52:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Sony produced a poll asking participants to pit PlayStation-exclusive titles against each other to see which would come out on top. The bout is still ongoing, but fans were quick to point out the absence of Bloodborne, which some may interpret as a tad suspicious.


The original post on Twitter/X invites users to determine "which PlayStation game reigns supreme." Voting showed that—in the first round—God of War Ragnarok beat out Demon's Souls, The Last of Us: Part II trounced Horizon Forbidden West, while Returnal was pulverized by Marvel's Spider-Man.




However, PlayStation fans were largely distracted by Bloodborne wasn't in the running as a pick for platform favorite. Many people—including famed YouTube personality Jacksepticeye—have been asking why FromSoftware's celebrated gothic-horror action game hasn't been included in the contest.


A forgotten classic (forgotten by Sony, that is)


Feel free to choose your own conspiracy theory, but it does seem odd that, in a poll asking people to crown the best PS-exclusive of all time, there's no Bloodborne, which has only ever been released on PS4. User @Bkwrd1 believes its notable absence is because Sony knows the game "would WASH the whole list."


It's true that many have been waiting for quite some time for Bloodborne to either be remastered or remade. At the very least, fans just want it to be ported to the PS5. As such, some may interpret the game not being included in the poll as an intentional snubbing from Sony, as though it refuses to acknowledge its existence. But I'm not here to put words in your mouth.


Recently, Bloodborne's creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki spoke about how pleased he was that so many fans are still talking about the 2015 game. Sadly, he has no knowledge about the fate of any possible remake of it.

We are now in the final run of Wii U and 3DS online play. Nintendo has confirmed that the consoles' online features and functionality will no longer work from 8th April 2024, and with that will come the end of a lot of game modes.
One title that will see some pretty heavy cuts is Super Mario Maker. The end of online play means that all community-built levels will soon be unplayable and the chance of 100% completion will be gone. It's a heart-breaking thought, but one that the community — specifically, a trained task force dubbed 'Team 0%' — has quickly rallied towards to make sure that no level is left unbeaten.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even if you haven't played Star Citizen, you're likely aware of its legacy. It's been in development for well over a decade – with an early access version of the game available to play – and has become one of the most highly-funded crowdfunding campaigns of all time. But now, the journey to a full release seems within grasp. Sort of.


According to a recent letter from the chairman and founder of Cloud Imperium Games, Chris Roberts, Star Citizen is on the path to 1.0, which the team considers "the features and content set to represent 'commercial' release." The letter says this means "the game is welcoming to new players, stable, and polished with enough gameplay and content to engage players continuously."




In other words, "it is no longer Alpha or Early Access," as the developer continues on a roadmap that will see the fruition of multiple milestones for the Persistent Universe (the main module of the game).


Still a long journey ahead


To coincide with these plans to bring Star Citizen 1.0 to the fore, Cloud Imperium has initiated a re-organization, which includes having developers relocate to be "closer in time zone to our main development operations in Manchester, Frankfurt, and Montreal."


There are also some words from Rich Tyrer, who recently became Senior Game Director. Tyrer has said his new role involves him "coming on board to help push Star Citizen to the next stage of its development, ultimately culminating in leaving early access and releasing the 1.0 version of the game." However, there's no release date for the long-awaited commercial release.


As of right now, Star Citizen has amassed a total of $672,037,749 in donated funds. Given this staggering figure, you'd be forgiven for understanding why a lot of fans have grown impatient waiting well over ten years for the game proper to launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Animal Well, the gorgeous indie metroidvania that will also be the first game published by Videogamedunkey's Bigmode, will hit PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC this May. More specifically, developer Shared Memory, which is just solo dev Billy Basso, revealed in a new gameplay trailer the game will launch on May 9. 
Dunkey revealed Big Mode, his own publishing arm, back in 2022, later announcing that Shared Memory's Animal Well would be the first game it publishes. Now, just shy of two years later, Animal Well will finally be in the hands of players in just a couple of months. 
Check out the Animal Well release date trailer for yourself below: 


"After nearly 7 years of development, Animal Well is finally almost ready to be released out into the world," Basso writes on X (formerly Twitter). "I have made this trailer to commemorate the occasion. I hope you like it. I don't really know what else to say." 
As you can see in the trailer above, Animal Well continues to look hauntingly gorgeous, and even kind of cute if you're a fan of spooky animals. We also get new glimpses of the game's metroidvania exploration, too, by way of a special yo-yo with a light that lures animals forward and more. Plus, there's a dog, which rules. 
Animal Well hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on May 9.

It is now due to launch late in March, and everything points to it being fairly sizeable in most respects, its most interesting feature being the all-new Dante Warframe.


Little is known about Dante so far, other than the fact that it is the mysterious grimoire-wielding biomech that used to be responsible for the Leverian museum. The 56th official Warframe was, thus, the personal assistant and chronicler of Drusus Leverian, giving the creature a unique position in the game's admittedly wild and erratic lore. With just a few months having gone by after Warframe's previous big content update, Whispers in the Walls, fans are poised to get a solid gameplay upgrade, from the l…]]></summary>

Regardless of whether that turns out well, though, there's good news, classic Marathon coming to Steam!


Do note, however, that this is not an official Bungie effort. Indeed, the Destiny developer isn't using this as an opportunity to regain community goodwill ahead of The Final Shape's release. Instead, we're looking at an honest-to-goodness community effort to modernize the original Marathon, as per its Aleph One rendition, and everything points to the game being available completely for free, which would be a huge boon for the franchise as a whole.

In it, you'll explore a vast labyrinth of tunnels, solve puzzles and escape its many mammalian-based horrors, all of whom  are out to gobble you up in one fell swoop - though as a strange, tiny little blob creature the size of a chicken nugget, it's unclear both what you are, and why exactly you're so appetising to them. Well, it probably has something to do with looking like a sentient chicken nugget, I suppose. Come and watch the release date trailer below.

You could solve the necessary puzzles to move on, but wouldn't it be easier to, we don't know, Falcon Punch any difficulties into oblivion?
notCHase's mod does just that. Rather than swanning around Hyrule brandishing the Hookshot or Bomb Bag, this Link has everything he needs in one Smash Bros.-inspired, super-powered fist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SNK has released a new gameplay trailer for its upcoming fighter, Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, revealing it's due out in "early 2025" as well. This trailer arrives roughly half a year after SNK formally revealed Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in a trailer similar to today's, featuring Terry Bogard facing off against Rock Howard. 
That duo returns for another fight in the latest trailer, spotlighting the game's new "REV" system that features Rev Guard, Rev Blow, Rev Accel, and presumably more we'll learn about when the game is released next year. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves gameplay trailer below: 


Unfortunately, the trailer doesn't reveal anything else about the game, including platforms. Presumably, it will come to PlayStation and Xbox (possibly Switch), and PC. 
SNK will release Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in early 2025.
In the meantime, check out SNK's original tease for the game from 2022, and then watch the Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves reveal trailer from last year. 
After that, catch up on Game Informer's thoughts on the latest fighting game releases:

It's been a long time coming, but the Fatal Fury franchise is officially back with Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, a new fighting game from SNK that will be launching early 2025.
There's no word on target platforms for the game yet, and truth be told, we personally think it's a possibility that it might skip the Switch entirely for Nintendo's eventual successor. That said, with the entry built on Unreal Engine 4, it's entirely possible that it could be optimised sufficiently for the Switch.

Looked for more codes!




I love anime-inspired games, and Reaper 2 is the perfect example, as it lets you play as a character in the world of the much-loved series Bleach. It comes with some of my favorite RPG elements—grinding quests and bosses to level up and investing in abilities and skill trees.


If you’re having trouble beating enemies and the grind is giving you a headache, using Reaper 2 codes can give you the boost you need—be it via more cash, rerolling your race, or resetting all your stats. If you’re looking for other games inspired by popular anime, check out our Shinobi Life 2 codes article and grab all the free prizes you can get your hands on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Little Pony: A Zephyr Heights Mystery will be coming to pretty much every platform on May 17 and while it’s definitely out of my usual comfort zone in terms of game choices, I can’t help but be incredibly excited for its release. 


Before you judge me, just know that I have a very good reason. 


You see, I have a three-year-old little girl who happens to love My Little Pony, but she also desperately wants to join in with every game I play. Whether I’m battling Eikons in Final Fantasy XIV or trying to chop down trees in Stardew Valley, she’s on my lap trying to play, and this My Little Pony game feels like the perfect moment to introduce her to a game she might actually be able to play. 


From the moment she was born, she’s seen me and my partner gaming. I was playing FFXIV with her a…]]></summary>

Instead, it now sits at the heart of a controversy that began with misinformation and is now being fueled by mischaracterization and misinterpretation. Today we'll shine new light on the case and show why it has implications for every internet user in the country. That leads to the role of ISPs and whether internet users can rely on them to defend whatever privacy they have left.

Initially, they checked in with the PS3 community. After all, the developer of the TimeSplitters franchise, Free Radical, all but disappeared after its PS3 launch title Haze failed to impress. It’s since completely closed as a result of the Embracer Group layoffs. However, it seems as though this development kit managed to make it through both events relatively unscathed.

Bidoof, the generation four normal type (apparently) Mouse Pokémon that somehow evolves into the Beaver Pokémon Bibarel, was first introduced to the franchise way back in Diamond and Pearl. It flew under the radar, for the most part, but secured a place in the hearts of players and has been an underdog fan favorite ever since.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Super Mario Maker was initially released for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U in 2015, it's hard to say if Nintendo knew exactly what it was setting itself up for. Opening up the opportunity for fans to create their own Mario levels and upload them for the community to play is a fun concept, and everyone was able to find something they loved about it. 


However, as we draw closer to Nintendo's server shutdown, players are racing to complete as many levels as possible before they're taken away. In fact, one group is taking this so far that they're just one level away from having completed every level in Super Mario Maker. This level, "Trimming the Herbs," may just be the toughest in the game's history. 




Why do players want to complete every Super Mario Maker level?

Let’s take a small step back first, though. The modern gaming media industry is positively inundated with meta-gaming and content strategizing: you can find a dozen expert (or “expert,” as it were) content creators discussing the ins and outs of the latest piece of content within a stone’s throw of any remotely popular release. Avoiding this is not feasible, and Helldivers 2’s popularity means your family, friends, and pets all want to know what the latest meta is now that the Railgun sucks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another indie title has been released that’s giving players some much-needed relaxation: Summerhouse. There’s no combat, no movement, and nothing to stress you out except the limitations of your own imagination. Plus, there are collectibles, and that’s always a good thing. 


Summerhouse, a game by independent developer Friederman, is all about building using a limited number of tiles and decor items. You start the game with only a few tiles to build with. As you place them down, you’ll start to get new pieces featuring people and animals that will bring your creations to life--if you're lucky.

Summerhouse is about building houses and feeling the vibe


Summerhouse is reminiscent of playing with building blocks, either as a child myself or with my daughter now…]]></summary>

MAR10 Day might be over, but hear us out-- Nintendo said that every day is MAR10 day with Nintendo Switch. So we're going to take that statement to heart and talk about our favourite Mario games. Yep, not the best, not the worst, but our personal favourites. And no, they don't have to be on Switch.
Everyone has a different favourite. For some, it's their first foray into the colourful, eclectic world of Super Mario. For others, the leap into 3D may have been too much to resist. Mario has had a pretty varied life since 1985's Super Mario Bros. (and technically even before that), and with the 40th anniversary looming next year, we're always ready to celebrate Nintendo's mascot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The game-as-a-service model can all too easily feel to players as though the title they love has been twisted into some sort of machine designed to extract money from them. While some are free-to-play, many games that had an upfront cost at launch have been irrevocably altered and require players to invest in each battle pass lest they be left behind in terms of gear, lore, or general progression. 


With Helldivers 2, Arrowhead Game Studios did what many would believe publishers would never do: it built a monetization system that doesn't try to rinse players for as much of their hard-earned cash as possible. The battle pass progression system feels satisfying, an amazing compliment to the core gameplay loop, and it even makes me want to spend a few bucks on something just so I can support…]]></summary>

The common thread is that these beams are blue, which no enemy faction in the game currently fires. After much debate about how this could be the return of the Illuminate faction, Arrowhead Game Studios' CEO has stepped up to resolve the matter, stating, "Blue beams aren't real, it can't hurt you."


Johan Pilestedt's post on Twitter does very little to comfort the hundreds of Helldivers currently fighting to push back the enemies of Super Earth. Even after a major victory in successfully setting up the Termicide Towers across every barrier planet to hold back the Terminid swa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever learned about something in one of your favorite games and thought “wait, that was a thing?” Well that’s exactly what’s happened with ConcernedApe’s latest Tweet regarding the upcoming 1.6 patch to Stardew Valley.


Confused Stardew Valley players are united in bemusement over ConcernedApe’s latest Tweet:


As it turns out, there’s a mechanic in Stardew Valley that it seems the majority of players have never witnessed, but it’s one that the developer is going to fix with the implementation of patch 1.6. 




Apparently, until this point, if you marry one of the NPCs in the game, there’s a chance that they will become so depressed that they’ll spend all day in bed, even though they’ve just got married. 


This isn’t something I’ve ever witnessed while playing myself and upon asking my Stardew Valley playing friends, they’ve never witnessed it either. This has led people to ask what on earth players are doing to their spouses to make this happen. 


The post also sparked a lot of requests for the ability to marry certain NPCs that can currently not be married, such as Willy or Robin. The number of people asking for this is pretty shocking, actually. I’m not sure why so many people want to marry Willy, but to each their own I suppose. 


This Tweet is the latest in a string of ConcernedApe Tweets detailing small updates that are coming in patch 1.6, with the others being: 



Fruit Trees will yield Saplings of the same fruit


Harvesting will be at the same speed in either direction


Larger area of effect for downward Melee attacks will be larger


Moving past pets will now take less time



Who’s to know what else will be revealed before the patch notes drop on March 19, but stay tuned for more tidbits of information!

But now, the tide has changed with the new weapon, Mace, a hammer-like tool with the power to cure Fall Damage. Here's how to make Mace in Minecraft and what it can be used for. 


Minecraft Mace Recipe


The Minecraft Mace recipe requires a Breeze Rod and Heavy Core. Both items can be found in the Trial Chambers but are only available in Version 1.21 SnapShot, Beta, or Preview.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The gaming landscape as a whole has greatly shifted from the good days of the single-player games and the split-screen co-op, to a more online-oriented strategy. It's not the case that these games just don't exist, obviously, but the big-picture look drives us more and more toward online-focused, multiplayer experiences. That's fine if done well, but we'll always need great single-player campaigns, so let's honor the best of the best. Easy task.


Below, I've outlined 15 of the best games you can play by yourself. While some of these may have a co-op campaign or some online functionality, those aren't their driving factors. With that in mind, let's go ahead and break down those top picks, spanning console and PC generations new and old.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Interabang Entertainment and The Angry Metal Company have given a new look into their upcoming beat-’em-up, Jay and Silent Bob: Chronic Blunt Punch. Alongside it is a 2024 launch window, and apparently, Digital Eclipse (and Atari) are helping with the project as publishers.


I’m going to be upfront with you: I know next to nothing about Jay and Silent Bob. I’ve watched the 1999 film Dogma, which featured the characters, as well as 2001’s Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, and I mostly enjoyed them, but stoner humor just isn’t in my wheelhouse. I’ve abstained from drugs and alcohol my whole life, so I just don’t relate to it. That isn’t a moral stance, either, it’s just whenever I’m not in full control over my thoughts and actions, I always do or say something completely stupid.




I do know beat-’em-ups, however, and from what I can tell, Jay and Silent Bob: Chronic Blunt Punch is a beat-’em-up. 2020’s Jay and Silent Bob: Mall Brawl was also a beat-’em-up, but while that title went for an NES retro-style aesthetic, Chronic Blunt Punch has a much more detailed cartoon look to it.


The trailer is mostly focused on an animated interpretation of the gameplay, but it also shows some scenes of the gameplay itself, with the eponymous heroes beating up road hockey players and phone-addicted teens. The animated portions show some super-hero sentai sequences and the genre-mandatory S&M boss. There’s probably a bunch of references sprinkled around that I don’t get, but hopefully, you do.


Jay and Silent Bob: Chronic Blunt Punch is coming sometime in 2024. The target platforms have not been revealed yet, but PC is one of them.

I've only seen three of them so far, out of its total of eight, but it's immediately obvious just how much of a step-up these places are compared to the dusty plains and rolling hills of the most recent Final Fantasy game to hit PC, FF15. An obvious take, perhaps, given that FF15 first came out eight years ago in 2016, but I'm sure anyone (all right, mainly me) who's ever despaired at Noctis' seeming inability to climb even the smallest hillock in front of him, or how everyone always rides right into your backside while gunning about on a chocobo, will feel some m…]]></summary>

Now, the FFXIV team is aiming to expand this to cross region travel, and you'll be able to test it out soon. 


Since Data Center travel was introduced, Square Enix has been open about the concerns and limitations of its infrastructure. Just traveling between Data Centers proved difficult enough, as Yoshi-P has long offered transparency into the process and its challenges. But there have been concerns surrounding functionality of less concrete systems, too. Especially when it comes to the in-game economy and social norms that differ between Data Centers.

        <updated>2024-03-15T19:27:58.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3D Realms has announced that the follow-up to 2019’s Ion Fury, Phantom Fury, will be released on April 23, 2024.


Phantom Fury continues the violent adventures of Shelly “Bombshell” Harrison, who first appeared in 2016’s Bombshell as a stand-in for Duke Nukem after Gearbox asserted their ownership of him. While her first outing was not very well-received, Ion Fury took a different direction by utilizing the Build Engine – the same game engine responsible for William Shatner’s Tekwar (and also Duke Nukem 3D). I personally had my issues with Ion Fury, but a lot of other people really connected with it.




Phantom Fury leaves the Build Engine behind but doesn’t completely abandon the retro-inspired graphics. While it’s moving to a full-3D engine, it looks like something more circa Y2K. It hasn’t been explicitly said by the developers (that I know of), but it seems to be presenting itself as an alternate reality Duke Nukem Forever, following an alternate reality Duke Nukem 3D. It’s as if that game actually released when it was supposed to instead of over a decade later. Hopefully, it will actually be good.


I played the demo of Phantom Fury a while back when it first became available. While it didn’t entirely sell me on the game, it was a competent enough slice that was full of appreciable small details. It’s important to note that while Ion Fury was developed by Voidpoint, Phantom Fury is being done by Slipgate Ironworks.


3D Realms recently saw layoffs as part of the restructuring of Embracer Group. It has been reported that they are now leaving Embracer as part of the $500 million sale of their parent company, Saber. The whole situation must be hell to try and work through, but it’s nice to see that the team was able to get Phantom Fury to the finish line.


Phantom Fury will be released on PC on April 23, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Secret Base has announced the first free content update for Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragon will bring survival and versus modes, online co-op, and new characters. The Sacred Reunion will be released on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch platforms on April 4.


Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragon was released last year. I reviewed it then, and it was… enh. It was all right. I felt that the combat wasn’t that great and, at the time, you couldn’t really do much with the character swapping. You couldn’t tie your second character into your combo. I’m not sure how much has changed since then, as there have been patches to tweak the mechanics.




There are three characters joining the roster. One has been revealed, while the other two are shadowed out. I bet one of them is Sonny Lee, the disappointing and unremarkable third Lee brother. The revealed character is Ranzou, who was a character in both Double Dragon 3’s and also an unlockable combatant in Double Dragon IV. He’s a ninja who fights with shuriken and a katana (or maybe a wakazashi).


Also being added is survival mode, which I assume is wave-based. There’s also a versus mode where you can give your friends a savage beating. Also included is online co-op. That should be good news for people with distant relationships, but I prefer to be able to “playfully” punch the person I’m playing with. There will also be new upgrades.


Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragon is available on PS4, PS5, Switch, PC, and XBox. The Sacred Reunion DLC will be available for free on April 4.

However, the game wasn't all spooks, scares, and monologues; it also has its zany, wild moments, many of which stand out long after you've finished it. 


Maybe the most iconic scene in the game is the Herald of Darkness song. It's a musical version of an interview that almost comes out of nowhere when players encounter it. Thanks to the fairly fluid nature of the game's themes, though, it fits well and provides a moment of relaxation, if not confusion, in the middle of quite an intense journey. In keeping with the fairly jarring experiences this series throws at you, one fan has now decided to recreate the entirety of Herald of D…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Combat is such a routine activity in video games that it often doesn't feel much like conflict at all. It's just something done to move the simulation along - a propulsive chore stripped of drama or significance or lasting emotion beyond a vague desire to see what lies beyond whatever it is you're trying to kill. In Death Of A Wish, combat has substance: it's a form of redemptive self-expression. The game's fights are a means of asserting and cherishing yourself in the face of a world that regards you as a deviant, a world whose poison you carry on the inside.

The Switch is home to a boatload of ambitious ports and today another is joining the ranks. Kingdom Come Deliverance wasn't in the best state when it launched on Xbox One and PS4 back in 2018, but there was still much to like. The question is, would the Switch see the same fate?
To answer that (from a technical standpoint, at least) the experts over at Digital Foundry have offered their analysis of how the RPG runs on Switch. The result: ehhhh, not bad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma 2 is right around the corner, launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next week on March 22. Ahead of the game's launch, Capcom has released a new gameplay overview trailer with more than seven minutes of new footage; and perhaps strangely, it's narrated by actor Ian McShane (Deadwood, John Wick, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides). 
Broken up into three sections in the video, McShane discusses "The Hero" of Dragon's Dogma 2, the "Two Nations," and, of course, "The Monsters" that players will be killing plenty of during their journey. 
Check it out for yourself in the Dragon's Dogma 2 gameplay overview trailer below: 


Dragon's Dogma 2 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 22, 2024. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's hands-on Dragon's Dogma 2 preview, and then check out this story about how Dragon's Dogma 2's main story campaign is about the same length as the first game. After that, read about how Dragon's Dogma 2 has an uncapped framerate but no visual presets or modes on consoles, and then check out this story about why Dragon's Dogma 2 has just one save file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is right around the corner, hitting Xbox Series X/S exclusively on May 21, and ahead of the game's release, Ninja Theory has revealed it will have a dedicated photo mode. Plus, the studio released four new images of Hellblade II taken using the game's photo mode. 
While in-game photo modes are becoming the norm more and more with each new release, there are still some games that launch without one. With how good Hellblade II continues to look in trailers and screenshots, it's great to hear the game will feature this mode. 
Check out the four new Hellblade II images taken using the game's photo mode for yourself below: 

Based on the tweet revealing the photo mode, it sounds like players can expect it to launch with the game. 
"Photo mode returns in Senua's Saga: Hellblade II," a Ninja Theory tweet reads. "Here are some shot we took purely using photo mode in-game this week." 
Senua's Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S on May 21, 2024. 
For more about the game, watch the latest Senua's Saga: Hellblade II trailer, and then check out this gameplay trailer from December. After that, watch this other gameplay trailer for another look at the game's action.

It's one of those rereleases that exists mostly for modern consoles, made a bit useless on PC by the fact that you can still buy and fully play the originals for half the price. It's made even less useful by launching in a right wonky technical state, with bad lag, crashes, and reportedly only three 64-player servers online at first.

Konami's Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 wasn't exactly met with universal acclaim from fans of the franchise (though we thought it was mostly "pretty good"), but that's not stopping the publisher from promoting the collection at every opportunity.
The latest video is a rather elaborate advertisement in which voice actor David Hayter, perhaps best known for his work on Metal Gear as Solid Snake and Big Boss, takes us on a brief journey through history as we dive into the classic Metal Gear Solid trilogy originally released on PS1 and PS2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My day in Lightyear Frontier starts out with a bit of farming. On a good day, it’s raining, so I don’t need to water the crops. On a bad day, there are weeds spontaneously spawning from the sky and I need to catch them before they land right on top of my precious plants. Either way, when I’m done, I’ll put the day’s harvest into the processing machines to work while I’m away, and then go exploring for minerals.
My goals are clear. I need to build a new machine, or upgrade my mech so that I can clean up a new area of the map and get new resources in return. Those will – you guessed it – let me build new machines or upgrade my mech again. There might be a few steps to juggle on the way, but nothing that needs me to hold long recipe flowcharts in my head. When I get back I’ll have everything I need to take the next step. It always feels like I’m making forward progress.

Having spent months of stubbornly maining Veteran and sticking as closely as possible to FPS convention, I’ve since found peace in the simple act of swinging knives/swords/giant electrified hammers into and through people. Mainly because it’s not so simple: for all its chaotic spectacle, the meleeing in Darktide (this month’s RPS Game Club star) works because it’s secretly been a rhythm game.

        <updated>2024-03-15T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not quite legendary, though.
A few years ago, FuRyu released The Alliance Alive HD Remastered for Switch—an uprezzed port of a great RPG that was sadly missed by most due to releasing on the 3DS after most players had already moved on to Switch. Yet The Alliance Alive was not the company’s first release on Nintendo’s old handheld; that honor belonged to The Legend of Legacy. This initial release debuted to a divisive reception in 2015 (we awarded it an 8/10 in our review), but evidently the Alliance Alive remaster did well enough to warrant giving its predecessor a second chance with The Legend of Legacy HD Remastered. Though we would still say this is the weaker of the two, FuRyu did a great job of polishing up this overlooked 3DS dungeon crawler; it’s not a stellar example of this genre, but fans will be sure to find plenty to love here.
Legend of Legacy doesn’t feature very much of a story, which may come as a disappointment to many players. After picking one of seven potential characters, you travel to the mysterious island of Avalon—a recently discovered landmass that rumors say is the home to a grand, ancient treasure. Each of the seven has their own reasons for coming to Avalon, and as you explore its various dungeons, you’ll slowly uncover artifacts revealing bits of lore detailing the civilization that once thrived there, the events that ultimately led to its downfall, and the unique ways in which the seven protagonists are tied to it.

Last month, we learned that Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal, was reportedly set to sell Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake developer Saber Interactive. The deal apparently carried with it a $500 million price tag, according to a Bloomberg report. 
Now, it's official: Embracer has sold off Saber Interactive to a group of private investors under Beacon Interactive, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. Beacon Interactive is controlled by Saber Interactive co-founder Matthew Karch, the publication reports.

Following the rough launch of Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection, which is an HD port combo of the original Star Wars: Battlefront and Star Wars: Battlefront II on modern consoles and PC, developer Aspyr Media says it's working to address issues and increase network stability. 
Shortly after the game's launch on March 14, players across all platforms (but especially PC), experienced server issues preventing them from getting into matches as well as other connectivity issues like disconnects, rubberbanding, and more once actually in a match. The result was a wave of disappointment from players excited to play these classic multiplayer games. Now, a day later, Aspyr has acknowledged the issues and is working to fix them.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/14/disney-dreamlight-valley-dev-gameloft-making-dungeons-dragons-survival-sim-game"/>
        <updated>2024-03-14T18:43:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gameloft, the studio behind Disney Dreamlight Valley, has revealed it is partnering with Wizards of the Coast to create a new Dungeons & Dragons game. It's being developed for both consoles and PC and Gameloft describes it as an "innovative hybrid of survival, life simulation, and action RPG."
Disney Dreamlight Valley is popular in the life sim genre, mixing fun gameplay, unique customization, and Disney together into a package that players seem to really enjoy. It launched into Early Access back in 2022 before the full release debuted in December. All of this is to say: if you're a fan of Disney Dreamlight Valley and Dungeons & Dragons, there's a new game to keep an eye on. 
Currently untitled, Gameloft says in its announcement on Instagram that the game is set in the mythical Forgotten Realms, which is also the D&D setting Baldur's Gate 3 takes place in. The game, which will mix survival, life simulation, and action RPG elements into one, will feature "unique cooperative gameplay," the studio says. 
"Players can expect an adventure where the rich lore of this legendary franchise meets real-time strategy in a unique campaign of resilience, camaraderie, and danger at nearly every turn," the announcement reads." 
There's no name for the project and no release window either. Gameloft is currently hiring for the project. 
News of this D&D game arrives roughly a year after Wizards of the Coast, which owns the D&D IP and is a division within Hasbro, reportedly canceled five unannounced games. The last D&D game released was Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance back in 2021 – read Game Informer's review of it here.

        <id>122184</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/GameGauntlet2024"/>
        <updated>2024-03-14T17:28:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No matter the industry – sports, television, movies, or games – the debate of "the greatest of all time" inevitably comes up. These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.
Though we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.
Will this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. 
While this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet. Be sure to bookmark this page or follow us on social media to be alerted when a new round starts!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2's Cutting Edge Premium warbond, aka DLC battle pass, is now available to buy in-game, and it is chock-full of oddball gadgetry such as lightning shotguns, burst-fire laser rifles and experimental armour. As with the Arc Thrower stratagem, the lightning shotgun fires arcs of electricity that conduct between players and enemies alike, but there's a fresh armour perk, Electrical Conduit, which reduces arc damage by 95%, allowing close-knit teams of Helldivers to roll around the battlefield frazzling themselves without much penalty. 
Still, I think the real star pick here is surely the Localization Confusion booster, which extends the time between enemy spawns, allowing weirdo solo players such as myself to disentangle from a dragged-out gunfight a little more gracefully.

They don't have much more to share about the game, not even a name, so presumably it won't be out for some time. Whatever it might be, it's headed to PC and consoles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week's announcement that Embracer are selling off Saber Interactive to new company Beacon Interactive has cast further doubt over the future of one of Embracer's bigger projects, the much-delayed Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic remake. While Embracer have yet to actually state this out loud, it sounds like the KOTOR remake will be a "joint project" between Saber and Embracer. It also probably won't be out in the next 12 months. Given the project's repeated disruptions and delays, I suspect many of us will settle for the game coming out at all.

I am Dragonkin Skywalker - telekinetic Mystic Spearhand, oxcart patron and an extremely bad thief. Joining me on the adventure are three AI-controlled pawns - the diabolical fury that is Donald Duck, the levitating liability that is Galadriel, Queen of the Woods, and the class act that is celebrity stage magician David Blaine, all of whom I have given new and stupid names plucked from my vast knowledge of wizardry across different entertainment fields.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is getting delisted on Steam in Japan later this month. That's according to a new "Notice of End of Sales" post on the game's Steam page. From Friday, March 29, 2024, onward, the game will no longer be available for purchase in Japan on the storefront. 
However, online play will remain available after the game's delisting, and purchased copies of the collection will remain available for re-download from the Steam store. 
Released less than two years ago on August 30, 2022, on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, The Cowabunga Collection getting delisted so soon comes as a shock. However, it's seemingly only affecting TMNT players in Japan. Game Informer reached out to publisher Konami to ask if there are plans to delist the game outside …]]></summary>

Crow Country, however, is a very different kettle of fish, combining chunky, PS1-style Final Fantasy 7 character models with early Resident Evil tank controls and panicked monster shooting.

        <updated>2024-03-14T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your eye over the original Outcast from 1999 today, and you'll find a world that's more abstract than alien. Hazy, almost block colour textures are stretched to breaking point over terrain that looks like it's been pulled and poked by a child sculpting in putty slime, while its cast of beige, three-fingered Talans are so rigid that they'd all be reigning champions at the local robot dance-off. Understandable, given the era in which is was made, but even so - what a difference 25 years make. Even after 2017's remake glow-up with Outcast: Second Contact, A New Beginning's version of Adelpha is a lush and verdant paradise, with treetops soaring over your head, and mountains requiring several triple or quadruple jetpack jumps to traverse. It's no Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, admittedly, but it leans in very much the same direction, punching your eyeballs with such bright, primary colours that you'll feel enticed to explore every inch of it.
A shame, then, that all its visual splendour amounts to is little more than an empty husk filled with open world busy work that already felt tired and done ten years ago. Its non-linear approach to storytelling remains intact, letting you tackle the quests and problems of its numerous village settlements in any order you wish, but even this has been boiled down to tedious checklists of fetch quests, escort missions and shooting up the same identikit facility one after another. Topping off this fatal combo is returning protagonist Cutter Slade, whose macho army dude dial is still set firmly to cringey wise-cracking and patronising stereotypes. A new beginning this ain't.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The creators of RuneScape, Andrew and Paul Gower, have revealed Brighter Shores, a new point-and-click fantasy adventure MMORPG. And if you're a fan of RuneScape, Brightet Shores looks like a game you'll want to keep an eye on. 
After starting Jagex in 1999, the Gower brothers focused their efforts on the studio's first big release: RuneScape. The rest is history. RuneScape is still a very popular game today, both in its modern form and as Old School RuneScape. The Gowers left Jagex in 2010 and little was known about what they were up to until now. It turns out Andrew Gower was working as the lead designer on their new game, while Paul Gower was working as the narrative designer for it.

Apparently, this bug will finally be fixed after being in the game since its launch in 2016.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oppenheimer was one of the most-watched movies in theaters last year, grossing nearly a billion dollars in box office revenues. For several months, the movie has been widely available on pirate sites too. While one might think that all demand would be satisfied, winning the Oscar for 'Best Picture' more than doubled the interest on pirate sites this week. The same Oscar boost affects other titles as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Ubisoft Montpellier's excellent metroidvania, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, hit consoles and PC in January, and it's still one of Game Informer's top scoring reviews of the year. You can read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review here to find out why we love it so much. Now, Ubisoft is giving players another reason to jump back in with a new post-launch content roadmap. 
What's more, all of the new content coming to the game is set to release throughout the year, starting with new Speedrun and Permadeath modes this month as well as new outfits for Sargon. In spring, a Boss Rush will be released alongside even more outfits for Sargon, and in summer, the Divine Trials update brings new combat, platform, and puzzle challenges as well as new amulets, outfits, and more. All of this will be free, too. 
However, later in 2024, new paid story DLC will hit Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, although Ubisoft offers no teases about what to expect. 
It's an exciting roadmap, doubly so considering the majority of the new content is free. 
For more, read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review, and then check out our breakdown of the four ways Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown gets the metroidvania genre right. After that, check out this guide about how to beat Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's hardest platforming challenge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In some respects, Helldivers 2 did come as a bit of surprise. Not a huge amount of marketing, no betas, and review codes didn't go out until it basically launched. Before it landed on my PC, there was a small part of me that thought it was going to be a rocky ride with severe performance issues or the like. Nope! It's easily slid into one of my favourite games of the year without question, and presumably, for the hundreds of thousands of others who've also opted into preserving democracy.
But there seems to be this sentiment that Helldivers 2's roaring success has come as a shock, so much of a shock that top execs and investors are doing YouTube thumbnail faces in boardrooms with mini-nuke explosions erupting from their heads. Should its success come as that much of a surprise, though? No, probably not.

This was surprising, because while I'd been broadly positive about the vibes of Vampire Therapist, I was reasonably concerned about the specifics of how it would all shake down. But it turned out that the critical perspective was something Nemati appreciated, and so we had a chat that dug down into the meat of it all. Although I was initially interested in how he'd come up with the idea of a vampire therapist, it turns out all roads lead back to Twilight's Edward Cullen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios quietly snuck flying Terminid bugs into the game in the latest update, it seems. Windows Central noticed flying Shrieker bugs are enemies that appear on planets plagued with Terminids and while official accounts for the game play coy, more and more players are running into them. 
It seems the Shriekers were added with Patch 1.000.102, which went live yesterday. Coincidentally, that patch was centered on Terminids and nerfing spawn rates for Bile Titans and Chargers on the harder difficulties of Helldivers 2. Windows Central reports Shriekers only appear when a "Shrieker Lair" is one of the side objectives on a planet, noting they look like "smaller versions of the mushroom-like Spore Towers that perpetually keep a large area around them covered in a thick haze." 


Shrieker Lairs, like the Spore Towers and Terminid egg nests can be destroyed up close and from afar with a well-placed rocket, grenade, or strategem. 
Keep your eyes on the skies, Helldivers and remember...DEMOCRACY.
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about a recent patch that introduced meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the game. After that, check out the Cutting Edge Warbond coming to the game tomorrow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CCP Games have shared a few more details about Project Awakening, a new game or at least, "survival experience" set in the Eve Online universe, which is getting a closed playtest from 21st May 2024. Project Awakening is a single-shard affair - that is, one in which all players inhabit the same world, rather than being split up across servers or instances. It's "built upon the principles of freedom, consequence, and mastery within a living universe", and "represents the next step in CCP Games' journey to create virtual worlds more meaningful than real life", which, you know, wind your neck in.

Exploding into coins upon death notwithstanding, and to be clear, rad as hell. Happily, its Season 2 update is all about rewriting the rules of its glistening digital battlefields. I’ve played a few rounds and the new, hacking-themed gadgetry it introduces looks like just the thing to freshen The Finals up.

The trailer for Nobody Wants To Die seems like it's self-seriousness is actually self-awareness. I mean, I kind of refuse to believe that hard-boiled future crime detective James Karra saying "I'm in the business of secrets... But it's more of an addiction... And I like 'em straight... No chaser..." while sipping from a glass of amber liquor isn't indulging in some amount of winking and nudging.

More specifically, V Rising transitions into 1.0 on May 8. We learned during a State of Play in January that developer Stunlock Studios' vampire game would be coming to PlayStation 5 this year, and today's announcement further affirms the team is confident it will hit the platform in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sabotage Studio has teased a new three-player co-op mode for its 2023 RPG Sea of Stars alongside news the game has surpassed 5 million players in less than a year. This new mode, dubbed Single Player+, lets three players journey together through the story of Sea of Stars, and it will feature new traversal and combat mechanics to accommodate playing with friends. 
Sabotage announced this news today with a special teaser trailer you can watch below. In it, you'll get a glimpse of what Sea of Stars' Single Player+ mode looks like, how it works, and what to expect. Check it out: 


"Staying true to the game's core turn-based roots, each player will engage in traversal and combat with a new 'co-op timed hits' mechanic as they embark with friends on Sea of Stars' grand adventure," a press release reads. "The new mode is currently in development and more details are set to be released soon." 
As you can see, Sabotage isn't quite ready to reveal when this new mode will hit the game. After all, the team is still working on Throes of the Watchmaker, a new DLC coming to the game sometime in the future. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Sea of Stars review, and then read Game Informer's Sea of Stars cover story for behind-the-scenes details about the game's development.

        <updated>2024-03-13T12:30:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation is rolling out a new update for the PlayStation 5 that enhances audio on the DualSense controller, adds new Share Screen features, and more. This update was in beta last month but rolls out for everyone starting today. 
The biggest features are coming to the PS5's DualSense controller. The built-in speakers can now produce higher volume sound, which PlayStation says will allow players to hear in-game sounds and voice chat audio more clearly. Plus, the noise cancellation on the controller's built-in mic has been improved. 


"The mic input quality on these controllers has been improved, courtesy of a new A.I. machine learning model," a PlayStation Blog post reads. "Background noise from button presses and game audio are suppressed, resulting in a better voice chat experience."
Share Screen is also getting some new features with today's update. Namely, viewers can move a pointer around and send a ping or draw a line on a shared screen, allowing them to highlight objects in-game or guide a player. Plus, viewers can now send emoji-based reactions to the host's screen – these features are turned off by default and the host and viewer must turn them on. PlayStation says these Share Screen features will hit the PS App, which also allows Share Screen, later this month. 
Finally, today's update allows users to adjust the brightness of the PS5 power indicator. Simply go to Settings, then Beep and Light, and then Brightness. 


For more, read about the last big PS5 update that added Dolby Atmos, larger SSD capacity, and more to the console, and then check out this story about a retailer listing of a "V2 DualSense" with a 12-hour battery life. After that, read about how the PS5 surpassed 50 million units in December, and then check out Game Informer's top 10 PS5 games to play right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stealth games in which you can become "one with the shadows" cover a wide range, though I guess spectrum is the more appropriate word here. You've got sober infiltration games like Thief, which metes out gradations of light and dark with the care of somebody calculating their tax expenses, and stylised affairs such as Mark Of The Ninja, in which stepping into shadow desaturates you and sort of makes your character far too fancy for enemies to notice.
There are games such as Splinter Cell, in which hiding in shadows rests on a gentleman's agreement with NPCs not to perceive the big green torches attached to Sam Fisher's head. And then you have games like Ereban: Shadow Legacy, which has just been given a release date - 10th April. In this mystical third-person stealth-platformer, your character can literally disintegrate and travel through shadows as a ripple of dark energy - a transformation that puts me in mind less of Thief than of squid-mode in Nintendo's Splatoon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who is Jeff Minter? Unless you’re a long-term fan of his work, you might have asked that upon hearing about Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story, the latest interactive documentary from Digital Eclipse (following on from The Making Of Karateka and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration). You might have heard Minter’s name in connection with the remake of the unreleased Atari arcade game Akka Arrh in 2023. Maybe you played his mind-warping shooter Polybius in VR. You might remember as far back as the Atari Jaguar and Minter’s phenomenal Tempest 2000, the unexpected highlight of the console’s library. Or perhaps you recall his work from the 8-bit glory days. You could just know him from the daily videos of him feeding his sheep on YouTube.


The point is that Jeff Minter has been making games for a phenomenally long time – more than 40 years, in fact. And in all that time, he has stayed true to what he believes in. “One of the things we say in the game itself is the idea of him being the last indie developer,” says Chris Kohler, editorial director at Digital Eclipse in California. “The last of the people from the early 80s who very consciously never sold out, never took the money, never looked to expand or do anything other than [be] just Jeff at his computer, making the sorts of video games that he wants to make.”

Draw from enough unique inspirations, and eventually, a game begins to feel entirely novel. That’s the sensation that emerges as you play Unicorn Overlord, Vanillaware’s vast fantasy adventure of tactics, strategy, and storytelling. I was consistently reminded of other systems and mechanics from prior genre releases, but the resulting combination felt consistently original and entertaining, even after many hours of battle and exploration.

A court in Barcelona has indeed authorized LaLiga to obtain the identities of subscribers at five major ISPs, but if our reading of court documents is accurate, LaLiga hasn't identified any, even by their IP addresses. As unlikely as it may sound, LaLiga may have no evidence that any subscriber did anything wrong, so ISPs have been instructed to find some.

Originally released on PC on May 30, 2023, Night Dive and publisher Prime Matter revealed today that System Shock hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on May 21, just shy of the game's one-year anniversary. 
This reveal comes by way of a new trailer over at IGN, which teases some of the sci-fi horror and first-person shooting players can expect in the game. Check it out for yourself below in the System Shock consoles release date trailer: 


The remake today is in great shape on PC, and players should expect a well-made retread of the classic game. This remake had been in the works for years before its PC release last year – check out the game in a pre-alpha state in 2016 here.

        <id>122256</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/12/final-fantasy-xs-theme-song-to-zanarkand-wasnt-originally-intended-for-the-game"/>
        <updated>2024-03-12T16:25:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you ask any Final Fantasy fan what their top five favorite songs in the franchise are, there's a 99 percent chance one of them is "To Zanarkand" from Final Fantasy X. However, it turns out, it wasn't originally intended for the game. 
This news comes from Audrey (aitaikimochi on X, formerly Twitter), a mega Final Fantasy fan, Twitch streamer, and CEO of Aitai Japan Inc., who translated a recent interview between Weekly Ochiai and Final Fantasy X composer Nobuo Uematsu, whose credits also include One-Winged Angel and Aerith's Theme from Final Fantasy VII and so much more. In that interview, Uematsu revealed "To Zanarkand" originally began as a piece for a French flute player, meant to be played during a recital. 


"'To Zanarkand' was actually not meant to be the theme for Final Fantasy X," Uematsu tells Weekly Ochiai, as translated by Audrey on X. "There was a flute player from France who originally asked me to write a song for them to play during a recital. When I wrote the piece, I thought perhaps this sounded a bit too sad for a recital. So I set it aside for the time being. 
"Sometime after, when I was making the score of Final Fantasy X, I was falling behind all the while the producers were hounding me. So since that flute piece was unused, I just kind of meekly handed it to them. They listened to it and said, 'Yes! This is brilliant!'" 
In retrospect, it's wild "To Zanarkand" wasn't originally composed by Uematsu for Final Fantasy X because it fits the game's themes so well, nailing the somber and sad tone present throughout Tidus and Yuna's journey in Spira. 
For more about Final Fantasy music, read Game Informer's exclusive four-part series on composer Masayoshi Soken's score for last year's Final Fantasy XVI:
Part 1: Creating The Prelude
Part 2: The Victory Fanfare
Part 3: Finding A Main Theme
Part 4: The Sound
After that, read Game Informer's review of Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster.

This news comes from a recent notice to investors that explains board member Juergen Goeldner is taking over as interim CEO in the meantime, as reported by GameDeveloper. 
While Starbreeze's messaging around Sjögren's leave isn't super clear – the team simply says it is bidding farewell to the former CEO – today's news arrives after Payday 3 failed to meet expectations, according to GameDeveloper. 


"On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to thank Tobias Sjögren for his achievements during the past three years," board chairman Torgny Hellström writes in the notice to investors. "Tobias took over the helm of Starbreeze in a challenging phase of its journey and we wish him well in his future endeavors."
Goeldner, the new interim CEO, adds, "Starbreeze has a strong history of developing and publishing games globally. After launching Payday 3, the company is well-positioned to leverage the strengths of the organization to monetize and develop the IP portfolio. I am looking forward to assuming an operative position and, together with the management, ensure the execution of this strategy."
Goeldner has 40 years of experience in the games industry, including several executive positions, according to the notice. His last executive position was as CEO of Focus Home Interactive. He has been a member of Starbreeze's board of directors since last year. Starbreeze has initiated a recruitment process for a permanent CEO. 


Payday 3 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 21. We enjoyed the game around launch, giving it an 8 out of 10 in the Game Informer Payday 3 review. More than 3 million people played Payday 3 in its first month, but the game still failed to meet the expectations of the studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moon Studios co-founder and tech and production director Gennadiy Korol has revealed the team's upcoming action-RPG, No Rest for the Wicked, which is also the game on Game Informer's cover this month, will not require an online connection to play single-player. Although, if you've read our cover story about the game, you already know this, and you also know you can play the game with up to three friends on a shared living server.
What's more, Korol says the game will feature "a rich Offline Mode" for those not interested in the game's multiplayer elements.


Korol announced this today on X (formerly Twitter), expanding on Moon's thoughts about No Rest for the Wicked as both a single-player and multiplayer game. 
"Even though Wicked was built from the ground up with multiplayer in mind, we did not want offline-play to feel like a second thought and we want people to be able to play on the go when connection quality is not always ideal," Korol writes. "Our April 18th [Early Access launch on PC] will focus on the single player experience and we will be sharing more details about the Multiplayer aspect of the game later in our Early Access campaign." 


Game Informer has played hours of No Rest for the Wicked, so far only in single-player, and it's been a blast. You can read our preview thoughts on the game's opening hours here, and you can watch it for yourself in our No Rest for the Wicked New Gameplay Today.
Read about No Rest for the Wicked's early access roadmap and Cerim's Crucible endgame content after that, and for even more exclusive content, head to Game Informer's No Rest for the Wicked coverage hub.

The developers have also lowered the health of the Charger’s head, allowing for instant takedowns with a Recoilless Rifle or EAT-17, without (in theory) entirely doing away with the community’s treasured "leg meta", which sees players blasting the juggernaut’s limbs to sabotage it.

In the early 2000s, tennis video games were everywhere. Whether you were talking mass-appeal titles like Virtua Tennis and Mario Tennis or more niche, lower-budget games like Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament and Hard Hitter Tennis, the market was absolutely flooded with choices. One of the most beloved of this era was 2003's Top Spin, which started as an Xbox exclusive before making the leap to PS2 and PC in subsequent years. Since that inaugural game, Top Spin has seen three more numbered entries, all receiving high review scores.

The developers have weighed in on this front, commenting that strictly speaking, Helldivers 2 doesn't support stealth at all. It's just designed in an "agnostic", systems-first way and this in itself makes stealth a possibility. It's also a quiet attempt to capture something of the intricacy of a full-blown military simulator, while still being a very "arcadey" game at heart, which owes a little to Arrowhead's own collective time in the military.

That’s going by recent comments by producer Naoki Yoshida, who also suggested we can expect a demo before it’s out - which should also be a good chance to test your rig against its apparently hefty hardware requirements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn't really know anything about Moomins going into adventure game Snufkin: Melody Of Moominvalley, besides that their heads always looked palatable to me - like bleached kidney beans. Plus the Moomin merch I'd seen over the years in official Moomin shops or the odd gift store was delightful, so if someone had rocked up with a pencil case adorned with Moomin heads back in school, you bet I would've been jealous.
And having finished the game, I'm unsure whether I've truly learned any more about the Moomins and their friends. But then again, I've come away thinking that it's a pleasant universe to spend a few hours in, where the wild is celebrated with rebellious song. If you're after the video game equivalent of a walk through the woods on a warm afternoon, Moominvalley is the place to wander.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MultiVersus, the Warner Bros. free-to-play crossover platform fighter, makes its big comeback on May 28. The game has been rebuilt and returns almost a year after its open beta was taken offline.
Player First Games game director Tony Huynh explains in a developer diary that MultiVersus has been remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, meaning it sports improved visuals and lighting. It also has a totally revamped netcode to provide what Huynh promises will be consistent online performance regardless of platform.
Every existing fighter sports new attacks and combat mechanics, and Huynh promises that new fighters are on the way. Additionally, new stages were teased with concept art depicting arenas based on The Powerpuff Girls’ Townsville and Dexter’s Laboratory.
Lastly, Huynh reveals a brand-new PvE mode is coming to the game. He doesn’t go into detail, only teasing it will offer “additional ways of playing with unique rewards.” 


MultiVersus was first launched in open beta last May and pits characters across Warner Bros. stable of IPs, such as DC, Looney Tunes, and even Game of Thrones, in a tag-team-focused twist of Super Smash Bros. inspired combat. The game was initially quite popular and generally well-liked. Writer Bryan Vore gave the game’s beta incarnation an 8 out of 10 in our review, writing that “Living games have the potential to go in frustrating directions, but MultiVersus has a strong foundation. If it can meaningfully roll out content and smooth out its rough edges, this could become a new crossover obsession for years to come.” 
Unfortunately, months of infrequent updates and lack of communication following the game’s second season saw engagement decline. Player First Games pulled MultiVersus from stores to address these criticisms. When the game returns, it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
Are you looking forward to jumping back into the new and improved MultiVersus? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

However, during last September's Nintendo Direct, we learned that this well-liked sequel is making the leap to Switch as Luigi's Mansion 2 HD, joining the third entry in the hybrid console's catalog. Today, Nintendo announced that Luigi and his Poltergust 5000 will return to Switch in June.
When it arrived on 3DS in 2013, it received strong review scores, including an 8.5 from Game Informer. This sequel actually involves the younger Mario Bro visiting a series of mansions to capture ghosts and rescue Mario from King Boo. You can see the reveal trailer for Luigi's Mansion 2 HD below.


Luigi's Mansion 2 HD arrives on Nintendo Switch on June 27. If you just can't wait to bust ghosts as Mario's brother, be sure to check out Luigi's Mansion 3, which is perhaps one of the most underrated first-party games on Switch. You can read our review of Luigi's Mansion 3 here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming off last year's overwhelming success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Nintendo and Illumination have announced that work has begun on a second movie set in the world of Super Mario Bros. The announcement, made by Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri, states that this film will arrive in theaters in the United States on April 3, 2026.
While the announcement stops short of calling this "Super Mario Bros. 2" or even referring to it as a sequel, Miyamoto confirms that Nintendo and Illumination are working together on this one, and the director duo of the first film, Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, are returning. "As for the details of the new movie, as I often say, we'll let you know once we're at the stage where we're ready to share more," Miyamoto said in the announcement video posted on Nintendo of America's YouTube channel. "This time, we're thinking about broadening Mario's world further and it'll have a bright and fun story. We hope you'll look forward to it!"
The Super Mario Bros. Movie stars Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, and Seth Rogen. Nintendo and Illumination have yet to confirm any of the cast of this new film set in the Super Mario Bros. world. The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrived in theaters on April 5, 2023 to positive fan and critic reception, and earned a place among the highest-grossing films of all time. The new film set in this same world is set to arrive almost exactly three years later on April 3, 2026.
What do you want to see from a new Super Mario Bros. animated movie? Do you think it'll be another wide cast film? Or will it zero in on a specific subset of characters, like a Luigi's Mansion or Donkey Kong Country movie?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.
The program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.
Like last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.
ScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.
We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.
Based on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.
Looking forward to hearing from you!

Soundodger+ and Fist Puncher are both due to vanish, following in the footsteps of puzzle game Small Radios Big Televisions, whose developer announced its imminent delisting earlier this week and released the game for free in response.

Well, allow us both to be reminded of something from over a decade ago, because the Watch Dogs film is still apparently A Thing. It’s more of A Thing now, too, because it has actual names attached rather than just a corporation’s vague “excitement” about licensing out its IP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While speaking to Final Fantasy XVI producer Naoki Yoshida in Square Enix's Tokyo, Japan, offices last year for Game Informer's cover story on the game, he told me there was currently no plans for DLC. However, a few months after the game's June release during The Game Awards 2023, Square Enix revealed FFXVI would be getting two DLCs. 
The first – Echoes of the Fallen – was a combat-centric DLC released that same night. The second – The Rising Tide – is a more expansive, story-focused DLC about the Leviathan Eikon curiously missing from the main game. While we still don't know when to expect The Rising Tide other than this spring, I spoke to Yoshida and DLC director Takeo Kujiraoka about what players can expect and more, and you can read about that in my preview here.

That doesn't mean, though, that I don't appreciate something light and simple now and then. In fact, Minami Lane might barely qualify as a management game by some standards.
There's no real pressure, no chance of failure, and its limit of a handful of levels lasting perhaps three or four hours just about taps it out. But sometimes such limitations are intentional, and exactly what you want from a game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm beginning to think we should bury Vampire: The Masquerade back in the forsaken graveyard where it was originally dug up, or at least banish the toothy reprobate back to its pen & paper castle. I don't know how White Wolf's RPG is viewed in the land of table tops these days, but here in computerville it has delivered exactly one good video game in the last 25 years (and don't come gibbering to me about 2022's Swansong, it wasn't fit to polish Bloodlines' fangs). Sure, Bloodlines 2 might prove a winner, but given years of delays and a developer change, I'll believe it when I see it.
Which brings us to Vampire: The Masquerade - Justice, the beleaguered series' first prowl through the rain-slick streets of VR. In theory, this should be exactly my cup of haemoglobin; a gothic, linear stealth game where you use your vampire powers to sneak across the rooftops of Venice. In its mechanics and design, Justice aspires to be a cut down version of Dishonored. Unfortunately, it's in the cutting down where most of its problems arise. It's too cramped, too basic, and too fuzzy around the edges, and the whole experience ends up being a bit mid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Famed manga artist and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama has passed away. He was 68.
The news was broken early this morning in a public letter by Toriyama's manga studio, Bird Studio. Bird revealed in a letter posted on the official Dragon Ball X account that Toriyama died on March 1 of acute subdural hematoma. A private funeral service was held, and the studio has asked fans to respect the privacy of Toriyama's family. You can read the full letter below.

March 8, 2024
Akira Toriyama was born in 1955 and became a manga artist at 23. Primarily known for his works in Weekly Shōnen Jump for works such as Dr. Slump, his biggest claim to fame would be Dragon Ball. First published in 1983, Dragon Ball would explode into a cultural phenomenon, spawning a massively popular multimedia franchise with multiple manga volumes, a successful long-running anime, several films, and a litany of merchandise. Dragon Ball has become one of the most influential mangas of all time and would also become a massive fixture in video games, with dozens of titles across a variety of platforms. 
Upcoming games based on Toryiama’s work include Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, the next entry in the Budakai Tenkaichi series, and Sand Land, an action RPG launching on April 26 based on his 2000 manga. 
Toryiama would also lend his distinct art style to video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger, and Blue Dragon. Six years ago, Game Informer editors current and former got together to talk about Toriyama's influence on the game industry. You can watch that video here.
Game Informer extends its condolences to Toriyama’s family and loved ones.]]></summary>

Is Dune appropriative? Is the appropriation the point? Whatever the case, Funcom want you to know that their upcoming survival game Dune: Awakening has nothing to do with any of that, posting a short Xeet from the official Awakening account that's the written equivalent of sticking your arms straight out, waving your hands, and going "Woahwoahwoah, hang on a minute."
"We agree that religion is an integral part of the Dune universe. This is why in Dune: Awakening you will meet and interact with people of different religions along your journey. However, as opposed to the story presented in the books, the player is not a messiah and will not play a major role in any of them. Leading people on a holy war is not why you arrive on Arrakis," reads the post in full. Personally, I approve of this effort to keep games apolitical. Politics? In my Dune. No thank you. I am of course being facetious. There is still religion and politics in Dune: Awakening, as confirmed by the statement, but you yourself aren't doing much of it.

Final Fantasy XVI, the latest wholly new single-player installment in one of gaming’s most storied franchises, is nearing its first anniversary this June.

Announced at The Game Awards back in December alongside the reveal and shadow drop of Echoes of the Fallen, The Rising Tide features Leviathan, the water Eikon mysteriously absent from the main game’s events.

Sometimes, a great idea can come from a simple premise. That’s how Son and Bone, the next game from TeamKill Media, the studio behind last year’s Quantum Error, came to be: a first-person shooter where you kill dinosaurs. Inspired by the dormant Turok series, TeamKill’s lead developer Micah Jones remarks about a joke the studio’s fans have made since the reveal of its dinosaur shooter at the top of the year. “They say, ‘If other game companies won’t do it, these developers will,’” Jones says, explaining that everyone on the team is a big fan of the Turok series.
After watching roughly 10 minutes of new Son and Bone gameplay, the Turok inspiration is…]]></summary>

EA has made these classics and more, and for some reason The Saboteur, available on Steam for the first time. You can see the full list of games here. I don't have anything specific against The Saboteur, but I do think it's very funny that the list goes, like, "beloved game from the 90s, beloved game from the 90s, 7/10 action game from 2009, beloved game from the 90s". Also, I can take the opportunity to make fun of Graham and James, the tallest wrongest boys at RPS, who apparently both liked it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma series director Hideaki Itsuno has announced that the meat you can cook over campfires in Dragon's Dogma 2 is, in fact, "real meat". There's been a certain amount of PlayStation-instigated speculation about whether the meat is CGI-generated, following the last round of Dragon's Dogma 2 previews. Speaking to Japanese site 4Gamer, as translated by Automaton, Itsuno revealed that the game's scenes of sizzling flesh are derived from live action film of steaks being grilled - partly for the sake of authenticity, and partly to save money versus creating computer models of meat products. You can cook several types of meat in Dragon's Dogma, each of which has its own cutscene, and a number of Dragon's Dogmatists are already performatively salivating at the prospect on social media.

First up, we dive deep into our most recent cover story for No Rest for the Wicked, talk a bit about how realistic and nauseating the driving is in Pacific Drive, learn about WWE 2K24, and prepare for the impending Moomin invasion. We also mop up on some games like Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth and Penny's Big Breakaway before Suriel shares details about the game he has been working on, Merchants of Rosewall. And we finish out the show by answering some reader questions.

After three earlier setbacks, the movie companies are now seeking a 'de novo' review of their quest to obtain the IP-addresses of Redditors who posted piracy-related comments on the platform. Reddit objects to the request, stressing its users' First Amendment right to anonymous speech should not be interfered with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the sillier aspects of the original Dragon's Dogma was accidentally falling head over heels for some rando innkeeper, and having them appear beside you as your sweetheart during the ending scenes, much to the surprise of many players who didn't realise they were hitting on every NPC they did a favour for. 


The game's Affinity system saw NPCs organically forming an attachment to players when you interacted with them, gave them things or carried out tasks for them. Towards the conclusion, one NPC is selected as "Beloved" and promptly abducted by a dragon for you to quest forth and rescue. There are a few characters who are positioned more obviously as romanceables, but the brilliance of the system is that you can raise your Affinity with pretty much anybody. If you want to finish the game staring passionately into the eyes of the court jester or that hearty bloke who runs the armour shop, it's within your power.

Discovery has decided to "retire" 2016's noodling around puzzle game Small Radios Big Televisions - meaning it'll disappear off storefronts in the next 60 days. Developer Owen Deery revealed this news on Xitter a couple of days ago, simultaneously announcing that the game is now free to download. Deery also noted you can buy the synthy soundtrack to show support.

Your shopping basket from the Steam store is now shared between devices, so if you put something in there on browser you can finish it up on your Steam Deck. But, more importantly, you can now hide single, selected games from your library, so your friends can't see when you're playing them - or even that you own them. Obviously the first thing that comes to mind is that this could usher in a new dawn of secret perverts able to hide their embarrassing 3D sex games, but are there other use cases for it? We discuss on this week's podcast. Plus: we've been playing current games! Cheese! And some more booze recommendations from James!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zoria: Age Of Shattering speedruns its fantasy RPG origin story in a quick cutscene montage at the start, so we might as well get that out of the way first, too. Low fantasy world, two warring kingdoms, one uses necromancy (this is cast as bad and cheating rather than practical, for some reason) to comprehensively gain the upper hand, and everything is named like a bunch of Scrabble letters were thrown randomly on the table. You play Elion war hero Captain Witherel - gender and class TBD by the player - in a small group making a final stand at the fortress Daeg Marastir, which is being overrun by the nefarious Izirian army. We start in media bellum, as it were.
This first stage, where you escape the fortress, gives you a whistle-stop tour of the main systems in the game. You control a squad of four, the combat is turn-based, you can pitch camp at any time to rest and heal up, and there are crafting systems for potions, food and gear. Zoria isn't really remaking the wheel as much as it is taking spokes from a bunch of other fantasy RPGs you like, and the result is the terrier of RPGs. Small, clearly has a lot of different DNA knocking around in there, and punches above its weight, but it's a bit scrappy and sometimes it's knees dislocate and it falls over. This terrier was made by three people, so that is sort of to be expected.

Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.]]></summary>
