        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a lot to discover on the expansive grounds of Botany Manor, and you'll soon be able to do so on Sony's platforms. Publisher Whitethorn Games announced plans to bring Balloon Studios' puzzler to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on December 17, 2024. 


There's nothing unique to the consoles to keep an eye out for with this release, but at the very least it offers another way to explore this quaint and thoughtful little gem. Check out a brief look at the PS4 and PS5 versions in the announcement video below.




Botany Manor first opened its gates on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC (Steam) on April 9. It's also available via Game Pass for any subscribers who want to give it a quick go as part of their membership. 


For those who haven't done so yet, Botany Manor follows retired botanist Arabella Greene. Thanks to her storied career, she now has a large collection of rare, and in some cases forgotten, plants. It's up to you to explore the manor, dig through Arabella's notes, and find out the right way to ensure their growth and continued survival. 


Botany Manor isn't just about bringing a bunch of plants back to life. Well, that's a large part of it, but it also hinges on learning more about Arabella's experiences as a woman scientist in the 19th century. You'll be able to piece together her life and what she went through, all while gathering the clues necessary to help the manor's many plants thrive. If you love plants but have the polar opposite of a green thumb, this is your ideal escape.

One of the candidates is LOCKED, with a lot of content to explore, from flows to traits and weapons. To learn more, check out the official LOCKED Trello link and also join the game's Discord.

What is the LOCKED Trello Link?


With so much ground to cover on the soccer field, you'll need more information about the most important mechanics in the game. The LOCKED Trello board is a great place to start, as you'll find flow types like Vines or Demon Wings here. On the other hand, if you're looking for free rewards, visit our LOCKED codes page.


How to use LOCKED Trello

The best way to use Trello is to keep it on the second screen while you play so you can make the right choice in-game. I love always having Trello open, especially for the game controls. But if you're looking for something specific, accessing Trello via PC is the best option. You can easily find what you need using the F key to filter cards. 


What is the LOCKED Discord Link?


There's no better place than the LOCKED Discord server when you need to talk to other players or have questions for developers. One of the channels to visit is #announcements, where you'll find the latest news about the game development. The next step is to head to the #updates channel for more details about new content. Other useful channels are #league-rules, #giveaways, and #general.

Download the Discord app and create an account to access the LOCKED Discord server. After the verification process, you will be able to join all channels. The PC version is the way to go, as exploring content is more comfortable.

It feels like it has been a long old time since we heard about Misc. A Tiny Tale. We've been keeping an eye on this delightful-looking 3D platformer since it was initially slated for a 2022 Switch release, and now, thanks to an adorable new trailer (via IGN), it looks like 2025 will finally be the year we get our hands on it.
For those who missed the initial announcement (or if you haven't checked out the above trailer yet), Misc. is a classic 3D platformer that will see you playing as an adorable tiny robot, embarking on a collectathon journey through a giant garden world. It looks like developer Tinyware Games has been inspired by the genre's biggest hitters like Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie, but there's more than a little Chibi-Robo thrown in there too — just look at that cute little fella!

Planet Coaster 2 wants to do that again, but this time adds water parks into the mix, with slides to design, pools to plop down, and raft rides that you can click together to form ambitiously speedy spirals. You can feel some creative pride when you look down on the watery wonderland you've made with these tools. But you may also wonder if it was worth the effort. As a newcomer to Planet management games, I've found this slippy sequel fiddly, cumbersome, and poorly explained.

The tier list above is made based on the overall strength of each flow in META LOCK. Keep in mind that some flows work better with corresponding weapons, a great example being the Genius flow + Genius weapon combo. My recommendation would be to first roll for the weapon you want to play with and then decide on the best flow to go with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The wait is finally over.
A few years ago, Square Enix announced it would be doing a remake of Dragon Quest III in its popular HD-2D engine, but this was then followed by a lengthy period of radio silence where its development status seemed uncertain. While they were at it, the developers decided to go ahead and remake the first and second Dragon Quests, too. Now that Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is finally here, we’re happy to report that the wait has been well worth it. Though it isn’t without drawbacks, this is easily the most feature-rich and enjoyable version of Dragon Quest III available.
Released in Japan in 1988, Dragon Quest III hails from a much simpler era, so the narrative is considerably less detailed than one you may find in a title from subsequent decades. You begin as a nameless warrior, the child of a once-legendary hero, now called upon to take up your father’s mantle and save the world from the threat of an evil dark lord. There’s not much character development to speak of, nor narrative depth—your character is essentially a blank slate and your party members are basically animated cardboard cutouts with some stats and gear attached. Though there are ultimately some clever tie-ins to other releases in the series and some new cutscenes to flesh out your father’s role, the plot amounts to little more than 'there’s a bad dude out there; go get him!'

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake's premise is bluntly, delightfully simple. The Archfiend Baramos, as evil as he is mysterious, is up and about. He’s got ill designs on the world. Your Dad tried to stop him, and he died. He fell into a volcano. We absolutely can’t be having that.
This is, more than anything else, a game about Going On An Adventure. Well walked ground, of course, but it’s rare to see it embarked upon with such barefaced delight, or such a wholehearted commitment to going the distance. It is a very big and a very simple RPG that is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a pond; a game to curl up with and play lazily and—with some sour caveats—enjoyably, for an entire winter.

This follows an earlier 1.04% reduction in October, a move which came soon after reports to the contrary suggesting the sovereign wealth fund was seeking to increase rather than decrease its Nintendo stakehold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video games turning into board games is hardly anything new, but you love to see it when it's one of your favorite franchises. Shin Megami Tensei is next to get a board game adaptation, and it's available on Kickstarter. Currently, it stands at over double its original asking goal of around $200,000, and it only started today.


The board game isn't modeled after any one particular SMT game, but rather the general idea. If you're unfamiliar with the series, each game is a stand-alone story. They always center around a war between the forces of Law and Chaos, represented by various deities from across the world. Players travel to a devastated Tokyo recruiting demons to fight for the future of humanity. The latest title, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance, was released earlier this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Em and Snoop had their time in the spotlight these past few weeks. It’s time for Ice Spice to be at the front of the stage and show out in Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix. Many fans eager to get her skin will wonder how to get it, so here’s everything you need to know.


How to get Ice Spice in Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix


To get the Ice Spice or Rap Princess skin in Fortnite, she will be available in the Shop for V-Bucks. Prices should be similar to those of Eminem’s and Snoop’s skins, so expect prices to be as follows:



Ice Spice and Rap Princess outfits: 1,500 V-Bucks each


Emote: 500 V-Bucks


Jam Tracks: 500 V-Bucks


Microphone / Pickaxe: 800 V-Bucks



Like the other two rappers, Ice Spice should also have a discounted bundle with all of her accessories. It’ll most likely also include the tracks used in the Fortnite Festival mode.


Her skin and all accessories will be available starting November 14, 2024, at 4 PM PST / 6 PM CST. Check the times based on your area as they can slightly differ.

How to get Ice Spice’s weapons in Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix


To get Ice Spice’s Grappler or her Mythic weapon, you’ll have to defeat her at her dedicated POI called Ice Isle. It’ll take place where Shark Island is. 


The location will be decked out in Y2K decorations and obviously scream Ice Spice. When the update goes live for Week 3, this area is going to be packed with fans, people doing any quests pertaining to the area, and people wanting the new gear.


Will Ice Spice be available after the event?


Ice Spice may be made available after Chapter 2 Remix concludes, but don’t count on it being anytime soon. If you really want to cop her skin to use in a later season of the game, don’t hesitate, or at least get a skin and not the whole bundle.

Back in July, Nintendo dished out a handful of lawsuits in its continued clampdown on Switch piracy. Four months on, one of these legal claims has come back as another win for Nintendo after the defendant failed to plead or otherwise respond within the court's given time.
The case in question was against James 'Archbox' Williams, the lead moderator of the r/SwitchPirates subreddit, who Nintendo accused of offering "massive libraries of pirated Nintendo Switch games" via several "pirate shops".

To put this into perspective, as a game ages and PC technology changes and advances, compatibility is often lost. An older game may not have support for higher resolution monitors, game controllers, or even operating systems. Some shaders that were used decades ago might not look right, or new bugs may crop up on newer drivers. A lot of the time, fans need to step in to create fixes or patches to keep these games running on new machines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If EA FC 25 rumors are to be believed, Track Stars is going to be the next promo, and we already have the first set of leaks doing the rounds on social media.


Like the previously released Total Rush promo, Track Stars will make its debut in this year's Ultimate Team. As of writing, it's not clear if the upcoming campaign will be a one or two-week affair. Nevertheless, a new campaign is always exciting, and there could be some amazing cards to find in the packs.


EA FC 25 Track Stars player leaks


There haven't been too many leaks so far, but there's an indication that Track Stars will have a new version of Heroes. So far, we have had the base versions of Heroes that can be found in the packs. The Track Stars variant could be quite popular, but it will depend on which footballers are going to be present in it.


So far, these are the names that have been leaked to appear in the upcoming campaign.



Theo Hernandez


Lucio


DaMarcus Beasley



Out of the names leaked so far, Beasley is rumored to appear as a SBC. This will be great news for those who don't want to rely on pack luck. A SBC makes it possible for all to obtain the card, but it will largely depend on the completion cost of the challenge.


More names are expected to be leaked as the release date comes closer.


EA FC 25 Track Stars release date


Unless there's any significant change in the schedule, Centurions will be a one-week affair. In simpler words, the currently available cards will be removed from the packs on Friday, November 15. Track Stars will be a direct replacement for the Centurions promo, and it could light up Ultimate Team right before Black Friday celebrations kick in.


It will be interesting to see which footballers eventually make it to the promo, and how their special cards will look like in terms of stats and playstyles.

It’s deeply imperfect and willfully obtuse, but also absolutely fascinating. I’ll ground you with a slightly wonky and dull allusion to Cultist Simulator, then guide you through in more or less the order I experienced it.

Last year, the Lego universe expanded a bit more outside of the box with cart-racer Lego 2K Drive and the open-world survival Minecraft-like Lego Fortnite. But the next chapter in the Lego universe, Lego Horizon Adventures, is a bit outside the normal Lego formula.


While previous action-adventure Lego games have taken place inside the worlds of legendary movie franchises (Star Wars, Marvel, Jurassic World, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, etc.) Lego Horizon Adventures is unique in that it serves as an abridged reinterpretation of the original Horizon Zero Dawn.

This doesn’t make too much sense now I think about it, but such things rarely do. A more accurate jab, in hindsight, might have been "you been running S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl at full specs or something?", because based on the upcoming FPS’s new system requirements, you’re going to need a reasonably laissez-faire attitude to literally any other concern in your life that doesn’t involve acquiring a notably juice-guzzling rig.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The studio behind sunny third-person adventure Rime and time loop murder mystery The Sexy Brutale has filed for insolvency, with the heads of the studio quitting their roles. Tequila Works had their funding from Tencent pulled at some point, according to Eurogamer Spain, leaving the company without an important flow of cash. Which may explain why they cancelled a game last month and laid off some of their workers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[STALKER 2 Heart of Chernobyl is going live on November 20 (unless there are any last-minute delays), and the upcoming title is already available for pre-download on specific platforms.


Developers GSC Game World have revealed plenty of important information surrounding the technical side of things. This includes more data on the system requirements, which will be vital for PC players before they purchase their copy. If you're on the Xbox and have access to the Game Pass or bought a copy, you can download the full game a week before the official launch.


STALKER 2 Heart of Chernobyl file size on Xbox


The pre-download for STALKER 2 Heart of Chernobyl went live on Xbox on November 12, and it stands at a staggering 146 GB. This is the same for users on both Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X, so you'll need to clear plenty of space to download all the files.


You can pre-download the file regardless of whether you purchased a standalone copy or are a member of the Xbox Game Pass. The new STALKER title will be a day-one entrant to the Xbox Game Pass. Subscribers won't have to pay any additional money to enjoy the game on the very first day.

While I have yet to test out the download system on Steam, the game can be pre-downloaded via the Xbox PC app. All you have to do is search for the game and start the download. On PC, the file size is set at 150 GB. It's likely going to remain the same if you purchase your copy on Steam.


While it's preferable to download the game on your SSD, you may also choose to install it on your HDD. Either way, it's going to occupy a lot of space, far more than other recent releases like Call of Duty Black Ops 6.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether or not you side with Technikki to turn Shipshape Island into an airship or Adaphne to turn it into a submarine, you’ll need to borrow something from Bowser. An airship engine, to be precise.


I’m going to be honest here, this is probably the only time in the game I got snagged. Reviewing a game early means I don’t have access to guides to get unstuck, so I did circles for a while to figure this out. The solution is something that might be obvious to you, I might have even missed a subtle hint spouted by a character, but it left me temporarily flummoxed, so you can learn from my mistakes.


You may have seen the airship engine on your first visit to Wayaway Island. When you enter Bowser’s store room to get the ampberries, the engine can be seen on the other side of a barrier. I want you to forget that you saw that, because it’s very misleading.


My first course of action was to return to that room, then find the way into it based on its layout. However, if you check where the door is and make the assumption that the entrance is on the same floor, you’re not going to find it. You don’t need to backtrack through Bowser’s Castle on Wayaway Island. In fact, in order to get to the airship engine, you don’t need to go back through Bowser’s Castle at all.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Instead, before you would enter the castle the usual way, instead go east down the path that runs in front of Bowser’s Castle. Along this way, you’ll find the back door. In there, you’ll need to use a Bros. Bomb (Ice/Fire charged attack) to break the boulder in the way. You can now proceed onward.


From there, it’s a bit of a tricky labyrinth to get to the storage room. It’s mostly skill-based, and it’s a straight shot to your destination. A pretty big relief if you had trouble finding where you were supposed to go in the first place.

I've banged the Minish Cap drum so many times by this point that my adoration for Link's littlest adventure is old news. With today marking 20 years since this GBA gem landed in Europe, it felt too easy to sit down at my desk and gush over the tight six-dungeon structure, the brilliant puzzle design or the somehow still under-discussed soundtrack. I've been rambling on about these for the past two decades and a big birthday like this deserves something special.
It's obvious what we should do, really. Let's talk about the parts of the game that suuuuuck.

Usually, the PlayStation 5 version of FFXVI sells on Amazon for around $50, but it's currently available for just under $25, making it half-price and the cheapest it has ever been on the shopping site. There's no known end date for this flash price drop, but you should probably make the most of it and snap it up if you haven't already.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games has announced the return of Fortnite OG, a mode that rolls the game back to its original build — but this time, it's not going away after a month. Fortnite OG will be available again as a permanent addition on December 6, 2024. 


The news was confirmed by Epic Games today, following some recent rumors of the mode's return, in a message posted to X. 


"OG is coming BACK and is here to stay," the company wrote. "Relive Battle Royale from the start and explore the OG map, collect OG loot, and relive OG seasons. Drop back in on December 6."




Fortnite OG brings everything back to Chapter 1


Fortnite OG returns the game to Chapter 1, which launched way back in the long, long ago of 2017. Many of us were wee babes back then. Fortnite OG lets players re-experience the game on the original island map with classic weapons, loot, and more. Epic Games first launched Fortnite OG on November 3, 2023, allowing players to get all warm and nostalgic until the company ended the event on December 2. The OG version of the game came with a 50-level OG Pass and an OG Store with old-school cosmetics.


Longtime Fortnite fans have a lot to celebrate this holiday season. Fortnite OG is on the rebound, but it's rumored that Season 6 could also launch soon. While it's not confirmed, a new chapter in the Fortnite legacy along with the return of OG will make for a lot of happy fans who may soon have a lot less time. But I suppose 'tis the slaying season, right?

Fortnite OG broke records when it launched last year. According to Epic Games, 44.7 million players logged on for a trip down memory lane, making it the "biggest day in Fortnite's history." Will that number be surpassed next month? We only have a few weeks to find out.

Whether you and our friends are playing the game's box-standard multiplayer mode or using one of the many incredible mods fans have made to trick it out, you'll need passwords to explore the Land Between as a team.


Luckily, group passwords are much more than a way to join a group for cooperative multiplayer or PVP. Many Elden Ring group passwords significantly buff the number of Runes you get when you defeat one of the game's shard-bearing bosses. Some of these passwords give you a boost of up to 5%, so you and your friends could end up squeezing a few more level-ups out of the game's most epic bosses.


Specific passwords also come with other effects, including unique summon signs, varying amounts of bloodstains, and th…]]></summary>

The latest claim accuses Google of ignoring notices that aim to remove pirate IPTV providers from search results. So here's the thing: why would a company take down 10 billion URLs from search but suddenly start acting differently? The public labeling of Google as "grossly negligent" deserves context too; two weeks ago, Google's diligence prevented one of its accusers from deindexing its own website.

As a character, Yanagi is a lot more complex than most of the roster, but if you're interested in playing her at her highest potential, here's everything you need to know.


Best Yanagi Build in Zenless Zone Zero


Jumping right in, Yanagi is an Electric Anomaly character with a significant focus on Shock DoT (Damage over Time) and On-field damage. Thanks to her combo-heavy nature, Yanagi wants to be on the field as long as possible, while you still cycle through the rest of your team to apply buffs and debuffs as applicable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While it definitely wouldn't rank amongst the best console ads of all time, Sony just released a pretty cool new PlayStation ad on their YouTube channel featuring one of the best surprises we've gotten from Sony in a while. 




These ads are always cool to look at. This time we get a glimpse at what seems like PlayStation city, a place where PlayStation's famous triangle, circle, square and X replace the regular traffic signs in a way that somehow doesn't result in an accidental Carmageddon remake. We also see some buildings turning into the PlayStation's symbols, and it looks cool, but the best part comes right at the end, when it announces a price drop of $70 on the PS5 Slim Digital Edition.


The price reduction is yet to take effect on the PlayStation direct online story, so don't get too hasty on your acquisition. Still, Sony notes the promo will last until Christmas or while supplies last, so I hope you manage to find the perfect balance between the two.


Sure, the comments make sure to remind players about the dire reality of having to buy the stand separately, but you don't really need one to enjoy your games. While the notion of a console only getting a temporary price drop four years after its release date would've been laughable in any other gen of PlayStation, this is better than no Christmas miracle at all. This piece of news feels even better when you realize how, for the first time in a long while, scalpers' plans went awry as they stocked up on a bunch of PS5 Pros that nobody is buy at ridiculous prices and have since begun selling them at a loss.


You can now get the PS5's Slim Digital Edition for $379.99 until Christmas, or until supplies are depleted.

For many years, The Legend of Zelda fans have been asking Nintendo to make him speak with words in a game and, curiously enough, they almost got their wish in the most recent installment.


Per VGC, the director of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Satoshi Terada, and longtime producer of the franchise, Eiji Aonuma, recently did an interview with Famitsu in which they revealed several fascinating tidbits about the title's development. The one that immediately caught most people's attention was the unexpected revelation that they almost made Link speak since Zelda was the playable protagonist this time around.

With the Switch successor's long-awaited reveal planned for sometime before the clock strikes midnight on 31st March 2025, the current Switch is getting another holiday season to itself.
As part of Nintendo's six-month financial results presentation, company president Shuntaro Furukawa revealed that the upcoming console will be backwards compatible with Switch software, so anyone who's picked up a Switch in the last seven-and-a-half years — or anybody who goes for a bundle this holiday season — can rest easy in the knowledge that they'll still have access to their library (and their backlogs) on the new system.

This is a stunning achievement in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. modding, and may even open the door to co-operative play in sandbox-style mods like Anomaly or G.A.M.M.A. down the line (this is pure speculation on my part, please don't tell Grok I said that).

Where to find Luminaras in Once Human


Luminaras can be found in Ashenton. They are Elite enemies that spawn in three different places, so you can knock out your task in one go if you know where to go. The reason we're all struggling to find them is that it's another one of those naming issues in Once Human. The enemy you're actually looking for is called a Luna Moth in-game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solo Leveling is undeniably one of the most successful manhwa, receiving global acclaim. It has since received an anime adaptation, a game, and even an upcoming live-action adaptation. However, the series' story doesn't end. It continues in Solo Leveling: Ragnarok. After a long wait, the official English release is finally available to read on Tapas.


The platform released a teaser for the webcomic adaptation of Solo Leveling's sequel on October 28. It is also running a promotional event to celebrate the title's launch.


Solo Leveling: Ragnarok first came into being as a web novel penned by Daul, which was released in Korea in April 2023. It was then adapted into webcomic form by REDICE studio's JIN and Brix. The webcomic was first released in Korea on August 1.

Solo Leveling: Ragnarok's plot


Solo Leveling: Ragnarok follows the story of Sung Jinwoo's son, Sung Suho. With one of the Absolute Ones falling in Solo Leveling, the others are set to fill the empty position. However, their idea of filling it isn't of camaraderie. For them, the first to seize the power becomes its new owner. As such, monsters once again start spilling on Earth. This time, Suho must step up and fight dangers, all the while learning of his father's legendary past.


While the sequel may have only just been released, it isn't Suho's first time in the series. He appeared in Solo Leveling's special episodes wherein he was seen clearing a game-like dungeon architectured by his father and his shadows.

These Agents are essentially character skins, which can be purchased from the Steam Community Market. Each brings its own unique aesthetic to the server, and much like Counter-Strike 2 weapon skins, offers a new way to customize your inventory.


Some hardcore players swear off the use of Agents. They can give a free competitive advantage to the opponent, as they make it easier to identify players. Still, they remain very popular among the Counter-Strike 2 community.

First up, starting on 24th November 2024, several first-party Nintendo games will be discounted by $20 at select local retailers such as Best Buy, GameStop, Target and Walmart. These are some pretty big hitters, and would no doubt complement a new hardware purchase quite nicely.

Of course, the crux of the matter was the fancy new Steam Deck model. On that topic, Yang said "If we see similar interest, we would definitely be interested in looking into other color variations in the future," which is good news for collectors.

After the demise of AlphaDream, it seemed like a new entry in the Mario & Luigi saga became nothing more than a mere pipe dream. Thankfully, however, a new collaboration between Nintendo and Acquire has resulted in Mario & Luigi: Brothership, a game that stands as not only the first brand-new entry in the franchise in nearly a decade, but also the first proper home console release.
We rather enjoyed it, too. In our 9/10 review, we said it was "easily the best Mario & Luigi RPG yet" with strong combat mechanics, impressive world-building, and clever puzzle design. Here's the thing with opinions, though... They often differ, and Brothership in particular has proven to be somewhat divisive with a few outlets. Heck, many fans have even taken to social media to bemoan the tweaks applied to the game's battle system.

If you’re someone who is heavy on exploration, this shouldn’t be too much of a problem. You mostly just need to poke around the right Islet after you first start the quest. This happens through the normal course of the story, but if you visit the entrance to Wayaway Island early, it won’t be there. Or, at least, Mario and Luigi won’t know what they’re looking for and, therefore, can’t activate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My strongest and most enduring memory of Grand Theft Auto will always be creasing into complete hysterics watching my mate pile into a crumpled police officer with a wooden baseball bat in GTA 3 after school one time. Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a colon and a dash in the same game name.
If you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter's job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist? I hope he doesn’t read that last sentence. I don’t get my pellet if the syntax becomes too convoluted. Moving swiftly on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Legend Of The Zone.
The third and strongest instalment of GSC Game World's S.T.A.L.K.E.R. trilogy brings this excellent set of Switch remasters to a close. In some ways, it feels inaccurate to say Call of Prypiat is the best of the three because it so effectively capitalises on the groundwork laid by Shadow of Chornobyl, but it’s a brilliant, welcome return to atmospheric exploration and emergent horror, with a reduced focus on firefights.
An intro cinematic recaps the real and fictional events that led to the opening of the Zone’s mysterious centre. The military has enacted ‘Project Fairway’ to beat the other factions and reach the area first. Predictably, this doesn't go well and Major Alexander Degtyarev, an ex-Stalker, is sent to investigate crashed helicopters scattered across the Prypiat outskirts.

Two months on, a handful of the game's developers have sat down with the BBC to talk about these criticisms and attempt to explain the thought process behind them. And it'll come as no surprise that Nintendo has an optimistic spin to put on each.

That means 6v6 fights, the original abilities of its heroes, and no limits to stop the entire team picking the same character.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.
Notably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.
Your mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.
This modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.
Will you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!

The simplest answer is that’s it’s a recurring bit of levity, a holdover easter egg, elevated to the status of key mission item in Hitman: Codename 47 before being given pride of place as an explosive in the World Of Assassination games.

Navíc existuje od jádra 5.12 možnost PREEMPT_DYNAMIC, kdy je možné volbu nastavit jako parametr jádra. Bohužel na některých platformách (arm64) je to spojené se značnou dodatečnou režií, proto se nepoužívá.

It looks like they're focusing on the act of throwing capsular items to catch or release monsters, together with the usage of monsters as mounts.
If you've somehow yet to encounter Palworld, it's a bestselling survival game that takes hefty - some would say, scandalous - inspiration from Pokémon, with players poaching Pokésque critters using magic spheres, and deploying them as soldiers and minions.

There’s only one of the three characters available in the freebie (one of the others is a toad nun with a shotgun), but he’s got a little cutlass, a flintlock pistol, and a can-do attitude - at least when it comes to either stabbing or shooting things. The game itself is a little bit deckbuilder, a little bit Into The Breach: turn based strategy with perfect information and various tricks you can pull to make enemies hit each other instead of the thing you’re trying to protect. Indulge yourself on the gourmet tray-tray below.

Namely, Sega have been trying to trim down their European studios for the past year, and Amplitude is just the latest bunch of devs affected by that.

I haven't really thought about it before, but Rift Riff's effusively laidback crowd control has me pondering those optimal moments in any tower defender when the incoming horde hits the flamer-MG triangle just right, and you can settle back comfortably into the role of clockwatcher.
Rift Riff encourages this behaviour by being nice to look at. Created by a trio of developers including Hidden Folks designer Adriaan de Jongh, it's a world of spacey, sun-carved mountains, forests and monoliths. The towers resemble the sacred architecture of Monument Valley, and the colour scheme and general ambience remind me of Cocoon. There's a demo, if you fancy it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nostalgia, when you think about it, is bollocks. There has never been a better time than right this second – averaged out, and despite repeated attempts to the contrary, humanity has never been healthier, freer, or more enlightened by knowledge. It’s true of games too. For every by-committee platter of passionless map markers, there are thousands of more personal, more creative, more interesting works, all adding to the decades' worth of great stuff we can still play today.
What isn’t bollocks is the emotional pull that nostalgia, for all its lack of cold, hard reason, still manages to wield inside our warm, squishy brains. Hence, the centrepiece of Apex Legends’ Season 23 update is a mode that recreates the battle royale FPS as it was back in 2019, defaulting back to the original map and weapon arsenal while cutting the 26-strong legend roster to the earliest ten. It’s a Fortnite-style rolling back of the clock, and a passably enjoyable one, but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always that good.

Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival is out now via Steam, where it offers over 70 songs to drum through, and a subscription service through which to unlock over 700 more. Maybe I should try to get my Donkey Konga drums working on PC, but I'll probably settle for playing it with a gamepad.

"Why, that's a Mass Effect vessel. Some mistake here surely?" 1) My name's not Shirley, and 2) Indeed it is a Mass Effect ship, but HelloGames struck a time-limited deal with BioWare to create a version for their own space sim.
"Blast, if only I'd noticed this at the time and acquired one," you mourn. "Ah, so many years I have wasted." Be of good cheer, my friend, for No Man's Sky has a Normandy once again, just in time for the latest N7 Day of assorted Mass Effect celebrations. For the next two weeks, you'll be able to get a-hold of it by way of a revised version of 2021's Beachhead Expedition. Tray-tray, away!

Everything revolves around catching, selling, and collecting the fish that gather in the rivers of a small island. It also lets you customise your character with clothing. Mostly simple hats and shorts, but some options let players celebrate their sexuality, such as a rainbow-adorned t-shirts, or titles that hang above your character which simply say "Trans" or "Bi". All this led one player to complain there was no "Straight" title. So, the developer added one. It costs 10 grand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, the rumour took root that GTA 6's release date would slip back from 2025 to 2026. An anonymous insider averred that studio heads were "worried" about the new open world game's progress - hence, perhaps, Rockstar's decision to mandate a full return to in-office work. Pshaw, say publishers Take-Two CEO. They announced a fall 2025 launch in March and have just doubled down on it in their latest financial briefing, with CEO Strauss Zelnick subsequently going on the tellybox to say that Take-Two are "highly confident in the timing", though he still has nothing to share about GTA 6 on PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was a competitive long-distance runner at school, breath control was paramount. We were never really taught this, mind. It was an art you picked up through practice: how to breathe before the race, saturating your blood with O2 without dizzying yourself; when to permit the shorter, emergency breaths and when to apply restraint; when to deepen your inhales and charge yourself up for an attack on a hill.
And then, how to organise your body around your breath, straightening your posture to expand your lungs without tipping back too far and squandering muscle power; how to breath in time with your stride and the movement of your shoulders, so as to firm up your momentum and shave a miraculous-feeling minute off your finishing time. All this, plus various daft psychological war gambits of my own devising. When overtaking or being overtaken, I used to seal my lips shut on that side and breath through the other corner of my mouth, to make it look like I was hardly out of breath at all.

It’s snacky and a bit janky, but it’s also great coffee break fodder, assuming you want to spend your break breaking a selection of heavy objects over the crumbly skulls of ne’er-do-wells. I mean, they might have done some things well, I don’t know them. But they aren’t doing any well to my character in the game, so violence it is.

Exploring rooms to the side, Alan Wake 2: The Lake House’s star finds whiteboards and documents revealing the typewriter’s purpose: to mimic Wake’s writing. Pages are graded along criteria such as ‘style’, ‘tone’, and ‘content’, then “fed into the algorithm” as references until “near-identical stories” to Wake’s can be produced.
“If Jules could simply cut the painter open and pull the painting out of him, he would,” reads one of the real Alan’s typewritten pages. That’s Jules Marmont, the obsessive head of the titular FBC centre. The Marmonts - Jules and his wife Diana - are running experiments to forcibly and synthetically create works of art, aiming to mimic creative passion convincingly enough for the paranatural entity inside Cauldron Lake to respond, as it has in the past.

Good news for stealth fans, and perhaps gooder news for a dozen strapline writers sweating profusely, soiling themselves in anticipation of using “kept you waiting, huh?”.
Until then, I at least have a steady drip feed of new information to keep me sated, the latest of which is the substantial hint that there'll be some new dialogue in the game, as per the video below. Alongside that, the previously pseudonymous Suzetta Miñet - who was credited with voicing EVA in MGS3 and Peace Walker - has revealed herself to be Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel in Disney’s The Little Mermaid.

It's a massively multiplayer World War 2 game, viewed from above, where battlefield logistics matters as much as aiming and flanking. Its developers have just announced a major new update coming next summer, Foxhole: Airborne, which adds planes to the game for the first time.

Planes, in a topdown MMO? It makes a little more sense if you watch the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After 15+ years of blackholing IP addresses and making the Domain Name System tell more lies than Pinocchio, some may wonder whether site-blocking is harming prospects of a future open internet. Confirmation that piracy blocking tests are now being conducted at the internet's core routers isn't a surprise. It's only the internet's spinal column, so what could possibly go wrong?

I always read the comments, for all commenters are my children. They exist to glorify and preserve me in my dotage. True, occasionally my children say things like "I think your writing and opinions are appalling, and that you deserve to be repeatedly run over by a herd of deer", but it is the nature of children to rebel.

Soon enough, you'll be able to play Halo 2's lost E3 demo on it, thanks to some lovely modders.

Those new cats, dogs, and turtles had the cute distinction of being able to wear hats, should you choose to kit your wee friends out. Now, following many months of smaller updates to the game, it seems those hats are causing a problem. "[If] you are experiencing performance issues in Stardew Valley 1.6, remove all hats from pets," said creator Eric Barone in a xeet. When asked the lore-accurate cause of this problem, he blamed: "a strange rash".

It's basically another method of capturing funny ragdoll glitches and posting them on the "lol-games-are-dumb" channel of your friend's Discord. Or for posting that flukey knife throw in Call Of Duty to Twitter, as if you really meant to kill the man from across the map all along. Or saving a clip for your personal records, like the footage of that time you yeeted an innocent citizen off the 50-foot wall of a castle town in Dragon's Dogma 2. We all do that, right? Right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ogres, Orcs, and Khorne are all on the way in the upcoming expansion for strategy game Total War: Warhammer 3, and Creative Assembly have just released their latest dev vlog with a few more details on what to expect. There’s still no word on the exact title, although given the established naming convention (Shadows Of Change, Thrones Of Decay), I’m tentatively calling it “Sniffers Of Glue” in honour of the No Think, Only Krump faction selection.
You’ll find the vlog in its full glory below. What’s interesting about this one is that vlog mainstay director Rich Alridge has brought along some new faces: battle designer Josh King and audio director Chris Goldsmith. And, yes, so no-one can accuse me of burying the lede: that audio design involved the enthusiastic, deeply disgusting slurping of porridge and yoghurt, and the jangling of real bones. The source of the bones is not revealed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.
The work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)
Mask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)
Other games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.
We continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.
To run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.

According to the plaintiffs, the owner of the service "held himself out as a Chicago-area law enforcement officer" to "mitigate potential concerns" over the unlawfulness of his business. A theoretical damages claim of more than a billion dollars, plus an allegation of wiretapping, makes this case a little more spicy than most.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've spent quite a lot of today trying to figure out why, exactly, some of the monsters in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta looked like bundles of copulating pyramids slathered in crocodile gravy. Nic clued me in on this reddit thread earlier, which cites unnamed Chinese players who've allegedly data-mined the beta's monster models, and learned that they are extremely large, encompassing hundreds of thousands of polygons.
If every monster in Monster Hunter Wilds were that fancy all of the time, your computer would become a volcano. As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you. When they're further afield, the flourishes fall away to free up memory and processing power. The popular Redditor explanation for the presence of monsters that look like Henry Moore sculpture is basically that the LOD systems are being forgetful, and neglecting to load the additional polygons at proximity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a yearly blockbuster, Call of Duty, through sheer expense and effort, would like you to think it is the Die Hard of video games. Or, depending on the setting, the Saving Private Ryan of video games. But it is barely Black Hawk Down. This latest campaign in Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 reminds me more of the forgettable Netflix shootfests that thumbnail their way across your TV screen as you try to find some gritty nothing to aid you in zoning out of life. Still, there is an anecdotal contingent of casual sofa sitters for whom Call Of Duty is the game. A balls-to-the-wall shooter to return to every winter and rinse through in a weekend. Ed has already gestured at its multiplayer, announcing: "yup, it's COD", like a deeply tired Captain Birdseye inspecting the day's catch, wondering when his life will change. But never mind that. How does the single player story mode hold up? Some are calling it the best campaign in years. And I guess that's true, in the sense that it is the least worst.

Dragon Age: The Veilguard runs like a tap on any halfway decent desktop hardware, so was naturally going to be worth trying on the weaker Deck. And sure enough, Bioware’s RPG (which is really more of an action game with the occasional verbal spar) settles comfortably into handheld life.
In fact, Valve have festooned its Steam page with a Verified medal, a seal of approval for any game that performs and controls well on the Steam Deck without any glaring weaknesses or impractical annoyances. It’s still worth playing around with the settings – more on those later – but I’ll back up that official assessment, having played for several hours without so much as an undersized tooltip.

It's an "innovative urban walking simulator" in which you play a disembodied pair of shoes, individually moved with a controller's analog sticks and trigger buttons. The first half of the trailer is all whimsy and playground fun - kicking a football, standing on a climbing frame, riding a skateboard. But then a note of darkness creeps in, as the player begins to channel the sheer nihilistic inconsequentiality of a world in which shoes have no thinking human bodies to restrain them.

It'd be more fitting to say it's somehow automated the whole process: an inserter plucked out the rulebook from my brain and deposited it in hot magma, while a new rulebook was churned out in a nearby machine and plopped into my brain from the other side - only for that to be immediately plucked out and incinerated as well. With each new planet and each new phase, Space Age reinvents itself. I'm battling hyperbole here, but ah hell, I admit defeat. Factorio: Space Age is a masterpiece, the final form of perhaps the most well-crafted building game I'll ever play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have zero archaeology experience or knowledge, but I bet archaeologists really love their jobs (for the most part). They get to analyse and discover cool artefacts and educate us on the histories of forgotten civilisations. That's dreamy stuff, that is. But I do wonder what it's like for archaeologists to discover and study something they shouldn't have; something with a disturbing secret - a curse, maybe. Bite-sized horror game The Children Of Clay explores this idea and I'd like more of it, please.

Yes. I admit it: I am a bug hypocrite, loudly extolling their virtue and beauty at a distance then getting irritated if they decide to come sit on me.
Fortunately, real time strategy Empire Of The Ants understands that the best place for insects to be is inside a screen, where they can be appreciated but cannot under any circumstances touch you. It’s out this week, as it happens, and here’s a new launch trailer to celebrate. Follow your pheromone trail to the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early reactions to Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer range from frothing dislike through omnimovement hype to our own Ed Thorn's dead-eyed appraisal that it's "a good one, I think. Not a bad one. If you like Call Of Duty, you will like this. If you don't like Call Of Duty, you will not like this." I feel like we need to emergency-deploy a supply crate of smelling salts, because the sheer OK-ness of Black Ops 6 appears to have tumbled Ed into a stupor. 


Perhaps it would be a different story if he'd encountered some of the spawning issues and glitches people are talking about, with players joining games and materialising right into a hail of fire. The players in question include Black Ops 6's developers, who comically note in the latest Black Ops 6 patch notes that "Yes, we saw ourselves in a Killcam before selecting a Loadout too." The latest patch seeks to address this, naturally. As regards the campaign side of things, it also resets your safehouse currency to 5000, if you've had your single player funds stolen (or multiplied) by technical gremlins.

For all the things I ended up enjoying about Dragon Age: The Veilguard, it isn’t much of an RPG. What little roleplaying it does offer revolves around what flavour of supportive hero you prefer, and you can count the number of impactful dialogue decisions on a three-fingered hand. This might sound utterly damning in the wake of Baldur's Gate 3’s incredible reactivity, and if I approached games as some sort of tedious comparative intellectual exercise rather than just, y’know, seeing how I felt about them, then I suppose it would be. Weirdly, though, the recent memory of Baldur’s Gate 3 didn’t diminish my time with Veilguard at all. It was actually the opposite: it freed Dragon Age from having to carry the torch for a certain period in Bioware’s history, and let me enjoy Veilguard for what it was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitch have introduced a new "Politics and Sensitive Social Issues" label for streams that "focus" on topics like "elections, civic integrity, and war or military conflict". As with the streaming giant's existing labels for M-rated material, sexual themes or depictions of gambling, the idea is that viewers can filter out such streams in advance by altering their settings.
Advertisers, similarly, can "make better choices about the content they want to advertise next to" - in other words, pull their ads from a whole swathe of material if they don't want to be associated with anything controversial. Twitch's hope is that "the labels will allow advertisers to have more context to inform which types of streams they show their ads alongside, which we expect to increase brands’ confidence in running ads on Twitch, and could bring new advertisers to our service."

Not only would this be inaccurate, but it would also do a disservice to what Straftat truly is, namely a wild overcorrection in response to the direction of modern multiplayer gunfests, one that careens straight through retro stations to arrive somewhere new and exciting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The mystery surrounding Deadlock, Valve’s work-in-progress MOBA shooter, has largely evaporated. Its freely extendable invite system is about as effective at controlling player headcount as a disinterested football steward, meaning pretty much anyone with a clued-in Steam friend can get in and start poking around its secrets. And yet, being a lane-pushing wizard fighter in the Dota 2 vein, it’s already a vast tangle of interplaying abilities, items, strats, and often unspoken rules, of the kind that even experienced gankists will take hundreds of hours to learn. It’s been too much for poor Brendy, at any rate.
Still, Brendy is but one man. What if we had but four men, working in tandem to crush lanes and flatten Patrons just as Gabe intended? To find out if Deadlock is indeed more comprehensible as a team sport, Graham, Ed, Ollie, and James joined forces, promptly getting fucked up yet emerging from the warlock hospital with a deeper understanding of its workings. Or, at least, if anyone would keep playing.

Bugs and maddening enemy spawns diminished the tension of being a fleshy human scavenger in a mech battlefield. But one feature annoyed some players much more - fresh water. See, you need to keep your headquarters stocked with water, as it gets steadily used by your settlement's inhabitants. The catch being that this water diminishes even while you're not playing the game. If it runs out completely, then everything you've collected gets wiped. The developers have listened to complaints about this most Farmville of mechanics, and they've answered in an interesting way. Water thieves! Now, on top of the usual downward trickle, burglars will come to steal your H2O as well.
It's not as bad as it sounds.

And within that first hour, Slitterhead's body-possessing and Hong Kong-inspired streets had me thinking, "Is this it, the sleeper hit of 2024?!"
No, sadly not. It's no doubt built a compelling universe filled with brain-sucking aliens that masquerade as humans, and it attempts plenty else besides: bouncing between bodies as you stealth around dingy apartment blocks, fighting with blood katanas, and gorging on pools of red plasma to refuel skills, many of which require more body-flitting. Thing is, they are ultimately just attempts, attempts that fall victim to an emptiness and jitteriness that quickly reveals Slitterhead's true, irritating form.

As such, I didn’t spend enough time with the combat to get a proper feel for it.

That's not the actual distant past you're parkouring through. That isn't actual Renaissance architecture you're clambering on. It's a holographic Animus simulation, conjured from ancestral memories flash-frozen within your DNA - convenient, inasmuch as it means that any inconsistencies are your DNA's fault, not Ubisoft's. If the ledge-mantling animations are glitchy, that's simply because you have bad genes.
We can both be forgiven for losing sight of Assassin's Creed's modern day narrative frame. Ubisoft themselves have downplayed it since the era of Desmond Miles, the watery Peter Parker figure who served as puppetmaster protagonist for AC games up to Assassin's Creed 3. In Assassin's Creed Shadows, however, they're planning to bring back the modern day setting in a big way, though details are scanty.

The company recently filed DMCA takedown notices with GitHub to remove APKs associated with popular apps such as PikaShow, Castle, and FlixFox.

That means it falls to me to round up (mostly) good (mostly) writing about (mostly) video games. I will otherwise be spending my Sunday continuing the fight against my dog's fleas, which rebound every three weeks no matter how much I spray, scrub or throw things away.  
On, the independent video game magazine which I linked to last week, has run a series of brief interviews with each of the contributors to its launch issue. I recommend Christian Donlan's for the puzzle game recommendations and Margaret Robertson's which expands on her fascination with Japanese paper games.

I am keen on any game that aims to follow in its footsteps, and there are a few. The latest is Blood Typers, a horror game where you tippity-tap on your keyboard to fight montsters in a spooky mansion, but this isn't a rail shooter, so you'll be typing to explore and navigate, too.

It's now got a release of February 2025, and there's a demo you can play now.

And every single time my brain clunks into gear and I turn inwards, where I struggle to come up with anything meaningful to say. So much so that a fog develops and out of the fog emerges a figure - it's me. I'm holding an M4A1 with an extended barrel and a vertical foregrip.

I have nobody to impress most days but my cat, and the only item of clothing she appears to have an opinion on is my Oodie, which is very comfortable for both of us and also smells like a chicken shop, which I imagine is more pleasant for her than me.
This aside, I found myself taking a whole bunch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard screenshots as I played just to capture the RPG’s various outfits. They are ridiculous. Incredibly intricate and detailed, as well as being obscenely impractical for the most part. I do not like any of them in the sense I would wear them, but I like all of them in the sense that they display artists allowed to run free like caffeinated weasels and indulge their every whim.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Motion Picture Association (MPA) continues to play a key role in expanding global site blocking efforts. After helping to establish a voluntary site blocking agreement in the Philippines, the MPA also filed the first complaints under the new rule. Torrent site YTS was the first target, followed by popular pirate streaming sites SFlix and MyFlixer this week.

He who casually dropped two of the most influential puzzle games ever then got distracted by yellow cranks for six years, occasionally popping up to drop a demake of Papers Please? Well, Pope has ceased hogging that crank, for now at least, and just released Haloween-y adventure game Moida Mansion. It’s on Itch here, and it’s completely free to play in your browser.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Part of the fun of Dragon Age's fantasy is that it's inconsistent - or at least, inconsistent by the standards of fantasy RPGs, which often break down into a million neatly organised and interlocking codex entries. It all rides on who you speak to. The humans believe one thing about the origins and workings of Thedas, the elves another, the qunari something else entirely. These differences are the basis for many factional disagreements and thus, many core series plot developments. According to former lead writer David Gaider, however, there's an "uber-plot" behind it all that may one day be resolved and bring the series to a close, assuming BioWare continue to refer to his original (and closely guarded) narrative documents.

It's based on an actual Kerbal Space Program 2 pitch the studio threw at Take-Two subsidiary Private Division back in the day. RocketWerkz CEO and original DayZ creator Dean Hall has hired several former KSP and KSP2 developers to work on the game, and is describing it on social media as a "KSP killer".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.
The Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.
Rise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.
You’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Film, ve kterém většinu času není vůbec jasné, jaká je zrovna motivace které postavy na plátně (např. jestli právě dělá vtip, nebo jestli se bojí o svůj život). To je jeho největší a soustavný problém, ale má i mnoho dalších, například arabské teroristy z "Návratu do budoucnosti" a pointu, spočívající v tom, že veřejnoprávní média vám non-stop lžou a vy jim to štastně žerete (což je pointa pravděpodobně nezamýšlená, protože film spoluprodukoval Český rozhlas). Je velmi smutné vidět dílo, na kterém pracovali lidi, o kterých víme, že jsou schopni vyprodukovat něco zajímavého, a výsledek dopadl takto strašlivě. (Ilča 10 %)]]></summary>
