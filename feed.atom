        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given how Starfield cozied up to AMD, those who don't use Team Red's hardware may have had concerns about how optimized the game would be on Nvidia's tech. Fortunately, when it comes to upscaling at least, Bethesda is launching official DLSS support. But until then, the mod community is coming to the rescue.


As spotted by DSO Gaming, Nexus Mods user Nukem recently released "Streamline Native," which adds DLSS support to Starfield. It doesn't say specifically, but the DLL file download page suggests it supports version 3.5, which is the latest build.

While there is already a DLSS mod for Starfield, this one by Nukem does something different by implementing options into the game's menu system. The above image shows the settings available natively.


What exactly is DLSS?


For those who don't know, DLSS stands for Deep Learning Super Sampling. It effectively enables game visuals to be upscaled to a higher resolution using an algorithm, saving additional strain on the user's PC hardware.


Because DLSS is Nvidia's own tech, some may have been worried that Starfield wouldn't offer support for it. Bethesda struck up a deal with AMD (Nvidia's biggest competitor in the GPU market) which would see the game being better optimized for Team Red's products.


Fortunately, as previously mentioned, Bethesda is bringing DLSS support to the game at some point. But for now, if you want it now, there are a couple of options available in the modding community. However, Nukem's mod appears to be the first one to actually streamline it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are you ready for Cyberpunk 2077's first DLC? Well, hold your horses for a second there. If you're excited about Phantom Liberty and you're in the market for some new PC hardware, Nvidia may have you covered.


Team Green is currently offering a chance to win an Nvidia RTX 4090 graphics card, which comes with a custom backplate designed after Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty.




If you want a chance to win what is essentially the most powerful GPU on the current market, all you have to do, according to the post on Twitter, is like said post and comment with a specific hashtag. There doesn't appear to be any mention of how long the competition is going on or when a winner will be announced, so keep an eye on social media for details.


All those graphical gubbins


Nvidia launched its RTX 4090 graphics card almost a year ago, effectively kick-starting the next generation of GPU tech (with Nvidia naming its 4000 series after English Mathematician Ada Lovelace). 


As the post on Twitter itself says, the 4090 boasts DLSS 3.5 – the latest in Team Green's AI upscaler – for all your visual purists out there. It's also, sadly, one of the most expensive pieces of PC kit available, so many of you will be eager to get hold of one for free.


As for the DLC itself, Phantom Liberty will be released on September 26, just a few days away. There's also Cyberpunk 2077 version 2.0 rolling out today, which represents something of an overhaul for the game. Developer CD Projekt Red even recommends starting a new save file due to how many changes this update will be bringing.

Among the heaps of releases coming our way this year, 2023 has been a pretty big one for Feral Interactive — the team behind the excellent Switch ports of GRID Autosport and Alien: Isolation. The studio brought The Lara Croft Collection our way back in June and is now setting its sights on the next porting project: 2006's WWII real-time strategy classic, Company of Heroes.
This has long been considered one of the standouts of the RTS genre, with some even ranking it among the best releases ever — no pressure then, eh? Fortunately, the odds were already in Feral's favour, having been behind the game's 2020 port to iOS and Android.

Announced in September, The Man Who Erased His Name stars longtime Yakuza series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and focuses on his life after Yakuza 6: The Song of Life before he appears in Infinite Wealth. And now, thanks to Xbox's 2023 Tokyo Game Show broadcast, we know we'll be hanging with Kiryu on Xbox Game Pass on the game's November 9 launch day.
The Man Who Erased His Name will also hit Windows PC as part of Xbox's PC Game Pass program on day one as well. 
Alongside this news, RGG Studio revealed that Like A Dragon: Ishin!, a Yakuza spin-off entry that hit PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2013 in Japan (but never came to the West), will hit Game Pass later this year on both Xbox and Windows PC. 
While waiting for these games to hit Game Pass, read Game Informer's Like A Dragon: Ishin! review and then check out the latest Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth trailer. After that, read our hands-on preview of Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ellis Tucci grew up playing games like Thief, System Shock, and Deus Ex. Now she's making an immersive sim of her own. It's called Spectra, and it's set in the US in an alt-history 1972 where Soviet Union is the dominant military power after President Roosevelt was deposed in a fascist coup. You play as a Soviet agent tasked with infiltrating and fomenting revolution in a fortress city called Hiwatha.
Tucci wants Spectra to meet the criteria players will expect from an immersive sim. "To me, the immersive sim is the platonic ideal of the video game" she says. "I've tried to deliver on that immersion by creating an environment that is extremely interactable and flexible in the ways it can be used." She explains that "a quite frankly silly proportion of the buildings in each map are enterable and that "you can turn off the lights, set traps, and use things like televisions, radios, or payphones as lures."


It sounds like everything immersive sim fans want. But there's one big difference between Spectra and the games that inspired it. Tucci is making it on her own. And she isn't the only indie developer working in one of the most ambitious, developmentally complex genres in the industry. Games like Shadows Of Doubt, Fallen Aces and Gloomwood are merely the steam rising from the bubbling magma chamber that is indie immersive sim development, Like the recent revival of retro shooters, the indie space is on the verge of an immersive sim eruption.

In 2020, it received a board game from Steamforged Games titled Horizon Zero Dawn: The Board Game. Another tabletop board game from Steamforged is on the way, and this one is titled Horizon Forbidden West: Seeds of Rebellion. 


Seeds of Rebellion is a prequel taking place before the events of Horizon Forbidden West but after Horizon Zero Dawn. Steamforged worked closely with Guerrilla Games to create an authentic story within the game's canon.


We don't have too many details on the gameplay just yet, although Steamforged has stated that it can be played by 1 to 4 players, and it is designed to deliver a "fully cooperative, narrative-driven tabletop experience."

Seeds of Rebellion's story


Discord is stirring among the Tenakth clans. It's up to you and your fellow Marshals to figure out what's going on and stop the rebellion before chaos erupts. During your campaign, you'll face off against machines, but you'll also have the chance to earn powerful equipment to give you a fighting chance. 


The board game hits Kickstarter on November 21. Steamforged also has an Elden Ring board game set to release in 2024.

There are actual vampires that come back from the dead less often. But I'm piqued nonetheless by Chinese Room studio design director Alex Skidmore’s thoughts on how this Seattle-set World of Darkness action-RPG adaptation will differentiate itself from other games in the genre, and especially, how it will put its vampiric premise to use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nacon has published several games but these days it's more known for its gaming accessories. It recently unveiled the Revolution 5 Pro controller which is officially licensed by PlayStation. The controller is compatible with the PS4, PS5, and PC. 


It looks like the DualSense Edge and it has many of the same features, including back buttons. You can customize the Revolution 5 Pro, as it comes with 3 sets of weights, 3 stick sizes, and 3 sets of stick heads to have the controller feel perfect in your hands.


There are some reasons why you may pick the Nacon over Sony's controller. Most notably, Nacon's controller features asymmetrical sticks, which is a preference for some players. It also boasts a battery life of over 10 hours and supports Bluetooth audio in addition to wired headsets. 




 According to Nacon, this controller is geared towards gamers seeking maximum performance. It features magnetic Hall effect technology that brings increased accuracy and durability and gives you less reason to fear stick drift. 


The controller is available in black and white, and it is set to release in October. You can pre-order it for $199.90. If you're looking for greater accessibility, you may want to turn to Sony's upcoming Access Controller which is highly customizable and catered towards players with varying needs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Baldur's Gate 3 "no possibility left unpossible" choice-and-consequence train continues with the revelation that, if you break up with a lover in the game, you can slowly repair the relationship and spark a bit of your old chemistry. This might not sound earthshattering to anybody from outside the videogame world - what are you doing here? Run along and watch your silly non-interactive movies and TV shows - but it's quite novel for a fantasy RPG in the BioWare tradition. In my experience, at least, most RPGs only give you the build-up to a character romance, then flash-freeze the relationship post-consummation, perhaps because you've unlocked a sexy "loyalty" companion ability and the developers don't want to take it away from you. Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the few that thinks about how chemistry  might come and go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite generates plenty of profit through its V-Bucks and microtransactions. Over the years, there have been plenty of reports of parents hit with breathtakingly high bills after a child goes on a Fortnite spending spree. Anyone who's faced such a situation may be able to claim a refund thanks to a ruling by the Federal Trade Commission. 


The FTC unveiled this refund process after Fortnite developer Epic Games agreed to pay a colossal $245 million settlement following accusations of charging for unwanted purchases and locking the accounts of customers who disputed the charges with their credit card companies. Since September 19, the FTC has been sending out emails to Fortnite players who may be eligible for a refund.


Any US citizens who have had unwanted purchases have until January 17 to claim a refund. At least one of these statements also have to be true: 



You were charged in-game currency for items you didn’t want between January 2017 and September 2022


Your child made charges to your credit card without your knowledge between January 2017 and November 2018


Your account was locked between January 2017 and September 2022 after you complained to your credit card company about wrongful charges

Fortnite's dubious practices


Fornite has been accused of predatory practices and "dark patterns" meant to coerce players into making purchases. The $245 million settlement will go to consumers who have fallen victim to these tactics. The FTC has yet to reveal how much affected players will be refunded, but it "will depend on several factors, including how many people file a claim."


Despite the setback, Fortnite is still going strong. This month, it began yet another anime collaboration, this time with My Hero Academia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer Group is a video game company which owns over 70 studios around the world. Things haven't been looking good for its studios lately, as they have been suffering from layoffs and closures. 


The next studio to meet this fate is Crystal Dynamics which is the team behind the Tomb Raider Survivor trilogy. It is currently developing the next Tomb Raider game which will be published by Amazon.




On Twitter, the studio announced that it had to part ways with nine brand/marketing employees, as well as an IT employee. According to LinkedIn, the studio has 201 to 500 employees. Crystal Dynamics states that the difficult choice was made to align the studio with its current business needs. 


Some of the ex-employees affected by the layoffs have identified themselves (as Eurogamer reports), including senior brand manager Nicholas Edwards who revealed on LinkedIn that he is no longer working at Crystal Dynamics.

Embracer Group is changing its business strategy


Embracer Group had been on a buying spree, but that has come to a halt. As revealed in an open letter, it is now focused on becoming a highly cash-flow generative business. The consequence of this has been the closure of studios like Volition and layoffs in studios such as Beamdog. 


It appears that not even Embracer's biggest studios are safe, as there have been reports of the company showing interest in selling off Gearbox, the studio behind Borderlands. This leaves us with uncertainty regarding all of Embracer's studios.

How Did Rebirth's Development Compare To Remake's? 
Rebirth launches on February 29, a couple of months shy of Remake’s fourth anniversary. According to Hamaguchi, Remake’s development cycle was around four years, making the turnaround for Rebirth, a much larger game, seem relatively quick.

Final Fantasy VII Remake felt like the realization of an impossible dream when it launched in 2020. Not only did it feel willed into existence after years of fan requests, but it largely lived up to sky-high expectations based on its generally positive reception. Tack on a good story expansion with the Yuffie-focused Intermission, and the series is riding a wave of momentum into its second chapter, Rebirth. To learn how the sequel is shaping up, I visited Square Enix’s Los Angeles studio to play two slices of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth: a flashback sequence of the ill-fated Mt.

Schofield is perhaps best known as the co-creator of the Dead Space franchise and the co-founder of Call of Duty developer Sledgehammer Games. Steve Papoutsis, who previously served as chief development officer and general manager for Striking Distance Studios, has been appointed as the new CEO.
Schofield has been active in the games industry since the early 1990s, working at companies like THQ, Crystal Dynamics, and Eidos Interactive.

Any new footage is a treat for Persona fans. However, what makes this trailer unique is its focus on the Persona rival team Strega. While they did appear in the original version of Persona 3, their emphasis here hints at some surprises for even seasoned fans of the series. Also, perhaps more importantly, we can see Elizabeth climbing up a descending escalator. I hope she finally turns the Velvet Room into a nightclub too.

The event is being held in-person and online over the next few days, and there's sure to be news on all kinds of games as we near the fall season.


Arguably, the TGS festivities have already begun. Sony and Nintendo aired both their big showcases ahead of the big event, and RGG Studio came out swinging with a release date for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth.


If you're worried the trailer salvo is already spent, though, don't be. Big names like Square Enix, HoYoverse, Sega, Atlus, Level-5, Capcom, and more are still on the docket.

From Twitch Plays Pokemon to Twitch Plays Halo, the concept of allowing a Twitch chat to control a game or an experience all from the comfort of their chat window has made a significant impact on the internet at-large.




But now, one vtuber has taken this idea to its logical next step — what if you let your Twitch chat control the appliances in your kitchen? Introducing uwu_to_owo, a self-proclaimed “mad scientist vtuber” who has carved out a niche in the ‘let Twitch chat control my kitchen appliances’ genre. Most recently, this creator has built a “robot” chef, connected to their Twitch chat, and programmed to cook fried rice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Criterion Games, developer of titles such as Burnout and Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, has formally joined EA Entertainment, according to a press release written by EA’s Vince Zampella. Criterion has been an EA studio since it was acquired in 2004, but it will now be primarily working on the Battlefield franchise.


“Today, Criterion is added to our world-class Battlefield studios dedicated to ushering in a new era for the franchise,” wrote Zampella, who oversees studios working on Apex Legends, Star Wars Jedi, Battlefield, and Need for Speed.


“The majority of the team will be working alongside DICE, Ripple Effect, and Ridgeline that are led by Byron Beede, GM of Battlefield. Criterion’s experience with Battlefield, our technology and building engaging experiences will have an immediate positive impact as we continue to work on Battlefield 2042, and as we continue pre-production on a connected Battlefield Universe.”


While known for racing games like Burnout and Need for Speed, Criterion has previously assisted on Battlefield games and other shooters under the EA umbrella, including the Star Wars Battlefront series. The last game Criterion released itself was the surprising 2022 Need For Speed Unbound.


Zampella goes on to emphasize that work on the Need for Speed franchise isn’t ceasing as a result of this announcement, though he doesn’t specifically state that Criterion will be responsible for future entries. 


“I’m really looking forward to working with a core group as we shape what’s next for the [Need for Speed] franchise," said Zampella.

As reported in DYKG's video on the subject, Nintendo gave Warner Bros. permission to create officially licensed products to help promote the second Pokémon movie — so Warner Bros. of course commissioned for Cyberworld to create a game in their QBORG engine, following on from the success of their Harry Potter-based browser game.

At around the 1:53 mark in the video, a Steam achievement is clearly visible in the bottom right corner. It's not unusual for trailers to feature footage from the PC version of their game, however, it's a bit disingenuous in this case. There technically is a "Footage Not Final" message but I think there's a difference between not final, and simply footage from a different version altogether.


It's no secret that the Switch version of Mortal Kombat 1 appears to have some issues. Players on Switch have voiced their disappointment with the version, citing performance issues and very dated visuals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Better get ready to wear those Spidey suits again because Marvel's Spider-Man 2 has gone gold. Insomniac Games announced the news on their Twitter page Wednesday, and the studio also published a video with the cast psyched about the game going gold. At this point, it's unlikely that the game will get delayed.  


"It has happened, the time is now," said Miles Morales' actor Nadji Jeter in the video. "Not bronze, not silver, but gold." He then proceeded to shout the announcement to the world. 




Marvel's Spider-Man 2 going gold means that the game is now getting pressed into discs. There will likely be a day one patch, but the 1.0 version of the game is now getting made and shipped to warehouses and stores around the world. 


"I just want to say that I love you and I'm so stoked for this game and I hope you guys enjoy it as much as we enjoyed making it," said Laura Bailey, who plays Mary Jane Watson in Marvel's Spider-Man 2. 





Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will be released exclusively for the PS5 on October 20, just one month away. There is no word on a PC version yet. 


Insomniac Games seems to be the most productive studio under PlayStation for this generation. It has released Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Marvel's Spider-Man: Remastered, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, and very soon, Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Additionally, Marvel's Wolverine is in the works at Insomniac  Games. 


To help fans get ready for the game, there's a prequel comic that leads into the events of Marvel's Spider-Man 2.

Legendary Nintendo name Takaya Imamura's debut manga is being turned into a video game — in case you missed that announcement last year — and the first trailer has just dropped at the Tokyo Game Show.
Coming to Switch and Steam in 2024, Omega 6: The Video Game sees the 2022 manga being adapted into a text adventure game, but it looks like there will also be combat in the style of turn-based battles. Imamura-san is working on the game's art direction, which blends the manga's style with retro pixel art visuals, with another Nintendo veteran — composer Shinobu Amayake, who worked on Wario's Woods and Stunt Race FX — joining the team to bring this space-faring adventure to the world in a new format.

The news premiered last night, as part of the RGG Direct ahead of Tokyo Game Show 2023. In it, we got a pretty lengthy look at the story of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. No, seriously, it's 10 minutes long. There are some major plot beats in this trailer. It's a mini-film in its own right.




Alongside some shocking revelations about the state of longtime Yakuza protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, as well as how Kasuga Ichiban winds up in Hawaii, we get a very important confirmation: that Infinite Wealth will have quite a large cast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has been going all-in on anime-related content lately, from the One Piece live-action series to Castlevania: Nocturne, and that trend looks to be maintaining its momentum. The streamer has dropped a trailer for their animated adaptation of Onimusha, which looks to be an action-packed romp through Edo-era Japan. Takashi Miike, director of 13 Assassins and Blade of the Immortal, is supervising director. 




In the trailer for Onimusha — which is scheduled to release worldwide on November 2 — we get a peek at our main character Musashi Miyamoto wrecking shop against the living and the undead. The series is being produced by animation studio Sublimation, most known for its work on Dragon’s Dogma. As such, this series seems to use CG more than traditional, 2D animation.


The anime series will tell an original story not found in the source material, according to a press release by Netflix. 


“Set in the early Edo Period, a time when Japan was transitioning towards peace, and warfare was fading into history, an aging Musashi embarks on a covert mission,” the release said. “Armed with the mythical 'Oni Gauntlet,' Musashi embarks on an epic journey to vanquish the lurking demons.”


To add, Musashi is “modeled after the late Japanese screen icon, Toshiro Mifune,” who is most famous for his work on films such as Rashomon, Seven Samurai, and The Samurai Trilogy, where he played the true-to-life Musashi Miyamoto. 


This is the first time Onimusha has received an animated adaptation since its initial release more than two decades ago. Onimusha: Warlords was first made available in 2001 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 is a popular game for many reasons, and one of the most notable is its cast. From the vampire heartthrob Astarion to the kind-hearted Karlach, many are smitten with the lovable characters. Well, fans are getting more of these characters, albeit in a different but still familiar manner from Baldur's Gate 3: Dungeons & Dragons.


Larian Studios announced on X (Twitter) that Baldur's Gate 3's core cast are reprising their roles for a Dungeons & Dragons adventure. D&D group High Rollers is hosting the one-shot, and it's airing on September 22 on the group's Twitch channel. Its advertised start time is 7 PM BST, meaning it will begin at 11 AM PST and 2 PM EST for American fans. 




A clip paired with the announcement showcases the voice actors introducing themselves and their characters. It's admittedly surreal hearing Neil Newborn slip so naturally into his Astarion voice and even copying his rather sassy mannerisms.


Despite only lasting a couple of minutes, the clip makes the stream seem like a fun time. It's nice seeing the cast reunite, even if it's so soon after Baldur's Gate 3's launch. Everyone bounces off each other well in the game, so seeing the dynamic play out live is a treat for fans. 


Another thing clarified about this stream is that those who miss it can watch the Baldur's Gate 3 D&D session recorded as a VOD. I typically don't watch many livestreams, so having an easily accessible recording is a blessing. Even if I miss the live show, I need to see how much Jennifer English plays into a Shadowheart who introduces herself as "god's favorite princess," because that's amazing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prior to joining RPS and coming into a possession of an Actual Contemporary Gaming PC, I did all my gaming on a plucky Erazer laptop from circa 2014. The old warhorse has certainly had some adventures, to the point that it isn't really a laptop anymore but a hovering debris cloud of plastic and metal, constellated by strips of sellotape, from which a moving picture may be hesitantly conjured by means of screamed insults and the careful deployment of desk fans. 


Among the sicker jokes I've played on various editors as a freelancer is to review triple-A games on this sorrowing technological Igor, which - I swear to you - physically flinches and begins to whimper frantically when presented with any game more demanding than Far Cry 2. Thing is, I'm pretty sure I can run Ubisoft's forthcoming Assassin's Creed: Mirage on this hapless relic. The publisher have released minimum and recommended system specs for their latest historical throat-slitter, and they're pretty dang reasonable.

They are built for you to be able to get off on cars and car culture and shiny paints and lifestyle that you are likely never going to have. My Summer Car is not like those games. This game is about realism. You don’t get off to this car because that’s sick.


That’s how developer Johannes Rojola described his design vision for My Summer Car in an April 2015 video on YouTube. He wasn’t talking about the driving model, as believable as it is. Neither was he describing the intricately designed systems that control your car's performance. No, he was talking about the “shit music” playing on the radio and the fact that when you drink a beer while driving, your vision is obscured by the bottle in your face…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an announcement I personally never could have predicted, the 2001 PlayStation 2 Capcom video game Onimusha: Warlords (and subsequent sequels) is getting an anime adaption for Netflix. The reveal is surprising for a number of reasons. The franchise is not one that is particularly well-known or currently popular. Also, the anime seems to have little to do with the original game. Protagonist Samanosuke Akechi does not make an appearance in the trailer. But, like Samanosuke, who was modeled after Japanese actor Kaneshiro Takeshi, the anime's protagonist, Miyamoto Musashi, is modeled after the late Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. Coincidentally, Onimusha 2's protagonist, Jubei Yagyu, was modeled after Japanese actor Yūsaku Matsuda, who had also passed away well before the game released. It's an odd throughline for the series but is a key element.
The other surprise for the adaptation is it is being co-directed by Takashi Miike. Miike is known for films like Ichi The Killer and Audition, but he also has another big Capcom franchise under his directorial belt with Ace Attorney, a film adaption of the Phoenix Wright games.
I played Onimusha for the first time in earnest when it released on Switch and enjoyed revisiting it and finally beating it. You can find more of my thoughts on that topic here.


The anime premieres November 2 on Netflix.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Farming life sims like Stardew Valley remain enduringly popular, and until Stardew dev ConcernedApe's Haunted Chocolatier arrives, there are plenty other games popping up like cute life sim mushrooms to horn in on our shared desire for a simpler, more rustic way of life. The route to this in Stardew Valley is actually quite hard, requiring mastery of several different interlocked systems that each ask a level of expertise that, on most days, I cannot be arsed to work towards. I love Stardew Valley, to be clear, but I hold no expectation of ever getting the most out of the farm space alloted to you as a result of your grandfather's death.
Fae Farm is a Stardewlike with a fantastical veneer and 3D graphics, but importantly it frontloads progress. It's slightly easier, in ways that seem small but cumulatively mean it takes up way less of your brain's runtime on bad days. For example: all activities, including watering your crops, use less energy than in Stardew Valley. This means you can run around clearing farm space and gathering resources, and have a working plot in just a couple of days. Heck, you can have a pretty full day in the mines before you've mechanised your farm. Game changer!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent episode of GamerTag Radio, Insomniac Games’ associate animation director James Ham said that players will be able to find the opposite Spider-Man — if they’re playing as Peter, then they’ll run into Miles, and vice versa — and join them in fighting crime in Spider-Man 2.


“There are times where you can be swinging throughout the city and you can see the other Spider-Man sometimes actively doing something or stopping a crime,” Ham said in the interview.


In that same vein, Ham said the other Spider-Man can also find you and join you in fighting crime. It was made clear by senior animation director Bobby Coddington that switching between Peter and Miles will also be present in this sequel, though “there’s key narrative moments where switching [between Miles and Peter] is something that is available,” Coddington said.


We were recently shown a first look at the open world of Spider-Man 2, which included new and unique ways of traversal, the utilization of the PlayStation 5’s hardware to reduce load time, and the expanded city, which has practically doubled in size in comparison with the city from the first Spider-Man. This, paired with the fact that we can stumble across a fellow Spider-Bro whilst on the prowl for criminals is making the upcoming sequel even more anticipated.


Spider-Man 2 is set to release on October 20 exclusively for the PlayStation 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV is due to have a finger-lickin' good crossover with KFC soon. The acclaimed MMORPG is no stranger to unexpected crossovers, but these are often with other games and not fast food brands.


KFC Japan announced the collaboration on X (Twitter) with a surprisingly ominous teaser. The 15-seconds show Colonel Sanders solemnly looking over the Eorzean sea before casting Triplecast, a spell exclusive to Black Mages starting at level 66. Assuming the Colonel is at this level, he'd likely be in the middle of Stormblood, galavating across the Doman continent.




There isn't a lot to see from the teaser, but the glitched text stating "Coming Soon" reads like a warning. I never thought I'd ask myself if Colonel Sanders would become an enemy in Final Fantasy XIV, but it almost sounds plausible now. 


Details on the collaboration are sparse, and if this tweet was it, I'd think it was a joke. This probably isn't the case because KFC Japan has another tweet teasing a Final Fantasy collaboration for October 4. Final Fantasy isn't explicitly named, but silhouettes of the Chocobo Alpha and a moogle are dead giveaways.


A crossover like this isn't surprising given Final Fantasy's previous collaborations with food brands. I'll never forget the Cup Noodles content in FFXV and Noctis wearing a Cup Noodles hat.


That comparison might not be the best regarding what to expect since they differ greatly. Whatever it turns out to be, it'll be a treat to the overlap of fans who enjoy KFC and FFXIV.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077's triumph was that it offered a sprawling story, dozens of hours long, which cohered around just a small number of themes. Or maybe even a single thesis: that the cynical, defensive, self-centred voice in your head - personified by ancient, soul-trapped, anarcho-rockstar Johnny Silverhand - offered only a literal dead-end, and that real rebellion in the face of a messed-up world lay in helping friends. It was Frank Capra with robot arms and samurai swords, and I ate it up.
V doesn't go to Washington in Phantom Liberty, but Washington comes to her. CD Projekt Red's major expansion to the first-person RPG opens up a new district and a new cast of characters, including the President of the New United States and an aging sleeper spy played by Idris Elba. The themes remain the same, but the thesis is being tested: how can you help your friends if you don't know who they are, and if their goals are mutually exclusive?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been nearly three years since CD Projekt Red first launched Cyberpunk 2077 into the world. And amid all the issues and updates, the question has constantly been whether Cyberpunk is back; whether it can right the course of its failed launch and regain ground in the eyes of those who were fervently anticipating it. 


I’m not sure anything could have cleared those original, lofty expectations, but Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty feels like a fitting swan song for a beleaguered yet still captivating RPG.

Since its disastrous launch in 2020, developer CD Projekt Red has delivered critical updates to Cyberpunk 2077 to align it more closely to the original vision, but Phantom Liberty, coupled with the free Update 2.0, is its biggest yet. This new expansion trades in the high-octane mercenary vibes of Cyberpunk 2077 for a more subdued spy thriller, and offers a well-made trove of new ways to experience Night City. The expansion features a great cast of personalities, all well-performed, even if some are underused. Interacting wi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spencer Yan's My Work Is Not Yet Done is a narrative-driven investigative horror game that combines elements of the survival and simulation genres with a plot exploring "the imbrication and dissolution of human identities/meanings within uncanny wilderness", to quote the project's Github page. It follows the final days of Avery, last surviving member of a doomed hunt for the source of a strange transmission, and sees you performing complex acts of maintenance upon environmental sensors, while picking through journals and other found documents so as to "to discern the most viable 'truth' behind both Avery's mission and the signal itself". 


It's all wrapped up in a dense, warping two-tone aesthetic with shifting naturalistic sounds that makes my breath catch in my chest. I love everything I've seen and heard about Yan's game, but I don't think I've ever done it justice in writing, and I doubt today's efforts will address this. For you see, what I'd like to call your attention to right now is the game's complex recreation of shitting.

While the game was developed to completion for publisher Virgin Entertainment, it was left unpublished because they didn’t have the rights to the property.


Wacky Races was this horrendous Hanna-Barbera cartoon from 1968. To be fair, I don’t like most Hanna-Barbera cartoons from the era, with The Flintstones and The Jetsons being the big exceptions. However, Wacky Races was this horribly formulaic premise about a vehicular race between various cartoon teams. Dick Dastardly and his sidekick Muttley would try to cheat by sabotaging, ambushing, or setting traps for other racers. These would, of course, backfire on him and invariably cause him to lose.

        <updated>2023-09-20T14:06:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega and Like a Dragon series developer Ryu Ga Gotoku (RGG) Studio held a presentation this morning sharing all kinds of new details for its upcoming games, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth and Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.
First up, it shared a 10-minute story trailer for Infinite Wealth, which shared so many details that I am hesitant to write them all here in fear of spoiling potentially major plot beats in the game. The summary is that Ichiban Kasuga is offered the opportunity to find his mother, which means he must travel to Honolulu, Hawaii. Returning characters make an appearance, Ichiban will apparently be fighting sharks and giant squids, taking part in fun Hawaii activities like surfing, and, expectedly, will be getting into all kinds of trouble with the local gangs. Kazamu Kiryu's role also gets somewhat defined in the trailer.


Some details not in the trailer include the fact that the playable party now has full freedom of movement while fighting, allowing for more strategy. The game includes a Crazy Taxi-inspired minigame, among many other money-making opportunities. Actors Danny Trejo (Machete) and Daniel Dae Kim (Lost) will also be playing Dwight, the leader of the Barracudas gang, and Masataka Ebina, the ruthless captain of the local yakuza syndicate, respectively. You can check out some additional screenshots for the game below.

Alongside the story trailer, there is also a five-minute gameplay trailer.


Arguably, the biggest news from the event, however, is Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth's release date, which isn't far off. The game releases January 26 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Preorders for the game will net you the Hero’s Booster Pack, to level up faster, and a Special Job Set that includes the Linebacker and Tennis Ace jobs.
Alongside all the Infinite Wealth details, Sega and RGG also released the full opening cinematic for Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, which you can watch below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although massively controversial upon launch due to the game practically not being finished, Cyberpunk 2077 has come a long way. It's a much more enjoyable (and complete) experience these days, and many are excited about version 2.0 of the game, as well as the DLC.


In fact, the next major patch for the game is so huge, developer CD Projekt Red (or at least its customer support) recommends a new save. A post on Twitter/X says that while 2.0 will let you continue your current Cyberpunk 2077 playthrough, a fresh start is recommended.




The post goes on to say that this is down to the sheer amount of changes that have been made to the game for this next update, which releases September 21.


Then there's Phantom Liberty


A few days after Cyberpunk 2.0, CDPR will also be releasing Phantom Liberty. This new bit of content will be available from September 26, bringing with it a new area, characters, story, quests, gigs, boss fights, and more. Oh, also Idris Elba voices a character.


When the game originally came out at the end of 2020, it was met with immense backlash due to the poor state of the released product. It was so bad that Sony pulled the game from its digital store and began issuing refunds.


CD Project Red's otherwise stellar reputation was ruined overnight. Fortunately, after a series of immense bug fixes, Cyberpunk 2077 finally became the game it was meant to be. Which is good, because no one would have wanted DLC of a game that was too buggy to play.

The upcoming expansion was confirmed during Sony's State of Play, and now a new trailer has been doing the rounds.


Over on the official PlayStation YouTube channel, you can see the launch teaser for the inbound Resident Evil 4 content. The two-minute clip shows Ada Wong as the events of the game unfold from her perspective.




We get a glimpse of some of the interactions she'll be having with Luis Sera, and we also see famed douche Albert Wesker in all his sunglasses-wearing coolness.


When are Separate Ways and Mercenaries coming out?


You'll be pleased to know that "Separate Ways" will be released on September 21. The story aims to fill in some of the unanswered questions from the main game as you take on the role of Ada Wong.


Capcom can't really seem to go wrong at the moment when it comes to Resident Evil games. Along with new entries in the legendary survival horror series, the developer has been releasing hit remake after hit remake.


Okay, RE3 wasn't as well-received, but it's still a decent reimagining of its 1999 predecessor. The remake of Resident Evil 4 is the latest modern take on the classic games. Many consider the OG RE4 from 2005 to be the best installment across the whole franchise.


Now, with the DLC just around the corner, fans can once again step into the boots of Ada Wong. With some additional sexual tension between her and Leon Kennedy, no doubt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the chunkier morsels from yesterday's leak of Microsoft documents is an extended email from Xbox CEO Phil Spencer, dating from 2020, in which he argues that today's largest AAA videogame publishers remain dogged by their "failure" to adapt to the shift from physical to digital videogame distribution, and especially, subscription models such as Microsoft's own Game Pass. This inability to move with the times, Spencer suggests, has created a situation whereby the largest publishers rely on sheer "production scale" to attract and retain customers. 


In turn, this has meant that publishers are unwilling to bet on new IPs - it could be billions down the drain, after all. Instead, "AAA publishers are milking their top franchises but struggling to refill their portfolio of hit franchises", while relying on "rented" IPs such as Star Wars. This is an older email, of course, and there's an obvious element of self-flattery in the shape of Microsoft talking up Game Pass. Still, it's a persuasive account of recent industry history, bolstered by Spencer's notes from conversations with Assassin's Creed outfit Ubisoft and GTA publisher Take-Two Interactive in particular.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Score(pion).
Mortal Kombat 1 launched on Switch this week to dominantly unfavourable reviews. With long load times, frame rate drops and a severe visual downgrade, the Switch version is simply not up to snuff — especially given its equal price tag to the better-received PS5 and Xbox Series X releases — but series creator Ed Boon has promised that fixes are in the works.
In a recent interview with BBC Newsbeat, Boon stated that Mortal Kombat 1 on Switch will "absolutely be getting an update", noting that the team is keen to address a "number of the concerns and issues" that have come up since the game's launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has announced that Gotham Knights' Game Pass debut will occur on October 3, and those of you who don't want to pay for it can check out the game after its mediocre critical response. Party Animals, Cocoon, and PayDay 3 also join the Xbox Game Pass lineup over the next few weeks.


Xbox Game Pass will be adding five new games to its service, which include:



Party Animals (September 20)


PayDay 3 (September 21)


Cocoon (September 29)


Gotham Knights (October 3)


The Lamplighters League (October 3)



Gotham Knights will be available to all Xbox Game Pass subscribers as it launches for the service on Xbox Series X|S, PC, and cloud. Each of these games will be available on the Cloud, except Cocoon.

Perhaps Gotham Knights will find an audience within the Xbox Game Pass community. The current Steam player base at the time of writing is at 199, according to SteamCharts, so this news could give a good boost to WB Games' multiplayer title. 


Destructoid gave Gotham Knights a mediocre 5/10 review score. "After playing Gotham Knights, I couldn’t shake the feeling that a lot of it had the air of an Arkham-verse fan game," says our review. "While there is something there, you can almost reach out and touch the design-by-committee elements and witness the souls of some of the developers leaving their bodies."


Despite a slew of awesome games coming to Xbox Game Pass, there are plenty that are leaving the service on September 30, says Xbox Wire. They include:



Beacon Pines


Despot’s Game


Last Call BBS 


Moonscars


Outriders


Prodeus 


Weird West 



If you dig any of these games, you can get a 20% discount to keep them.

Fulqrum Publishing has announced that the retro-inspired first-person shooter Forgive Me Father will be making the leap from PC to consoles as it shoots onto Switch on 28th September.
Released on Steam last year, Forgive Me Father has managed to rack up a strong number of very positive reviews and looking at the above trailer, it's fair to say that this one seems wild. Forgive Me Father is developed by Byte Barrel and will see you making your way through a comic book-looking world, filled with Lovecraftian horrors. You'll have to manage your 'Madness Level' to grant you various perks as you attempt to take out the creepy creatures with some gruesome kills.

A new update is in the works for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and while it may not quite be the drastic problem-solving patch that many of us are still hoping for, it looks like at least some bugs will be the target of the upcoming improvements (thanks, Serebii.net).
It looks like the main issue being tackled this time around has to do with a bug that prevented trainer battle victories from being recorded. This meant that it was difficult — if not impossible — to collect rewards from the likes of Paldea's League Officials or the Kitikami Ogre Clan in The Teal Mask. The update will also set out to fix a problem where players could not deposit special Pokémon GO catches into their Scarlet and Violet saves.

        <updated>2023-09-20T09:43:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed fans have Assassin's Creed: Mirage to look forward to. The upcoming game will focus on Valhalla's Basim, and it is set in ancient Baghdad. We've already learned a lot about the game, including that it will have a smaller scope than your average modern AC game, and it'll return to the franchise's roots by embracing stealth gameplay. 




Although the game will be shorter than Valhalla, developers are still pushing current gaming platforms, including PC. The recently revealed PC requirements show that you'll need a beefy PC to max the game out, though you can get away with a weaker PC if you're willing to turn down some of the settings.

This is what you'll need to play Assassin's Creed: Mirage on PC


The minimum system requirements target 1080p at 30FPS, and you'll require 8GB RAM. You'll also need an NVIDIA GeForce 1060 (6GB) GPU, an Intel Arc A380 (6 GB), or an AMD Radeon RX 570 1600 GPU. The recommended specs target 1080p at 60FPS. To hit this, you'll need 16GB RAM. As for video cards, Ubisoft recommends an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti (6 GB), an AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT (6 GB), or an Intel Arc A750 (8 GB).


If you want to max out the game, you require 16GB RAM. You'll also need an AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT (16 GB), an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 (10 GB), or better. Manage this, and you'll enjoy the game at 60FPS at 4K. 


The game isn't too big, as you're advised to have 40GB free. An SSD is required for all configurations, which is a move that is becoming increasingly common among modern games. You'll also enjoy multi-monitor and widescreen support. 


Assassin's Creed: Mirage will be available on October 5 on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. An iOS port is also in the works.

It has been mere days since Trombone Champ tooted its way onto Switch, but the development team at Holy Wow Studios has been hard at work on a patch that will add more songs and fix some of those pesky bugs.
We don't know exactly which songs will be added in the upcoming patch, with the studio only noting that it will be "2 recent tracks from the PC version", but more renowned musical numbers for us to butcher is always a good thing, right? What we do know is that the update will be getting rid of two major bugs which crashed the game upon defeating the final boss and occasionally led to the wrong score grade being given to a performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 has finally launched on PS5. Much like its PC counterpart, it has received near-unanimous praise, though console players haven't been without problems. Some PS5 players have been dealing with the frustrating problem of game crashes. 




Larian Studios has acknowledged the issue, and a Tweet explains that the bug is likely connected to PSN. Developers are working on it, but in the meantime, you're advised to disconnect your console from the internet when playing Baldur's Gate 3.  




A fix will hopefully be out soon, as Larian Studios has a patch scheduled for September 21, and it'll finally bring the game to Macs. Larian Studios still has plenty of work ahead, as there is also an Xbox Series X/S port on the way.

Critically acclaimed but not flawless


Though BG3 has been basking in the spotlight, players have also been struggling through quite a few issues. Act 3's performance taxing even the most capable PCs is the most glaring problem, and PS5 players haven't been spared either. 


Larian Studios has been mending many of these issues with major BG3 patches, including one which featured over a hundred fixes. Fortunately, these minor hurdles haven't been enough to stop the game from reaching over 800,000 concurrent players on Steam and drawing adoration from both critics and players.

It seems Nintendo will be offering an alternative DLC physical release for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe in Japan.
As highlighted on social media, the Japanese physical release will apparently include a copy of the base game and the Booster Course Pass (featuring Waves 1-5) all on a single game card. The only download required will be for Wave 6 when it's released in Winter 2023. Here's the Amazon description:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Development of new content for Evil Dead: The Game has ceased, developer Saber Interactive has announced. The game’s planned Switch version has also been canceled.
In a statement posted to X (formerly known as Twitter), Saber explains that despite only releasing the game last May, it’s effectively moving on from it. Saber doesn't give a reason behind the decision, but states that it still plans to fix any major bugs and will keep the servers running “for the foreseeable future.” Check out its full statement below. 
Evil Dead: The Game is an asymmetrical multiplayer game set within the popular film universe where players control Ash and his friends to survive against a player-controlled Kandarian Demon. We weren’t particularly enamored with the title at launch, with video editor Alex Van Aken scoring the game a 6 out of 10, writing in his review, "It’s incredibly one-sided for a game all about two sides. And it’s majorly unbalanced." You can watch a team of editors tackle the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.]]></summary>

The Mortal Kombat series has had a lot of movie and celebrity crossovers throughout the years and the latest game Mortal Kombat 1 is no different with a cameo from Jean-Claude Van Damme and voice work by Megan Fox.
We've also seen characters like Terminator and Robocop, but one that apparently continues to elude Ed Boon and his team is the retired assassin John Wick, played by the one and only Keanu Reeves. Although this character has been featured in games like Fortnite, standalone titles, and the actor himself has shown up in Cyberpunk 2077 as Johnny Silverhand, unfortunately, NetherRealm didn't have any luck securing him.

In some news you might have seen coming, Saber Interactive has today announced it's officially cancelled the Nintendo Switch version of Evil Dead: The Game.
There's no reason attached to this announcement, but the same update reveals the decision to not pursue the development of "new content" for the game on other platforms. Servers will remain online in the "foreseeable future" and any major issues that arise will also be addressed.

        <updated>2023-09-19T21:44:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this morning, various Xbox and Microsoft documents leaked online: emails, in-development plans, internal details, and more. It's how we learned Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games at one point, that Xbox is planning an Xbox Series X/S refresher for next year, that it might be working on remasters of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and that Microsoft has plans for a next-gen hybrid console in 2028. 
The leaks were quite extensive, and after some online confusion, we learned via Bloomberg that Microsoft accidentally provided federal courts with confidential (and not redacted) documents. Following news of these leaks, Spencer has now addressed what’s happened with a brief statement on Twitter. 
We've seen the conversation around old emails and documents. It is hard to see our team's work shared in this way because so much has changed and there's so much to be excited about right now, and in the future. We will share the real plans when we are ready.
September 19, 2023
He shared that on Twitter, but The Verge has obtained a more in-depth memo sent to Xbox employees. Here it is, in full: 
Something of note, especially for those particularly excited about something that might have leaked today, is that in both the internal memo to Xbox employees and the public-facing statement posted to Twitter, Spencer says these leaked documents and email are old and plans have changed. He also says the team will share "the real plans" when ready. Now, he obviously can't say the leaked information is what's happening and must downplay it as a result, but it's also a reminder to take everything that has come to light with a grain of salt because it's very likely plans have changed.

Although late and reportedly nowhere near ready, it has been given a name. Screenshots of 'Piracy Shield' obtained by an Italian website are interesting but deliberately give little away for security reasons. 'Luckily', what appears to be the platform's web portal can be located in seconds.

The past decade of innumerable remasters has been boring enough, but remastering these two games is particularly boring. When even bother when all Bethesda have made since Oblivion is Oblivion remakes with added spacesuits or yelling? Boring. But while I think the torrent of remasters is a miserable sign of big publishers just giving up, if they're going to do it anyway: why not Morrowind?

Scumhead's Franzen - released a few days ago on Steam and Itch - has a couple of big draws, straight off the bat. Firstly and least importantly, it's free, which it really shouldn't be. Secondly and more significantly, it's one of those rare RPG miniatures that is both richly imagined and snappy, with a busy and befuddling world in which you have immediate clear motivations that escalate rapidly and breed Dire Implications. It also looks like a 16-bit Pathologic, so consider me firmly on board.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first glance, Lies Of P looks like a wannabe Bloodborne reskin, replacing the Gothic edges of Yarnham with a twisted version of a kid's fairytale. There are silhouettes in windows sheltering from an infection that's plagued the populace and puppets who've gone awol. Take damage and you've got a chance to recoup the costs by smacking the baddie back. There's a bit where you platform down a large well, thin planks of wood marking your descent. Survive and you might want to visit your doll-like maiden and spend your souls.
But is Lies Of P just another boring pretender to Bloodborne? No! I think it's worked with its Gothic Pinocchio theme remarkably well, and the option to snap and configure your puppet lad to your liking makes its journey feel distinct. Sure, Lies Of P might lack some of the presence of its main inspiration, and not all of its parts come together to form a cohesive whole, but the game is an undeniable must for Soulslikers who crave the dark. It's perhaps the closest any Soulslike has felt to a FromSoft game, in everything from its presentation to the cadence of your character's jog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I dunno if you've heard of this game Starfield, but there's a lot of talk about it at the moment. It is a roleplaying experience where the role you play is not "Viking-ish warrior who can shout with the power of a million metal frontmen" or "wasteland wanderer downing cans of irradiated coke" but "person in space following a broadly unexciting A-plot". Much of the most interesting stuff in Starfield is on the periphery of the main story, as is the case with most Bethesda RPGs, but I find Starfield to be much less whimsical (something I won't relitigate here). As an RPG, Starfield is taking itself seriously, and sometimes this collides with the design game systems and menus.
An example of this is that you are supposed to experience the vastness of space, but cannot do so without going through a lot of loading screens. Another is that you have two sets of clothes: a spacesuit for places that are hostile and have no breathable atmosphere, and street clothes for planets that do. And NPCs keep making fun of me for wearing my spacesuit when I don't need to, and I hate them for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overnight, in what Edwin called an "unredacted document oopsie" related to Microsoft trying to buy ActiBlizz, two things have been revealed that interest me. Well, three. Firstly, Phil Spencer capitalises "Gaming", which I hate. Secondly, as noted in that linked story, Phil Spencer wants to buy Nintendo and, in pitying also-ran brackets, Valve, which has some of the same energy as me walking into an estate agent and demanding a six bedroom house with a new fitted kitchen and a hidden library. And thirdly, according to a release schedule from a presentation dated 2020, Bethesda and Zenimax have planned out their next few years of games in depressing MCU presentation-style. Boy, are the next couple of years going to be whelming.
As is predictable now, it is largely a list of sequels and remasters, many of them dated quite optimistically, it must be said. This document pegs Starfield for 2021, for example, and obviously that didn't happen. There are also two unnamed games on there for this year (Projects Kestrel and Platinum; 2021's Project Hibiki we know refers to the surprise-released Hi-Fi Rush) and it seems unlikely they're going to appear before the end of the year. We know The Elder Scrolls 6 isn't coming for at least another five years. They're going to remaster Oblivion (but not Morrowind, the weird cousin everyone else likes most, but whose parents aren't sure what job to give them in 2023). And they're going to make Dishonored 3. I'm excited about that! But also fearful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft and Xbox appeared in court earlier this year over its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Various previously unseen documents from those court proceedings have leaked, revealing Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games at one point, an Xbox Series X/S refresh and a new Xbox controller planned for 2024, and potential remasters of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Another leaked document details the company's plans for a next-gen hybrid console in 2028, as reported by The Verge.
This document stops short of revealing what the console is, what it could be called, and what it might look like one day. However, it reveals some key details about its architecture and how Xbox views it as a hybrid game platform that uses the cloud…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers, I have a confession to make. I might have to stop playing Starfield. Not because its main story quests are intensely boring and repetitive. And not because its planets are all mostly dull, lifeless husks. It's mainly because wherever I go in the universe, I'm haunted by the fleshy spectre of a misshapen man. I'm not even talking about the adoring fan (though he does also stalk my every step, too). Rather, I'm alluding to my own in-game father, who's randomly generated face and features are so utterly horrifying to me that I do a little sick in my mouth every time I run into him. Who can blame me, honestly, when his mouth is so high it clips right through his goddamn nose?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As you've hopefully read elsewhere on here, there's been an overnight windfall of insider info about Microsoft's long-term gaming biz objectives, thanks to documents accidentally released by the US Federal Trading Commission during its court case against Microsoft's Activision-Blizzard acquisition. We've learned that Microsoft are still rather keen on buying Nintendo (and Valve), and that the company had planned out the release of Dishonored 3, an Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remaster and a Ghostwire: Tokyo sequel during the run-up to its acquisition of ZeniMax. 


The leaked documents also include extensive internal pitch and presentation materials regarding Microsoft's first-party gaming operations all the way to 2030. We can apparently expect a mid-generation Xbox console refresh, code-named Brooklin, in 2024; more intriguing, from a PC gaming perspective, is the promise of a 2028-bound "hybrid" Xbox platform, which will centre on a "thin client" OS that runs cloud-based games on “< $99”, "consumer or handheld" devices. Oh no, it's the power of the cloud all over again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft and Xbox representatives appeared in court earlier this year to get its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard legally greenlit. Per usual court proceedings, various emails, documents, and more were sealed away from the public and press, but many unseen documents leaked this morning. It's how we learned Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games at one point, and that Microsoft is planning an Xbox Series X/S refresh with a new controller for next year. Other documents point to potential remasters of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, alongside other games. 
More specifically, a "ZeniMax Management Forecast" document details plans for various games, including the aforementioned remasters of Fallout 3 and Oblivion, alongside a potential sequel to 2022’s Ghostwire: Tokyo and a third installment in Arkane's Dishonored series.
You can take a look at the document for yourself below (credit to Game Pass Tracker on Twitter):

September 19, 2023
As you can see, this document mentions other games we know about, like Machine Games' Indiana Jones project, 2021's Deathloop, and the recently released Starfield. 
It also mentions The Elder Scrolls VI, which we just learned will launch no earlier than 2026 and will not launch on Sony's PlayStation 5. 
It's important to note that this leaked document is over three years old, so it's safe to assume plans have changed and that this schedule likely does not represent the company's current plans.
For more, read about how Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games in 2020, and then check out the refreshed Xbox Series X/S and new Xbox controller coming next year, according to internal Microsoft documents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am in control of the RPS Game Club this month, so therefore I can do whatever I want - and this time I'm delving into the world of Hypnospace Outlaw's music. No other game sounds like Hypnospace. Featuring a veritable mountain of tracks (most of which was composed by the game's creator, Jay Tholen), Hypnospace’s extensive catalogue stretches across genres both real and imaginary. While Seepage’s Nothing Left For Me is a clear pastiche of Linkin Park, Fre3zer’s Icy Girl is a purposefully poor attempt to mimic Coolpunk, a genre built upon remixes of a jingle for a discontinued soda brand. The most exciting thing about Hypnospace is that its soundtrack is so dense and complex that there's opportunity to hyperfocus on one particular area to an intense - even problematic - degree.
Enter The Chowder Man, a stetson wearing Kid Rock analogue who makes frequent appearances throughout Hypnospace. A prominent rock musician in the 80s, Erik Helman (portrayed beautifully by musician, comedian and inventor of the Rick Roll Hot Dad) is attempting a last-ditch revival after his music career flatlined, transforming him from Jagger-esque superstar to sold-out jingle writer. The Chowder Man’s in-game discography is strange and varied, spanning from glorious rock ballads to 22 second earworms about a microwavable butter-based dessert. Totalling ten tracks, I have decided that it is my duty - nay, my fate - to rank and review them in their entirety. So let us commence this spiritual journey together, my friends, into the complex mind of The Chowder Man.

A sizeable helping of the same, if a 2020-dated release schedule leaked as part of today's accidental FTC Microsoft court document blowout is to be believed. The document is from a July 2020 Microsoft presentation about the acquisition of ZeniMax, during the early months of the Covid pandemic - as such, it doesn't reflect Microsoft and ZeniMax's plans today, following global lockdowns and the buyout, and several of the dates are obviously bogus. Still, it's probably a good steer as to current and future Bethesda and ZeniMax projects, which may include Dishonored 3 and remasters of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Fallout 3.

It begins with Spencer speculating that Nintendo may be receptive to approaches, thanks to one of Microsoft's allies, San Fran investment fund ValueAct, buying up Nintendo stock and so, attempting to steer the company's board towards accepting an acquisition.

Per The Verge, as a part of the ongoing FTC vs. Microsoft case over the latter’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft released a document to the court featuring a chart illustrating its approach to releasing Bethesda games since purchasing the publisher. It lists each title released under the Microsoft banner with details such as its release window and targeted platforms.

Mortal Kombat 1 might be using its conspicuous numeric digit to suggest a reset or rethink of some kind, but in truth it isn't remotely concerned with reinventing its world of misfits. While part of me wishes this surface-level overhaul had been more radical, it's maybe unwise to expect that. For decades this series has embraced its love of brainless ultraviolence and childish storytelling. If Mortal Kombat 1 can be praised for anything, it is unwavering kommitment to the bit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Often when we talk about "hype" surrounding a release, it’s in anticipation of shared cultural euphoria more than that of a great gaming experience. Either way, a great RPG game hits different. Recently, Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate 3 have both been landmarks. Not to mention the enduring sweep of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and the Minesweeper-esque ubiquity of Skyrim. When studios get the RPG right, the end result inspires excitement and devotion in ways that feel utterly unique to the genre.
To this end I chatted to Dragon Age, Baldur’s Gate, and Mass Effect maestro Mark Darrah, some of the folks at Studio ZA/UM, and the minds behind the two definitive tomes on CRPG history: Matt Barton of Dungeons And Desktops, and Felipe Pepe of The CRPG Book. I wanted to ask these genere experts about all things choice and consequence, player freedom, and Baldur’s Gate 3’s phenomenal success. What turns a niche into a phenomenon? What goes into creating a great RPG? And what makes the genre so special to people? Turns out that last one is a big question to ask.

While AMD has a very robust portfolio for the high-end server space with 4th Gen EPYC, today AMD is introducing the EPYC 8004 "Siena" processors for "intelligent edge" servers.

It's part of the surprisingly prosperous genre of "team up to complete some big unwieldy task with multiple moving parts" games, and while it hasn't yet hit the highs of Overcooked or reached the terrible depths of Barotrauma, I think the recently launched Early Access build might be worth your time. Amongst other things, it's trying for a curious blend of jolly party game and macabre theocracy work simulator. And it does have some rather swanky-looking ships.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the weekend, Starfield players began to share reports of a strange paranormal infestation. There are asteroids in the game that, for reasons known only to gods and/or programmers, follow you from orbit to orbit, flying eerily in formation with your ship, and sometimes even accompanying you to a planet's surface. "In one of my weirdest Bethesda glitch experiences, I've got a tiny asteroid that's been following me for the past 30 hours," user ReverendRoo posted on Reddit, triggering an avalanche of comments reminiscent of UFO chasers spotting each other at a NASA open day. "I would catch a glimpse of it from time to time," wrote fattfett. "I tried to approach it but you can't. It stays away. I assumed it had a deeper meaning [toward] the endgame." Some players, like Blackdius, have multiple asteroids in tow. It seems impossible to blow them up. I've dug up a Youtube video below of one such clingy space boulder from a couple of weeks back. As you can see, it's not just a fixed background point like a screen artefact, but seems to move in response to the player's ship. Most peculiar.

Not so with Payday 3. It's due to release on September 21st, but its developers have decided to handle things themselves.

"Denuvo is no longer in Paday 3," they announced yesterday, ahead of its release on September 21st.

Following the apocalyptic events of Mortal Kombat 11 and its story-based expansion, Mortal Kombat 1 represents a new era for the franchise’s characters. While it purports to do the same for the video game series, the more I played Mortal Kombat 1, the more familiar the latest entry felt, but that’s far from a bad thing.
Mortal Kombat 1 brings the tight gameplay of its predecessors to the next level. Every punch, kick, throw, and special move feels impactful in the dances of death in which its characters participate. Once you get a fe…]]></summary>

Samsung is currently running a money-back promotion that brings this high-end PCIe 4.0 drive down to an attractively low price in both 1TB and 2TB varieties. 
You can get £30 back on the 2TB size, bringing the price to £94, while the 1TB size offers £20 back, resulting in a final price of £52. (This cashback offer runs until 9th October 2023, for the record; see their site for more info.) These are great deals and well worth considering if you want to upgrade your PC (or even PS5) with one of the fastest SSDs on the market.

Whether it's the rush of stars streaking past a ship going into hyperspace or the distinct hum of a lightsaber, Respawn really went all out to match the aesthetic of one of the world's biggest movie franchises. One of the most important elements in achieving that is through music, and while the Star Wars sound is iconic and well-known, a good video game score has to be more than just an imitation of what came before. The music for Jedi: Survivor was written by Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab, and when I ask them what makes a good video game soundtrack, they answer in unison.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We often hear that videogames can have a positive impact upon the world, but this is the first time I've seen somebody use one - an antique strategy sim, no less - to advocate for appropriately balancing the level design of your front lawn so as to stop indigenous insects being overrun by smaller invading species. The scientific research paper in question - uploaded in August this year, and brought to my attention by RPS contributor and apparent ant enthusiast Matt Cox - sees researchers Samuel J. Lymbery, Bruce L. Webber and Raphael K. Didham use Age of Empires 2 to study how human shaping of the environment affects the balance of power between the indigenous Australian "meat ant", or Iridomyrmex purpureus, and the Argentine ant, or Linepithema humile, who are one of the world's more invasive ant species.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the things I like best about Die Gute Fabrik's forthcoming Saltsea Chronicles is an optional feature. It's a card game, Spoils, which you can play while sojourning upon the game's islands and searching for clues about your ship's missing captain, Maja. Here's how it works: two teams of two characters take turns to play cards, moving in clockwise around a table. Players must follow the lead player's suit, and the highest-scoring card wins the trick, with four tricks comprising a round. It might sound like a straightforward competition, but different islands offer different house rules, and there are twists that reflect the game's ethic of community, mutual respect and diversity, and help animate the detail of its gently post-apocalyptic oceanic world. 
The winning card from each trick is handed to the loser, so victory is, in its way, an act of generosity. Score more than 100 points in a round, meanwhile, and the "Hoarding" rule means you must relinquish those points to the other team. As Die Gute Fabrik's CEO and creative lead Hannah Nicklin observes, this fits the anti-capitalist politics and mythology of Saltsea, in which "hoarding is sort of seen as the apocryphal cause of the flood". The Spoils tutorial menus riff on this with a cute but mildly unsettling image of a sinking ship.

With two fantastic Spider-Man games under Insomniac’s belt, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 feels like the culmination of the 2018 game and 2020’s Miles Morales in all the best ways. At a recent preview event, I spent roughly 90 minutes swinging and gliding across its new and improved New York City, taking down scores of bad guys and even challenging the Lizard. When my session concluded, I walked away thinking one thing: The first two games swung so that this third act could soar.

A new trailer for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth dropped last night during the Playstation State Of Play stream, and holy cow, despite feeling a bit ill and exhausted and generally not firing on all cylinders at the moment, I think I might be more pumped for this than literally any other video game on the horizon right now. Even that long-awaited PC release of Final Fantasy 16 can't quite compare to this, if you ask me, and I might even be more enthused by it than the prospect of a Switch 2. And I don't even really like Final Fantasy VII! That's how much Nomura's mad, timey-wimey game child has sunk its teeth into me. I'm mostly here just to see what mad nonsense comes Cloud's way next - and from the looks of things, it's a lot.

Fed up of waiting for a big publisher to revive a series that’s been lying dormant for decades? Simply do it yourself instead. 11 years after the release of Jet Set Radio Future, and with Sega seemingly unwilling to exhume their cult-favourite rollerblading series outside of weird crossovers with Ubisoft’s Roller Champions of all things, Team Reptile have done exactly that.
Enter Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, as authentic a sequel to Jet Set Radio as you can get. Dripping with style and oozing cool, the team have crafted a carefully observed love letter that both respects and advances the original duology in meaningful ways, while taking a step back in others.

I love the open-world RPGs of the series' recent years, especially Assassin's Creed Origins and Odyssey, but I’d be lying if I said I was a fan of their respective cities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US author and artist Bill Willingham has rather dramatically announced that he is placing the Fables comicbook property in the public domain, including all Fables spin-offs and characters. This means that - pending a judgement from third-party legal experts, anyway - anyone can now create art of any kind set in the Fables universe. "What was once wholly owned by Bill Willingham is now owned by everyone, for all time," the author wrote on his Substack. "It's done, and as most experts will tell you, once done it cannot be undone. Take-backs are neither contemplated nor possible."


You might recognise Fables as the universe in which Telltale's The Wolf Among Us is set. It's a grubby noir fairytale world in which bedtime story characters like Snow White and Prince Charming live discreetly among regular humans, aka Mundies, having been driven from their homelands by a mysterious Adversary. I confess I've not read any of the original comics - I've only ever played the Telltale adaptation, which I enjoyed. I feel guilty about that in hindsight, because Willingham seems to have a pretty dim view of Telltale's work, though that's partly to do with what he considers to be his longstanding unfair treatment by Fables publisher DC Comics.

As you can probably tell, they're all focused on different genres, different League heroes, and have all come from different developers - and soon they'll be joined by Song Of Nunu, the next game from Rime developers Tequila Works. 
I got to play a very small slice of it at Gamescom last month, and yep, if you've been craving another low stakes adventure that's all but guaranteed to wrench at your heartstrings and wibble your tear ducts, Song Of Nunu will almost certainly fill that Rime-shaped hole in your life when it comes to PC on November 1st.

Alongside news of Rebirth's release date, Square Enix and PlayStation also released a new and expansive trailer during today's State of Play. In it, we get our first looks at characters like Cait Sith, Vincent Valentine, and more. We also get to see The Gold Saucer, some fun minigames inspired by the visual style of Final Fantasy VII on PS1, and more of the game's open area exploration, which features ridable chocobos, vehicles, and segways.

Peter Parker's old high-school is a location you can visit, as well as Miles Morales' Visions Academy
You will be able to swap between Parker Spider-Man and Morales Spider-Man almost instantly
New U.I. options and more visually interesting tasks to do around the city will, hopefully, prevent you from using the menus too much
Parker and Morales can user a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man app
Folks will make requests for Spider-Man's help. Sometimes they want a specific Spider-Man, often they don't care
There is a new fast-travel system
There are over 65 suits to unlock and wear

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, during Sony's recent State of Play livestream, we got a look at both the upcoming PSVR2 update and story DLC for the Resident Evil 4 Remake. 
The VR trailer is brief but does show the game in action. Much like the other VR port of RE4, the move brings the whole game into virtual reality. The big news is that the update is coming this winter.


More immediately, we finally got confirmation that "Separate Ways" is coming to RE4. For the uninitiated, Separate Ways was a side campaign starring, you guessed it, Ada Wong, initially released with the PlayStation 2 and all subsequent versions of the original Resident Evil 4. Separate Ways will be released next week, on September 21.
Moreover, Both Ada Wong and Albert Wesker will be made available as playable characters in the Mercenaries game mode.
For more Resident Evil 4 Remake, check out our review.
Correction: An earlier version of this story mistakenly identified "Separate Ways" as "Assignment Ada." We regret the error.]]></summary>

Today's trailer stopped short of revealing a more exact release date, though. Baby Steps was revealed during a June PlayStation State of Play earlier this year. In it, players control Nate, an "unemployed failson with nothing going for him until one day, he discovers a power he never knew he had: putting one foot in front of the other." And as you might expect, players will control Nate on his journey to discover more of the world around him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another Code: Two Memories, or Trace Memory as it's known in North America, is a Nintendo DS game that launched on the handheld device way back in 2005. Its sequel, Another Code: R – Journey Into Lost Memories, launched on the Wii in 2009, but it never came to North America. Now, players can experience both games when Another Code: Recollection hits Switch in January. 
Another Code: Recollection is an enhanced collection of Trace Memory and Another Code: R launching on Switch on January 19, 2024. During today's Nintendo Direct, Nintendo revealed this collection of games with a new trailer showing enhanced visuals while pulling back the curtains on protagonist Ashley, who is traveling to the remote Blood Edward Island in search of her father. 
Check out the Another Code: Recollection reveal trailer for yourself below: 


After Ashley receives a letter from her father, who she believes to be dead, a chain of mysteries and visions from the past is set off, sending her to Blood Edward Island. There, Ashley must investigate her surroundings while solving puzzles to reveal the truth. Another Code: R completes Ashley's tale. In it, she journeys to Lake Juliet two years after the events of Trace Memory to uncover the hidden truth surrounding her mother. 
"This collection includes fully enhanced versions of both original games, featuring overhauled visuals, fully explorable environments, new voice acting, puzzles, music, and more," Nintendo's description of the game reads. "Optional hint and navigation systems have been added to help players new to adventure games." 
Another Code: Recollection will cost $59.99 and launch on Switch on January 19, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dave the Diver has been one of the sleeper hits of the very busy year of video games that 2023 has been so far and continues to be. Dave the Diver hit PC earlier this year but now, developer Mintrocket has revealed the sushi restaurant management game will hit Switch next month. 
More specifically, Dave the Diver will launch on Switch on October 26, and it will do so with Switch-exclusive bonuses, but only for those who preorder.


The game will cost $19.99 on Switch and you can preorder it on the Nintendo eShop right now. You can also check out a demo of the game on Switch right now, too. Preordering the game before its release will get you a bonus skin for Dave's boat and an exclusive lamp decoration for the sushi restaurant. Mintrocket describes the boat skin as nostalgic and themed after an 8-bit visual style, whereas the lamp depicts Dave "in [a] charming retro style." 
"We're over the moon seeing and hearing the reception to our first game," Dave the Diver game director Jaeho Hwang writes in a press release. "Bringing this to the Switch community has been an important goal for us as we think the console is a home where the players will truly appreciate everything Dave the Diver has to offer." 
For the uninitiated, Dave the Diver tasks players with diving underwater to gather ingredients by day that are used to serve hungry customers at a seaside sushi restaurant at night. However, there's a mystery bubbling up from "the deepest depths of the Blue Hole, the setting that [Dave] will swim through in this incredible journey." 
Dave the Diver is currently available on PC. It hits Switch on October 26. 
While waiting for its Switch release, read Game Informer's Dave the Diver review.

Then I downloaded arcade racer Horizon Chase Turbo and basically played nothing else. It was fast, accessible, a throwback to the Amiga racers of my youth, and perfect for sneaking in between work meetings and emails.

Now its sequel Horizon Chase 2 is out on PC... but only via the Epic Games Store. Damn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Robotality and publisher Chucklefish have announced that Wargroove 2 will be released next month. More specifically, the sequel hits Switch and PC on October 5, just a few months shy of the first Wargroove's fourth anniversary. 
Chucklefish announced the Wargroove 2 release date during today's Nintendo Direct alongside a new trailer showing more of the game's beautiful pixel art and challenging turn-based combat. It also highlighted the new commanders to control, a new playable faction in Wargroove 2, and the sequel's three interweaving campaigns. 
Check out the Wargroove 2 release date trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, this new trailer reveals the Faahri Republic, which Chucklefish describes as "a nation of curious mouse-folk who have landed in Aurania on a scholarly expedition."
"What the Faahri Republic lacks in military experience, they more than make up for with academic theory," a press release reads. "Equipped with mysterious crystal technology, Commanders Lytra, Pistil, and Rhomb must work together in pursuit of information for their mysterious benefactors." 
Elsewhere in the press release, Chucklefish says Wargroove 2 features new recruits and veteran wardogs to control alongside the game's new commanders. You can supercharge those commanders with a newly updated Groove system, too. Once you're done with Wargroove 2's three campaign arcs, you can battle with or against friends in co-op and multiplayer modes, both locally and online, with up to three other players. 

Preorders for Wargroove 2 are now live on PC and Switch. On Steam and Nintendo Europe and North American eShops, you can preorder for 20% off today. The game's full price is $19.99.
Wargroove 2 hits Switch and PC next month on October 5. 
While waiting to learn more, watch this Wargroove 2 trailer and then read Game Informer's Wargroove review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vanillaware released 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim in 2020, and it was a bit of a sleeper hit. However, this team is also behind other games like Dragon's Crown and Odin Sphere. Now, Vanillaware has announced Unicorn Overlord, a new tactical fantasy RPG, and it launches March 8 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4 as a digital-only game, and Switch.
During today's Nintendo Direct, the team announced this new game with a trailer showcasing its various characters, unique art style, and tactics gameplay. And perhaps unsurprisingly, it looks great. 
Check out the Unicorn Overlord reveal trailer for yourself below: 


Vanillaware says Unicorn Overlord combines overworld exploration with an innovative battle system that's very reminiscent of Vanillaware's combat style. In the game, you'll "traverse the vibrant world, cultivate a grand army with over 60 uniquely designed characters, and grow your renown throughout the five nations in this unique epic fantasy experience." 
In addition to a Standard Edition of Unicorn Overlord, Vanillaware will also release a Collector's Edition that includes a physical copy of the game, a premium box, a 16-bit BGM soundtrack CD that consists of two discs with 10 tracks on each, a 132-page artbook, and an original card game for Unicorn Overlord that includes 239 cards, tokens, and markers. The Collector's Edition also includes the "Atlus x Vanillaware Heraldry pack and preorder DLC, which lets you customize the Liberation Army’s flag with emblem designs from Odin Sphere, Dragon's Crown, and 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim." 
Unicorn Overlord launches on March 8, 2024, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4 (digital only), and Switch. 
While waiting for its release, read Game Informer's 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim review and then check out our thoughts on Dragon's Crown. After that, read Game Informer's Odin Sphere review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Nintendo Direct, the company announced release dates and windows for some highly anticipated Amiibo figures, namely, the Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the Noah and Mio Amiibo for Xenoblade Chronicles 3, and the Kingdom Hearts Sora Amiibo for his inclusion on the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate roster. 
All five Amiibo look great, as Nintendo has especially become great at making these figures compared to the first few runs of Amiibo. Nintendo announced that the Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo for Tears of the Kingdom were coming back in June, and now we know exactly when: both hit stores on November 3. While the two figures were announced together, each will be sold individually. Each Amiibo unlocks a special fabric for your paraglider in Tears of the Kingdom and special materials and weapons for the game. 
The Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Noah and Mio Amiibo go live on January 19, 2024. These two will be released as a single set. The Noah Amiibo gets you Consul N’s Armor for Noah in-game and the Leisure Time outfits for Noah, Lanz, and Eunie. The Mio Amiibo unlocks Consul M’s Armor for Mio and Leisure Time outfits for Mio, Sena, and Taion. 
And finally, the Kingdom Hearts Sora Amiibo for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will join the figure lineup sometime in 2024. 
While waiting to get each, read Game Informer's review of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and then read Game Informer's review of Xenoblade Chronicles 3. After that, watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg reports that two Unity Technologies Inc. offices closed today following a "credible death threat" amidst ongoing controversy regarding a new per-install fee implemented for developers using Unity. The company also canceled a planned town hall, according to Bloomberg. 
Two days ago, Unity revealed plans to charge developers using the Unity video game engine a per-install fee that would be enacted every time a player installed their games. Developers were quick to point out issues with this per-install fee, like players' ability to install, delete, install, rinse, and repeat to cost developers money as a form of retaliation, amongst other things. Many developers publicly called for Unity to walk back these changes. While Unity has addressed some of the concerns, developers are still wary of trusting the company moving forward, with some developers signaling they might move development to completely different engines in light of this fee. 
Unity CEO John Riccitiello had plans to address company staff during a town hall this morning but instead canceled it and closed the company's Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, California, offices as a result of death threats Unity received it perceived to be credible.

The terrible beauty of that generator-based exploration and scavenging loop. That moment when you walk just a little too quickly down a corridor, and hear the awful rummaging in the walls. The agonising discovery that not only is it possible to roam with the lights out, but pretty much required, beyond a certain point. The dense burden of grasping more or less where to go, without knowing how to survive the journey - and above all else, those goddamn rats, always encountered where least convenient. Shoo! Shoo!
It's by far the most oppressive and demanding horror game I've played in recent memory, and it'll get considerably worse with the release of the Halloween update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On paper, Final Fantasy XIV doesn’t do a very good job of encouraging fishing. FFXIV’s lead director and producer Naoki Yoshida — known as Yoshi P — wanted to create something that was "fun, but relaxing”, and there aren’t a lot of material rewards for the time you put in. You can sell the fish or break them down into other materials, but really the only reason to fish is for the sake of fishing itself. 

And yet today Final Fantasy XIV is home to a close knit fishing community of over 27,000 people. This single shared interest has spun off into many different directions, including fishing as a competitive journey, the process of building a space for the hobby itself, and even a kind of metagame. But the main thread tying these all together is the love for fishing, and the community’s central hub is actually located outside of the game - in a Discord server called Fisherman’s Horizon, lovingly nicknamed Fishcord.

I fear we are reaching that point with the life and times of Mary Read, my Starfield character and nowadays quite accomplished space pirate, who has sworn never to land on a planet ever again. 


Immediately after conquering the Chimera in Part 2 of the Starfield No-Planet Run, I commandeered a UC Longsword II on the other side of the same system. The Longsword has proven a predator without equal, charging straight through opposing craft even when they've got several levels on me, its unforgiving autocannons forming the dominant bassline of every encounter. Frankly, it's getting repetitive, and while the obvious remedy is to plunge cackling and crying into a star system with an AI threat level in the high double digits, I doubt that will really alter the rhythms of Starfield's ship combat - it'll just mean I have to do some grinding.

On top of that, the company revealed that all versions will receive a closed beta test next month, complete with crossplay.
In Battle Crush, players choose a character and fight to be the strongest of a pool of 30 players as the ground collapses around them. Due to ever-encroaching waves of enemies and unique battle arenas, players must be thoughtful with their placement and strategies. The player characters, called Calixers, cover a wide range of influences, often drawing inspiration from mythological figures. Battle royale may be the main mode, but Battle Crush also offers Brawl mode, where a player chooses three Calixers to fight with on a smaller map, and Build-Up, a one-on-one mode where two players compete for a best-of-five series.
Players can sign up for Battle Crush's closed beta test, which is slated to run from October 23 through October 30 on Switch, PC, and Android. Battle Crush is currently planned to launch in spring 2024.]]></summary>

The 2020 launch of Cyberpunk 2077 was terrible. Anticipation reached a point that no reasonable game could meet. Cyberpunk could have potentially grappled with those lofty expectations, but the major problem was its technical proficiency – or lack thereof. Despite the game getting good reviews (a product of press only being given PC copies) for most players, the game crashed frequently or was riddled with bugs. The PlayStation 4 version was pulled from shelves and taken offline. The content of the game – the story, the characters, the mechanics – was barely discussed in the face of players struggling even to explore the neon-soaked streets of Night City. It was a disaster, and fingers were pointed in many directions at…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this summer, Nintendo revealed WarioWare: Move It, a new game set in the long-running "microgame" series. Ahead of its release later this year in November, Nintendo released a new trailer for WarioWare: Move It during today's Nintendo Direct. In it, we learned more about its various microgames and what a "Form" is. 
Forms are the specific poses players must perform during microgames. You might have to squat down and flap your arms, like a chicken, to push an egg out of your virtual WarioWare: Move It avatar, for example. In these microgames, you'll need to perform the correct action while in the right form as quick as you can. And you'll need to do so quickly because Nintendo says microgames come one after another in quick succession. 
Check these WarioWare: Move It microgames out for yourself in the trailer below: 


Eslewhere in today's trailer, we learned more about WarioWare: Move It's Party Mode, which will allow up to four players to compete against each other. You might have to reach a goal without getting caught by Medusa's gaze, for example, or settle a score in an arena to be the last one posing. 
Between Party Mode and the single-player modes of WarioWare: Move It, Nintendo says there are over 200 microgames to play through. 
WarioWare: Move It hits Switch November 3.

For the most part, it seems to be largely the same game you played back on the Nintendo 3DS – albeit with much better graphics. We got a first look at gameplay today, too, which you can see in the full trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been 30 years since the release of the original F-Zero, and as a tribute, Nintendo is creating a new version of the beloved racer. F-Zero 99 is a battle royale version of the game, similar to other recent Switch experiments like Tetris 99 and Mario 35. Check out the reveal trailer below.


The game will take place on classic F-Zero courses with machines from the original SNES game, and as the name implies, it will support up to 99 players at once. In addition to beating the competition, you'll have to avoid running into obstacles to keep from exploding. You can also complete missions to unlock new cosmetic options to customize your machine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this summer, Nintendo announced that Princess Peach was getting her own game. At the time, they referred to the project as Untitled Princess Peach Game but during today's Nintendo Direct, the company revealed its official name: Princess Peach Showtime! 
Princess Peach Showtime hits Switch early next year on March 22. Alongside the reveal of the game's name and its release date, Nintendo also shared new details about what to expect. Princess Peach and some Toads took a trip to the Sparkle Theater to see a play. But when the Wicked Grape and the Sour Bunch arrive, it's up to Princess Peach to save the day . 
Check it out for yourself in the Princess Peach Showtime trailer below:


Princess Peach hops onto the stage with the help of Sparkle Theater guardian Stella to take down the Sour Bunch and hopefully, their leader, Wicked Grape. To do that, Princess Peach will have to make her way through a variety of plays, transforming along the way. We see her become Swordfighter Peach, with a Muskateer-esque outfit to go with it. As Swordfighter Peach, she can use a rapier to take down the Sour Bunch and other enemies before her. But that's just one play. 
Today's trailer also revealed Princess Peach will become Detective Peach to determine who is stealing artifacts from a museum. We also see her become Patisserie Peach in an effort to find stolen desserts, and Kung Fu Peach to stop the Sour Bunch from taking over a martial arts school. 

This was just a taste of the transformations that await in Princess Peach Showtime, too. 
Princess Peach Showtime hits Switch on March 22, 2024.

Anyway, I like a kick, and I like a game that manages to actually be funny, and I have been playing Deathbulge: Battle Of The Bands. You do the math(s).
I actually wrote about Deathbulge in a round up of best demos in a Steam Next Fest back in 2020, at which time I enjoyed the RPG antics of a band entering a cursed Battle Of The Bands competition and finding out that it's a fight to the death. The full thing came out a month ago without my noticing, and got past the endpoint of the demo. It's fun! I'm enjoying the combat, which is both real-time and turn-based, and has some surprisingly deep tactics attached to it. But more importantly, the full Deathbulge game starts in a town where you enter houses by kicking doors in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the Lenovo Legion Go revealed itself, I was unconvinced by its portability credentials but enticed by the wireless mouse transmogrification of its detachable, Nintendo Switch-like controllers. A sparkling sliver of Swiss Army handheld design, providing a familiar taste of desktop play that the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally could never achieve without a USB dock.
Turns out, now that I’ve tried the Legion Go for myself, I was worried about the wrong thing. It’s nowhere near as heavy or cumbersome as it looks, and while the breakaway controls remain an exciting prospect, they also risk introducing an acute pain point. At the very least, the model I tested proved highly vulnerable to lead-handed RPS hardware editors, because I left the building very much with the impression that I’d broken it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As gaming at large gorges itself on a feast of fantastic titles, PCVR crawls beneath the table licking up the crumbs. There are tasty treats simmering in the kitchen, like the remake of The 7th Guest and sequels to I Expect You To Die and Arizona Sunshine, but right now all the fine dining is happening on Quest and PSVR2, covering which would involve running my thumb under RPS' hermetic PC seal.


In my desperation, I've turned to golf, something I would never consider under normal circumstances. I feel about golf the same way I feel about the UK Conservative party, insofar as both occupy space that would be better filled with trees. But I haven't gone totally tartan slacks. We're only entering the realm of minigolf, which I am more positively inclined toward. It lacks the pretensions and exclusionary nature of its bigger, paunchier cousin. Anybody can rock up to a minigolf course with a putter and nobody will sneer at you for being shit at it. It's also small and inherently naff, traits I can likewise relate to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a couple of days of furious game developer reactions, game engine company Unity have backtracked a teensy bit on their plan to charge developers who meet certain revenue and copies-sold thresholds a "runtime fee" for every installation of their game.
The company will only make developers pay extra for the first installation of a game on a new device - so no fees for reinstallations, in theory, and no prospect of spiteful players "install bombing" games to drive up costs for their creators. However, the company haven't stated how or indeed, if they can distinguish legitimate from illegitimate installations in advance, seemingly because their method for tracking installations is based on "estimates" using a proprietary data-gathering system, which they aren't able to discuss in depth.

Minecraft! After a month reporting on the barren planets of Starfield and plundering the rather more involving dungeons of Baldur's Gate 3, it's almost steadying to remember that these supposed titans are but momentary flickers, transient particles in the sunken Creeper eyesocket of Mojang's behemoth. And what a time to rediscover the game. Vanilla Minecraft has always felt like an autumnal creation to me, even before they added all the pumpkin heads - a game of long nights and campfires, with an ambience derived from Tove Jansson's Moomin books. Anyway, here's the teaser trailer for Minecraft Live.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s something that feels oddly momentous about sending one of Dune: Spice Wars’ harvesters to get to work worm-dodging while hoovering up MSG (magical space glitter). It was, after all, Dune II’s implementation of these trucks that are largely responsible for the shape of the entire RTS genre. I’ve mused before that if you count Alien as something that wouldn’t exist without Dune, along with the effects the RTS had on esports, it's wild to consider how different gaming could have been if Frank Herbert hadn’t visited Florence in 1957 to chronicle a natural phenomenon. It’s one heck of a butterfly effect, which is fitting, because Spice Wars itself can often feel like a creative exploration of how integral butterfly effects are to grand strategy rulesets. Forget those harvesters for a moment, because this dry but undeniably captivating 4X is all about the steamroll.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can’t fault the pitch. In Gunbrella you’re a sort of cowboy dude with a shotgun that’s also an umbrella. You use the umbrella to deflect enemy projectiles, block attacks, fly up into the air like a furious Mary Poppins and zoom along ziplines. You use the shotgun, as you might reasonably expect, to do the majority of your big murdering.


Gunbrella is a classic 2D platform shooter in the style of a steampunk western. It’s like Deadwood crossed with Singin’ In The Rain, if Gene Kelly ever used his umbrella to blow holes through anyone who didn’t sufficiently praise his tap dancing. Some light exploration bits have you travelling by train from frontier towns to mining villages, much of them decorated with giant spinning cogs – so you know it’s steampunk – and populated by a small cast of quest-giving locals, pill-dispensing shopkeepers and monologuing villains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favourite TV shows is The Rookie, because you never have any idea what could happen next. No episode can go more than five minutes without some kind of twist, often with no relation to anything that has happened up until that point. Like, you think the stand-off between criminals and their victims in a courthouse nuclear bunker has been resolved, but it turns out that while the camera was off him, a lawyer got stabbed by someone else. Hauma is bringing that kind of energy to the visual novel space. 
You play as Judith, a former detective and champion boxer who's wrapped up in solving the case her grandfather was working on before he died. On its face, Hauma is therefore a detective game in a pretty cool 2D comic book-style, with a slightly worse version of the Frogwares Sherlock Holmes mind palace as your inventory of clues, which you combine to logic your way through puzzles. But at the point where you're in a tunnel under the ruins of a Nazi temple in Munich, having discovered that the MacGuffin is a shin bone carved with the recipe for an eternal life drink (which was stolen by some nuns and taken to Bavaria, and then the nuns all got pregnant I guess?) - and, secondly, having recently survived a massive explosion at an Oktoberfest beer tent - you kind of think, well, things have gotten quite out of hand, haven't they?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cor, has it really been almost half a year since we've done one of these? Apologies, readers. I honestly don't know where the time goes. It's probably because we're spending too much time with our favourite guilty pleasure games, which is the subject of this latest Ask RPS column.  
The question comes courtesy of ronzilla, who asked: What were your favourite guilty pleasure games of 2022? As in, I play this all the time and I'm semi-embarrassed to admit it? 
A good question! In canvassing the wider RPS Treehouse for their responses, it quickly became clear that most of our guilty pleasure games extend way beyond the bounds of just the year 2022, so we've answered a bit more broadly than the original question perhaps intended. Still, hopefully there are still some entertaining answers in here nonetheless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The internet isn’t fun anymore. Actually, that statement isn’t severe enough to reflect how bad the internet is these days, so let me try that again: being online in 2023 is a fucking nightmare. There are only three websites. They are all designed to make you angry because it’s the most profitable emotion. Your aunt was indoctrinated into fascism by a page called “This country used to have real bin men” after she liked a meme about glass milk bottles in 2012. Every boy you went to school with has a podcast about football now. Your Mam once warned you about spending too much time on the computer but now spends eight hours a day playing Hay Day on her phone. AI was meant to let us lie in fields and read books, but instead it’s being used to show you what Breaking Bad would have looked like as an anime.
But it didn’t used to be like this! Obviously I don’t need to remind our regular readers about the glory days of the information superhighway because some of you are old enough to be my Dad (and I’m thirty-one) but just in case a member of Gen Z has stumbled upon this article by accident: the internet used to be fun. Like, really fun, and Hypnospace Outlaw is living proof of it.

Id Software's 1997 shooter was fancied up with a remaster released as a free update in August, complete with all the old stuff and one notable new addition. MachineGames, the studio behind the modern Wolfenstein games, have created a whole new story campaign for the remaster. I've really enjoyed playing it. It's the old Quake 2 you know and have complicated feelings about, filtered through modern design sensibilities. I think both veterans and newcomers could enjoy blasting these biomechanical alien horrors.

"[It's] just struggling with finding time and you know, being interested in a story, wanting to see it through," he said. "So it can even be daunting at times to start playing a game that you know is really, really long."

In case you're wondering, I've checked with the authorities and yes, PHARAOH should be written in all capitals, making a laughing stock of all previous RPS reporting. If it feels unnatural, try to imagine that you're bellowing the game's title from the summit of a pyramid, so as to remind your embattled subjects of your magnificence. RPS boss Katharine behaves similarly in morning meetings. "EDITOR-IN-CHIEF," she roars at us repeatedly, until somebody rushes her the daily traffic reports, a steaming goblet of sphinx eggs and a gif of a crafty kill in Shadow Gambit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Usually, when a player is going through a strategy game, they figure out how things work by trial and error," Total War: Pharaoh's game director Todor Nikolov tells me at this year's Gamescom. "And once they do, they feel the urge to start a brand-new campaign because they've already figured out that portion of the gameplay."
Sitting across the table, these words ring frighteningly true for me. Unbeknownst to Nikolov, he has just described the exact experience I had playing the 50-turn campaign preview for Pharaoh a week earlier to an absolute tee. Unlike the far more knowledgeable brain of frequent RPS contributor Nic Reuben, I am a complete babe in arms when it comes to the Total War juggernaut machine, and it took me attempting to play two other games in the series (Three Kingdoms and Troy) and several restarts in Pharaoh itself before I felt just about confident that I (very vaguely) knew what I was doing. At the time, I thought, 'Man alive, how is Total War still so rubbish at teaching players how it works?' But when I speak to Nikolov a week later, he has some very welcome news for me: there's going to be a dedicated tutorial campaign where players can (hopefully) find their feet. Music to my ears.

This song believes in you, aggressively so. "MythForce! MythForce! Everyday people become heroes! / MythForce! MythForce! You and me, we can defeat evil!" The roguelike dungeon dallying that follows doesn't take that "you can do it!" Saturday morning cartoon flavour to its comedic conclusion in the same way an Adult Swim animation might, or a Devolver game would. Instead the real focus seems to be function over flavour, resulting in a skeleton-battering jaunt that is competent and comfortable, yet never fully embracing the silliness promised by the sick guitar riffs of the theme.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being a dedicated spacer I've never had much interest in the base construction aspect of Starfield, but that was before I learned that you can spacewalk by means of console commands, aka cheats. Reddit user WeirdConcern4666 made history on this front yesterday. Here's how you do it: 1) get up from the cockpit controls, 2) hit the tilde key to open the command console at the bottom of the screen, 3) type "player.setpos x 10" to teleport your character outside the ship, then hit return and 4) type "setgravityscale 0" to engage zero gravity and stop your character plummeting endlessly. Then hit the tilde key again to close the command console, and well, there you go.
Space sure is bigger outside a spaceship, isn't it? Just as well you brought that jetpack. If your vessel of choice is on the bulky side, like mine, you might need to increase the number on the end of "player.setpos" to escape the invisible barriers around your craft's exterior. Witness my character Mary Read's first attempts at a spacewalk below. If you've somehow discarded your jetpack, you can always punt yourself about with the recoil from an appropriately chunky firearm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know about you, but after spending 100+ hours in both Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Assassin's Creed Valhalla, I'm well up for an AC game that reins its open world in a bit and goes back to the sort-of single city stab-athon the series used to be. The ones where stealth actually mattered, and you felt like a proper assassin working from the shadows. Assassin's Creed Mirage is all this to a tee - as Ubisoft have taken great pains to remind us over the last year as they gear up to celebrate the series' 15th anniversary. 
And after spending three hours playing some of its early mission sequences, I can confirm this is very much a game whose sole purpose is to scratch that nostalgic itch good and proper (before we inevitably hurl ourselves into the still very ambiguous void of whatever the heck Assassin's Creed Infinity is). If, however, you don't have much fondness for those older games, and prefer the more action-oriented RPG-ing of recent Creeds, Mirage is probably going to feel like a step backward from all the things you know and like - and you may be better off waiting until the next big open world entry set in feudal Japan pitches up instead.

The Dell G2724D is a well-reviewed 27-inch monitor that sports a better Fast IPS screen, a DisplayHDR 400 certification, FreeSync/G-Sync compatibility and even works with consoles at 1440p 120Hz.

Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. 
If you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.
We truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.

This is important because ScummVM currently supports only the Macintosh versions of these games. These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports. Now, thanks to the folks from ZOOM-Platform, you can easily obtain these game variants.
