That's not necessarily the case with the official licensed Dark Souls pen & paper RPG, which seems a touch sloppy. Along with giving one class starter gear it won't have the stats use, it has some spells and items which, going by the rules, seem unhelpful at best. The real Dark Souls starts here.

Lost Ark has a handful of subclasses that didn't make it over from the Korean version game to the Amazon Games' localized edition that was released in February. Thanks to a tweet from the Lost Ark team, we may be able to play one of those subclasses in the game very soon.

April 14, 2022
The tweet, which you can see above, only contains a GIF of a rotating bladed polearm that indicates and a date emblazoned below it of April 21 indicates the Gaivalier is set to arrive in an update next week. Also known as the Lance Master in the Korean Lost Ark, the Glaivier is a Martial Artist subclass that specializes in using spears and glaives, poking enemies with dangerous sharp objects from a safe distance. She can use her special class ability to switch between stances while fighting.
The Glaivier already has a page on the official Lost Ark site that gives a brief description of its playstyle and shows shows off some of the skills you'll be utilizing on the battlefield. Here's Lost Ark's description of the new subclass:
"The Glaivier has two distinct skill sets, each one is represented by one of her weapons, the spear and the glaive. The best way to leverage her eloquent, yet deadly form of martial arts is to find balance between her two stances."
If the April 21 date is truly the release of the Glaivier, we'll be swinging big deadly polearms in all kinds of badass ways in a week's time. If you're new to Lost Ark, its an isometric online action/RPG that you can download and play for free on Steam. I gave the game an 8.25 out of 10 in my review which you can read here. If you're a fan of games like Diablo, or want to try an MMO that's easy to get into, Lost Ark is a great game to check out.]]></summary>

The Pokémon series pretty much has the market in the palm of its hand when it comes to the amount and variety of merchandise that it has. So no one is going to bat an eyelid at Pokémon nail polish, right?
Japanese beauty brand uka has created a line of Pokémon-inspired nail lacquers. This is the latest in the brand's 'Study Series' collection, which focuses on using colours that bring out your beauty, no matter what skin type you are. There are six different coloured polishes in the collection, each one representing an extremely popular Pokémon. There are three colours for adults, and three for children - but we say stuff that, and get whatever colour you want!

After posting a deal that had the Nvidia Founders Edition RTX 3080 Ti at its UK RRP of £1049 last week, third-party cards are now reaching the same levels. Right now, you can pick up a beefy KFA2 OC card for the same price, after a £50 discount at Overclockers. 
If you'd prefer the better value RTX 3080, then there's also been movement - after appearing for £860 seven days ago, the cheapest card is now this Zotac Trinity OC model for £810. That's still a hefty chunk of change for a graphics card - and above the original RRP of £650 - but it's a damned sight better than the £1000+ these GPUs have retailed at for months.

South of the Circle is a newly announced narrative adventure centered on survival and romance in the midst of the Cold War. The game comes from Lumino City developer State of Play and is being published by 11 Bit Studios, the team behind Frostpunk and This War of Mine. 
Unfolding during the politically charged 1960s, players control a climate scientist named Peter. As a Cambridge academic, he finds himself conflicted with the brewing global conflict, which drives a wedge between himself and his love, Clara. Peter’s troubles escalate during a trip when he crash-lands in Antarctica. Stranded, he must now survive the frigid landscape while reflecting on the personal and professional choices that took him to this point.

State of Play says South of the Circle is inspired by narrative adventure games such as Firewatch and What Remains of Edith Finch and boasts a striking cinematic, minimalist art direction. It's unclear how gameplay unfolds, but the implication is that interactions will be on the minimal side of things. The game is brought to life by an ensemble cast including Gwilym Lee (Bohemian Rhapsody), Olivia Vinall (The Woman in White), Richard Goulding (The Crown), Anton Lesser (Game of Thrones), Adrian Rawlins (Chernobyl), and Michael Fox (Downton Abbey).
South of the Circle is planned to launch later this year and will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Just a couple of weeks ago, the famed honcho of the Legend of Zelda series, Eiji Aonuma, announced that the sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild would be delayed into Spring 2023. It was an announcement that many of us were undoubtedly expecting, particularly given that 2022 is already playing host to the likes of Bayonetta 3, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and the more recently announced Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, which is lined up for the 'Late-2022' slot.
While we wiped away a tear from the corner of our eyes and lamented that we wouldn't be playing BOTW2 over the holidays this year, the announcement video itself showcased some brand new footage from the upcoming sequel; so much so, in fact, that we even posited 16 theories about Link's gnarly new arm. What we perhaps didn't notice at the time — something we hadn't considered until the chaps over at Digital Foundry talked about it recenty — was that the footage looks remarkably crisp for OG Switch hardware.

I’m a real sucker for verticality, so normally I’d be immediately trying to see how high I could get, but after tentatively scaling a few floors I decided to give the urgent main quest the benefit of the doubt. There would probably just be a disappointing invisible wall anyway. I climbed back down and did my best to engage with the expensive cutscenes filled with proper actors. 50 hours of mediocre Strange Days references later, I had most of the game under my belt and was ready to go searching for something more substantial - to try to find some actual cyberpunk in this retrowave moodboard. I set about pushing Cyberpunk 2077 to the vertical limit.

Publisher 11 bit studios has announced that the "compelling narrative experience" South of the Circle will be making its way to the Switch.
Although no firm release date has been set as of yet, the game is looking to be an emotional love story set during the Cold War, with games like Firewatch and What Remains of Edith Finch being big influences on the project. The game will feature several familiar voice actors (shout out to The Woman In Black's Adrian Rawlins!) to flesh out the story and bring it some emotional weight.

Secret Mode is a pretty apt name for a publisher, isn't it? Especially today, as they've been keeping a pretty big secret from us. The studio has announced that it will be bringing Liverpool-based Cosmonaut Studios' Eternal Threads to Switch sometime this year.
The game was announced last year, but until today, we had no idea that a Switch version was ever in the works. It comes out on PC, PS4, and Xbox One next month, but really, this is a puzzle game about manipulating time to save a group of six people from a fatal house fire. This is perfect for those cosy night-time playthroughs, just like reading a murder mystery!.

Once every turn he could blink across the map, moving twice as far as he can with a regular action point, plopping him right behind a pesky Cultist’s cone of suppressing fire. It was both effective and efficient, but the real fireworks began whenever I clicked teleport strike, which repositioned him while also savaging several enemies in sequence with his power sword. He was simultaneously my initiator and my (almost) one-man clean up crew, ready to be rallied by a cry from my Justicar whenever his AP tank ran empty. I almost felt sorry for the cultists. 
I’ve played a curated, two hour slice of Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters, and I’m keen to play more. As speedy as my sword boy felt in those moments, though, at other times I felt compelled to move forward at a crawl. When I asked creative director Noah Decter-Jackson whether I was just being too cowardly, he hedged his bets.

RedDeerGames has announced it will be bringing 2Boone Games' Bit Orchard: Animal Valley to Switch. Made by just one person, Bit Orchard is cosy looking farming sim that takes inspiration from the Game Boy era in the '80s and '90s and pairs the genre down to its simplest, most relaxing form.
The game launched on Steam last year, but given the inspirations of Nintendo's chunky handheld, we think the Switch is a great fit for this cute-looking game. You'll raise an apple orchard and try to make profits to expand your little farm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nobody saw it coming.
The recent release of Triangle Strategy raised an interesting conversation about the role of customization in RPGs. For those of you who didn’t pick it up, progression there is almost entirely linear, with each character having a predefined class that remains rather rigid throughout the whole experience. Some enjoyed having that more ‘intended’ and consistent experience, while others didn’t like feeling boxed in to pre-made cutouts. For those that feel like you would be more in line with the latter group, Nobody Saves the World is absolutely designed with you in mind. This is a remarkably open-ended and thrilling action-RPG that constantly throws surprises and choices your way, enabling you to overcome its challenges on your own terms. It’s gaming ‘comfort food’, plain and simple.
Nobody Saves the World sees you playing the role of a pale, fleshy, zombie creature who wakes up in a small hut with no memory of its past. The villagers speak of a Calamity coming, and it can seemingly only be averted by a powerful wizard in the village named Nostramagus. Unfortunately, Nostramagus is nowhere to be found, and you quickly discover that he left behind his wand with a note asking his bumbling assistant to come save him. To stick it to the annoying assistant, you decide to take the wand yourself—granting you newfound transformation powers—and set out on a quest to find Nostramagus and hopefully put a stop to the Calamity before everything is destroyed.

March was a busy month for Nintendo. With several big releases such as Triangle Strategy, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's season pass kicking off with Wave 1. So it's perhaps no surprise that - even in the wake of Elden Ring - the Switch was Europe's best-selling console in March.
Gameindustry.biz shared the findings in their latest report, mentioning that while overall console sales dropped 39% compared to March 2021 (likely due to stock shortages for Sony and Microsoft), Switch sales actually increased by 9%.

Road 96 touts a procedurally-generated narrative about several teens crossing the border of the nation of Petria. Of course, we’ve seen our fair share of procedurally-generated levels in roguelikes. Still, the promise of a shifting, randomized story made Road 96 an ambitious experiment to watch when it dropped for Switch last year. And even though it might feel as if Road 96 flew under the radar, it was listed as one of the Switch’s best-selling indies in 2021! Today, DigixArt’s third title cruises onto PlayStation and Xbox. 
You can watch the Xbox launch trailer below:

The trailer showcases Road 96’s vibrant, cartoony aesthetic, but don’t mistake that for narrative lightheartedness. Political and personal tension lies at the heart of the adventure game’s dynamic storylines. While interacting with several NPCs (friendly or otherwise) and selecting choices that influence various outcomes, you’ll be exploring a wilderness hosting desert expanses, lush forests, and more. This all comes packaged in a 4K 60fps experience. As the trailer’s narrator states, “each decision could shape your destiny and Petria’s too. Time for you to hit the road.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A publishing deal is on the dashboard too.
Epic Games has snatched up yet another partnership within the industry. This time, the Fortnite developer has shaken hands with Brazilian developer Aquiris, who created the rather brilliant polygonal racer Horizon Chase Turbo.
This is the latest deal that the studio has reached, following on from acquiring Harmonix last year. This partnership is a little bit different, however, as Epic is simply investing in the company rather than outright nabbing them for their own. The two studios have also entered into a multi-game publishing agreement for some unannounced multiplatform games. That means we might well be seeing more Aquiris games on the Switch.

Metroidvania's are a dime a dozen these days, with so many trying to take a stab at what Metroid Dread, Castlevania, and Hollow Knight do so well - search exploration. But with a little bit of action too. Or a lot, in the case of Blast Brigade vs. the Evil Legion of Dr. Cread.
Developer Allods Team pokes fun at the genre in their cheeky little launch trailer, while also highlighting what makes its Metroidvania unique. Inspired by '80s action flicks, run and gun your way through a secret island base and arm yourself with more guns and gadgets in order to save the world. There are four playable characters, each with their own unique methods of traversal, and you can swap between them on the fly!

While it makes sense in theory, in practice with Linux 5.16 having been out as stable since January and Linux 5.17 out for several weeks already there is a lot of hardware improvements past the v5.15 that haven't been back-ported or otherwise picked up by Ubuntu Jammy's kernel build. The main pain point this presents is for those using the latest-generation Intel "Alder Lake" processors with a mix of performance and power efficiency cores.

Here at Nintendo Life, we know our audience is a smart bunch of cookies, so we know that you're all confident in the knowledge that Masahiro Sakurai - known most recently for his work on Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - hasn't worked on a Kirby game in quite some time. Nor, indeed, has Nintendo itself!
That doesn't mean, however, that folks in the wider circle of the internet don't occasionally need a bit of a history lesson; it seems that quite a few people have been crediting both Sakurai and Nintendo for the likes of Kirby and the Forgotten Land. Well, our video extraordinaire Felix has put together a wonderful piece explaining the history behind Kirby, its creator Sakurai, and the studio HAL Laboratory.

This process is, currently, one in suspended animation, and has been for longer than I anticipated. I moved just before the release and my PC is still somewhere in or about the Irish Sea. Luckily I can link this to FixFox thematically, as a big exciting incident for the story involves waking up a man who was stuck in a cryopod. Around that, you, a fox called Vix, fix things in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi future where your tools are bananas and stamps.
I was several hours into FixFox before I left it, and discovered it was much larger than I expected. It's paradoxically cosy and friendly even as its world is vast and strange. I had some minor annoyances with this - you do a lot of travelling around, and in the early stages of the game there aren't many fast travel options to mitigate this. But now I've been without it for two weeks, I've found myself missing the big spaces and warm welcomes of that world.

When Pokémon Unite was originally revealed in June 2020, it didn't go down well with the Pokémon community at the time. The reveal trailer generated 150,000 dislikes in less than 24 hours and even managed to outdo the reveal of Metroid Prime: Federation Force, which had over 90k dislikes in less than a day.
Fast forward to April 2022, and it's a completely different situation for the free-to-play MOBA-style Pokémon game. It's safe to say Unite is big, like really big - with the latest announcement from The Pokémon Company revealing combined Nintendo Switch and mobile downloads have now exceeded 70 million worldwide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Niantic Labs is no stranger to cute creatures featured in AR mobile games; it popularized the genre with games like Pokémon Go and Pikmin Bloom. But now, Niantic is betting on its own IP with the new AR experience called Peridot. 
The game is named after the critters at the center of the game. Peridots, or Dots as Niantic also calls them, are to be raised from birth to adulthood and can be bred to create new variations of Peridots. Because it's an AR game like Pokémon Go, you'll be able to travel with your Dots, who will help you find items in the world or can be used for a photo-op at a local landmark.

Lifting some features from the Tamogachi or Nintendogs crazes (or, you know, real pets), you'll be spending time with your Dots by teaching them tricks, feeding them, and, yes, you can pet the Peridots. When breeding the Dots, you can mix and match them with your friends' creatures with different characteristics to create entirely new creature archetypes and combinations to diversify the species further.

Niantic is looking to soft-launch Peridot in select territories and countries soon, although no exact locations or release dates have been specified yet. You can pre-register for Peridot on the game's website to get updates on when it'll be available. Expect the game to launch on iOS and Android devices when it becomes available.
Are you excited for this breeding twist on the creature collection genre? Let us know if you're going to be playing Peridot in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New episodes of Moon Knight debut on Disney+ every Wednesday, and tell the story of Steven Grant's transformation into one of Marvel's wildest characters. Wait... Is it Steven Grant or Marc Spector? On third thought, is it Marc Spector or someone else? Regardless of who is in control at the moment, Moon Knight punishes evildoers and looks darn good doing it.
You will soon be able to add Steven and Marc's versions of this character to your Funko Pop and Marvel Legends action figure collections. Funko recently announced a handful of Pops based on this new show. The line consists of Moon Knight in his traditional garb (as Marc sees it), Moon Knight in a nice suit (as Steven sees it), and a comic book version of him that comes with a comic cover background. The wave also includes a Pop of Arthur Harrow, who may or may not be evil. Time will tell. You can see all of the Pops in the gallery below.

Hasbro is releasing two different Legends Moon Knight action figures, again showing off Marc and Steven's ideas of the character on the show. Both figures come with the appropriate weapons, along with a build-a-figure component.
Now we just need Khonshu action figures. Are you watching Moon Knight? How do you think it stacks up to other Marvel shows? Let us know in the comments section below!]]></summary>

In Evil Dead: The Game, if you’re looking to play as the Demon, you have your work cut out for you. Taking on four players by yourself can be quite a task, but you have a plethora of wicked tools at your disposal. With traps, Deadites, and even possessing survivors, you can attempt to isolate and destroy your targets with precision. Each different Demon comes with a special kit that syncs up with various playstyles, so let’s take a look at the three core Demon templates you’ll have available to play with at launch. …]]></summary>

They're asking £345 for the 12-core, 24-thread processor when you use code SAVE20 at the checkout, and tossing in three months of Game Pass Ultimate and free next-day shipping to boot. That's £20 cheaper than the current Amazon price, and a massive drop from the £430+ going rate at the beginning of the year.
*OK, the Ryzen 9 5950X is technically faster, but it costs way more and the difference in gaming performance is miniscule. The Ryzen 7 5800X3D also looks promising, but hasn't yet been released and will likely cost more than this 5900X while packing fewer cores.

CD Projekt Red has announced it will be delaying the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt as it brings the remainder of the porting in-house.
We have decided to have our in-house development team conduct the remaining work on the next-gen version of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. We are currently evaluating the scope of work to be done and thus have to postpone Q2 release until further notice. 1/2
April 13, 2022
The change in development teams on the new-generation upgrades was revealed through a tweet on The Witcher series Twitter account. "We have decided to have our in-house development team conduct the remaining work on the next-gen version of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt," reads the tweet. "We are currently evaluating the scope of work to be done and thus have to postpone Q2 release until further notice." A follow-up message says, "We'll update you as soon as we can. Thank you for your understanding."
Saber Interactive was the company working on the ports of Witcher 3 to the new consoles from Sony and Microsoft and had previously partnered with CD Projekt on the Switch port of the same game. No reason was given as to why Saber will no longer be involved, nor is there a timeline on the new expected release window. 
In recent months, CD Projekt has had its hands full with the new-gen ports of Cyberpunk 2077 released in February and is still planning to expand the game with new content. The studio also announced a new chapter in The Witcher franchise is coming and will be running on Unreal Engine 5 instead of the in-house developed REDengine.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo: The Best Generation.
Looking back over nearly four decades of video game output from Nintendo in both hardware and software form, it's easy to pick out highlights, both historical and personal. Super Mario Bros. was a seminal release in the history of the medium; A Link To The Past codified the design template that the Zelda series would use for the next two decades; GoldenEye 007 helped birth the competitive multiplayer shooter genre that would go on to dominate gaming for multiple generations; and so on and so forth.
It's also easy to pick out times when Nintendo dropped the ball. The N64 years saw the ascendance of Sony's PlayStation and marked a decline in Nintendo's cultural cachet. The Wii U, much as we love it, took all the success and mainstream momentum of Wii and squandered it in a matter of months. However, even those eras produced incredible genre-defining games: Super Mario 64, Ocarina of Time and the aforementioned GoldenEye were all N64 titles. And where do you think Switch has been cribbing all those incredibly polished first-party ports from?

MLB The Show 22 is a savvy veteran, a game that continues to perform well on the field, despite some modes feeling like they are falling behind the times. Developer Sony San Diego once again finds new ways to capture the realism of the sport and add even more excitement to the already fantastic batting and pitching battle. Given just how much content is here, not every mode received the attention we want, but Sony makes up for them with excellent new experiences.

Publisher:

It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on "violations of the state's civil rights and equal pay laws," specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

Blizzard has released a new video shedding light on the origin story of Overwatch 2's new hero, Sojourn. 
A trailer sheds light on Sojourn's background as a former Canadian special forces captain who worked alongside Overwatch during its peak. We still don't know much about her combat abilities beyond the fact that she's a damage-focused hero, but players will find out when Sojourn becomes playable in the game's upcoming PvP beta for PC.

Speaking of that beta, it's set to go live sometime this month after Blizzard announced it was detaching PvP modes from PvE to get the former content out the door faster. Overwatch 2 still doesn't have a release window, and its development has been affected by factors such as Activision Blizzard's ongoing sexual harassment lawsuits, staff departures, and the publisher's impending acquisition by Microsoft.

      Beamdog
      
Game publisher Aspyr has announced that it will be acquiring development studio Beamdog. The news was revealed in a tweet this morning, one day after the two companies announced a new game together, MythForce.
We're excited to welcome the talented team at @BeamdogInc to the Aspyr family!

April 13, 2022
The tweet reads, "We're excited to welcome the talented team at Beamdog to the Aspyr family!" Other than giving a link to the MythForce website, no other information on the purchase is given. 
Outside of the new IP that is MythForce, Beamdog has specialized in remastering classic Dungeons and Dragons-related RPGs. The studio has previously released Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, and Planescape: Torment. Most recently, Beamdog developed an online edition of the strategy board game Axis and Allies 1942.
Aspyr also has its hands in remastering and releasing games. The developer/publisher has been bringing back Star Wars games from the recently bygone eras, such as Star Wars: Episode I – Racer, Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, and the upcoming port of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed on Switch. While most of these games are straightforward ports, Aspyr is developing a from-the-ground-up remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, which was announced at The Game Awards last year.
MythForce, the project tying these studios together before the acquisition, is a four-player first-person fantasy roguelite with art designed to resemble a Saturday morning cartoon. Check out the trailer for it in our story from its announcement yesterday. Mythforce enters Early Access exclusively on the Epic Games Store on April 20.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on in-person events for a couple of years now. Although infection numbers have generally fallen in recent months, many companies continue to exercise caution when it comes to organizing public gatherings and Quakecon is one of them. The show's organizers have announced that for the third year in a row, Quakecon 2022 will be a digital-only event.
In a post to Twitter, the organizers revealed that Quakecon will take place August 18-20 with more details to come in June. They explain that the constant uncertainty around holding large gatherings this year made it hard to commit to putting a show together in the time required. Quakecon will return to its normal in-person state in 2023, however. You can read the full statement below:
Quakecon was a digital event in 2020 and 2021, with last year’s show being free to attend. This news isn't far removed from E3 2022's outright cancellation last month due to similar concerns, though this month's PAX East has committed to being a physical convention. Every company has their own comfort-level for dealing with the pandemic and while the situation has improved, we likely won't see every event back in full from until at least 2023 and maybe beyond.]]></summary>

In Evil Dead, playing as a survivor means you’re going to be taking on a ton of Deadites, regardless of what your favorite specializations or weapons are. While survivors are placed into basic buckets that dictate areas that they’re better at, you’re inevitably going to be doing plenty of shooting, stabbing, and decapitating as you move through a level. So don’t think that by playing support you’re going to be sitting in the back throwing heals and watching fear meters – every class is going to be in the thick of it…]]></summary>

This news comes by way of a tweet posted by the Certain Affinity account, which states that after more than 15 years of working on the Halo series, the studio is "deepening" its relationship with Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries.

The Noctua NH-U9 series has been capable of cooling HEDT systems even with Threadripper / EPYC processors using the NH-U9 TR4-SP3 while fitting within 4U height requirements. For the Noctua NH-U9 series and other 4U compatible heatsinks they've tended to be limited to 80~92mm cooling fans due to height requirements. Noctua though recently introduced the NH-D12L as offering a dual tower CPU heatsink design capable of fitting 120mm fans and has been the focus of our recent testing.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even with PC hardware orthodoxy supporting SSD replacement, I’m convinced that getting one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck is the wiser method of expanding its storage. It’s technically possible to swap in a bigger SSD, sure, but compatible M.2 2230 drives are much harder to find than the standard 2280 drives on our best gaming SSDs list – and based on my testing, a good microSD card can be just about as fast as the Deck’s preinstalled SSD.


That’s on top of microSD cards being cheaper, easier to install, easier to remove, and available with much more choice than Steam Deck-compatible SSDs. That’s not to say that any old card will work – Valve’s handheld PC specifically supports UHS-1 microSD cards – but I’ve found and tested a few that will do the job, and do it well.

        PlayStation 4
				
Publisher:
      Sony Interactive Entertainment
			
Developer:
      Sucker Punch Productions
      
Release:
                      	July 17, 2020
			
            
The upcoming Ghost of Tsushima film will have its screenplay written by Takashi Doscher, Deadline reports. 
Doscher’s writing credits include writing and directing 2019’s sci-fi romance Only, the Hulu exclusive film Still, and the ESPN documentary A Fighting Chance. Now he’ll be penning the screenplay for Ghost of Tsushima’s big-screen adaptation, which is helmed by John Wick director Chad Stahelski. Alex Young and Jason Spitz of 87Eleven Entertainment serve as producers with PlayStation Productions overseeing the entire project. 
The Ghost of Tsushima film is in very early development, with Stahlski saying in December that he intends to take his time with the movie in order to “do it right.” The film crew is said to be working closely with the game’s developer, Sucker Punch. Stahlski is a fan of Ghost and was inspired to make the movie after playing the game “many times.”
We still don’t know anything in regards to casting (though the voice actor for protagonist Jin Sakai raised his hand in humorous fashion) and it will likely be a while before we see anything substantial from the project. But it’s nice to see the pieces slowly fall into place. Video game movies have generally improved over the last few years, so we hope that Ghost of Tsushima continues the trend when it is eventually released.

Point-and-click games cemented the vast potential of interactive narrative at the turn of the century, employing innovative environmental/dialogue puzzles with evocative pixel art and chiptune music. Nowadays, we lose ourselves in impossibly large sandboxes with equally extensive choice-driven plotlines. It’s fitting, then, that Norco feels like a precious relic from the Sierra-led Golden Age of digital adventures. Geography of Robots’ debut title ponders unchecked capitalism and classism at the heart of America’s oft-neglected Deep South. Moreover, Norco’s retrofuturistic and net.art aesthetic is …]]></summary>

As the Demon in Evil Dead: The Game, you have a lot of work to do – after all, you have to beat 4 other players! However, you have a rather nasty toolbox at your command, full of traps, possessions, and even the ability to summon horrific boss monsters that will destroy your prey. Of course, the first challenge is simply to find them, a task that can be daunting given how big the map is. Survivors can do things that give away their position too like riding in cars, so it’s important to pay close attention to the minimap.

Want to see how everything works in Evil Dead: The Game? As a survivor, you’ll have to loot up and complete objectives before taking the battle to The Dark Ones themselves. To do this, you have to gear up and take advantage of numerous caches of loot scattered across the vast map.

You might even want to use a car to help get around the field much fast, but be aware that the Demon can possess cars too, turning them into deadly weapons in a flash. Be on the lookout for signs like traps that the Demon might be close to discovering your presence – even though the map is huge, they can find you early! Check out some exclusive gameplay and commentary in this video focused on the survivor perspective!]]></summary>

There's plenty of action RPG for fans of the genre, but Steelrising hopes to rise above the usual high octane fun. Join us for a special episode of New Gameplay Today as we give you a look at what to expect from developer Spiders' upcoming title.

To make this NGT even more exciting, the team behind Steelrising is here. Jehanne Rousseau (CEO, co-founder, and lead writer), Sébastien Di Ruzza (design director), and Ciaran Cresswell (localization lead) gave us the deets ahead of the game's September 8 release.
But what can players expect from the unique new title? Steelrising takes place during a fictionalized and sci-fi version of the French Revolution. You play as protagonist Aegis as they take on the treacherous automata army to liberate the people of France. Given such a unique mesh of period and theme, the developers got the unique chance of merging the beautiful styles of the past with a dark and unsettling layer of robotic terror to create a truly unique art style.
On top of its creative visuals, Steelrising will feel right at home for fans of action RPGs. The game features plenty of upgrades, weapons, and armor to collect and an exciting story set in this fascinating vision of a fictional past. Another big emphasis for the team was making sure that the routine enemy encounters/boss battles were memorable and enjoyable. Did they accomplish such a feat? You'll have to watch today's NGT to find out!
Are you excited for more from Steelrising? Spiders' new game launches later this year on September 8 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. For more exciting preview videos of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to subscribe to our YouTube page to stay up to the minute on titles such as Cult of the Lamb, Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong, and Forspoken!

Evil Dead has been a fascinating franchise to follow, with a unique blend of elements ranging from the truly gory and gruesome to raucous comedy and creativity. Since its horrific beginnings with Evil Dead, the brand has blossomed into a true multimedia empire, spanning multiple films, a TV show, and more. Today, Saber Interactive and Boss Team Games look to enter the emergent asymmetric horror market with Evil Dead: The Game, which operates in a decidedly different fashion than other options out there.

The story picks up several months after the events of 2019's Season 3. A powerless Eleven and the Byers family have moved to California. Hopper is being held captive in Russia. Our remaining friends must pick up the pieces while starting high school. Naturally, the ongoing supernatural menace and the sinister government conspiracy attached to it continue to haunt the world’s unluckiest small town. Per a warning to Eleven in the trailer: “a war is coming. Your friends in Hawkins are very much in the eye of a storm.”

Stranger Things 4 consists of nine episodes, each with a runtime twice as long as before. Because the episodes are supersized, they’ll be divided and released in two batches that are five weeks apart. Volume 1 premieres on May 27, and Volume 2 arrives on July 1. It's unknown how many episodes are in each volume, but one would imagine it's a clean split, so four/five each. 
Earlier this year, Netflix renewed Stranger Things for a 5th and final season. The last season currently has no premiere date. For more on Stranger Things, you can read about its recent crossovers with Far Cry 6 and Magic: The Gathering.]]></summary>

A new update for Halo: The Master Chief Collection is now live and it includes a number of bug fixes and improvements for the overall experience.

Clocking in at roughly 22 gigabytes on Xbox consoles, this update is one of the biggest in recent memory for MCC, especially as much of 343 Industries continues its focus on the latest Halo game, Halo Infinite. Here’s what’s …]]></summary>

Not, like, groundbreaking or anything, but hey, not everything needs to be. BIOTA has some platforming, some shooting, some bits where you drive mechs and submarines. It keeps things simple and it largely works, making for a game that's an inoffensive 8-bit-style romp with flashes of greatness.

Nintendo has released a new Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes trailer that showcases the “mysterious mercenary” players will control when the musou hits Switch on June 24. 
Aptly titled the “Mysterious Mercenary Trailer,” it begins with a spar or all-out fight between the female version of Byleth and a purple-haired male warrior. Byleth clearly has the advantage here and later in the trailer, it’s revealed they’re the Ashen Demon, presumably helping the game’s main antagonist, the Ashen Dragon. However, before that reveal, we learn that the purple-haired warrior is Shez, the protagonist players will control in Three Hopes. Like Fire E…]]></summary>

One thing I've been playing recently is Ghostwire: Tokyo, a ghost huntin' action game that's a bit less weird and a bit more "kind of like an Ubisoft game" than I was expecting. But I like Ubisoft games just fine, so I'm having a blast - plus there are still some clutch ghost fights to be hand when I run out of finger-ammo for my magic hands.
I am extra delighted by the animals, though. For whatever reason, they are unaffected by the evil fog that has swept through Tokyo and turned everyone into spirits, so there are a few dogs and cats just sitting around and (and this is the good bit) you can read their thoughts.

All of that initial benchmarking as usual was done using the default GCC system compiler across all tested AMD/Intel processors. Of course, there also exists AMD's Optimizing C/C++ Compiler (AOCC) as a downstream of LLVM/Clang with various Zen optimization patches applied.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Nacon has announced Rogue Factor's newest title in the works is called Hell is Us, with former Eidos Montreal Art Director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête on the project as creative director. Jacques-Belletête has previously worked on games such as Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Mankind Divided and worked on concepts for Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy before transitioning over to Rogue Factor. The debut teaser trailer for Hell is Us can be seen below.
Hell is Us is described as an action-adventure set inside a country in the midst of a civil war where the main character will fight against creatures caused by a mysterious event the locals call "the Calamity." He'll have to use special weapons and equipment to take on these monsters that resemble monuments scattered across the nation in order to survive and learn more about his history in this land.

"Our goal with Hell is Us is to bring back true adventure and exploration," says Jacques-Belletête in a press release provided to Game Informer. "There's no need for a detailed quest log or precise waypoint on the map: we want players to feel the thrill of adventure, guided by their feelings and instincts."
 The first game from Rogue Factor since we acquired it is also one of our most ambitious projects, and we can't wait to reveal more about it in the coming months."
We'll have more on Hell is Us soon, including an exclusive preview where we speak with Jonathan Jacques-Belletête about his vision for the project. Hell is Us is being developed using Unreal Engine 5 and is planned for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2023.]]></summary>

The case debuted late last year for a princely £240, expensive even for a large form factor case, but now it's down to £175 - a more reasonable ask given its full tower size and laundry list of features, which I'll tell you about presently.

To the delight of many a fan, Square Enix announced Kingdom Hearts IV yesterday. The tantalizing cinematic trailer showed off a more mature-looking Sora exploring a realistic human city invaded by Heartless. Naturally, the video raised countless questions, but it also led us to gush about the things we want to see in the hotly-anticipated sequel.
That’s why we, the Kingdom Hearts fans in the Game Informer office, couldn’t help but share our personal hopes and dreams for the next game. Let us know what you think of our wishlists, and be sure to share your own desires and expectations down in the comments!

2017's Hello Neighbor gained a bit of a cult following thanks to its popularity in streaming and on YouTube, and since then, fans have been clamoring for a sequel. With that sequel now announced and a release date in sight – December 6 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC – developer tinyBuild has released a beta to tide fans over until later this year.

Anyone can access the beta, so long as they preorder the game, and what you'll find is not a look at the final version of Hello Neighbor 2 but instead a look at what the game is shaping up to be. tinyBuild has promised that the beta is spoiler-free and does not contain story elements from the final game. It's more like a scenario meant to showcase what the game looks like today, what some of its mechanics feel like, who some of the people in Raven Brooks are, and more. Game Informer editor Wesley LeBlanc went hands-on with this demo, and today, he's joined by fellow associate editor John Carson to discuss the first 11 minutes of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake processors are among the best gaming CPUs you can buy, but certain owners have noticed a seemingly worrisome trend: their LGA 1700 motherboard socket puts so much pressure on the chip that its IHS (integrated heat spreader, the big grey bit on top) starts to bend. This isn’t so much a concern for the CPU’s structural integrity as it is a cooling issue, as a non-flat IHS will struggle to transfer heat to the CPU cooler plate as effectivity.


In a statement to Tom’s Hardware, however, an Intel spokesperson has essentially said it’s not as bad as it sounds. The statement does acknowledge the warping (or “deflection”, to use Intel’s more engineer-y term), but says there’s no evidence thus far to suggest it drives load temperatures up to unsafe levels.

Kingdom Hearts 4 was surprise-revealed yesterday during a 20th Anniversary announcement trailer for the series, which is where Square Enix also revealed that it was developing Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link, a new mobile game for the franchise. 
The reveal of Kingdom Hearts was quite extensive and you can read Game Informer’s full breakdown of it here, but one thing that couldn’t go unnoticed was the new visual style. Featuring a much more realistic look, especially compared to the cartoony nature of previous Kingdom Hearts games, this new sequel looks beautiful.

Wii Sports solidified the power of motion-control gameplay and catapulted Nintendo’s seventh-generation home console to immediate superstardom (it’s no wonder the cartoony sports simulator cracked our Top 25 Wii Games).

If you recall, the Kingdom Hearts 4 reveal showcases some beautiful shots of nature – lots of green foliage, a small creek, perhaps some Redwood trees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the weekend, Square Enix surprise-announced Kingdom Hearts 4, the next big game in their incomprehensible RPG series which stars Disney cartoon characters as pop-punk boyband multiverse superheroes. I am mildly distressed to see KH4 lean towards a 'realistic' art style in parts, though I would be curious to see a Kingdom Hearts Mickey Mouse that's just a wee mouse wrapped in leather, plaid, buckles, and zips. While KH4 is largely a mystery for now, eagle-eyed viewers think the announcement trailer hints at a crossover with the Disney Princess world of Star Wars.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2D bullet hell game Vampire Survivors is surely one of the most interesting success stories of the year, as what was a simple mobile game became popular almost overnight. Its very minimalistic roguelike style captured players looking for something casual, but still engrossing. You pick one of several characters and move them around the screen as they auto-attack. As enemies are disposed of the player levels up, along with changing weapons and gaining power-ups, with the ultimate goal being to keep the ever growing mob of enemies under control. On death you unlock new weapons and characters by spending coins gained in battle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's BAFTA Game Awards winners were announced earlier this week, and just as It Takes Two and Unpacking received a lot of nominations, so did It Takes Two and Unpacking win a lot of awards. The co-op divorce sim picked up the big weird face for Best Multiplayer and Best Original Property while Unpacking won Best Narrative and the publicly voted EE Game Of The Year award. Nice.

So-called "Open Web Piracy" allows internet users to watch pirate IPTV streams without paying a penny. Not only that,  anyone with access to a legal stream can easily make it available to the masses, even from their own home.

They just tend to bounce me off pretty fast, and a bit like with adventure games, when I get stuck I typically just get bored and do something else.
It took almost 70 levels for Reiterate to do that. That's a recommendation.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 and AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT both launched in recent weeks with the aim of reasserting some sanity, and to an extent, they have: while they’re not immune to bonkers inflation, they’re still relatively affordable, with unusually plentiful stock available.


Which, though, is the better buy? Both are 1080p-focused cards on sale for £300 or less, both sit at the bottom of their respective GPU hierarchies (the RTX 30 series and Radeon RX 6000 series), and both support ray tracing, so let’s break out the bar chart app and do some comparisons.

In the last few months alone, we’ve endured the cursed nights of Age Of Darkness: Final Stand, called down sky lasers on the hordes of Diplomacy Is Not An Option, and now we’ve got ORX, a dark fantasy tower defence game that blows all of them out of their ditch water moats with its compelling mix of deckbuilding and real-time strategy. It’s not out in full just yet, but its demo got a substantial update this week, adding more levels and a bunch of game-changing cards to the mix that are well worth making a return trip for if you’ve only ever played the original half-hour version from 2020. I’ve lost several evenings to it already, and lemme tall ya, RTS turtlers have never had it so good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we were putting together our most anticipated games of 2022 list back in January, there was one game I knew had to be on it: Mojiken Studio’s A Space For The Unbound. It’s a slice of life adventure about two Indonesian high school students set in the late 90s, and the demo (which has recently been expanded to include the first chapter in addition to its short prologue) instantly captivated me when I first played it a couple of years ago. There are some light supernatural elements that will be instantly familiar to anyone who’s watched the films of Japanese anime directors Makoto Shinkai and Mamoru Hosoda (including a giant, ominous Your Name-style comet, no less), but for the most part this is a much more grounded game than Mojiken have made in the past, such as the fantastical point and click puzzlers She And The Light Bearer and When The Past Was Around. 
Indeed, the only game in their back catalogue that has a recognisable, real-life setting is their short, free browser game Banyu Lintar Angin. Born out of an internal game jam project in 2017, Banyu Lintar Angin once again draws inspiration from the studio’s home country of Indonesia. It only takes a couple of minutes to play, but speaking with its creator Dimas Novan, it was vital in sowing the seeds for what A Space For The Unbound would eventually become.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like all badly behaved children, we're guiltily celebrating Mother's Day a week late this year on The Electronic Wireless Show podcast. This time we're talking about our favourite mothers in games, which basically means we're talking about a bunch of angels and monsters.
But come for the mother chat, stay for the cursed chickens, Matthew's eel/snake hatred, and a description of the very real way that Henry Cavill eats eggs. Plus I play one of the best Cavern Of Lies I think I've ever done. Apologies again for sounding a bit echoey this week as I await the delivery of everything I own.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two smash-hit games combine in Wheredle, a daily puzzle game where you're dropped into a Google Street View look at a random state in the USA, and need to guess which one it is. Bit GeoGuessr, bit Wordle. You have seven attempts to guess the state, and each wrong answer gives you a hint by pointing, literally, in the right direction. Yes, this is pleasant enough.

In lieu of explanation, they repeat the word "metaverse".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You’d be forgiven for getting excited about the AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT. A brand new RDNA 2 graphics card, with ray tracing support, that’s both easy to find in stock and available at a comparatively approachable £200 / $230? In the midst of a years-long components shortage, exacerbated by all manner of price-gouging bollocks, it’d be entirely understandable if upgrade-starved PC owners went for this like my cat goes for unattended crisp packets. Especially if they’re happy to stick to playing at 1080p.


Alas, the RX 6500 XT isn’t just an inferior low-end option to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 (one of the best graphics cards, and perhaps the outright best for budget builds right now). It’s an offputtingly slow, sometimes bizarrely-designed GPU in general; instead of providing long-overdue relief to a truly fudged hardware market, it ends up feeling like more an attempt to just sell any old second-rate kit to an audience that’s been left desperate for something, anything that’s new and somewhat affordable.

What's a good metaphor for that? If only there were a food product that had built an entire brand around the concept. I guess we'll never know. But Chinatown Detective Agency, a beautiful, pixely, point and click puzzle game set in a cyberpunk future Singapore, has what I predict will be a pretty polarising central feature, and that is real time historical research.

Today, Scan's selling both models at RRP, with the 3080 Ti costing £1049 and the 3090 Ti costing a cool £830 more than that. These are both high-end cards with a price tag to match, but the Founders Edition models are generally the cheapest you'll find - so we thought you should know about this unprecedented stock situation!

It's a life sim set in a post apocalyptic world where, instead of punk metal bikinis and murder, the vibe is regrowth and bright colours; a sort of juicy 3D Stardew Valley with an emphasis on crafting. 
But now the sequel My Time At Sandrock is launching into early access on May 26th, bringing a whole new region to restore. Sandrock may look more traditionally post-apocalyptic, being as it is a sandy outback populated by cowboys, but it's still got a helping-hands community feel at its core, plus an interesting eco-friendly angle and an all-new multiplayer mode. But its origins were much more modest. As Pathea Games' executive producer Zifei Wu tells me, Sandrock originally began life as a My Time At Portia DLC pack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot on the heels of The Wheel Of Time finding a load of new fans through a live-action series, GOG and Nightdive Studios have dug up and re-released a 90s FPS set in Robert Jordan's fantasy world. GOG are also using this opportunity to revive Good Old Games, their original name, albeit only as a store category for games they consider both old and good. This is one of them, they say. Is it? I know it's old, but is it good?

Even aside from my enduring love of megafauna, Spice Wars is made by Shiro Games, the studio behind Wartales and Northgard, and that's enough to have my interest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga represents great value. All nine Star Wars films bundled up in bricks! But do its pieces really come together? Well, yes and no. The game is charming and breezy, offering plenty of locales and set pieces fans of the force will fawn over. Yet its episodes are wildly inconsistent, with stories told at lightspeed and open world hubs filled with so many collectible bricks it solidifies your brain to a lump of mortar.

This move has now happened, but if you were hoping for an update on how I am getting on with a massive virtual jigsaw, you will be disappointed. Everything I own (bar the suitcase of clothes Mr. Ryanair allowed on the plane) has been held by customs. More monstrous is that my stuff actually cleared customs, but some absolute head-melter unrelated to me or my boxes of pens - and who, I am choosing to assume, tried to ship a load of high grade cocaine into Ireland - got the entire container stopped in Dublin.
This means that I have been without any TV for two weeks. Nor any books, video games, or even my big bag of crochet. We didn't get internet until two days ago. It is only by the grace of a technician looking at an HDMI cable stuck in our wall jack, stroking his chin, and then yanking the cable really hard that I'm talking to you now. In those two weeks, I discovered I am weak. But by a stroke of complete luck the new flat faces an busy shipping lane in an estuary. So I have also discovered a deep love for big boats and VesselFinder.

Today, the Crucial P5 Plus is also heavily discounted, dropping below the £100 mark for the first time here in the UK.

The Deck, which launched in February after missing a planned release in December 2021, has only just finished its first round of shipments; now it’s moving into the Q2 2022 phase, Valve are “ramping up shipments” to make sure everybody gets theirs within their current order availability estimate.


That’s according to the Steam Deck Twitter account, from which Valve also announced that they’re clarifying what these availability estimates actually are. So far these have been given purely as Q2 2022, Q3 2022 and so on, but the Deck’s Steam store page will now list the actual months in that quarter – including your personal delivery estimate, if you’ve already got a reservation waiting. This change won’t affect when the handhelds are ready, it just saves a Google search for anyone less familiar with the business-speak of quarterly codes.

        <updated>2022-04-05T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chrono Cross was one of those Square JRPGs that never made its way to Europe at its original time of release. Heck, the first time I got to play time-travel classic Chrono Trigger was when the Nintendo DS version came out in 2009, almost 15 years after it first came out on the SNES. Chrono Cross, its semi-related but not direct sequel, has taken even longer to get here. First releasing on the original PlayStation in 1999 in Japan (and 2000 in the US), it's finally arriving on PC and modern consoles on April 7th as Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, which bundles the original game with its accompanying text-based side story Radical Dreamers that only ever released on the ill-fated Satellaview. The latter's original 4:3 pixel art looks mildly ropey blown up on today's screens, but the main game has received all the modern conveniences you've come to expect from Square Enix's recent run of retro PC ports: new HD character models, re-orchestrated music, multiple font options, and the holy grail: a fast-forward button.
I'm nowhere near the end yet, but from what I've played so far, Chrono Cross is a rollicking good time. There are dozens of characters to meet and recruit to your party that can tangibly change your path through the story, the turn-based battle system offers oodles of depth and variety, and Yasunori Mitsuda's revamped score is right up there with the Final Fantasy greats. For all its buff and polish, though, Chrono Cross has, sadly, also been struck by the same curse as other Square Enix PC ports. The lack of settings options makes it hard to pin down exactly what the problem is, but there's something about the performance and inconsistent frame rate of my review build that's so fundamentally borked that it's like those 22 years haven't even happened. If you, too, have been looking forward to Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, I'd strongly advise waiting for a few patches to arrive before dipping your toes in.

A previous patch in mid-March made Radahn a pushover, see, and apparently that's partially because a "bug" caused the intended nerfs to go too far. So, they've fixed that bug, giving Radahn some power back, but still leaving him slightly less mighty than he originally was.

An employee group had announced a walkout before Actiblizz's change of heart, and apparently are going ahead today to continue conversations about safe workplaces and the option to work from home.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo Infinite officially launched last December, receiving rave reviews from critics and fans - including Brendan’s review here at RPS. It peaked with over 200k viewers on Twitch. And for many content creators like Kevin Lynch, aka KevinKoolx, December marked their best month ever in terms of engagement on YouTube and Twitch. Halo, after a decade of somewhat divisive releases, was back. It’s hard to overstate how impressive a feat this was, since the Halo fanbase is almost as divided as the Star Wars one - a seemingly trivial topic like the inclusion of sprint is just one of many decade-long points of contention. But somehow with Halo Infinite 343 Industries created an experience that almost every type of Halo fan could rally behind. But now, just four months after launch, Infinite is struggling to retain its playerbase.

 Now the Twitch peaks are below 10k and dropping, with the averages even lower. Lynch says February was his worst month views-wise in over a year. You'd expect some tail off after launch for any game, but every content creator I’ve spoken to echoes this sentiment: engagement for Infinite is abnormally low for a live service-game at the beginning of its multi-year journey, especially for a franchise as big as this. The game plays great, so what’s the problem? I spoke to a number of different streamers and content creators to get their point of view.
