        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On September 1
Ubisoft servers for 15 games will be shut down this week (as is customary), just in case you forgot that was eventually happening. Again, 15 games in all will be impacted, including five Assassin's Creed titles.
As for how it works...it's a bit complicated. Chiefly, Ubisoft shutdowns include taking servers offline, and eliminating multiplayer as an option. Ubisoft describes that process with the following statement: "You will be unable to play multiplayer, link Ubisoft accounts in-game, or use online features." Obviously, any "games as a service" titles would be erased from existence under these guidelines.
Ray_Trace1 over on Reddit has broken down the process a bit, going beyond the multiplayer considerations. Select games also have this caveat: "Additionally, the installation and access to downloadable content (DLC) will be unavailable." That's the nail in the coffin for a few of these games, especially Assassin's Creed 3. As written, this shutdown is removing DLC access unless you own the remaster (because it checks online servers for authentication), which has issues of its own.
Some massive publishers are just so unwieldy that it makes sense that not every single game (especially failed ones) would be kept up in perpetuity. But the DLC implications are just bad practice on every level. Thankfully, there are still outfits left like the Anno 2070 studio, who are working to preserve the game on their own servers.
September 2022 Ubisoft servers shutdown list:
Anno 2070 (is in the process of being transferred by the developers)
Assassin's Creed II
Assassin's Creed 3 (non-remastered)
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
Assassin's Creed Liberation HD
Assassin's Creed Revelations
Driver San Francisco
Far Cry 3 (non-remastered)
Ghost Recon Future Soldier
Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands
Rayman Legends
Silent Hunter 5
Space Junkies
Splinter Cell: Blacklist
ZombiU

Nintendo has long been a pioneer of creative controllers. There was, of course, the Wii remote which revolutionised mainstream motion-based gaming, the N64 controller which finally let you play a game with three hands, and, the crème de la crème, Donkey Kong Jungle Beat's DK Bongos.
Many of us still have a pair or two of these GameCube novelty items sitting in the back of a closet somewhere, waiting for their time in the limelight once again. Bongo Souls came and went, but the jungle drums are beating once again. One designer from the game development YouTube channel Cobra Code has built a new PC game around the DK Bongos. Now that's a rhythm we can get down to.

SNK producer Yauyuki Oda, who is responsible for some of the developer's solid modern fighting games, has suggested that both SNK and Capcom are interested in the possibility of reviving the SNK vs. Capcom (SvC) series — a crossover franchise that has remained dormant since the 2006 Card Fighters Clash series.
Speaking in an interview with VGC, Oda spoke of the recent art collaboration that took place at fighting game tournament EVO earlier this month, which saw characters from SNK and Capcom's respective fighting game series squaring off for the first time in many years. Pressed for the possibility of a revival of the crossover series, Oda reacted with positivity, noting that Capcom itself has some interest in the possibility.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Jet Set successor needs more time to get it right
Team Reptile is taking a little more time on Bomb Rush Cyberfunk. The quest to paint the town, challenge crews, and more will now be aiming for summer 2023.
In a post to social media, the developer says it needs more time in order to realize its vision for Bomb Rush Cyberfunk.
"About the release: We are convinced that releasing the game this year will not take it to a level where we would be personally satisfied with. To create a fulfilling and unique game we are extending the development time of Bomb Rush Cyberfunk to summer 2023."

But that's not the only bit of Bomb Rush Cyberfunk news this week. Team Reptile says it will be dumping "a lot more visuals" this week, to show how the action-sports hybrid is shaping up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-cE0PK9TeQ
Rise and grind
There's already been one drop today, highlighting the boostpacks players can use to do tricks. In the video example, Team Reptile shows off a Boost Trick, a 1080 spin. Landing this into a manual can keep the combo going, and coming at it from higher ground and landing in a manual boosts your speed.
https://twitter.com/ReptileGames/status/1564979009099792384
While it's a bummer we won't be seeing Bomb Rush Cyberfunk this year after all, it's good that Team Reptile is taking its time. The Lethal League developer has impressed me with just about every showing of Cyberfunk so far.
It's got the right style, and it's got great moves across the different styles of traversal. While a Jet Set style game might go for skates, Team Reptile has also shown off skateboards and BMX bikes too. Tack on some fantastic music and purported battles for turf, and yeah, I'm keen to see Team Reptile fully realize their vision.
We'll see what the team has in store for Bomb Rush Cyberfunk next summer.

Following the trailer release for Team Reptile's funktastic Bomb Rush Cyberfunk way back in 2021, we have been feeling the groove while we wait for an official release date. Today, however, we have had to put that funky music on pause as the studio took to Twitter to announce that the game will not be released this year.
As noticed by the folks at VGC, in a heartfelt message conveying the developer's desire for the game to be released in the best possible condition, Team Reptile has stated that the game's launch date is being pushed back to Summer 2023 — a very un-groovy extension on the original 2022 window.

Having gone hands-on with a short 20-minute-ish demo of the game at this year's Gamescom, I can confirm that the remake is real and seems faithful to the original despite some heavy tinkers in the modernisation station. For nostalgic fans it should make for an exciting revisit to cyberspace, but I'm unsure whether it'll land quite as well for newcomers seeking a showdown with Shodan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've got a pretty good line in interesting folk traditions here at RPS. I grew up in a county where staying up all night at the stone circle to welcome the Summer Solstice was an annual tradition (later augmented by a woman wearing antlers offering a selection of downers and hallucinogens), and as a child I had an unnecessary encounter with the Salisbury Hob-Nob. For the past few years Alice0 has gone to the Burryman's Parade, gracing us with pictures of that most wholesome gentleman. Rural traditions are fun if you're part of them, but to outsiders they can be unsettling at best. 
This is relevant to my thinking about Saturnalia, an upcoming survival horror game by Italian studio Santa Ragione, where a small group of outsiders try to escape a village on the night of an ancient ritual. I've been playing a preview build of Saturnalia for the last week or so, and also got to talk about it with the studio director Pietro Righi Riva. "I usually tell people, 'Oh, you should make a game in like six months', and I have tried to do that in the past," he tells me. "This one just kind of got out of hand. I found an email yesterday, as I was looking for finishing the credits, about me discussing some story items in April 2017." And, while I am sure that most developers don't wish they'd been making a video game in the middle of the pandemic, I think the extra time may have allowed Santa Ragione to make something excellent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new game, eh
Konami has been playing it low-key ever since the handling of Hideo Kojima and PT set them back decades, mostly content with dropping some compilations of their golden years; or the occasional new game like Super Bomberman R. While their 2022 lineup for the Tokyo Game Show likely won't excite anyone on paper, an ominous 2022 Konami TGS tease might.
The publisher has revealed its TGS 2022 lineup, and it sure looks like a lineup. Amid several new entries in its string of sports titles, we'll also get to see more of Super Bomberman R, as well as four Yu-Gi-Oh games, which are currently helping to keep Konami afloat in their games department.
But the main thing to keep an eye on (spotted by Gematsu) is a similarly low-key tease for a "new title" from a "world-loved series."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Depending on how you look at it, The Last of Us Part I is either a from-the-ground-up remake or a very involved remaster. Either way, it packs many enhancements over the base game. While I didn't care much for Part I, if you're interested in checking it out yourself, here are some of the biggest changes you can expect. 
Accessibility Options
The Last of Us Part I comes with Naughty Dog's full suite of accessibility options. And that's something worth commending. This comes in the shape of fully customizable controls, a host of visual aids, options to alleviate motion sickness, help with navigating levels, options for the deaf or hard-of-hearing, and combat accessibility. Within each are dozens of sliders and toggleable options, allowing players to customize the game experience completely, …]]></summary>

I'm not sure I needed two more versions of The Last of Us, but here we are. Back in 2014 when the PS4 remaster came out I had little interest in playing it again, as it was just too soon. But eight years is a long time, and a lot of folks probably are interested in another go-around. Last of Us Part 1 is now the best way to facilitate that.

Due out on September 2 on PS5 and at a later date on PC, The Last of Us Part 1 is a juiced-up remake, taking the PS4 version even further with redone visuals and tons of toggles/options. It's essentially the same game with some bells and whistles — and the same story beats and characterizations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This game has a monkey in a lab coat.
'Cyberpunk' has become a bit of a dirty word in games as of late after a certain game's widely-publicised rough launch. However, video games and the cyberpunk aesthetic have gone hand in hand for almost as long as the medium has existed. From SNES-era titles like Shadowrun and Hideo Kojima’s wildly underappreciated Snatcher and Policenauts; to the present where we find games like Astral Chain, VA-11 HALL-A, and — yes — Cyberpunk 2077. In fact, it's so common in games that it becomes harder and harder to be wow-ed by the aesthetic. Despite this, ANNO: Mutationem pulled us in right away.
ANNO (no relation to the popular city building simulator of the same name) is an action-RPG that comes courtesy of indie developer ThinkingStars in conjunction with Sony’s China Hero Project. After launching on Playstation platforms and PC in March, it makes its way to Nintendo’s hybrid with a near-flawless conversion, only let down by some long load times and the occasional frame rate dip.

In 2013, I was 19 and still practicing the unfortunate act of pre-ordering video games before I knew if they were good or not. As misfortune had it, it came out while I was out of town, but my Dad went and picked it up from our local GameStop for me. Like an absolute dork, I remember spending weeks looking at the picture of the box he sent me, practically counting the nanoseconds until I could play it myself. 
And when I did, it was everything I could've hoped. I was admittedly a less savvy media viewer back then and truly believed its story was unlike anything else. I don't think that's true anymore – it pretty shamelessly borrows from Cormac McCarthy's The Road, No Country F…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stranded: Alien Dawn is Haemimont Games’ second sci-fi sim on the trot, and despite being set on a planet that actually has air this time, it could well make Surviving Mars’ well-funded colony building feel like an afternoon playing with Lego. In Stranded, as I saw from a hands-off preview at Gamescom 2022, you’re certainly not planetside by choice, having crash-landed on an uncharted world with just four surviving astronauts left to scavenge, hunt and build their way towards something resembling a life.


“Like RimWorld”, I thought to myself upon hearing the pre-demo pitch, and subsequently wrote in my notes four separate times before ceasing to bother. If only mere words could convey just how much “like RimWorld” Stranded: Alien Dawn is – other 3D-ified clones exist, like last year’s Going Medieval, but here, even the exact spaceship-wrecking premise matches that of Ludeon Studios' seminal survival sim.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Nooo! Don't gooo!".
Cast your mind back to 1996, you might remember the now-iconic opening cinematic for Capcom's Resident Evil, featuring the in-game S.T.A.R.S team in a live-action shoot (for Nintendo gamers specficially, you might have first encountered the cinematic in the 2006 DS release, Resident Evil: Deadly Silence). Even in the mid-'90s, it was considered to be pretty cheesy, but its inclusion has been cited by Resident Evil fans as one of their favourite aspects of the original game in more recent years.
Now, after 26 years, three of the cast members have reunited to promote a fan project from YouTube channel Residence of Evil. As reported by Time Extension, Charles Kraslavsky (Chris Redfield), Greg Smith (Barry Burton), and Eric Pirius (Albert Wesker (he still looks like him!)) sit down with host and filmmaker Andrew Saullo to talk about their experiences shooting the cinematic, whether they remained in contact with one another in the years since, and how they became involved with Residence of Evil's fan project called 'The Keeper: A Biohazard Story'.

The Street Fighter 35th anniversary is upon us, and to celebrate, Capcom has launched a new English-language website ahead of the arrival of Street Fighter 6.
Here's the rundown from Capcom:
"Since the debut of the original Street Fighter all the way back in 1987, countless players have played the games. Nowadays, the series has expanded beyond just the games, we've also released movies, merchandise, run eSports events, and done numerous collaborations to reach a wider audience. Seeing people from all kinds of backgrounds interacting with the series in its various forms has been a momentous driving force in keeping us going as we work towards its future."

Right now, the main purpose of the site is sharing stories, via a social system of sorts. Capcom is collecting "comment cards," which are like little information squares with someone's name (or alias), an avatar, and a little blurb about themselves and their favorite aspects of the Street Fighter series. Current and former Capcom employees, including Shuhei Matsumoto and Hideaki Itsuno, have contributed.
The other functionality of the site includes a history lesson page, dating back to the original Street Fighter game in 1987, through 2023's Street Fighter 6. While you can't click each game to get a full breakdown, select entries do have a separate pop-up page, including Street Fighter 1, 2, Alpha, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
The Street Fighter 35th anniversary landing is a cute little page, and no doubt is helping in terms of easing the wait for the next iteration. After cruising through a lot of these games, I can't help but want to play them again.

Back in July, Scoot Airlines unveiled its Pokémon-themed B787-9 Dreamliner — more simply referred to as the Pikachu Jet TR. Now, the airline has set a date for this Poké plane's maiden voyage (thanks, Nintendo Soup), as the jet will be travelling from Singapore to Tokyo on September 9th, 2022.
As a low-cost airline, it appears that the Pikachu Jet will only be performing short-haul flights in Asia for the moment (no transatlantic crossings onboard just yet, we're afraid). The plane will be entering standard Scoot circulation after a few initial flights, so who knows, you may even end up on board the Pikachu Jet if you're travelling that part of the world. Be sure to check out the plane's opening schedule if you are hoping to catch a ride.

Konami announced its Tokyo Game Show line-up earlier today. The annual convention, which starts on 15th September, will play host to several developers and publishers. We've already talked about one title that snuck into the company's line-up — the 1996 arcade game Cannon Dancer — but it's also been teasing another announcement in a series that's " loved all over the world", but not from one of its biggest series, reports VGC.
On 16th September at 3:30pm JST (that's 11:30pm PST on 15th, or 2:30am EST / 7:30am BST on 16th), Konami will be announcing a new title related to a beloved series from the company. This is enough to get anyone excited, of course. However, VGC's source has reported that this new title will likely be related to a smaller project, and not those rumours of a Castlevania, Silent Hill, and Metal Gear Solid revival.

It says that through third-party allotment, Sixjoy Hong Kong, a Tencent Holdings subsidiary, has purchased 16.25% of From Software’s shares, while SIE has acquired 14.09%. Despite this, Kadokawa Corporation is still the largest shareholder of From Software, holding 69.66% of the shares.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quantic Dream, the developer behind games like Detroit: Become Human and Heavy Rain, has been acquired by NetEase Game, one of China’s largest video game companies whose catalog of games developed and published include Knives Out, Naraka Bladepoint, and more. 
This news comes from a posting released by NetEase today that calls Quantic Dream its first studio in Europe. It’s unclear how much the acquisition cost NetEase, but the developer-publisher says it will allow the studio to continue to operate independently, focusing on creating and publishing games while supporting third-party developed titles too. 


“We are thrilled to embark on an exciting new stage of growth with Quantic Dream, bound by our shared vision, mutual trust, and respect,” CEO and director of NetEase William Ding writes…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Step and stride.
As we're only weeks away from this year's Tokyo Game Show, we're starting to find out what games developers and publishers will be showing off at the annual convention. And amidst Konami's line-up — which includes multiple Yu-Gi-Oh! games, Super Bomberman R 2, and Coffee Talk Episode 2 — is the surprise return of a forgotten classic — Cannon Dancer.
Known as Osman in Japan, the game was created by Kouichi "Isuke" Yotsui, who worked as a designer on Capcom classic Strider. Our friends over at Time Extension spotted the game in a listing shared by Twitter user @ohfivepro. What makes this so special? Well, Cannon Dancer was an arcade exclusive back in 1996, and Isuke considered it "his" sequel to the classic side-scrolling action game. So this is the very first time we're getting this game on home consoles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meet the "Playboy"... No, not that one.
British video game developer Rare is undoubtedly best known for its close relationship with Nintendo back in the '90s and early '00s, before Microsoft outright acquired it in 2002. Indeed, games like GoldenEye 007, Banjo-Kazooie, and Perfect Dark have all cemented themselves as icons in the industry; games that have not only stood the test of time in their own right, but also directly influenced a good deal of the titles you play to this day.
In the late '80s, however, Rare embarked on a decidedly different venture; one that ultimately never came to fruition. As reported by our friends over at Time Extension, before Nintendo's Game Boy system was announced and released, Rare's co-founder Chris Stamper worked on a hardware project known as the RAZZ arcade board which used a Zilog Z80 processor and could apparently display thousands of on-screen colours - certainly more than Nintendo's own Game Boy could manage. This board would then be utilised in a handheld device that Rare christened the 'Playboy', with much of the exterior design handled by the company's other co-founder, Tim Stamper.

But in a surprising turn of events, I left thinking the game was a real highlight of my time in Cologne's multi-hall maze of excellent people and overpriced schnitzel.
And most importantly, the guns didn't annoy me at all! In fact, their craic contributed a great deal to my enjoyment of the strangest FPS I've played in a while - one where I was forever grinning at the screen like an idiot. If you're a fan of Rick And Morty from before it got weird to be a fan of Rick And Morty (or Squanch Games' back catalogue, or general bizarro laughs), this is one for the wishlist.

If you were thinking about making a JRPG inspired by those hard-boiled detective stories, then developer SWDTech has already got you beaten. Pixel Noir, a turn-based RPG that mixes investigative crime with classic RPG elements, is coming to Switch in April next year.
The game has been in Steam's Early Access since 2019 and has captured the interest of many with its isometric viewpoint and different take on the JRPG story. Instead of playing as some plucky young teenagers out to save the world, you're a grizzly detective — the city's cheapest, even! Not a story about the power of friendship, then. Now, publisher BadLand has announced that the game will be leaving Early Access next spring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Darkest of Souls
In the latest in a seemingly endless line of major industry acquisitions, Chinese conglomerate Tencent and Japan's Sony Interactive Entertainment have collectively bought just over 30% of controlling stock from stellar studio FromSoftware — as announced by FromSoft parent Kadokawa Group.
Tencent subsidiary Sixjoy Hong Kong will take ownership of 16.25% of the purchased shares, while SIE will sire the remaining 14.69%. It is important to note that Kadokawa Group remains the majority shareholder in FromSoftware, owning a huge 69.66% of the Dark Souls studios stock. This "third-party allotment" of shares has been allowed in order to bolster FromSoft's financial resources, as well as facilitate its growth in overseas territories. The deal is expected to close September 7, 2022.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOrtKh8Vv3g
"FromSoftware is driving the Game Business as it has continually been creating world-famous works, such as Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Elden Ring, leveraging its advanced game IP development strength," wrote Kadokawa in its officious sales document. "With an eye on further expansion of the Game Business, the Group recognizes the enhancement of capabilities for the creation, development and deployment of game IP as one of the Group’s highest priorities. In line with this policy, the Company has decided to have FromSoftware implement fund procurement by way of a Third-Party Allotment to Sixjoy and SIE."
FromSoftware is the latest studio sell-up its shares, in part or in whole, to Tencent. The holding company already has either full, majority, or partial stock control over a number of major industry players including developers and publishers such as Activision, Supercell, Epic Games, Remedy, Riot Games, PlatinumGames, Bohemia Interactive, Dontnod Entertainment, Klei Entertainment, Inflexion, Sumo Digital, and Funcom.

The Nintendo Switch has proven to be groundbreaking on a number of levels, but, as with many consoles, accessibility has continued to be one of the main features on which it can improve. A 2017 console evaluation by The Able Gamers Charity confirmed just this, commenting on the Switch's 'zero accessibility features' at launch. Since then, Nintendo introduced system-level button remapping and the ability to zoom, but there's still much more that could be done, and YouTuber Akaki Kuumeri has created a Joy-Con adaptor to begin moving these problems in the opposite direction.
Kuumeri's design (shown in the video above) works to combat certain dexterity issues some gamers experience as a result of the console's traditional two-handed approach to gaming. Flipping one Joy-Con into an upside-down position, the adaptor lets you play the console's two-handed control system from the button inputs of a single controller.

Yes, Street Fighter really is 35 years old. Capcom's first ever fighting game launched in arcades on 30th August 1987, and the company hasn't ever really looked back. It is the fighting game series everyone knows and respects. So it's absolutely deserving of a very stunning website to commemorate the series' 35th anniversary.
Capcom opened the website earlier today and it really is a looker! On the front page, you can filter comments from developers, artists, voice actors, and more. Fan messages are shared on the page, which details people's passion for the series along with which game was their first. And there's a rather nice selection of high-quality art. The comments section is being updated constantly, and you can leave your own message about your love of the Street Fighter franchise over on the page!

Back in the days of the N64, developers were still trying to figure out just how to wrap their heads around the world of 3D gaming, even Nintendo itself. With The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, we were treated to visuals the likes of which had yet been seen, including the vast landscape of Hyrule Field, the stunningly realised towns and dungeons, and of course, the intriguing day and night cycle depicted in the sky above.
It turns out, however, that the sky itself is one big optical illusion, achieved by creating a small rotating cube that nestles within the camera's viewpoint, giving the impression of enclosing the entire map within its borders. You'll likely already know this, of course, since the very nature of a 'skybox' is to effectively enclose a game's landscape within its borders, but seeing the feature in practice via the below video is frankly kind of mind-blowing.

Update : Following on from the launch of Sakurai's YouTube channels last week which gained 200,000 subscribers in less than 24 hours (see the original story below), exactly one week later he's announced his channels have now exceeded a combined total of 700,000 subscribers.
That's his English YouTube page and also the Japanese one. His English channel currently sits at 379K subscribers, and his Japanese channel has 326K subscribers. Not to take away from this milestone, but as some have pointed out, his fans could possibly be following both channels, which would no doubt bolster numbers. Still, the fact is it's a combined amount of 700K in a week!

The return of the fighting game series SNK vs. Capcom has been heavily requested. Sure, there's been some Neo Geo Pocket Color games re-released on the Switch in recent times, so how about a modern revival?
Well, the good news is that SNK producer Yauyuki Oda - the individual behind SNK's more recent fighting games - seems to be aware of this. Speaking to our friends at VGC, Oda referenced how popular some SNK and Capcom collaborative promo posters were at EVO 2022 this year, which was apparently enough to reconfirm interest in the revival of the series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't stay out too late
I didn't know I needed a creepy fishing game, and that's where Dredge comes in.
In this drifting exploration game, you'll head out on a trawler in search of fish and "long-buried secrets." It's a peaceful(ish) job during the day, but when the sun goes down, horrible creatures surface. If you're afraid of the ocean, maybe sit this one out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfniX3fH1l0
Dredge is the debut title from Christchurch-based Black Salt Games and publisher Team17, who has a knack for finding projects with intriguing new concepts in familiar genres.
This trailer is more about establishing the serene-meets-sinister vibe of Dredge, which is fine — it serves its purpose. But if you want to see gameplay, I'd check out the Steam page for some more illuminating screenshots and gifs. The lighting is fantastic.
Yer fond of me lobster, ain't ye?
I like the idea of roaming between islands for quests, snatching up and selling sell fish, earning enough money to upgrade the ship, and heading out into the great unknown, potentially at my own peril. The inventory system also catches my eye as a perpetual Resident Evil 4 replayer; it's going to be fun to twist and turn odd-shaped items (in this case, fish and gear) to squeeze them all into a tight space to maximize trips.
[caption id="attachment_342338" align="alignnone" width="1920"] Making room for all the fish on the ship with a bit of "inventory Tetris."[/caption]
I'm hazy on how the nighttime mechanics work — how screwed are we? — but the scenery is unnerving. (And I'm generally not one to be too put off by freaky Subnautica-sized sea creatures.) As the creators of Dredge put it, you'll be able to "strengthen your mind and use special abilities to survive trips out on the water after dark."
Dredge is launching in 2023 on Nintendo Switch, PC (via Steam), PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. There's much more to see before then, and I'll be keeping tabs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can also pick up its previous versions right now
What's in a word, but an arrangement of letters? Factori is a neat-looking indie game that takes the alphabet and asks you to make "soup" and other words with it, factory-style.
Factori essentially seems like a mash-up between words and logic, like if Zachtronics made a game about forming words. You start with just one resource, the letter i.
From there you can bend, rotate, reflect, and more, eventually making more complex letters. Then you can use those complex letters to form words, optimizing chains and hunting for secret letters.

The initial version of factori was made for the 2021 Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam, where it took home the #1 spot. Developer Star Garden Games went on to refine the free demo into a 1.0 version, which you can currently purchase on Itch.io.
Steam-powered factori
Today's announcement, which brought this to my attention in the first place, is that Star Garden is now planning to bring factori to Steam. And it's not just a port of the 1.0 version from Itch, either.
According to Star Garden's blog, factori will hit Steam with several new features. This includes a hard mode, which has restrictions on certain buildings that can be used. A dark mode is also on the way, which is always, always a good choice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7gvQiYYDhQ
There are also more secrets, some quality-of-life improvements, and more to be announced. Basically, it sounds like Star Garden is adding a little more to the factori with each new release. And if you already dug the original idea, these new twists being added seem pretty interesting.
There's no ETA on the Steam version of factori just yet outside of a 2023 estimation. The team has set up several social platforms, including Discord, Twitter, and a newsletter, so you can be notified on any announcements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lead combat designers Mihir Sheth and Denny Yeh have over 17 years of God of War experience shared between them, and both played prominent roles in the previous game’s success. The series’ current direction is inspired by an old studio motto: Playing with your food.
“That’s an internal philosophy that we’ve had since back in the day,” Sheth says. “Kratos plays with his food. We tried to create systems you want to engage with that are fun, very playful, lots of different routes. And when we looked at the combat in the last game, we were like, ‘We can push this further; we can find new toys and ways of playing with enemies and strategies.’ That’s been the guiding principle more than anything else.”

It's more interesting to us in PC land because it'll be the first time the heart-and-zombie smasher makes its way to PC - albeit "very soon" after its console release.

Below, a new seven-minute clip of the remaster in action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get ready to party with Jackbox Party Pack 9
A staple at any good party, the Jackbox games have become something of a ubiquity for people who love a good group game at a get-together. They're well-designed, easy to understand, and anyone can partake as long as they have a phone or computer to use. The Jackbox model is pretty genius, and it's one of those series I'm always going to check out every time they have a new release.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7ffJQyTC6Q
That's why I'm super excited to see the trailer drop for their newest release, Jackbox Party Pack 9. It's yet another excuse to have a bunch of friends over and sit down to check out the new games. There are four completely new games in this pack, as well as the return of a revamped favorite:
Quixort, a co-op trivia sorting game where players will have to sort a series of blocks in order thanks to the help of some little robots.
Junktopia, a storytelling game where players are turned into frogs by an evil wizard, and must earn their way back into the wizard’s good graces by giving random objects amusing backstories to increase their values.
Roomerang, a role-playing game where players take on the role of gameshow contestants and must answer prompts and avoid elimination.
Nonsensory, a laid-back game where players write, draw, and try to guess the silly things that their friends wrote and drew.
And of course Fibbage 4, the return of a classic where players must bluff and get other players to believe their false answers.
The new trailer that dropped today gives a nice, quick overview of what each game entails if you're looking for a summary. There are also some adorable pugs involved, which I think is only due to their being adorable. Whatever, I'm not complaining.
Jackbox Party Pack 9 will be available on Nintendo Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam, with an announcement of the release date coming soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Night City is waiting
A new dive into the world of Cyberpunk is just around the corner. Netflix confirms today that its animated series Cyberpunk: Edgerunners will debut on September 13.
The anime, a collaboration with CD Projekt Red and Studio Trigger, also debuted a new and very-NSFW trailer today alongside the announcement.
Cyberpunk: Edgerunners follows David Martinez, a street kid who's trying to get by in Night City. He eventually becomes an edgerunner, or essentially a merc, similar to V in Cyberpunk 2077. Hopefully David's big heists go smoother than V's did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtqIas3bYhg
David winds up befriending other lost souls trying to get by in Night City, it seems. Lucy, one of the main characters of the series, has incredible technical abilities but is seeking a way out of Night City and away from her past.
The series is 10 episodes long, and all 10 will drop on September 13. No waiting around for each week's new episode here.
A high-octane future
I'd normally be a bit lukewarm on the concept of a Cyberpunk anime, seeing how 2077 didn't quite land for me or others. I've gone back since the release of the next-gen update for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, and while I dig a lot of the little improvements that have been made since launch, I'm still iffy on the overall game.
What's kept me interested in this has been Studio Trigger's involvement. The animation house behind Kill la Kill and Promare has a well-regarded background in over-the-top action. And today's trailer is a mix of over-the-top action and Studio Trigger style. Edgerunners seems like it could at least make for a fun watch.
Netflix has landed some solid animated game adaptations in the past, and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners has the benefit of drawing on both the video game and the tabletop franchise behind it. Of the many, many video game adaptations in the works, this could at least manage to be a fun, futuristic romp.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the greats crosses a huge milestone
Terraria is one of those games that has a simple premise, but it's so well executed, it's secured a spot as one of the best games of all time. I came to know it as sort of a 2D version of Minecraft (although that's something of an oversimplification), and it really gained traction in the mid-2010s when it got picked up by the Let's Play community on YouTube. Terraria is incredibly well-loved to this day, and is now one of the best-reviewed games on Steam. That's because Terraria has surpassed over a million reviews on the platforms, and while it's not the first title to do so, it is the first title with over a million reviews that has also maintained its "overwhelmingly positive" status.
Specifically, those reviews are still 97% positive, with 978,864 positive reviews and 21,444 negative ones. That lands Terraria as the second-best reviewed game on Steam of all time, after Valve's beloved classic Portal 2. However, it did manage to beat out Stardew Valley, Hades, and Left 4 Dead 2, just to name a few.

Like Minecraft, Terraria's community is still going strong, and its developer Re-Logic is still producing new content for the game (as well as providing quality-of-life updates) over ten years after its release.
The newest update 1.4.4, called the Labor of Love update, will be released sometime in late September, and will also be the game's first simultaneous cross-platform launch for both console and PC.
While I did have a brief Minecraft phase, I never did give Terraria a try, even after watching plenty of my favorite YouTubers give it a go back in the day. Based on those overwhelmingly positive reviews, however, it sounds like I have no choice but to give it a try one of these days. Another awesome game to add to the list!

If this sounds like you (or, alternatively, if this is your first time laying eyes on the figures) then you are in luck, as Good Smile has today announced that it will be re-releasing both figures in 2023.
Sharing the news on Twitter, preorders are now open for both figures via the Good Smile site with orders predicted to ship around June 2023 (thanks, Nintendo Soup!). Both Meta Knight and Waddle Dee are each priced at $41.99 (around £36, though this excludes international shipping fees).

Remember the 'exploded' Game Boy consoles we showed you a while back? Well, the company behind them, GRID Studio, is back with a more up-to-date example: Nintendo Switch Joy-Con.
While we'd argue that getting Nintendo to repair your Joy-Con is a more sensible course of action when they finally succumb to Joy-Con Drift, there is something rather appealing about having them framed in this fashion.

Square Enix has released a new trailer for its upcoming Nintendo Switch port of NieR: Automata. The preview focuses on evocative protagonist 2B, the NieR hero who would become a legendary gaming icon.
2B — or to offer her full moniker YoRHa No.2 Type B — is a YoRHa all-purpose battle android created to aid humanity in its war with The Machines. Adept in all manner of fighting abilities and coded to operate with cold and ruthless efficiency, 2B is one of mankind's finest tools in its efforts to reclaim the planet. As NieR fans will be fully aware, however, there is more than 2B than meets the eye, and her single-minded coldness will be put to the test on the battlefield when faced with the chaos, disaster, and "death" of her equally disposable friends and colleagues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHMMLn00ts
While NieR: Automata launched as something of a cult release, PlatinumGames challenging action-RPG would find itself pushed into the mainstream, thanks in no small part to 2B's elegant, engaging, and undeniably sexy demeanor. Operating as both the heart and the brain of NieR: Automata's narrative 2B — alongside her battle buddies 9S, A2, and not forgetting Pod — offer the only real semblance of actual humanity in a bleak, miserable, and seemingly endless war of attrition.
NieR: Automata The End of YoRHa Edition was first announced during June's Nintendo Direct. The port will feature a faithfully recreated adaptation of the 2017 modern classic, bundled with all of the RPG's post-release content which includes additional missions and character costumes. In addition to this DLC, the Switch port will feature a small range of exclusive skins for the trio of protagonists.
NieR: Automata: End of YorHa Edition launches October 6 on Nintendo Switch. Pre-orders for the physical release are now live at the official Square Enix store.

Way back in June when the Pokémon GO Fest 2022 first began, everyone's favourite Poké Ball guy (no, not the one from Sword and Shield), Professor Willow, was sucked into an ultra-wormhole and swiftly replaced by the robot distributor, Rhi. Over the course of the celebrations, Pokémon GO had a clear Willow-shaped hole at its core, keeping us worrying about the professor's absence throughout the Ultra Beast events. However, at the festival's conclusion, Professor Willow returned and it seems that the Wormhole has worked wonders on his appearance.
Recognisable by his rolled-up lab coat, PE teacher-style zip-up and wire-framed glasses, the new (and dare we say, improved) Willow has re-emerged as a younger model. No longer looking like a default Pixar father figure, Willow now sports a black coach jacket and biker goggles. Hey, do we even spy a little bit of stubble going on there?! How very down with the kids.

Ubisoft's subscription-based guitar education game Rocksmith+ is set to launch. Rocksmith+ goes live on PC, exclusively through the Ubisoft Store, on September 6.
This service was announced last year as a follow-up to Rocksmith, Ubisoft's line of games that teach you how to play the guitar. Rocksmith+ was shown off at the Ubisoft Forward event, and went on to host a closed beta.
The key difference between Rocksmith+ and its predecessors is in the packaging. Previous Rocksmith games functioned the same as a Guitar Hero or Rock Band, with a suite of tools and songs on-disc that could be added to with DLC. Rocksmith+ is a subscription service, asking for a monthly payment rather than a disc-and-cable purchase.

As a Scanner model android, 9S prefers more investigative measures over brute force. He's also keenly curious about the world around him and is more outgoing and friendly than his counterpart, 2B.

More specifically, the exciting Shovel Knight follow-up/spin-off title will hit those platforms on Sept. 23. What's more is that if you have an Apple Arcade subscription, you can play the game for free. It'll cost $24.99 on Switch and on Steam, however.
This news was revealed in a comical trailer released by Yacht Club Games, which you can watch for yourself below: 


"When Drill Knight and his dastardly digging crew blast apart Shovel Knight's peaceful campsite and steal his loot, he grabs his trusty Shovel Blade and starts tunneling after them," a press release reads. "But as he and Shield Knight soon discover, this adventure goes much deeper than a simple heist."
"Meet new friends and foes, visit strange lands, and outfit yourself in your quest to keep the entire land from collapsing underfoot. Jump, slash, and dig your way down an ever-changing chasm of mystery in Shovel Knight Dig, an all-new Shovel Knight adventure." 

While waiting to play Shovel Knight Dig on Sept. 23, read about Scrap Knight, a new character that will be featured in the game, and then watch the reveal trailer for the title.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something you own might be compatible
The Joy-Con IR sensor is a weird beast, and one that I don't interact with often. At all, really! It came screaming out of the gate with 1-2 Switch compatibility, but has since mostly trailed off. Mostly.
I was reminded by this Reddit thread that the right Switch Joy-Con does in fact have an IR sensor; some Nintendo documents call it the "IR motion camera." Now, if you haven't interacted with it in any way, that's kind of normal. The total number of games that can wield the power of the IR motion camera is a very small list, and only several of them are particularly noteworthy. While there was a time when 1-2 Switch was relevant, that time passed roughly a week after it launched. Labo sadly has similarly fallen into obscurity. As of now, the most notable games I'd cite as IR motion camera ready are Ring Fit Adventure, Resident Evil Revelations, and Brain Age Switch.

Below is a list compiled by Reddit user extremeelementz, which we've elaborated on and added to.
Games that use the Nintendo Switch Joy-Con IR sensor:
1/2 Switch (a sole minigame has IR compatibility)
Nintendo Labo (used for Labo creations as an optional tool, and allows it to read bits of the Labo cardboard)
Game Builder Garage (like Labo, you can use it for creations)
Ring Fit Adventure (checks your heartrate: take that Wii Vitality Sensor)
Resident Evil Revelations (reload by covering the sensor)
Spy Alarm (shovelware that functions as a detection kit)
Night Vision (shovelware with basic interactions with the IR camera to showcase night vision)
Brain Age/Dr. Kawashima’s Brain Training (some minigames can sense things like hand motions, asking you to perform the proper hand signal)
Smile Basic 4 (programming software that utilizes IR optionally)
Ninjala (scans to unlock cosmetics)
Vitamin Connection (used to interact with a maze mechanic via distance calculations)

Part deckbuilder, part roguelike and part tower defence, this is a real-time strategy game played by the seat of your pants, where a rolling deck of cards determines not only what kind of defences you can build, but also what buffs, spells and additional forces you can deploy to help defend your keep from the oncoming hordes. It's a gripping mix that's already claimed over a dozen hours of my time in recent weeks, and it's a number I can only see going up and up and up as it continues to develop in early access.

MultiVersus director and Player First Games developer Tony Hyunh — a man who has proven to be welcomingly exciteable in regards to their title — has teased a new update for the crossover-tastic platform fighter. The update will arrive on all platforms at some point within the next week.
https://twitter.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1564381499469639681?s=20&t=U3RPA01w3BEJeNZlhaUHEA
Asked by YouTuber AngryJoe when the in-game store would be open for business, Huynh responded, noting that while both the store and Guilds were currently on the docket, neither was considered a top priority for the title over aspects such as character balance, online stability, and bug stomping. It's worth remembering that, despite having entered its first season, MultiVersus is still technically in open beta, and, as such, is currently operating as a "work-in-progress" title.
Hyunh did note that the new update, which will roll out sometime next week, will contain "cool things" — though stopped short of giving details. the player base is currently expecting new modes such as Arcade and Ranked Online, as well as season one characters Rick (Rick & Morty), Black Adam (DC Comics), and Stripe (Gremlins) but, for now, it looks like we'll just have to wait and see what September brings.
MultiVersus is currently available in open beta on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While mooching around Samsung’s Gamescom booth, waiting for their 990 Pro SSD reveal, I took the opportunity to play with an altogether more unusual addition to their hardware catalogue. The Samsung Odyssey Ark, for the unfamiliar, is a kind of all-in-one entertainment screen: a mammoth 55in Mini LED panel that can act as a desktop gaming monitor or living room TV, complete with honking great speakers and built-in support for all the big game streaming services so you can play on it without a PC or console. Unlike other monitors of this magnitude, it can also rotate into portrait mode, leaving the top curve towering over you like an unsympathetic Victorian headmaster. 


I actually enjoy a touch of design madness creeping into the occasional piece of PC gear, regardless of whether it can hang with the best gaming monitors that sensible people might buy. What I experienced with the Odyssey Ark, however, was a device that too often veered onto the wrong side of senseless – when it was even working properly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lost in Time
Nintendo has officially announced a shutdown date for its mobile RPG Dragalia Lost — the fantasy adventure will end service on iOS and Android platforms on November 29, 2022.
As reported back in spring of this year, the decision was made to shut down the CyGames-produced title earlier this year, which will see Dragalia Lost close its servers after four years of relatively successful engagement. The narrative campaign came to a close back in July, with players encouraged to use these remaining months to wind up their adventures, max out characters, and spend any remaining "Diamantium," the title's in-game currency. No further Diamantium can be purchased as of today.
https://twitter.com/DragaliaLostApp/status/1564503406550581248?s=20&t=8Q7I66AJbLN6-oUpGx_yQA
Launching in the fall of 2018, Dragalia Lost was a very popular title, raking in over $120 million USD within its first 15 months of operation. Over the course of 2021 and 2022, the earnings figures have dipped, though the game still remains somewhat popular among its hardened community. As we have quickly come to understand, however, if you are not making All The Money, you might as well be making No Money, and thus Nintendo and CyGames have decided to pull down the blinds.
"It is our sincere hope that you have enjoyed your experience with the game from the moment you started playing it," said Nintendo back in spring. "We will strive to ensure that you continue to do so for as long as time allows."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The most common cheat skipped to the testing range
While Nintendo is fairly lax about, well, basically everything in regards to its online system, Splatoon 3 cheaters are already facing a reckoning — before the game is out.
While Splatoon 3 is due out on September 9, this past weekend Nintendo ran a "Splatfest" event, which allowed players to download a demo, log in, choose a side (rock, paper, or scissors), and play. But according to famed Switch dataminer OatmealDome, Splatoon 3 anti-cheat was not only present during the Splatfest, but it also started issuing console bans.
This impacts folks who modify the game in any way, and apparently the most popular means of this during the Splatfest was a way to enter the testing range (the lobby system that lets you practice) immediately. Essentially, this allowed folks who shared the user-created patch to skip the tutorial segment and save some time. Well, in theory, at least. Once the game actually does come out, OatmealDome also has a running total of cycled events, including Salmon Run variants, as well as regular and anarchy battle maps.
As far as the Splatfest itself goes, I had fun up until halftime (as team scissors). Once the 4v2v2 mode started up things got a little dicey, especially for the winning team. As the current winner you're locked out of manually queuing 4v2v2 matches, and you can "randomly play one" through chance by starting up the regular Splatfest queue. It was too chaotic for my tastes, and as-is, I'll probably be playing up until halftime for these events before taking a break.
That said, everything else with Splatoon 3 is looking good so far — and that's before we've seen the campaign, Salmon Run, and the new card game.

Ever since Paradox Interactive announced Victoria 3, I've been in a state of semi-disbelief. It was a strategy game in-joke for so long that I couldn't believe it was really happening. I was provided a preview build of the upcoming socio-economic grand strategy game thanks to Paradox. To quote Sidra Holland and Jackie Chiles, it's "real, and it's fantastic." And soon, you too can politick to your heart's content when the game releases on October 25, 2022.
For those of you present who aren't cool enough to know what the Victoria series is all about, an introduction is in order. Victoria is a grand strategy game series aptly set during the Victorian era. Whereas other entries in the Paradox family of grand strategy games focus on war or lineage,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm going to level with you: I'm not a GSG player. I play strategy, sure, but grand strategy has always been a bit beyond me. I'm a fundamentally un-grand person; I spend most days dressed like a 14-year-old fan of Tony Hawk, I do not like olives or scallops, and I'm unable to predict the consequences of actions if they exist outside of, say, a 12 month timeframe. A game like Victoria 3, where the whole point is making decisions that have country-wide effects and outcomes years in the future, is essentially operating in a different language to any I understand.
I'm trying to learn new languages, though, so it's not an unwelcome challenge. The problem is that previewing Victoria 3 is quite an advanced level to dive in, the Paradox GSG equivalent of being a live translator for a UN summit when you're only just about able to read the French version of The Famous Five. In a presentation before I and others were let loose on the better part of a week with the game, it was claimed that Victoria 3 is the best yet for onboarding newcomers, with a deep and detailed tutorial system. And to that I say: kinda. Luckily, the AI in Victoria 3 is so advanced it's better at playing the game than I am.

Bouncing between appointments in this sea of booths and lanyards was jarring, but I'd eventually settle in after a few minutes of reconfiguring my brain to whatever presentation or control scheme was placed in front of me. Hyenas never gave me a chance.
I sat in a 20-minute presentation of the game and tried my level best to understand SEGA's stab at a live-service FPS. Instead, I exited the booth with whiplash... and a sense of curiosity. Somewhere inside the game's insufferable tone is a kernel of cleverness, I just need to get my mitts on it to confirm my suspicions. Otherwise, it's very difficult to really understand whether it can survive in such a saturated space.

Last week saw the return of Europe's largest gaming industry event, Gamescom, which arrived in both a physical and online capacity for the first time in several years. And, according to live stream host Geoff Keighley, it was quite the popular event, with over 12 million viewers tuning in to day one stream Opening Night Live.
The stream, which took place on the evening of August 23, featured a selection of trailers, updates, and reveals on some of the hottest games headed our way in the coming year (or two). Titles such as the mysterious Soulslike Lies of P, the goofy Goat Simulator 3, brutal sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol, and the long-in-development Dead Island 2 all found time in the spotlight, with the two most watched trailers of the entire stream being the previews for Sonic Frontiers and an update for Genshin Impact.
https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1563947341337485322?s=20&t=6NCQfoav20yFFrvFLVZC-w
In addition to the success of the ONL stream, Geoff notes that around 265,000 visitors from over 100 countries made the journey to the Koelnmesse complex in Germany to be part of the live show. Attendees had the opportunity to chat with developers and publishers, play demos, and catch up with some of their long, lost industry pals. It seems, on the whole, that Gamescom 2022 was a success, providing Europe's leading live event brand with some much-needed positive press.
The next major gaming event will be Tokyo Game Show, which will take place September 15-18 in Chiba, Japan. Of course, just like with Summer Game Fest and Gamescom, we will be sure to report all of the hottest news and reveals from the event right here on Destructoid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Drumroll, please, for the latest interactive, live action, film archival puzzle from Sam Barlow, of Her Story and Telling Lies. This latest rumination on voyeurism also delves into storytelling, sex, death, religion, love, lust, lies, pretence (as distinct from acting), power and self. That's a lot to pack into the partial, out of order clips of three different films, which manage to span both decades and careers. The central figure is Marissa Marcel, an almost-star actor who made three movies before disappearing. So the question you strive to answer, by looking through unedited takes and rehearsal footage, is: what happened to Marissa Marcel?
In typical Barlow fashion, the entirety of the footage isn't easily spooled through. From one starting clip you're able to watch it, flick back and forth through the recording, and pause it to use the in-game search tool to focus on a face or object on screen. Selecting it will then take you to that face or a similar object in a different clip, and eventually you build up a much fuller catalogue of footage.
Now. Immortality also talks quite a bit about sex, in various ways and for various reasons, and there is female nudity. So yes, you can enhance! Zoom! on a tit. And the game will take you to another clip featuring a similar tit. Ba-dum, tsh!

By the time I knew something was up with Sam Barlow and Half Mermaid's latest FMV mystery, I had already ripped open Pandora's Box. I just didn't know it yet. Little hints and bread crumbs were laying there. Percolating theories were just waiting to be blown open to something big. And I just kept tugging at the threads.
Immortality is the latest game from Barlow and co., and it sees Barlow returning to full-motion video similar to Her Story and Telling Lies. The most obvious difference is how the experience itself handles; rather than typing queries into a database, you have a reel setup similar to a classic Moviola machine and a crosshair.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gungrave G.O.R.E. marks the return of the Gungrave franchise after almost 20 years (well, besides that VR game), and today we found out that the sequel is coming just in time for Thanksgiving. A new cinematic trailer shown during Gamescom reveals a November release date, and it runs down the wacky cast of characters and why you'll be riddling them with bullets. 
The largely CG trailer sprinkles in a bit of in-game action, though you should check out this previous gameplay video for a better taste of the over-the-top combat. We’re introduced to Grave’s allies who band together to take on a fearsome foursome of antagonists looking to rule the world (probably). Fans of the PS2 games and the anime that spawned from them will be happy to know that G.O.R.E. looks as bombastic and absurd as they'd expect. Newcomers that enjoy bullets, blood, and insanity will likely feel right at home. 


Gungrave G.O.R.E. launches November 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Pre-ordering nets you a special Grim Reaper skin designed by former Tango Gameworks designer Ikumi Nakamura, who is working on G.O.R.E. as a character artist.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mafia celebrates its 20th anniversary today, and in a new blog post by Hanger 13, the principal minds behind the series reflect on its creation and history while also teasing what’s next.
Longtime Mafia designers Roman Hladík (general manager), Tomáš Hřebíček (head of production/media director), and Alex Cox (game director) sat down to discuss Mafia’s entire history and their most cherished memories of the franchise. It’s worth a read if you consider yourself a diehard fan (check it out here), but the most exciting news from the conversation is the confirmation that the next game in the series is in development.
Hřebíček writes: 
“A few years away” is a long time to wait, especially since the last mainline entry, Mafia III, is approaching six years old, launching in October 2016. But we're happy to see the series continue and are curious to see where it heads next. In 2020, Hanger 13 released enhanced remasters of all three games, the most substantial being a complete remake of the original dubbed Mafia: Definitive Edition.

        <updated>2022-08-29T13:06:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has reportedly canceled its Resident Evil series after just one season. 
This news comes from a report from Deadline, which reports that Netflix has decided not to move forward with a second season of the show following the release of Season 1 last month. As far as why, there’s no official reason as of yet but considering Netflix’s past, it’s likely that Resident Evil didn’t meet expectations in terms of both critical and audience response. The show will now join many other shows canceled after just one season at the streamer including Cowboy Bebop, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, and more.
Deadline notes that Resident Evil’s release came right after the highly anticipated Season 4 of Stranger Things, which might have led to its less-than-stellar first weekend on the service. However, the series still debuted in the number two spot, behind Stranger Things, pulling in 72.7 million watch hours. Deadline reports that viewers watched Resident Evil for 73.3 million hours in its second week, taking the number three spot on Netflix, before dropping out of Netflix’s Top 10 by week three. 
This isn’t Netflix’s first foray into the world of Resident Evil, though. Its 2021 movie, Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, holds that title, but that anime series wasn’t well-received either. For more about the series, check out this retrospective video that looks back at 25 years of Resident Evil.

There’s something about the memory of that taste that is amazing, even if you know the sophistication of your palette has evolved a lot in the intervening years. That’s a bit how I feel about the early Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games. I can recall with crystal clarity being gathered around a TMNT arcade cabinet with my friends, pumping in tokens to try and beat Shredder before the birthday party ended. Or spending a weekend banging my head against the wall of the first NES game and its absurd sewer challenges. The Cowabunga Collection exists to service the nostalgic recollection of these types of experiences, and it does so with aplomb. Are these truly great games worth …]]></summary>

You’ve likely heard of Lies Of P after it took the internet by storm after Gamescom Opening Night Live. If you haven’t, I’ll quickly catch you up to speed: it’s a Pinocchio-themed Soulsborne.
You play as the iconic marionette fighting to become human in a fictional French city inspired by the historic Belle Époque era – a time of abundant affluence for the country. Familiar characters like Geppetto, Pinnochio’s creator and father figure, and Gemini Cricket help familiarize the story, but Lies Of P promises intriguing twists through a dark reimagining.

Endless Dungeon, the successor to 2014’s Dungeon of The Endless, is a tower defense twin-stick shooter created by French developer Amplitude Studios; and after my hands-on session at Gamescom 2022, it has the potential to be the next big roguelite. 
Interestingly, this upcoming roguelite is more a reimagining than a sequel. Instead of the point-and-click navigation and automated combat featured in the first game, players now directly control characters and weapons in real-time. Endless Dungeon reimagines its predecessor’s pixel art dungeons into larger, gorgeously-lit 3D spaces. Also, up t…]]></summary>

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. On this episode, we'll say "Jackpot" to Season 6 as we conclude with the latest title in the series, Devil May Cry 5.
Released March 8, 2019, Devil May Cry 5 serves as a return to the classic timeline after an over-decade-long hiatus. Nero reprises his starring role, but he's joined by Dante and mysterious newcomer V. The three demon slayers, alongside familiar allies, unite to combat a powerful demon lord. Longtime DMC director Hideaki Itsuno wanted to hit a "homerun" with the title after realizing he may not have many games left in him, so he went all out. That includes adopting Capcom's…]]></summary>

Neodash is a type of racing game that pops up relatively often; a time trial crossed with an obstacle course and a little of what I suppose is the endless runner. Picture Trackmania but with the courses condensed into short bursts of high speed dodging and you're basically there. They're often very throwaway and don't really hold my interest for long. Neodash grabs hold immediately.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Drinkbox Studios’ Nobody Saves The World is getting a shot in the arm via a new expansion arriving next month. Dubbed Frozen Heath, this update adds new forms, challenges, and a fresh region to explore.
Frozen Hearth takes place in an underground region that hosts The Tempering, a series of trials consisting of combat challenges and puzzles. Overcoming this contest rewards two new forms: the Killer Bee and the Mechanic, which can be used in the main game. 


On September 13 you can buy the Frozen Hearth expansion separately for $4.99 or pick up it alongside the main game in a bundle for $27.99.  
Nobody Saved the World launched in January and became one of our early favorites of 2022. Former editor John Carson scored the game an 8.25 out of 10, writing in his review that, 
“Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish as I leveled my way through form ranks for the next body or ability to work with. It's most fun when unleashing devious yet approachable combat scenarios, keeping me on my toes to find the best solution to survive. Thankfully, it gave me plenty of those unrelenting loops throughout, justifying the time to save this funny little world.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

The games are called Penny Blood and Armed Fantasia (no points for guessing who's making what), and based on what I've seen so far, I'm intrigued.

It launched at £125 for a 1TB size earlier this year, but now it's down to £84 where it's rather more fetching. The 2TB size has also been reduced and is even better value at £152. Here's why we rate these SSDs - and where to find them at the lowest price.
Let's do the 'where to find them' bit first. It's quite simple: WD's UK store is offering the 1TB at the best price right now, while Ebuyer is the place to go if you'd prefer the larger 2TB model.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It wouldn't be Gamescom without a Geoff Keighley liveshow to kick it all off, would it? Tuesday's Opening Night Live showcase featured a huge amount of trailers to gawk at, a baggage carousel of content that moved at a blistering clip. Despite its two hour runtime a lot of interesting (and in most cases, new) titles weren't given a huge amount space to breathe, their moment in the spotlight frequently cut short by another trailer waiting impatiently in the wings.


You'd be forgiven, then, for missing a few bits and pieces because you were blinking really fast or distracted by the cat eating something unknown underneath your coffee table. Not to worry though, as I've once again gathered team RPS to tell me in detail about the games that caught their attention during Geoffcom 2022.


Much like our E3 roundup from earlier in the summer, each RPS staffer took ten minutes out of their day to wax lyrical about an upcoming project featured within the showcase. All eight (including yours truly, who thanks to Katharine actually remembered to contribute this time around) chose completely different games. Some picks are more obvious, whereas others are a little off piste. In a good way, of course!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Ninja’s dark fantasy action title Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty impresses in a new gameplay trailer that captures the fast-paced thrills you'd expect from the minds behind Nioh and Ninja Gaiden. 
Fans of the studio's previous action titles should find plenty to love with Wo Long if this video is any indication. Set during the Three Kingdoms era of China, you'll battle invading demons as a soldier using a blend of graceful swordplay and Chinese martial arts based on the Five Phases philosophy. The trailer shows off the many demonic foes awaiting your blade, including a bipedal tiger that is swiftly kicked out of the way by the protagonist. 


Next month, those attending Tokyo Game Show will be the first to play Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty via a show floor demo. Everyone else will have to wait until early 2023 to experience the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.]]></summary>

Thankfully, Micro SD cards are getting extremely affordable, even in massive sizes all the way up to 1TB. Smaller sizes like 256GB and 512GB are better value per gigabyte, but today in the UK there's been a big discount on a 1TB Lexar Play Micro SD card that brings it into contention too. 
The Lexar Play 1TB is now retailing for £110 at Amazon, compared to a usual price of £140. If you'd prefer something a little more high performance, the highly-rated SanDisk Extreme 1TB card is also on sale, dropping from £220 to £140.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Sony Interactive Entertainment announced it will increase the price of PlayStation 5 consoles in various non-U.S. territories due to global economic conditions such as inflation. Microsoft then declared later that day that it will not be doing the same with the Xbox Series X/S. Now, Nintendo has chimed in on the matter. 
In a statement to Eurogamer, Nintendo reiterates a quote from president Shuntaro Furukawa, made in June, in which he stated the company has "no plans to increase the trade price of its hardware.” Furukawa made this statement during the 82nd Annual General Meeting Shareholders that month, in which he also said: 
"While we cannot comment on pricing strategies, we currently do not have any plans to change the price of our hardware due to inflation or increased procurement costs in each country. We will determine our future pricing strategies through careful and continued deliberations.”
Although the PlayStation 5's price will remain unchanged in the U.S. (for now), both versions of the console have become more expensive in Canada, Europe, the UK, Mexico, Japan, and Australia. The price hikes have already gone into effect in those regions except Japan, which occurs on September 15. 
The only time Nintendo significantly adjusted the price of its current consoles was last fall, when it permanently reduced the cost of the standard Switch model in the UK and Europe. Nintendo has yet to do the same in the U.S.

But despite both of these events, it's been difficult to ascertain what the game actually, well, is.

Colour me intrigued, then, as I sat in a quickfire presentation at this year's Gamescom and bore witness to some mythical gameplay.

Since then, development changed hands like a baton at the Olympic relay; Yager left a year later, to be replaced by Sumo Digital, only for Sumo Digital to leave and be replaced by Dambuster Studios. Usain Bolt hasn't expressed interest yet, but there's time.
So going into a 20-minute hands-on with the game in the year 2022, I was a bit apprehensive. What sort of Frankenstinian horror awaited me behind closed doors? But, far from a shambling mess, what I played was a zombie 'em up that seemed close to what Graham saw in 2014, only polished up to a surprising, bloody gloss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not that all the other wars were just a bit of goofing around, but World War One – a conflict remembered more for its bleak, arduous trench warfare than any great triumph over evil – seems like a particularly unusual source of inspiration for a strategy game that will, presumably, be played for fun. Nonetheless, The Great War: Western Front, a combination of macro planning and tactical RTS battling revealed this week at Gamescom, has elected to lean right into WW1’s complexities and difficulties rather than dance around them.

Developers Petroglyph have gone for historical accuracy in various ways, senior designer Chris Becker and audio director Frank Klepacki explain to me at a hands-off demo in Cologne. The soundtrack will even include licensed music from the era. But something they want to really hammer home is the brutality of the war: territory won’t be won in heroic pushes but slowly and bloodily, while collapsing morale is as much a danger as any advancing army.

Netflix revealed in a tweet made today that Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Slumberland) will direct this BioShock film adaptation and Michael Green (Loga, Blade Runner 2049, American Gods) will write the script.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atomic Heart reemerged during Gamescom with a new trailer devoted solely to showing off its impressive, Bioshock-esque combat. Over three minutes of gameplay footage shows off the carnage you'll unleash against adversaries, both artificial and organic. 
Players wield melee weapons or firearms in one hand and more, shall we say, unconventional abilities in the other. That includes electrifying targets with lightning bolts, tossing them around with a telekinesis-like power, freezing foes solid with an ice blast, or using wires to hijack machines. The action-packed video shows off how players can creatively combine their arsenal to dismantle and disembowel anything standing in their way. 


Atomic Heart was first announced in 2018 and takes place in an alternative futuristic version of the Soviet Union in 1955. Robotic technology flourished post World War 2, allowing humanity to create a high-tech utopia. Unfortunately, these mechanical helpers have started rebelling against their human creators. If that wasn’t enough, killer mutants born from secret experiments have also run amok. Players control private agent P-3, who embarks on a secret mission to get to the bottom of what’s caused this seemingly perfect society to collapse and clean up this mess. 
Atomic Heart launches this fall for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It’s also launching on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

It’s a game clearly designed to mimic the picture book imagination of childhood with its hand-drawn visuals and the innocent silent presence of its protagonist, a young boy named OU and his opossum friend. Even its music is reminiscent of some lost, unknown childhood as we’re lulled into the strange world of U-Chronia with the smooth instrumentation of a single guitar and its occasional percussion. Yet it’s clear with the presence of beasts that threaten your safety and a shadowy clone that this isn’t some peaceful retreat into childhood.

A video game sequel is hard to create, especially if the previous game was a commercial success. Why did the game resonate with fans? How many new features does the sequel need to justify another price tag? Should anything be changed at all? How do you make something fresh while retaining the identity established in the first release?
These are the questions developers constantly ask themselves while making a game. The road to publishing a project is full of pitfalls, and it’s easy to lose the path.

Not Age Of Empires II this time, though. 
Because there's no Matthew, I change the Cavern Of Lies into a cavern of moral judgement for Nate, and make him run a gauntlet of some of the most important choices in Dragon Age Inquisition with no context. He turns out to be both authoritarian and kind of wholesome as an Inquisitor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["The thing we're doing with The Dark Pictures is exploring different sub genres of horror," explains game director Tom Heaton. The Dark Pictures Anthology is, well, a horror anthology, each a compact standalone scary game where you explore and deal with QTEs and hazardous choices, in the vein of Supermassive's smash hit Until Dawn. The idea, says Heaton, is that each one takes one or two horror sub-genres and mines them, maybe subverting the tropes here and there. Up next is The Devil In Me, inspired by the infamous Chicago serial killer H. H. Holmes. 
"What I think we decided with The Dark Pictures games early on was that the next game in the series would be very different from the last game, because we want to keep it fresh, we want to give the audience new," Heaton explains. So, after a zombie ghost ship in Man Of Medan, the psychological witch hauntings in Little Hope, and military squad vs. vampire aliens in House Of Ashes, Heaton pitches The Devil In Me as kind of Saw meets The Shining. It's a serial killer slasher in a weirdo hotel, and it has a true crime element. And I have to say, it's probably the most excited I've been for a Dark Pictures entry.

Dead Pets Unleashed looks exactly like my cup of tea, or rather, a fizzling concoction of Red Bull, battery acid, and popping candy. After launching a Kickstarter campaign, developers Triple Topping have released a Dead Pets Unleashed demo, so players can get a taste of the highs and lows of band life and, after playing the demo myself, it’s definitely worth checking out. You'll wanna turn your speakers up for this one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In February, we reported the server shutdown of Dark Souls 3 after a dangerous hack – Remote Code Execution – rendered affected PCs inoperable. Attackers "executed arbitrary code on a remote device, meaning they could take control of a player's PC." But thankfully, seven months later, the servers are back online. 
The official Dark Souls Twitter account initially confirmed servers would remain offline beyond the release of Elden Ring. However, the extensive deactivation period that ensued couldn't have been anticipated. The RCE hack affected all three Dark Souls games. And now that the third entry's multiplayer modes are available again, hopefully, the other games in the franchise will see the light of day, too. 
PC版『DARK SOULS III』におけるセキュリティの脆弱性調査と対応が完了したため、本日よりゲームサーバーを復旧し、オンラインサービスを再開しました。ユーザーの皆様にはお詫び申し上げますとともに、復旧をお待ちいただいたことへの御礼を申し上げます。 https://t.co/mPmnBK9Wbd
August 25, 2022
A translated From Software Support tweet (see above) reads as follows:

"We have completed the security vulnerability investigation and countermeasures for the PC version of "DARK SOULS III," so we have restored the game server and resumed online services from today. We apologize to all users and thank you for waiting for the restoration.

In addition, we are also working on the PC version of "DARK SOULS Ⅱ" and the PC version of "DARK SOULS REMASTERED," and we will inform you as soon as they are restored. We apologize for the inconvenience and inconvenience for all users, but we appreciate your understanding and cooperation."]]></summary>

Now, after the internet noticed the studio is currently hiring for three positions to form a “blockchain team”, developer Build A Rocket Boy have responded to the claims on Reddit.

I've felt proud a number of times at this year's Gamescom so far, marked first by an excellent McDonald's choice (honey crisp chicken and bacon) on the first evening, followed by a doner kebab that put it to shame. And in a non-savoury twist, today it was being a member of the first squad to complete the Warhammer 40K: Darktide demo mission – the sweetest feeling of them all, and a perfect team-bonding exercise.
The bonus emotions? Surprise and... not being so surprised. Surprise that we'd accomplished such a feat, but not so much surprise in the game itself. It was, as expected, a good co-op FPS time! But a very familiar one.

If it actually reaches such speeds in the wild, once it launches in October, that would make it the fastest consumer PCIe 4.0 drive yet. And write speeds aren’t far behind either, at up to 6900MB/s.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Dark Pictures Anthology returns this November with The Devil In Me, which serves as the season finale for the franchise (until the next batch of games arrive). A new trailer showcases the host of new features designed to ensure the season ends with a bang.
The Devil In Me stars actor Jessie Buckley and follows a group of filmmakers fighting for survival in a dangerous house, a replica of H.H. Holmes’ infamous “Murder Castle.” The new trailer runs down additions such as being able to use important tools from a character inventory and extended exploration mechanics; players can freely run, jump, and climb now. Supermassive also reveals the story is over seven hours long. An online shared story lets you enjoy the experience with friends from afar, though you can explore the adventure with friends in the room in local multiplayer. 


The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil In Me arrives November 18 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. You can get a better sense of the game's narrative by watching this recent story trailer.]]></summary>

First announced last fall, the game comes from Soliel Ltd, developer of the upcoming Valkyrie Elysium, and consists of Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive alumni. With those credentials, it's little surprise that Wanted: Dead looks absolutely bonkers. 
The story centers on Hong Kong cop Lt. Hannah Stone, a member of the Zombie Unit. She and her squad must get to the bottom of a corporate conspiracy, but the game doesn’t appear to be nearly as serious as its premise lets on. Gameplay blends stylish swordplay with explosive gunplay as players slice and/or shoot through gang members, mercenaries, and other foes in an adventure that looks ridiculous. The release date trailer also shows off anime cutscenes, rhythm music gameplay, cute cats, and whatever else it manages to cram in. 


Wanted: Dead is launching on February 14 and is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

Developer Mojang Studios is shaking things up with its next spin-off, and after my behind-closed-doors demo at Gamescom, I’m interested.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft’s chief executive officer of gaming and Xbox head Phil Spencer believes games exclusive to a single console will become something we see less of over time. 
This news comes from a new interview with Spencer from Bloomberg discussing Microsoft’s in-the-process acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the landscape of console exclusivity, and more. He believes that this is a good thing for the gaming industry in the long run. 
“[It] is something we’re just going to see less and less of,” when discussing the idea of specific games being exclusive to a single device. “Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox, and I buy a PlayStation, and our kids want to play together, and they can’t because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television.
“We really love being able to bring more players in reducing friction, making people feel safe, secure when they’re playing, allowing them to play with their friends, regardless of what device – I think in the long run that is good for this industry. And maybe in the short run, there’s some people in some companies that don’t love it. But I think as we get over the hump and see where this industry can continue to grow, it proves out to be true.”
Bloomberg also asked Spencer about the status of Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition, how the company will handle unions and ongoing unionization efforts happening within Activision Blizzard, and more, so be sure to check out the publication’s full story here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pentiment, Obsidian Entertainment's medieval narrative adventure title, is coming on November 15. We first learned of the project during the Xbox Games Showcase in June. 
The game's art direction emulates medieval manuscript illustrations and woodcut prints while the story unfolds in 16th-century Bavaria. You play as an illustrator who becomes wrapped up in a series of murders over 25 years. You'll engage in choice-driven conversations where your decisions steer the plot and create lasting consequences in a tale that expands into a larger conspiracy. Check out the original reveal trailer below to see it in action. 


Pentiment is made by a small team within Obsidian led by director Josh Sawyer. You can pick it up on Xbox consoles and PC (day one on Game Pass). It will be the second game that Obsidian ships this year, following the 1.0 release of Grounded in September.]]></summary>

Modern homages to classic video games often go one of two ways: They either stick close to the gameplay conventions to which they are paying tribute, or they expand the original games’ styles in meaningful and innovative ways. Blossom Tales II: The Minotaur Prince, like its 2017 predecessor, is more the former than the latter, adhering closely to the classic Legend of Zelda blueprint, most notably that of A Link to the Past. Despite this lack of innovation, Blossom Tales II still manages to capture many of the acclaimed elements of what many consider to be one of the greatest video …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Park Beyond, an upcoming theme park management sim in the vein of a juiced up Rollercoaster Tycoon, is trying to balance two slightly opposed teams in its target audience. There are people who love doing the management bits - the bean-counting, optimising the amount of salt on fries to make people thirsty and buy more drinks, paying close attention to demographics and average spends and that sort of kidney*. Then there are people who want to design a park full of cool-ass rides and different themed zones, a true magical wonderland. Inside this Park Beyond are two wolves, in other words, and each needs a different but equally robust set of tools to wrangle.
After some hands on with an early build of Park Beyond, I have a little more faith that Limbic Entertainment are going to be able to pull it off. The toolset for building a rollercoast is, in particular, impressive. It's never been so easy to make a ride that breaks both the laws of physics and the laws of health and saftey. The coasters in this game are an absolute menace. In a good way.

When the Splatoon 3-focused Nintendo Direct hit two weeks ago, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the information and how much content the Splatoon team was bringing at launch. As someone who very much enjoyed the first two Splatoon games (as well as Splatoon 2's Octo Expansion), that Nintendo Direct was all I needed to bring my excitement levels up a few notches. However, having the opportunity to get my hands on the soon-to-be-released Splatoon 3 only skyrocketed this game up the list of my most anticipated 2022 releases.
During my 75-minute hands-on session, I was able to check out the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morty Smith from the popular cartoon Rick & Morty is now a playable character in the free-to-play stage fighter, MultiVersus. 
This news comes from a new Morty-focused trailer for MultiVersus that showcases the fighter in action. It features a look at how he plays as a Bruiser class brawler, complete with a muscle-enhanced left arm "Armothy" and the "Plumbus" all-purpose alien device.
Check these moves out and more in the trailer below:


"Morty, the teenage grandson of a mega-genius scientist Rick Sanchez, arrives as part of MultiVersus Season 1 and is a Bruiser class character with more than a few tricks up his sleeve," a press release reads. "Morty's moveset, which is on display in a newly released gameplay trailer, features a mix of skills and attacks, from his muscle-enhanced left arm 'Armothy' and 'Plumbus' all-purpose alien device, to his ability to whip himself at opponents and use of various projectiles."
The trailer also reveals the President Morty character variant, which is available as an in-game purchase right now.
For more, check out every character nerf and buff from the big MultiVersus Season 1 update, and then read about how Black Adam and Stripe from Gremlins are coming to the game this season at some point. Check out our thoughts on the game in the Game Informer MultiVersus review after that, and then read about how MultiVersus was July's best-selling game in the U.S. thanks to its Founder's Pack.

Think of all the dirt and clumps of dust you’d be grossed out by, and don't even get me started about being outside. Giant horrific insects? No thanks. I’m already emotionally scarred from the giant bug puppets in Honey, I Shrunk The Kids, and it’s the reason I won’t ever play Grounded (soz Obsidian).
Thankfully, Tinykin takes a more whimsical approach to this hellish situation. It’s a sci-fi adventure platformer where you and a tiny alien army explore a giant house and, as a bite-size summary, it’s excellent. Splashteam have made a fun, laid-back Pikmin-like bursting with humorous surprises and I played the game with a silly grin on my face the entire time.

That essence has made its way into Blossom Tales II, a charming light adventure game in the classic "going on an adventure" sense rather than the "rubbing every item on every other item until you're allowed to play again" genre sense.
You're playing out a story playfully told by your grandfather, who's cast you as the wee hero of a village out to rescue your brother from the sinister Minotaur King. Both of you occasionally interject, sometimes prompting a decision that changes the game a little as your granddad amends things to your liking. It doesn't go to the full meta-narrative lengths of a Juarez Gunslinger with it, but it's a cute touch and keeps the framing relevant.

It's only by four days, though, to October 21st, which is sort of baffling. Maybe Warner Bros. are about to announce a new DC-verse TV show coming out on the Knights' original release date of the 25th? Who knows. But along with this early-release sneak attack is a new trailer, giving us a closer look at the rogues gallery that the extended Bat-family are up against.

The RPG combines the story of Pinocchio with some major Bloodborne energy, as the puppet searches for a way to become a real human boy in a decimated city. This is far from the classic fairytale story though. With a dark-gothic backdrop and mechanical killer robots to contend with, Pinocchio has his work cut out for him.

Of course, they also work for desktop computers too - and are much more portable and space-saving than an average actual desktop monitor. 
You can even get OLED models now - and a coupon code on Amazon US brings one model down from Innocn from $350 to $200 when you tick the 'coupon' box on the product page. That's quite a bargain for a 15.6-in portable screen of this calibre.

It's a new fantasy action RPG, with super powers, set in a semi-open world. In what is becoming something of a theme for me tonight, however, the trailer doesn't really give much away about the game aside from the topline selling points. There is a tiny, teeny smattering of gameplay at the end, though. Big swords, big monsters, big magic, big sand. In another continuing theme from games revealed tonight, Atlas Fallen is out next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, the Dead Island 2: Day One Edition leaked on Amazon, showing a Lenny Kravitz-like warrior on the box cover. So, it’s only fitting that Gamescom 2022 ended with two trailers (cinematic and gameplay) for the long-overdue zombie-slaying sequel. 


We follow a chiseled survivor named Jacob as he leaves the safety of his (bloodied) condo and ventures into a Californian hellscape swarming with undead. He kills several adversaries with an empty rifle, jutting it through their rotten bodies and smashing their heads against the pavement with its wooden butt. 
The gameplay trailer shows scenic beaches, forsaken suburbs, cratered city streets, and still-lit carnivals. In what is one of the most graphic clips I’ve ever seen at a game show, we watch as the player-character clobbers zombies with blunt objects, jump-kicks adversaries off roofs (parkour mechanics?), and shoots gasoline tanks to engulf hordes in flames.


Dead Island 2 is a first-person action RPG with six playable characters. And according to a designer who appeared onstage, the gory romp has an irreverent, pulpy tone and gameplay that’s all about “experimenting with your preferred zombie-slaying methods.”
Dead Island 2 punches and kicks its way onto PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 3.]]></summary>

The game looks overly graphic, yet also brings about comparisons to BioShock's tone and storytelling conventions. It'll be interesting to see how the narrative sews all of these wild experiements together. The Outlast Trials is designed as both a single-player and cooperative experience. The player clearly is free to explore at certain points, and appears to rely on trap-like devices to fight back and escape. In one sequence, we see two players helping each other up to higher ground.
The footage concludes with news of a short closed beta running from October 28 to November 1. No other release date news was shared.]]></summary>

The show is called Brain Structure. Or to be specific, Hideo Kojima presents Brain Structure. 
As for what, exactly, the podcast is, it's a bit unclear. Kojima announced Keighley would have a regular entertainment news section and that the show will feature "very special guests from various fields." The first episode will be released on September 8, with subsequent episodes coming out weekly. English and Japanese versions will be available.
If you don't want to wait, a pilot episode is available now. Episode "#00 Prologue" dives into Kojima's creative process. Check it out right here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Telltale is known for choice-driven storytelling, and yet, the first trailer for The Expanse focuses entirely on action. As XO Camina Drummer keeps tabs on her mutinous crew, she'll also be tasked to navigate the ruins of a downed vessel on the outskirts of an asteroid belt.
The trailer showed Drummer space walking, dodging debris, and working her way through the massive vessel. We also see her throw a punch and grapple with someone in zero gravity. To bring this beloved science-fiction universe to life, Telltale enlisted the development talents of Deck Nine (best known for the Life is Strange series). The first pre-alpha footage looks ambitious and dark, delivering a cinematic viewpoint into an investigation riddled with death. The facial animations on the characters also look like an evolution from Telltale's previous work, yet some of the same facial features look similar.
The Expanse is slated to release in summer 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Killer Klowns From Outer Space, the science fiction comedy horror from the late 80s, made a surprise crash landing during today’s Gamescom showcase. Believe it or not, the cult classic film is getting a game adaptation.


The trailer starts with a comical cinematic sequence – a teenage boy listens to loud music and plays the air guitar in his bedroom while the once-peaceful neighborhood beyond his window gets vaporized. When he notices the explosions and opens the front door, Killer Klowns with blasters reveal themselves from behind a stack of boxed pizza pies. 
Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game is “a crazy new take on multiplayer horror” from the executive director of Friday The 13th: The Game. Brief gameplay clips were shown, with Killer Klowns firing lasers at fleeing civilians in a carnival playspace. A band of teens plan a retaliatory attack from a nearby tower, and chaos ensues.
Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in early 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something Wicked Games, a new studio made up of developers whose credits include Fallout 4 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, has revealed its first game, Wyrdsong, in a new trailer. 
The trailer was released as part of the Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley, and while it was short, it featured plenty of mystery and fantasy intrigue.
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, there's not too much to glean from it. However, we did note what was said by the narrator during it: "In the cracks of reality, there exists two lives, one before the shadow and one behind the eye." Sounds spooky. 
"Wyrdsong is an occult historical fantasy RPG set in a fictionalized Portugal in the middle ages," a press release reads. "Players will be challenged to question both their reality and the choices they make as Wyrdsong is set to expand, question, and re-define aspects of what makes up the current Role Playing Game genre." 
Shortly after the trailer's release, Jeff Gardiner, an ex-Bethesda Studios dev with credits in Fallout 76, Skyrim, Fallout 4, and more, posted a link on Twitter that leads to the newly-launched Something Wicked Games website. 
"Our goal with Something Wicked Games is to utilize our independent and creative autonomy to create the next evolution of open world RPGs," Gardiner, who is the founder and CEO of Something Wicked Games, writes in a press release. "Our first project, Wyrdsong, has been my dream game for some time now, and I'm thrilled to finally share it today." 
A press release also states the game is being developed in Unreal Engine 5.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Squanch Games has released a new trailer for its upcoming first-person shooter High On Life, and this time, we get to watch our protagonist take down a boss. 
This trailer, which aired during today's Gamescom Opening Night Live presentation, highlights a fight between our protagonist and their loud-mouthed weapons and 9-Torg, an alien boss. The boss fight features some standard point-and-shoot combat, but it also features some platforming too by way of a grapple hook-like knife tongue thing in your arsenal. Because the weapons have personalities and speak, you'll get to hear said knife tongue thing drop more f-bombs than ever heard before in a boss fight, too. 
Check out the High On Life 9-Torg boss fight trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, the boss fight looks like a great time, and it deserves some props for being more than just a who-shoots-who-more type of battle. High On Life hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) on Dec. 13.

The trailer was surprisingly substantive. On top of plenty of flavor text about the dark and gritty world, we saw several gameplay shots – including, but not limited to, destroying giant steampunk monsters in a victorian theater, massive open levels, and even lighting a marionette-inspired spider on fire. A Pinnochio-inspired soulslike might be a goofy sentence to type, but you know what? The game looks really neat. Check it out below: 


Lies of P doesn't yet have a release date. However, it'll be released on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC sometime next year. Better still, it's coming to Xbox's Game Pass on day one.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anakin Skywalker doesn't like sand, but developer Deck13 Interactive is hoping you will love it in Atlas Fallen, a new action/RPG experience that is all about the grainy substance. This Focus Entertainment-published title debuted at Gamecom Opening Night Live, and is slated to release in 2023 for PlayStation 5 Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
The game is set within the sands of a timeless land, and the protagonist can unleash sand-powered abilities and infuse sand into shape-shifting weapons. The sand arsenal is used to hunt legendary monsters in either a single-player or cooperative campaign. In the cinematic trailer, we see one hero use sand to repair a bridge, and another hero glide along the sand like she's on a hoverboard. Together, the heroes create various weapons with the sand, like a whip, to down a handful of alien dogs. We'll have to wait to see how closely the gameplay mimics the cinematics.
Deck13 Interactive is the studio behind Lords of the Fallen and The Surge series of games.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soldier Boyz is the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, and it’s ready for public testing!
Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn't find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

Created in 1996 by Rocket Science Games and published in early 1997, this ambitious 3D-rendered first-person adventure has you journey through 4 surreal, dream-like worlds in search of your lost colleague.
ScummVM currently supports the English and German versions.  It features a widescreen mode, improved cinematic quality, and a few bug fixes. A Japanese version also exists, but we need more information about it to support it. Please contact us if you have a copy of the Japanese version or some other language version that we haven't discovered yet.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. You can also download a demo here.  If you encounter any issues, please submit them to the issue tracker!
