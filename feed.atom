The LEGO Overwatch 2 "Titan" set pictured above was scheduled to come out next month, but The LEGO Group has decided to postpone the release following accusations of harassment, discrimination, and misconduct at the California-based offices of Activision Blizzard.
Activision Blizzard, the video game giant responsible for Overwatch, Guitar Hero, and Call of Duty, was sued last year by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing over allegations of "pervasive frat boy workplace culture", racism, and "blatant sexual harassment" which affected many of its employees.

You'll either know what these are, or you'll be annoyed that your entire feed is taken up with them. As it turns out, they're just the spoiler-free results of a game called Wordle — a daily, free, browser-based word-guessing game by a man named Josh Wardle (it's a play on his last name). It's simple and about as fun as doing the crossword, but what propelled it into virality is the enticingly mysterious way that you can share your results coded into squares.

For the sequel, she’s not the same underdog we watched come into her own. She’s proven herself, becoming a hero in the eyes of the populace around her. Of course, once you succeed and earn the title of “greatest machine hunter in the land,” the pressure’s on to live up to people’s expectations, and Aloy isn’t going to have it easy this time around.
When it rains, it pours. Six months after the events of Horizon Zero Dawn, Aloy heads westward to find out more about a mysterious Red Blight, which signals the degradation of the biosphere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on "violations of the state's civil rights and equal pay laws," specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

Lego has delayed the upcoming release of its Lego Overwatch 2 Titan set as a result of the ongoing Activision Blizzard controversy. 
This news comes by way of TheBrickFan, which reports that Lego is pausing the release of the set in order to review its partnership with Activision Blizzard in light of allegations against the company and leadership within. The latest of said controversy was revealed back in December when a current Blizzard employee said in a press conference that she was demoted after filing an HR complaint about sexual harassment. Here’s Lego’s official statement regarding the indefinite delay:
This decision by Lego must have come in the final hour because the Overwatch 2 Titan set was due out very soon. With less than three weeks to go, it wouldn’t be surprising if these boxes were already being sent to retailers before today. 
There’s no word on when this set will be released or when Lego’s review of its partnership with Activision Blizzard will be complete.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, it depends...

The benefit of hindsight makes it easy to declare that the Switch was a masterstroke in design that could not fail. That'd be revisionism, of course, as Nintendo released the system against a rather challenging backdrop in early 2017. The Wii U had been a failure, and that's not hyperbole — it managed lifetime sales of just 13.56 million units, Nintendo's worst return aside from the Virtual Boy. After a tough launch, the 3DS established itself as a popular device and shifted a respectable 75.94 million units to date across its various models. For context, though, that's less than half the sales of the Nintendo DS family, the company's best-selling system to date with 154.02 million sales.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie revealed way back in 2020 that Savathûn, the sister of Oryx from Destiny’s The Taken King, would be getting her own expansion and last year, the studio revealed that our guardians would be taking on The Witch Queen come February. 
With February 22 right around the corner, Bungie’s marketing for the upcoming Destiny 2 expansion has been ramping up and today, the company released a trailer all about the new exploration area in it: Savathûn’s Throne World. As seen in other trailers, Savathûn is a big fan of anything with a dark hue of green and her throne world is no different. However, all is not as it seems there as Savathûn considers the area to essentially be an extension of her mind.

“Tell me, oh honored guest,” Savathûn says in the trailer. “Why would you want to escape? This Throne World is indistinguishable from my own mind, Guardian. Every step taken, every bullet fired, I keep and count them all. It’s not too late to turn around.” 
That’s not foreboding at all…
As you can see in the trailer above, the Throne World looks quite unique compared to other places we’ve visited in Destiny 2, with a distinct horror feel to it all. It also looks quite diverse, too, which is exciting. The trailer’s description mentions Savathûn’s “glistening palace” and “gnarled roots in the swamp” so it sounds like there’s a journey ahead of us before actually reaching Savathûn’s Throne. 
We’ll all learn more when The Witch Queen hits Destiny 2 on February 22. 
While waiting for this expansion, check out Game Informer’s Lore Refresher on Savathûn and then read about how you’ll need need the digital deluxe edition of The Witch Queen to play through its dungeons, less you want to purchase them separately. Watch this narrative-focused trailer for Destiny 2: The Witch Queen released back in December after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Far: Changing Tides, the sequel to 2018’s Far: Lone Sails, has secured a release date, and it’s not too far (eh?) away. The meditative post-apocalyptic adventure sets sail on March 1. 
Like its predecessor, Changing Tides tasks players with piloting and maintaining a large makeshift vessel, this time to explore a flooded world. Along the way, you’ll explore underwater cities and other vestiges of humanity while solving environmental puzzles in the ship or on foot. The adolescent protagonist can dive beneath the surface to recover scrap and other materials as well. Like in the first game, don’t be surprised if you grow attached to your ship as you constantly tinker with it in order to overcome new obstacles. A new release date trailer offers a fresh, albeit brief, look at what’s in store.

Far: Changing Tides will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can read our review of the first game here.]]></summary>

Ross spoke rather freely with FTW about his philosophies of creating games, stories from the creation of Days Gone, and what he felt went right and wrong with the project. He also spoke about iteration in games, which he was hoping to do in a potential sequel to the open-world zombie/biker adventure. Comparing Days Gone to other popular franchises, Ross points out how the Batman: Arkham series or Uncharted build upon the ideas and features as the installments go on.

Another aiming to make its mark soon is Infernax, launching on Valentine's Day (14th February).

The huge growth of online multiplayer, and especially free-to-play, has opened up cross-play as a relatively common feature. Titles that support this on Switch, for example, include Rocket League and Knockout City.

Not at all unlike the stormy weather featured in EA Dice’s latest release, Battlefield 2042, players can use these new tornadoes to traverse the battle royale map quickly by simply hopping in. You’ll know a tornado is on the way, too, as it’ll swirl in the sky first before touching down.

“If you see a tornado start to form, that’s no signal to flee,” a press release about the v19.01 update reads. “Instead, run into it as a swirling escape strategy. You’ll spin round and round ‘til you choose to glide to safety – or if you stay spinning long enough – ‘til the twister spit…]]></summary>

Night Trap and Bandersnatch fans, rejoice: The FMV genre is not dead. In fact, it's now glitzier than ever, with the announcement of Aviary Studios' debut game, The Gallery, coming to the Nintendo Switch this April.
The Gallery, a "part hostage thriller, part social drama" choose-your-own-fate game, is set in both 1981 and 2021, as an art curator is held hostage by a portraitist who wants to paint them — and threatens to detonate a bomb if they are interrupted in any way.

If you’re playing solo or with one other friend, launching into a match is much easier than launching into one with a larger squad. If you fall into the latter camp, there’s a good chance you can’t even get into a match proper and while 343 Industries attempted to get this issue mitigated before the studio’s holiday break, it wasn’t able to get it completely fixed. According to a new post-holiday break Halo Infinite blog post, a fix is coming soon.

The game, developed by Galip Kartoğlu and published by Stun Games, boasts a selection of unique fighters, each with their own styles and moves, as well as an emphasis on tactical fighting – you won't just be hammering every button as fast as you can here.

After initially backtracking to clarify that 500 hours is how long it'd take to do absolutely everything, Techland have now explained that you can finish the game's main story in 20 hours, or 80 if you hit every side quest too.

Remember the shock of Sony entering the handheld market with the PSP? Many experts predicted that the sleek console would spell the end of Nintendo's dominance in the portable sector, and while the PSP was undoubtably a commercial success, it wasn't enough to unseat Nintendo's DS, which sold a whopping 154.02 million units worldwide (compared to the estimated 82 million units of the PSP).
Sony's successor, the PS Vita, was far less popular, with estimated sales of between 10 and 15 million – a fact which saw the Japanese tech giant pull out of the handheld arena to instead focus its energies on its home console line – which, based on the robust performance of the PS4, was a wise move.

Court documents have revealed details of a story of two LAPD officers who were fired from the force back in 2017 for playing Pokémon GO on duty — whilst ignoring calls for backup at a nearby robbery-in-progress.
As reported by Vice, Officers Louis Lozano and Eric Mitchell, who have just had their appeal for reinstatement denied by a California judge, were in the vicinity of an ongoing robbery at a Macy's in Crenshaw when they received urgent calls from colleagues to provide support.

Sega's taking great care with Sonic's next mainline outing, Sonic Frontiers. Apart from making the tough decision to delay the release in order to "brush up the quality" of the title, it's also been added in additional features to make the experience more accessible to everyone.
As part of this, Sonic's new game will bolster its localisation offerings - with even more supported languages in both voiced and subtitle form. Here's the full rundown, courtesy of the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account. Note: * for Xbox and PC only.

The mod support for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild over the past few years has been outstanding.
One thing we're yet to see though is multiplayer support. As you might recall, someone last year offered $10k to anyone who could create a mod for BotW that made this happen. With this in mind, a modder by the name of Alex Mangue (in collaboration with Sweet and Ethi) recently uploaded some clips to show what they've been working on (thanks for the tip, @Swiftfeet16).

Lost Ark has already had success in other regions, but the title will finally see a launch in North America next month after many years. In a nutshell, Lost Ark has a ton of features and mechanics that you’d expect in a traditional MMORPG like dungeons, raids, loot, crafting, home building, and more. So what’s the hook? It’s all tied together with stylish action combat, more akin to what you’d find in a modern ARPG like Diablo, Path of Exile, or Torchlight. Check out the trailer below to get a taste of what you can expect!

With various character classes to suit most traditional archetypes and years and years of content already online in other territories, Lost Ark has a blueprint for launching heavy and hard come February 11 on PC. We’ll have to see exactly what choices Amazon Games has made to many systems, especially monetization, but we won’t have long to wait. Are you looking forward to Lost Ark?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the weekend, developer Techland made waves on social media by tweeting that its upcoming open-world zombie sequel, Dying Light 2: Stay Human, would take "at least 500 hours" to fully complete. While the studio likely thought this was good messaging to showcase just how much content is in its branching-narrative story, the announcement was met with some backlash amidst the excitement, as some players bemoaned the length and worried about bloat or that they would never see the end of such a massive adventure.
Later, as the studio saw some of the negative response, the Dying Light Twitter account clarified to one fan that you can complete the story and side-quests in 70 to 80 hours, "if you're not in a rush." Then, the official Twitter account took the messaging wide, saying that "500 ho…]]></summary>

That initial release was treated like a joke in the U.S. Yakuza was seen as a Japanese crime curio by some and an inferior Grand Theft Auto knock-off by others. But mostly, it was just ignored. 
Over the years, creator Toshihiro Nagoshi and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio continued to churn out one Yakuza sequel after the other. I remember a small minority in the gaming community praised the series’ combat, humor, and storytelling, but the general public broadly waved off these games. However, slowly something started to change. With each new Yakuza, that vocal minority grew until they just couldn’t be ignored.

Following this past weekend’s reveal that doing every single thing in Dying Light 2 Stay Human will take 500 hours (and less than 100 hours to beat the story, complete all side quests, and explore the map), Techland has told Game Informer that the main story of Dying Light 2 can be completed in about 20 hours. 
“Completing all the side quests, learning about the world’s history, and engaging with all characters can easily take 80 hours or more, depending on playstyle,” Techland says. “Dying Light 2 takes place in a complex world filled with content and built both broadly and vertically.” 
For comparison, Techland says that in the original Dying Light, finishing the main story and all side quests took about 30 hours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Legends: Arceus is scheduled to arrive on Nintendo Switch on January 28. That’s not far away at all. Will the formula shake-up from the standard treatment prove to be a success? While that remains to be seen, a trailer unveiled today gives prospective players a taste of some of the experiences they can expect to see in the latest Pokémon entry. While it’s been already relayed that the game won’t be a “true” open world, it looks like the colorful little critters do roam free in various areas. Check out the full trailer below.

An action slant and style for the game seems to add quite a few new elements for players to engage with, while still maintaining the classic core of Pokémon. Based on the new trailer, it looks like crafting will be quite important as a mechanic, so that particular aspect is intriguing to me. Also, you can fly on a bird, which makes me wonder if the rest of the traditional HM abilities will be represented with heavy action and mobility. I’d say there’s a pretty good chance, especially since it looks like you can also surf around in the water on your favorite Gyrados.
Are you looking forward to a different direction in Pokémon for this title? Will it be a Switch smash hit to start the year? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

PlayStation released the full list of top downloads on the PlayStation Network in December today, and as usual, it gives us a great look at what players were interested in last month. While Among Us took the top spot on both PS4 and PS5 in the U.S., Canada, and EU, a big movie release helped push an older title into the number two spot.

It’s no surprise that when people left the theaters after Spider-Man: No Way Home, they were rearing for more Spider-Man, and what better way to experience more Spidey fun than with Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales?

Among Us
Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales
Call of Duty: Vanguard

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix is developing a "Scott Pilgrim" anime with creator and graphic novel artist Bryan Lee O’Malley. 
This news comes by way of The Hollywood Reporter, which reports that O’Malley will also write and executive produce the series based on his cult-classic graphic novel series (and subsequent film). Netflix is developing the adaptation with UPC, the group behind Netflix’s The Umbrella Academy and SyFy’s Chucky TV series.

O’Malley is writing and and executive producing this Scott Pilgrim anime alongside the showrunner for Nickelodeon’s Are You Afraid of the Dark? series, Ben David Grabinski. However, it’s important to note that a series order has not been made, so the anime isn’t entirely off the ground just yet – it’s simply in the works for now. If it’s picked up for a full series order, O’Malley and Grabinski will serve as the showrunners. 
As far as animation goes, it’s being handled by anime studio Science Saru (Devilman Crybaby, Star Wars Visions). Saru’s Eunyoung Choi will be a producer for Scott Pilgrim and the company’s Abel Gongora will direct the series. The Hollywood Reporter writes that the members of the Sex Bob-omb are set to be featured in the anime, with Scott Pilgrim movie director Edgar Wright and producing partner Nira Park also working as executive producers on the series alongside and Adam Seigel, Jared LeBoff, Marc Platt, and Michael Bacall.  
"Scott Pilgrim" was published as six volumes between 2004 and 2010 and Wright’s movie based on those volumes, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, was released in 2010 with Michael Cera playing the titular character. There’s no word if any of the cast members from that film are returning for the anime. 
While waiting for the anime, read about why Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game is still one of the best 2D brawlers out there.

It’s not a match for Monster Hunter World on overall visual fidelity and detail, but the upside is that it’s easy to go a-huntin’ at high frame rates even if you’re on low end hardware. To whit, Monster Hunter Rise’s PC requirements go even lower than World’s, only asking for a GT 1030 or Radeon RX 550 at minimum.

There’s the green tights version the world first met in 1948 and that slowly evolved into a green suit with purple accents. We also got more on-the-nose versions with some Riddler iterations dawning a costume covered in question marks and sometimes carrying a question mark cane.
Frank Gorshin’s Riddler from the 1960s Adam West Batman series (and movie) played with both the green suit look and the green tights look. Then, we saw Jim Carrey step into those tights in 1995’s Batman Forever and that was the last silver screen appearance of …]]></summary>

But far from being a step down from World, Monster Hunter Rise is every bit its equal - and Capcom's stellar work with this PC port has given it a much-needed buff and polish to really make it shine. Not only does Rise offer the same seamless and expansive environments as World, but it also adds a few new twists to make tracking down its titular titans even more enjoyable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the presents I got for Christmas this year was a copy of PS5 exclusive Spider-Man: Miles Morales. I had about a week where I was completely by myself this year, and I spent it being Spidey and self-yeeting around New York. It's a great game on many levels, and I especially liked that one of the outfits you can unlock through story missions is a scarf and ear warmers. Mostly though, it's just made me think that web-swinging is the most fun way to get around in games, and more games should do it. By "more games", I mean "every game".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I briefly posted before the new year about WorldBox - God Simulator, and Graham wrote about it over the weekend, too. It is a world simulation game that has no resource costs or goals, just simulated events. You make a world, plop some animals and fantasy races into it (and if you want, a bunch of dragons and wizards) and see what happens. I cannot stop playing it. And I wanted to give some more detailed examples of how the simulation works, especially if you just leave it running with little intervention.
I am a WorldBox scientist, you see (though merely a BSc at the moment), and my first experiments suggest that every civilisation, along a long enough time scale, is basically doomed. Big 2022 energy. In the case of WorldBox, this may be because at some stage the scientist running the experiment will get bored and drop in e.g. a tornado. That's okay, because there are almost infinite experiments to run. I hope that isn't how the simulation I am living in is being run. Oh no. Don't think about it.

        <id>116904</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/01/10/elden-ring-is-steams-most-anticipated-game-after-taking-top-wishlist-spot-from-dying"/>
        <updated>2022-01-10T15:13:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elden Ring is seemingly the hype train that just won’t stop and with less than two months to go until release, it is now officially Steam’s most anticipated title. 
That’s because From Software’s upcoming action RPG is now the most wishlisted game on Steam. It’s an impressive feat for Elden Ring as Techland’s highly-anticipated sequel to 2015’s Dying Light held that spot for 12 months, as reported by Eurogamer. Steam’s “Top Wishlists” page is a great indicator for Steam player hype, but unfortunately, it does not reveal any specific numbers.

However, someone wishlisting a game does not automatically translate to a purchase so if there were numbers, it wouldn’t necessarily be indicative of how much Elden Ring is going to sell on Steam. It’s a great indicator for general excitement around the title, though, and considering Dying Light 2 held the top spot for a year (after taking it from Cyberpunk 2077), Elden Ring is sitting pretty. 
For context, here’s what the top 10 on Steam’s “Top Wishlists” page looks like right now: 
Elden Ring
Dying Light 2 Stay Human
Party Animals
God of War (2018)
Hollow Knight: Silksong
The Day Before
Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl
Starfield
Frostpunk 2
As you can see, Elden Ring is sitting above some very exciting releases such as Starfield, the PC version of God of War, and the sequel to indie darling Hollow Knight, Hollow Knight: Silksong. Hopefully, Elden Ring delivers on all the hype it’s garnered so far. One Game Informer editor who previewed the game seems to think so. 
For more about Elden Ring, check out some gameplay from this New Gameplay Today segment and then watch the latest trailer released for Elden Ring. Read about the different resolution and performance priority modes featured in Elden Ring after that.

The original Mass Effect 3 had various "Happy Ending Mods" to change the close of Commander Shepard's story, and now Mass Effect Legendary Edition does, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. This week, we examine Bungie's smaller experimental entry in the series, Halo 3: ODST.
Halo 3: ODST was released on the Xbox 360 on September 22, 2009, and was intended to be a smaller project designed by a skunkworks team. However, the development of ODST has roots in Peter Jackson's aborted attempt to make a Halo film/game. For the next hour, we talk about ODST's relatively short development time, why the title changed from Halo 3: Recon, the innovative Firefight multiplayer mode, and Bungie's push to spin out from under Microsoft and become its own company again.
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves) and Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and former Game Informer editor Bryan Vore (@Bryan_Vore) as we unpack the history and impact of the first Halo game to not feature Master Chief.  And for more Halo, be sure to check out our definitive ranking of every Halo game.
Check out the rest of our podcast on the Video Gameography hub. If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every year a glut of video game releases hit the market, making it hard to keep track of everything. RPG fans had a pretty good 2021, from fantastic indies to new games in popular franchises. Bandai Namco gave us two stellar RPGs in Tales of Arise and Scarlet Nexus. Remakes and remasters, like Nier: Replicant, Mass Effect Legendary Edition, and Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, provided plenty of nostalgia, while also bringing new fans into the fold. Longawaited entries finally debuted with Shin Megami Tensei V and Neo: The World Ends With You. And that’s only scratching the surface. Here are five RPGs worth your time that may have slipped past your radar.

Persona 5 (and its Royal expansion) is easily one of my favorite games of all time. The limited details surrounding the next game’s narrative, combat, and music have forced superfans like me to make their own wishlists. So, here are six – that’s right, six! – features I’d like to see in Persona 6:
  



      
												
All-Adult Cast
Look, I love Persona’s tried and true narrative DNA – a crew of teenage outcasts call upon their mystical alter egos to defend the world from evil forces while also juggling hobbies, romance, and classes. Nevertheless, I’m ready for Atlus to bring the series’ mature themes to the adult world.

They were excited to push the company’s tech and to bring a cult hit into Rockstar’s vision for the future. They were excited for the chance to prove themselves as a Rockstar studio, having recently been purchased by the company. They were excited to lead development on Bully 2, the sequel to Rockstar’s critically acclaimed open-world adventure about life in a private school.
But things don’t always go as planned, and other obligations on a release schedule get in the way of passion projects. Rockstar New England’s Bully 2 was shelved in favor of other, more troubled projects in development, like Max Payne 3 and Red Dead Redemption.

Kula and her ice-centric moves were revealed in a new trailer this week. Formerly a member of Team K' in past King of Fighters installments, she's joined the tournament with newcomer Krohnen (who's mechanically a callback to the popular Akira-inspired KOF character K9999) and Ángel, a former NESTS assassin with a pro wrestling move set.

It would have been quite the shock if a fan-favorite face like Kula didn't make the main roster of KOFXV, but since she's the 38th character revealed from a confirmed roster of 39, other mainstays like Taekwondo practitioner Kim may have to wait for DLC or miss out entirely. There are rumors as to who the final character will end up being, but what we do know is there's only one spot on a team open, and it's alongside Ash Crimson and Kukri. 
The King of Fighters XV is scheduled for release on February 17 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Those who preorder it digitally can start fighting a few days sooner with an early access period that begins on February 14.]]></summary>

Revealed on a Careers web page, Question Games, the team behind The Magic Circle and The Blackout Club, is working on a new South Park game and a job listing might hint at multiplayer. The listing also reveals that the game will be developed in Unreal Engine with an aim to release on “modern systems” such as PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

“Question and South Park Digital Studios are seeking a Lead Level Designer for work on a new video game set in the world of South Park,” the Lead Level Designer job listing on Question Games’ Careers page reads. 
The requirements section of this listing reveals that multiplayer experience is a must for anyone who applies, which could hint that this South Park game could feature some kind of multiplayer. This would be especially interesting because both South Park: The Stick of Truth and South Park: The Fractured But Whole were single-player. 
“Multiplayer Experience – Shipped at least one multiplayer game as a senior level designer or have equivalent relevant experience,” the requirements for the Lead Level Designer position read.

You can check out the full Careers page here, but there’s not much else to gleam from the listings. Whether or not this South Park game resembles the last two released or is something totally different, only time will tell. For now, read Game Informer’s South Park: The Stick of Truth review and then check out Game Informer’s South Park: The Fractured But Whole review.

Twelve Minutes: a timeloop thriller. Lemnis Gate: a tactical FPS where you out time loop one another. The Forgotten City, the Outer Wilds DLC, watching a man throw a “traditional shaped returning” boomerang on YouTube. All of them, time loops.
I’m absolutely sick of them. So here’s me hoping that 2022 is the year of the "time skip", instead. Or at least, one of these coming years an excessive number of games built around skipping time. Yes, they aren't without their flaws, but I'd argue they're less repetitive and capable of greater surprise. Alright, at least hear me out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas.

Fallen Order was released November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Daniel Tack, and Andrew Reiner on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

Yesterday, Game Informer reported that Days Gone director Jeff Ross said Bend Studio's latest game sold more than Ghost of Tsushima, which recently hit a milestone after selling 8 million copies. However, in a recent livestream with former God of War and Twisted Metal director David Jaffe, Ross revealed that his source for the sales numbers was a now-defunct website called Gamestat, which tracks PlayStation Trophy data, as reported by PushSquare. 
Here's what Ross said: "Where I got my data from, I had access to a lot of telemetry, and I could see stuff and when we were at 5 million copies – when we were announced at 5 million copies – the telemetry data was at 5.8 [million].

Does the idea of Pokémon Snap but with dogs appeal to you? Pupperazzi has you covered. Armed with your trusty camera, you’ll capture a variety of dog breeds in a world seemingly populated with nothing but canines. You’ll catch them doing all manner of strange things, like jamming to music, riding bicycles (somehow), or executing death-defying skateboard tricks. You can adorn pups in different outfits and upgrade your camera to capture better, more dynamic photos. Watch the most recent gameplay trailer below if you need something to cheer you up.

This year’s show is technically still going for another day, but like a Foo Fighters album, CES tends to front-load the good stuff. As such, it’s basically safe to start rounding up any PC gaming kit highlights. Some of these have been a long time coming – like the GeForce RTX 3050, Nvidia’s first XX50 desktop GPU with full ray tracing and DLSS support – while others might be pleasant surprises or eye-catching, if likely to be witheringly expensive, new concepts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Bend Studio director Jeff Ross revealed earlier this week that Days Gone sold more than Ghost of Tsushima, but was not praised like it and instead seen as a disappointment by Sony and PlayStation. Discussing that with former God of War and Twisted Metal director David Jaffe on a recent livestream, Ross also revealed some other pitches Bend Studio made after a sequel to Days Gone was rejected. 
As first reported by Video Games Chronicle, Ross said he was especially interested in rebooting PlayStation’s long-dormant Resistance series, which was created by Insomniac Games back in the PlayStation 3 generation. Like the pitch to Days Gone 2, though, it was rejected.

You know, after it was announced as Rainbow Six: Quarantine, changed its name, dipped under the radar for ages, then re-emerged with news it was being delayed. Signs pointed to a shaky spin-off from Rainbow Six: Siege's popular Outbreak mode. But no, I was totally wrong! After an early hands on with the game, I’m now at ease, at least when I’m at a safe distance. You see, the zombies here may be fewer in number, but they don’t mess about. This makes for a tactical spin on zombie-slaying that truly rewards teamwork, and it’s wonderful as a result.

Surely it’d be another video game TV project that would stumble through development until it’s quietly canceled, only for the world to collectively ask years later, “Hey, what happened to that Fallout show?” That’s what video game movies and TV developments have done to me. In this instance, though, it appears I’m wrong because production is moving forward and the show now has a director. 
Those familiar with HBO’s Westworld series might recognize him, too, as it’s the same person who created and executive produced that series: Jonathan Nolan, the brother of famed director Christopher Nolan (The Dark Night, Inception…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2022 is finally here and that can only mean one thing. We've got another year of hip new video games to look forward to, and we've been busy rustling up the ones we're most excited about. In truth, there are tons of games on the horizon that could easily sit on this list, and some of them are so close to release we can practically already see the pixels on our screens morphing into their lush, polygonal landscapes. Games like Monster Hunter Rise, God Of War and Rainbow Six Extraction. You won't find them here, but trust us, you'll be seeing a lot of them over the coming weeks. 
There are always more games coming out than we have fingers to write about them, but the 2022 games we've listed below are the ones the RPS team are personally most looking forward to playing. We've got games big and small here, and they're all listed in alphabetical order. After all, release dates are increasingly slippery beasts these days. Think we've missed something? Why not take to the comments below and tell us all about it. You might just convince us to put it on our radars. But enough from me. Here are our 43 most anticipated games of 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Legends: Arceus is right around the corner, hitting Switch on January 28, and Nintendo has been slowly revving up its marketing for the upcoming hub-based RPG. That continued today with a new six-minute trailer released on the Japanese Nintendo YouTube account and while the entire video is in Japanese, it still gives us a great look at what’s in store for us in the Hisui region. 
Namely, the locations, pocket monsters, and NPCs we’ll be encountering. It also gives us our best look at the HUD and menu screens in Pokémon Legends: Arceus thus far as well. If you’ve been following this game since its announcement, you’ll notice that the game is looking much better than when it was first shown, too. 
Click here to watch embedded media


Pokémon Legends: Arceus has been described by Nintendo as an open-hub game, akin to the Monster Hunter series, rather than an open-world one and while that’s still the case, this trailer reveals these hubs are actually quite large – big enough to make flying around on a Pokémon or riding on the back of one in water very viable. 
The entire trailer is exciting and it offers us our best look at Pokémon Legends: Arceus yet so if you’re excited for this upcoming RPG, it’s definitely worth six minutes of your time. 
For more, be sure to check out this trailer released last month that introduces the Diamond and Pearl clans to the game and then read about how Hisuian Voltorb still somehow looks like a Pokéball. Check out this reveal of the Hisuian forms for Zorua and Zoroark in Pokémon Legends: Arceus after that.

So here comes Pupperazzi, nailing the zeitgeist as a game specifically about taking photos of dogs - who, of course, you can also pet. It's now just two weeks away from release, with a January 20th release date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Horizon Zero Dawn set a solid foundation for Guerrilla Games to build upon in Horizon Forbidden West, and the developer isn’t about to let this opportunity pass it by. For the upcoming sequel, Guerrilla Games looked at fan feedback, revisited ideas that were too ambitious for the first game, and tapped into the studio’s well of creativity to make Aloy’s exploits even more exciting. For our latest cover story, we saw Forbidden West in action and learned firsthand about how the sequel is making some worthwhile changes to improve upon its predecessor. 
Better Cinematics 
We expect improved graphics with each new entry in a series, and so far, the footage shown for Forbidden West has been extremely impressive. But sometimes it takes seeing the game up-close to really notice its finer points. “…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looks like E3 2022 will follow in the footsteps of last year’s show by being a digital-only event. Although the hope after 2021 was a return to an in-person gathering at the Los Angeles Convention Center (with even the city’s mayor crossing his fingers), the ongoing pandemic has nixed those plans. 
In a statement to Venture Beat, posted below, the ESA confirmed that the coronavirus remains a major issue so it’s playing it safe for one more year:
As we all know, the pandemic is still very much a thing, especially with the Omicron variant running rampant. This isn’t the biggest shock in the world but still disappointing for fans, developers, and media hoping to reconnect in person this June. Since the pandemic started, E3 has been canceled outright in 2020 and the 2021 edition saw the event unfold through a series of livestreams and digital meetings held on the ESA’s website. If nothing else, it'll be interesting to see how the ESA iterates on last year's approach.

No, I hated rolling credits on the game because I knew this phenomenal AAA VR experience was over, and I didn’t know when I would ever have another VR adventure of that caliber again.
Anyone who has ever put on a VR headset can tell you that the technology is promising. Anyone who owns a VR headset can tell you how slow the industry has been to fulfill that promise. I love creative offerings like Beat Saber, Superhot VR, and Pistol Whip. Those entertaining diversions make me happy to have a headset, but they only provide one type of experience.

We all love it, and some of the best games have it, whether that takes the form of a bombastic shooter, sword-clashing melee fest, or good old-fashioned brawler. Action is one of the most universally beloved genres, so we’ve compiled a list of upcoming games that already have our adrenaline pumping. Rather than rank them, each game is arranged in chronological release order so you’ll know how long you’ll have to wait before you can get your hand on them.

Fast forward to now. Suddenly I own the latest expansion The Queen And The Sea, plus all the DLCs that came before it. I'm nonchalant, thinking that I dropped the game for a reason. Surely I can't be won almost three years later? Well, nope. I was wrong. The DLCs have opened my eyes to the game in ways I hadn’t anticipated. The combat is crunchy, the challenge is thrilling, and Dead Cells more than holds its own next to more modern darlings of the genre like Hades.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Far Cry 6 was released last October, and while the base game offered dozens of hours of FPS action gameplay, Ubisoft upped the ante by committing to free content drops and three paid DLCs. 
Some of the free DLC includes Los Pollos Hermanos and Heisenberg outfits from Breaking Bad, while the first paid DLC, dubbed Vaas’ Insanity, gave players the chance to play as the infamous villain from Far Cry 3. Vaas’ Insanity was the first part of a villain-focused trilogy included in the Far Cry 6 season pass that costs $40. The second villainous DLC will star Far Cry 4’s Pagan Min, and now, Ubisoft announced that it’s coming next week. 
Dive into the twisted mind of Pagan Min. The new Pagan: Control DLC is coming January 11. pic.twitter.com/2hIr1xoPkc
January 5, 2022
More specifically, it will go live on January 11. Like the Vaas experience before it and the forthcoming Joseph Seed DLC coming after it, this Pagan Min-focused episode called Pagan: Control is a rogue-like experience that sees the Troy Baker-voiced villain “struggling to escape the horrors of their own minds.” You will die a lot and retry a lot, Ubisoft promises. 
You begin with a pistol and must find new weapons and powers to progress through Pagan Min’s mind. You’ll be able to give this experience a go in five days on January 11. 
For more, read about the other DLC offerings you can expect in Far Cry 6, and then check out our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Far Cry 6 review. Read about the Vaas’ Insanity DLC after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on "violations of the state's civil rights and equal pay laws," specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

After weeks of public silence, Activision has responded to an ongoing strike at Raven Software. 
The ongoing Raven employee strike, which began after a dozen contract QA workers were let go in December, entered its third week this week with no formal acknowledgment from Activision. However, a new statement from upper Raven Software management (see: Activision management) given to GamesIndustry.biz reveals that the company is in active discussions with employees. 
For more about story, read Game Informer’s prior coverage of the Raven layoffs, including Activision’s statement following the transition of 500 contract employees to full-time.

You can, of course, view each right now on their website – no purchase required – but you won’t be able to see how much each is going for as the auctions won’t begin until January 12. 
“Konami Memorial NFT is a new initiative to share content that has been loved by players all over the world, for many years,” a press release reads. “As the company’s first project in this area and with NFTs and blockchains technology in its infancy, Konami will continue to explore new developments and listen to player feedback following this initial collection.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Horizon Forbidden West's new west coast setting isn’t just inhabited by fearsome new machines. Aloy will also encounter tribes and cultures, some friends and some foes. Guerrilla Games released a video reintroducing players to familiar tribes such as the Oseram, Utaru, and Tenakth, giving a rundown of their culture and standing in this region of the country. 
We see the Utaru, a culture in tune with nature, singing songs in an effort to cure their land of the blight. On the flip side, the battle-hardened Tenakth, which is divided into three clans, serves as the dominant tribe in the Forbidden West. One of those clans is the Regalla, the rebel faction shown in previous trailers that are at war with their fellow clansfolk. As powerful as the Tenakth is, the trailer hints at rumors of an even stronger group residing on the outer reaches of the Forbidden West.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Konami, the Japanese company best known for squandering every shred of goodwill they built through series like Castlevania and Metal Gear Solid, are getting into NFTs. Of course they are. Should've guessed. While publishers like Square Enix, EA, and Take-Two are still contemplating NFTs, I am not remotely surprised that Konami are one of the first notable names to actually start selling useless digital junk. Next week, they will hold an auction for NFTs of videos, artwork, and music from early Castlevania games. Konami, man.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Studio director and co-founder of Playground Games, Gavin Raeburn, has revealed that he’s leaving the company. 
First reported by Windows Central, he has revealed that after co-founding and working at Playground for 12 years, he’s retiring from the racetrack. This news comes two months after the studio put out its most successful title yet in Forza Horizon 5, which at the time of its release, also had the biggest launch of any Xbox Game Studios game ever.

“After 12 years working on five award-winning Forza Horizon games, Gavin Raeburn is leaving Playground Games as studio director,” Turn 10 Studio Head and Forza franchise lead Alan Hartman told Windows Central. “A founding member of Playground Games, we thank Gav for his leadership and contributions to the Forza franchise and wish him all the best.” 
Hartman said another Playground co-founder, Trevor Williams, will transition from General Manager to Studio Head effective immediately, replacing Raeburn. He also said the studio will continue to focus on updates to Forza Horizon 5 and the ongoing development of its Fable reboot, which was officially announced in 2020. 
As noted by Windows Central, Raeburn has quite the history in the racing genre, having worked on Codemasters’ TOCA series, Dirt, and Grid. He left Codemasters in 2009 to create Playground Games, which was acquired by Microsoft in 2018. 
There’s no word on what’s next for Raeburn or if he’s even staying in games.

Check out this new Xbox and OPI nail polish collaboration that unlocks a unique Forza Horizon 5 car wrap after that.

Or it's possibly being hindered, at least. This all started with a big stink on Christmas Day that led some to declare Steam had been banned by the Great Firewall which restricts access to many sites outside China, but the reality is not so clear cut.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The vanguard of Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs had some seriously good chips in it – including two of the best CPUs for gaming overall – though there weren’t many models for aspiring PC builders on tight budgets. Now, though, Intel has used CES 2022 to launch the rest of the 12th Gen desktop lineup, adding loads of more affordable Core i5 and Core i3 processors on top of new Core i7 and Core i9 options. Intel also unveiled its new H-series, 12th Gen gaming laptop chips, which use the same hybrid architecture (combining powerful P-cores with smaller, less energy-intensive E-cores) as their Alder Lake desktop cousins.

The high: the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti, as new top-of-the-line CPU with 24GB of upgraded, 21Gbit/s GDDR6X VRAM. The low: the GeForce RTX 3050, Nvidia’s first XX50 GPU in a donkey’s age.

Within a couple of hours of each other. But my stress is your gain, as there are and will be some major announcements on new kit, starting with AMD. Their freshly-announced hardware includes an assortment of new CPUs, desktop and mobile graphics cards and even some laptop APUs – APUs that sound a lot more useful for gaming that what current integrated graphics can offer. There’s even an Nvidia Image Scaling rival in the upcoming, driver-level Radeon Super Resolution feature.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightingale certainly isn't the sort of game I was expecting from a former BioWare developer, but I'm well excited to give it a go. Announced at The Game Awards 2021, Nightingale is a survival craft 'em up set in a fantastical, alt-history world. It's being made by Inflexion Games, a studio lead by Aaryn Flynn, former programmer and general manager at the Dragon Age and Mass Effect developers. 
But don't go in expecting the sort of huge, arcing plotlines of BioWare's recent games. While Nightingale will have an over-arching narrative, it's being designed to offer up adventures that let you make your own stories. I spoke to Flynn at the end of last year to find out a little bit more about what that entails.

Money will go to current and former female employees and contract workers. The suit started in 2018 following widespread allegations of a festering workplace culture, and was originally due to be settled for $10 million (£7m) until California state authorities raised objections that it wasn't enough.

We do our best to rescue others from harm, to avert world-ending disasters, and give everyone around us the happy ending they deserve. But if there's one thing I've learned about myself in 2021, it's that I'm a cruel, heartless robot who will happily toss others under the bus if they don't provide any material benefit to me. Or at least I am when I'm playing Unsighted, the gorgeous and criminally underrated action RPG from Studio Pixel Punk that puts a ticking time-bomb inside each of its characters' metallic chests which, if left unchecked, will remove them from the game entirely, preventing you from gaining some potentially very handy upgrades to help you in your quest to fight back against your human oppressors. 
It's an ingenious system, as you're not only fighting against the hordes of enemies that appear onscreen, but your own ineptitude.

That being said, if barrelling through the streets of a futuristic, neon-glazed Detroit, hopping over pursuing cop cars and racing through business offices and factories to the tune of an engrossing soundtrack doesn’t whip ass, I don’t know what does.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo has, for good reasons, become a shorthand for describing the flavour of gothic, grimdark fantasy setting in games, where pus-filled demonic hordes and rotting, undead corpses scour a hellish cathedral looking for unwitting adventurers. For all its wretched decay, however, the series still feels like an indulgence to be savoured. Its clickiness and abhorrent sights make the games endlessly gratifying, and masterful butchery of fiends eases most players into a comfortable rhythm. And part of that appeal lies in the macabre yet captivating fantasy it so deftly peddles — all that blood, gore and guts really make for a grisly setting that’s nearly impossible to look away from.


Tainted Grail: Conquest conveys the same sense of blight and doom in its dark fantasy universe — one that’s a reimagining of Arthurian legends — but also ups the ante with a huge wallop of Slay The Spire’s roguelike, deck-building elements.

First and least of these was Desert World, a blithe eternity of golden sand always viewed from kilometres up, where fizzing white rings rose toward me like expanding surf. I'd try to find my way down to the surface, but always at the risk of glitching straight through and ending up in Snake World, where monstrous serpents emerged from darkened kitchens.


Somewhere between these two poles lay the realm of the Animals, not that they were really animals, but clouds of eyelash-thin mandible, grot and sparkle, like rotten food on the point of becoming a school of tropical fish. I loved Animal World. I used to spend hours trying to mind-hack my way into it. I was pretty shocked to find its likeness in Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus - an irresistibly strange, gristly, sorrowful, comical and inventive album of creatures, songs, places and phrases from Jack King-Spooner and composer Helena Celle.

Which is a shame, since it’s a rather unique title in their respective careers, and it charts new waters for these cult directors.


World’s End Club was the first game the pair released since forming their own studio, Too Kyo Games, and can best be described as a bizarre but intriguing blend of platforming and death games, starring a cast of prepubescent children way too young to be fixing the world or dealing with cults. Think Danganronpa, if Danganronpa was a Saturday morning cartoon rather than a murder game filled with psychopaths.

To prevent overcrowding and crashing servers, Square Enix have had to halt free trials and new sales to keep the game stable after an unprecedented surge in popularity this summer. Between that and the global shortage of materials to add more servers, it may be quite some time until new players are able to experience it. If you have an active subscription and manage to brave the long queues however, you’re one of the lucky few who get to experience something truly special. For everyone else: hang in there, it will be worth the wait.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest free game giveaway in GOG's winter sale is an unexpected one for the festive season, but perhaps a game which captures the feeling of being trapped at a seemingly endless Christmas lunch with awful relatives: I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. Nothing says 'bad family Christmas' like being tortured for 109 years by a sentient supercomputer which nuked humanity and keeps only five people alive to torment. The 90s point 'n' click adventure game is a grim one (so grim!), but one which does have its fans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a special Christmas message from three of the NieR series' development stars, creative director Yoko Taro has announced that NieR is over. No more NieR games for us... unless he receives a massive pile of money. Quickly, it becomes clear he's just joshing around. Another classic ruse from the man in the Emil mask, and a subtle hint that they may have something new in the works. Plus, it's just a really delightful video and you should all watch it.

If you're staring baffled at an endless list of innumerable deals, you could use some help. Honestly, most of our Steam Autumn Sale recommendations still stand, but the few of us in the RPS treehouse who haven't already clocked off for the Christmas holiday do have some fresh picks for you too.

There's some Christmassy-ness flowing in to tide me over, thanks to the mini-Christmas tree in my room. Every year it's popped on the wardrobe alongside an honorary Lynx Africa. They share the same festive colours, after all.
Having pondered my tree for a bit, I thought about trees in games and how they make for good side quests. Now join me by the bark, as I examine why this might be the case in a roundabout manner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was younger I watched a nature documentary narrated by David Attenborough (I realise that doesn't narrow it down) and in this nature documentary David told me about a cave. It is a very big cave, and every night a huge colony of bats come screaming out of the entrance. They spend the day clinging to the ceiling of this big cave, and all their bat poo falls down and has become a towering heap carpeting the floor.
But then David said look, the carpet is moving. And it turns out that the whole bottom of the cave is covered in cockroaches and giant centipedes. And if ever a small baby bat or an old injured bat falls, it is eaten alive by this hoard of chittering insects. This nature documentary haunted me, for it was the worst thing I could imagine happening.
Anyway, Nate has been to that cave and he's going to tell us all about it for this episode of our supporters only podcast, The Nate Files. Thanks for being a supporter, pals!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a busy, kind of mixed year for strategy games. Ever a broad church, 2021's seen enough releases to keep ten of me busy, from the easy-going Legion War to the month-consuming Shadow Empire. I don't know about you, but my personal "to play" list is out of control.
And yet, while we've had plenty to enjoy this year, it's felt like a period of build-up to something bigger. I'm not one for looking forward. If a game's not out yet it tends to disappear from my mind, making room for a hundred other recent releases in this age of plenty. That I've less interest in looking back over this year than I do pondering the next suggests that maybe we're in for something special in the coming twelve months. Or perhaps it's just been a rough one and I'm very sleep deprived and don't want to think about 2021. Either way, let's have a look at what's in store for strategy fans in 2022, yeah?

As first spotted by Bleeding Computer, multiple owners of Dell-made PCs – including the Alienware Aurora R8 and Inspiron 5680 gaming desktops, as well as the Latitude 5320 and 5520 business laptops – started developing big problems after installing the new BIOS versions. Failed boots, mainly, which of course makes it harder to apply potential fixes.

I now know the reason why and I hate to admit it. Infinite doesn’t have a battle royale mode, which I've come to realise is the perfect FPS template for gaming with my mates. Something about it just works, you know? Listen, let me explain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know almost nothing about Alfred Hitchcock. He’s the kind of archetypal director whose work I’ve been exposed to in bits and pieces without ever actually sitting down to watch one of his films in full. All of that is to say that, upon starting Alfred Hitchcock - Vertigo the game, I was in no position to judge whether it was a faithful adaptation of the film or to recognize all but the most obvious illusions to Hitchcock’s body of work (look, birds!). That’s okay, though, because as it turns out, Vertigo is an original story based on a collage of Hitchcockian concepts, not a direct adaption of the 1958 film by the same name.
Vertigo the game follows author Ed Miller as he grapples with a debilitating case of vertigo–a condition that leaves him unable to stand as the world appears to spin around him–and paralyzing guilt over the death of his daughter and her mother, Faye, after their car falls off a bridge into a ravine below. With Ed bed ridden, it’s up to Dr. Julia Lomas, psychologist and psychiatrist, and Sheriff Nick Reyes to unravel the mystery of what really happened, and whether Faye and his daughter even exist. My thoughts on how Vertigo goes about telling this story are... complicated.

Jagged, delicious, minding their own business. Until their blockiness was papped and thrust into the public eye. Memes ensued and the grapes became the talk of the town, so much so that they’ve been smoothed out in the latest patch, much to everyone’s dismay.

Yesterday, they announced that they've had to lay off around 25 employees to keep the studio going. They add that development will continue, albeit at an understandably slower pace.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks. It's been a funny old year, 2021. On the games side, it's often felt like a year of shifting goalposts. Games that were delayed by the pandemic last year finally got their due in 2021, but in turn many of the releases we were expecting this year have inevitably slipped into 2022. The pandemic has affected games of all sizes this year, and I don't think it will go down in the history books as one of our all-time greats. There were still plenty of fantastic games that came out this year, mind, and we're still counting down our absolute favourites over in our Advent Calendar. 
That said, I do think 2021 will prove to be a pivotal year for RPS - and not just because I stole Graham's key card and changed the locks on the front door of the Treehouse. It's been a year of immense change here at the site, so I wanted to take some time to reflect on everything that's happened this year, and look forward to what we've got in store for 2022.
