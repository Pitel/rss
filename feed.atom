Publisher Thunderful has announced that Laika: Aged Through Blood, the critically-acclaimed 'motorbike metroidvania', will finally be gracing the Nintendo Switch on 30th January 2025.
Originally scheduled to launch over a year ago on 11th January 2024, the game was delayed just one day prior, with Headup – the game's publisher at the time – stating that it wanted to "ensure the version we launch is in the best possible shape it could be in".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Florian Wirtz Bundesliga POTM SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete the challenge to get a special card for your Ultimate Team squad.


This is the latest Wirtz item to be added to Ultimate Team. Unlike his previously-released special cards, this one is pretty easy to obtain. The cost of completing the challenge is low, and you should be have most of the fodder required to complete the challenge. Let's take a look at how you can complete this challenge in Ultimate Team. 


EA FC 25 Florian Wirtz Bundesliga POTM SBC tasks


The Florian Wirtz Bundesliga POTM SBC has two tasks, and here are the conditions.


Task 1 - Germany



Min. 1 Players from: Germany


Min. Team Rating: 84



Task 2 - Bundesliga



Min. 1 Players from: Bundesliga


Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 85



EA FC 25 Florian Wirtz Bundesliga POTM SBC solutions


Here's a set of solution you can use to complete the latest Bundesliga POTM SBC in Ultimate Team. 


Task 1 - Germany



Any 10 84-rated items


Havertz 83



Task 2 - Bundesliga



Any 9 85-rated items


Palhinha 85


Any 83-rated TOTW item



The 90-rated Wirtz POTM card isn't crazy in terms of in-game stats. But it's cheap, and offers the Incisive Pass playstyle+ (which could be a strong in the new meta). You'll need to boost the Pace (84) and Shooting (81) to get more purchase of the card. This is a great card for any beginner who have recently  got started in Ultimate Team.


While he can also play as a LM, I will strictly use him as a CAM only.

What a saga it's been for Harley and the boys. The game came from the creators of the excellent Batman Arkham series and even existed within its universe. However, players were unenthused by live-service elements and repetitious gameplay (even if it wasn't as bad as assumed from early trailers). The game hit below publisher Warner Bros.' expectations as interest trailed off on Steam, with news of layoffs for the staff.

Although there is nothing set in the proverbial stone when it comes to details of the Switch 2 or what happens from here on out, at least not until the Nintendo Direct on April 2, we can take some educated guesses based on Nintendo’s previous timelines and behaviour. 


When will the Switch 2 release?

It launched earlier this month - and now it is no more, for Rockstar have descended like briefcase-wielding peregrine falcons and performed what is being called a "friendly takedown" on modding team World Travel. My brother did a "friendly takedown" on me once, and my elbow still doesn't bend the right way.

Although games like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing served to propel the cozy gaming genre to a huge number of new players, the genre has been around for far longer. Some would pinpoint the birth of cozy games with Little Computer People, released for multiple platforms in 1985. We’ve come a long way since then, but cozy games are still a firm favorite for many.

So, I’ve been ignoring a lot of titles that boast the metroidvania label in their press releases. I’ve probably missed out on some good ones, but I just can’t look at another rectangle-dominated map screen. Okay, one more, I guess. Blade Chimera caught my attention because it’s created by Team Ladybug and WSS Playground, the folks behind Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth. Not my favorite game, no, but solid and dependable.

As officially revealed by Nintendo, the new console will release later this year, and we also have confirmed information about Backwards compatibility.


The official trailer, released by Nintendo, gave us the first glimpse at what the new console will look like. One of the very first pieces of information was on the topic of backward compatibility, and there is great news if you have owned or own games from the Nintendo Switch.


Will Nintendo Switch 2 have Backwards Compatibility


If the header of this article wasn't indicative enough, then yes, you'll be able to play your older games on the new console. This includes a huge lineup of games that have been released for the Nintendo Switch since 2017. This is great news for game preservation as well, which has been an iffy area between gamers and developers.

Nintendo Switch 2 Backwards Compatibility Explained


Nintendo won't be trying to implement rocket science in their new console, and Backwards Compatibility should work as expected. Put simply, Backwards Compatibility is the ability for a game released on an older console to run on a newer piece of technology. The Nintendo Switch 2 will be able to play both digital and physical versions of games originally designed and released for the original Nintendo Switch.


That said, certain games won't run properly on the new tech. They will either not be supported at all, or they might not be fully compatible with the Switch 2. We are yet to get any information about which games will be included on that list. Based on the confirmed list of games, there's not much that you'll be missing out on.

I hope you didn't get too excited about it. Rockstar has already shut down the Liberty City Preservation project, making it inaccessible to gamers going forward.

Given the scale of what it was promising, the Liberty City Preservation project all seemed too good to be true. Well, that's because it was, but not through any fault of the developers' own.  


After the project gained momentum with Grand Theft Auto fans, it also attracted the attention of Rockstar itself. Gi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's official: the Nintendo Switch 2 is releasing in 2025, and Nintendo has already given us a sneak peek of what to expect. Although Nintendo hasn't confirmed a list of games that will be released on this upcoming system, we have at least one that's likely to arrive, with plenty of speculation on future titles.


All confirmed and rumored games available on Nintendo Switch 2 release


Starting with the official Nintendo Switch 2 announcement trailer, it looks like a new addition to the Mario Kart franchise — likely Mario Kart 9 — is all but confirmed for a Switch 2 launch title. Although there's no release date for the console or game yet, with a new Mario Kart game usually releasing every two to four years, we're due for another soon. It was only a matter of time before we got word of one.


The other most likely candidate for a game releasing on the Switch 2 is Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. While it was initially announced as early as 2017 at E3, Nintendo restarted its development, with some speculation that this second console had something to do with it. With a predicted 2025 release date, it'd be no surprise if Metroid Prime 4 ends up being among the first series to launch on the Switch 2.


Let's check out some other potential Switch 2 games we might see in the next year or two:



A new Super Mario entry


A new Legend of Zelda entry


Halo: The Master Chief Collection


Pokémon Legends: Z-A


Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth


Past game remakes/ports



In particular, we'll likely see various remakes and ports from the previous Switch or from other consoles and PCs to carry to the Switch 2. The main candidates for this early on are The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, but only time will tell where the releases will go from here.

To start, Spider-Tracer is an effect that is activated when pairing his Web-Cluster alt-fire attack with another ability in his kit. A spider web icon will appear over an opponent’s health bar if they are affected by a Spider-Tracer. 


There are three abilities he has that pair with the Web-Cluster ability which are the following:

With Sid Meier's Civilization VII, developer Firaxis has created a solution to this problem in the form of three Ages: Antiquity, Exploration, and Modern. On standard speed and Age lengths, each of these three ages will last between 150-200 turns, equivalent to about three or four hours of playtime. For those seeking a long grand campaign that progresses through all three Ages, you can do so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There have been rumours about the Switch 2 circulating for months, but no concrete confirmation has come forth from Nintendo until now. The Switch 2 has finally been revealed, with an in-depth introduction video and details available now. 


Rather than announcing the Switch 2 with huge fanfare, Nintendo America instead simply Tweeted out the video along with a link for more information. After months of leaks and speculation, I’m sure this almost feels anticlimactic to many, but I’ll take what I can get and am excited for the reveal and more information to come. 




The Switch 2 will ditch the standard colors of the Joycons, at least as standard, instead placing them on the base of the joysticks themselves. This helps to give the Switch 2 a more sleek look while retaining the same tried and beloved overall design, albeit with more curves and a mysterious additional button below the home button.


More information will be revealed during the next Nintendo Direct on April 2, but during the reveal trailer, it was shown that the Switch 2 will come with backward compatibility as standard, allowing you to play both physical and digital games that are already available for the original Switch. 


Screenshot via Nintendo / YouTube


The connection of the Joycons will no longer rely on a slider mechanism, but rather they will attach to the console using magnets. It remains to be seen how strong these magnets actually are, and I have fears that my Joycons may soon be flying across the room once they weaken, but I remain hopeful. 


With more details coming at the next Nintendo Direct on April 2, there are also a few hands-on events happening across the US for players to get their hands on the new console prior to release:



New York (April 4 - April 6)


Los Angeles (April 11 - April 13)


Dallas (April 25 - April 27)

Let's take a look at how you can complete this challenge. 


EA FC 25 Paulo Dybala Serie A POTM SBC tasks


The Paulo Dybala Serie A POTM SBC has two tasks, and here are the conditions.


Task 1 - Serie A



Min. 1 Players from: Serie A TIM


Min. Team Rating: 85



Task 2 - Top Form



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 86



EA FC 25 Paulo Dybala Serie A POTM SBC solutions


Here's a set of solution you can use to complete the latest Serie A POTM challenge. 


Task 1 - Serie A



Koopmeiners  83


Gavi 83


Tsygankov 83


Dumfries 82


Swanson 87


de Jong 87


Sauerbrunn 85


Gerard Moreno 83


Marquinhos 87


Fulkrug 82


Parejo 83



Task 2 - Top Form



Any 86-rated TOTW item


Boniface 82


Saka 87


En-Neysri 83


Carpenter 83


Le Normand 83


Bruno Fernandes 87


Xhaka 86


Lewandowski 88


Gundogan 87


Suarez 82



For fodder worth about 100,000 coins, this Dybala item is certainly worth considering if you like playing with a CAM. He has Playmaker++ and Shadow Striker++, which adds to tactical flexibility. He also offers 5* Skills and 91 Dribbling. The 83 Pace is slightly low, but 88 Shooting and 88 Passing are decent as well. With an overall rating of 89, he could easily fit into an evolution soon, which will allow you to improve the card further. 


All in all, it's a pretty well-valued SBC that you can consider if you have a lot of surplus fodder.

It isn’t much of a mystery. The three levels (7-5, 7-6, 7-7) appear on three corners around a big door on the map. More notably, their map icons are square. Even more notably, when you enter the levels, there’s a sign near the beginning that shows a red button with the word “FIND!” (at least in the HD version). Just note that this isn’t optional. In order to proceed, you need to find those buttons, otherwise, you can’t move onto the boss.

Last year, we had a great time with Revolution Software's 'Reforged' remaster of the classic point-and-click adventure Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars. "It sure would be neat if the rest of the series received such a treatment," we thought to ourselves, "if only Revolution had something up its sleeve..."
As it turns out, it does! Or, more accurately, it might. Three weeks ago, the studio released its 'Christmas Video 2024', thanking fans for their support over the past 12 months and showing off some of the game's original art. It's a sweet video that, we'll admit, flew under the radar for us a little; but, as noted by Game Watcher (and brought to our attention by our friends over at Push Square), the message also contains a tease of what the future might hold — ooh, how sneaky!

Nintendo has just unleashed its second DK rerelease on the Switch with Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, a game that's seemingly taken a few cues from Emperor Palpatine on how to cheat death ("Somehow..."). To celebrate, the firm has also launched a range of Donkey Kong-themed merchandise in Japan and, well, it goes hard.
Honestly, we're kinda torn on whether this stuff is actually any good or not. Let's be honest, it's not exactly subtle. The Diddy Kong fleece in particular is quite literally the character's torso and arms in the form of a jumper; certainly something we wouldn't mind popping on while chilling on the sofa, but perhaps also something we'd think twice about rocking while out and about.

Animal Well, which turned damn near every games journalist into a tiresome obsessive? Not nominated for anything. UFO 50, an impressive, important, big boy achievement snubbed by our own 2024 list?

Cursed Tools are a powerful item that helps to permanently buff up your in-game build with stat boosts and unique abilities. Typically, most Cursed Tools are Special Grade items that normally require you to complete Investigations (and open the chests).


The process of obtaining the Turbo Mask is slightly different.


How to obtain Turbo Mask in Jujutsu Infinite


The Turbo Mask is available exclusively in Winter Chests, and you can earn these chests as part of the Winter Update event. This is a time-limited event that's not going to be available for a long time. To obtain this specific type of chest, you'll need to defeat the Santa boss.

The folks at this Digital Foundry have this week taken a look at the latest Switch release Donkey Kong Country Returns HD.
In brief, the resolution and frame rate are "surprisingly solid". This Unity-powered game runs at 1080p docked and 720p in handheld mode on the Switch - with reasonable image quality and sharper textures. Unfortunately, it's not all intact - with "some oddities" and hiccups like reduced effects and sloppy animation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s easy to forget that — technically speaking — Attack on Titan is set in a world very much like our own. This is because the author of the manga, Hajime Isayama, seems to be allergic to showing a complete world map outside of vague glimpses. To help you out, here's our take on the AOT world map.

AOT World Map, explained


Based on the path the story takes in Attack on Titan, we can draw some conclusions about this world. To start, it’d seem that the world is a vertical flip of our own, based on a map of Marley shown in Chapter 93/Episode 86. If this is true, that would mean the fictional nation of Marley is parallel with Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and Brazil.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lil Gator Game previously kept the whimsical fun going with additions like New Game+ and Baby Mode. Now, it's getting ready to explore the world further with a "huge game expansion" called In the Dark.


According to developer MegaWobble, the In the Dark expansion doubles the size of Lil Gator Game. As the title and key art implies, this one takes our adorable hero underground to explore caves, with the promise of meeting a bunch of new characters in the process. You can head underground for yourself in the announcement trailer below.




The new content is located on the main island within a previously blocked entrance. In addition to the new friends awaiting Lil Gator, there are also some teenage ne'er-do-wells threatening to put a stop to the cozy frivolity to which we've become so thoroughly accustomed. New item types, a ribbon-powered double jump, and more are on the way to add to the exploratory opportunities. 


Lil Gator Game: In the Dark is currently in the works for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch. At the time of this writing, there's no release date in place for the expansion, but there are options for both newcomers and returning players. The expansion will arrive alongside a 'Gator of the Year Edition' of the main game that bundles it with all the new content. 


In the meantime, if you want to see if the game is right for you, you can always check it out on Game Pass.

As a catacombs-based location, The Tomb reminds me of the good old days with Black Ops 2's Zombies Buried map. However, this area seems a bit more open, as you have the free range to go deep in the catacombs or outside an excavation site. According to the Call of Duty Blog, The Tomb feels a little like Liberty Falls, as it features a similar tight space layout that'll make exploring all the more challenging.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Heian Sukuna Moveset is now live in Jujutsu Shenanigans, and you can get it quite easily on a private server.


The move set is one of the many additions made as part of the latest update. While the process isn't impossibly difficult by any means, it's not exactly easy as well. Let's take a look at how you can obtain this moveset in a private server.


How to obtain the Heian Sukuna Moveset in Jujutsu Shenanigans (Private Server)


Having a private server allows you certain extra benefits. For example, you can spawn certain things as you want. The first step to get the moveset is to spawn four blocks in a line. Make sure there is space between them. Select the first moveset and scroll down to Divergent. Once found, assign 5 to this Move Key.


Do the same for the next one, and assign 6 to it. Change the Input ID to two letters, and they can be as per your choice. But do remember to make them the same for all. Increase the size of the blocks to make them bigger than your character.




Now, add a touch block to cover all four blocks, and enter the Output ID. This should be the same as the Input ID that you set for all four moveset blocks. Next, just walk through all the boxes, and you'll have your moveset.


If you're wondering why you need to do this in a private server, the reason is simple: it's unavailable in the full game. Once the next update is available, you should be able to unlock the Heian Era Sukuna moveset in the full game. Till then, the private server is the only available option if you want to test out its strengths and weaknesses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emulation explanation.
2024 was a big year for Nintendo's emulator takedowns, with the likes of Yuzu and Ryujinx both biting the dust after facing the company's wrath. Now, at a recent lecture hosted by Japan’s Association of Copyright for Computer Software, Nintendo lawyer Koji Nishiura has explained the technicalities of when an emulator is considered illegal and why the Big N has so many in the crosshairs.
As reported by Denfaminicogamer, Nishiura — the deputy general manager of Nintendo's IP division and patent attorney — explained that there's a difference in legality between the emulator itself and its uses: "While you can’t immediately claim that an emulator is illegal in itself, it can become illegal depending on how it’s used" (translated by Automaton).

The other developer, Arachne, recently left game development after recovering from a mishandled surgical procedure last year. According to Dizzie, her departure doesn't have anything to do with the aforesaid violent crime, which pre-dates their relationship.

That's plenty to get your head around, and the roster is expanding rapidly. NetEase have announced that they plan to introduce a new hero approximately every six weeks - in other words, twice per three-month season. I wonder how long it'll take them to probe beyond the obvious Marvel headliners and start seriously abrading the bottom of the Connected Universe barrel. Nagneto, for example. Or how about J. Pennington Pennypacker, who shoots coins out of his wrists?

Just me? I need to get out the mould spray more often.


OK, how about when you were a kid and you lifted up a nice, round stone and the damp, fertile soil beneath writhed away from you in a fervent knotting of pellucid, boneless bodies and the tickling of a thousand little legs? Right. Anoxia Station is that and also, a turn-based strategy game about drilling for oil. The recently released Itch.io demo is rough around the edges, but I do adore the vibe.

An official statement published this week reveals that between 2021 and November 2024, a total of 3,682 pirate sites were blocked to prevent exploitation of local content. Interesting, perhaps, but after 15 years of effort, did site-blocking actually work and, if so, who benefited, and how?

If rumour speak true, it's being made in Unreal Engine 5, and will feature changes to core systems like blocking, stamina, and sneaking.

But it was very messy because it was my first game and I didn't know what the hell I was doing. So I found myself, when it came to pumping content out, I was like: oh, shit. This code base is fucking awful. Like, I can't put stuff together easily. I'm running into bugs everywhere. But now shit just works!"
You might know Sam Prebble as Trigger Happy Interactive, the solo developer behind frenetic FPS Turbo Overkill. Before that he went by a different name, attached to a very different project. Total Chaos, first released in 2018 under the moniker Wadaholic, is a total conversion mod for Doom 2. With its focus on a thick survival horror atmosphere of tension and disempowerment, it's about as far removed from Turbo Overkill's manic, Doom Eternal-inspired action as a game can get. As Prebble puts it, the only thing the two projects have in common is the first person perspective. Even so, he found himself returning to Total Chaos after wrapping development on Turbo Overkill, resulting in the standalone remake.

This was due to the Intel web camera support in those new-at-the-time laptops yet to be properly upstreamed and relying on binary bits. Over time that Intel IPU6 MIPI camera support has seen portions of the code upstreamed into the mainline Linux kernel and distributions like Fedora taking extra steps to make them work but still in 2025 those with newer Intel laptops boasting the latest web camera technology are often facing a challenging experience...]]></summary>

In her review, Alice Bee (RPS in peace) said that it was such a large thing it ultimately felt "small, cold and unlived in". I remember thinking the same. Would I have thought differently if it had copious amounts of gore? No. But would I have had a better time? Probably yes. Well, a former senior artist at Bethesda has revealed in an interview with Kiwi Talkz podcast (cheers VGC for the spot) that they'd originally planned for it to have decapitations but decided against them in the end.

The mention comes after the IPTV provider, which is mainly popular in Latin America, boldly applied for a U.S. trademark. This trademark is unlikely to be granted without protest, but that doesn't seem to be a major issue; the service has already rebranded itself as FlujoTV.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We often get sent so many games from publishers and developers that we simply don't have the time or capacity to play. But 'tis the start of the year and I felt like I had a duty to give some of them a proper whirl and see what's what. Thus I was lured once again into the roguelike genre, for which I am an eternal sucker.
Developed by Wave Game, Magicraft sees you play as a kid who's isekai'd into another dimension (or at least, I think he is, because I chose the option to "skip the story" when I selected new game and only later deduced the situation) and tasked to mince all the demons within it. It's typical fantasy fare with an interesting twist: you can combine any number of spells within your inventory, which made me feel very clever, even if I had no idea what I was doing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like it or not, horror gaming is often built on jump scares. Deriding a good cheap scare ignores the endorphin rush that draws so many players to the genre, in the same way that the "elevated horror" trend forfeits some of the soul of schlocky slasher flicks and ghost movies. Don’t get me wrong, Silent Hill and Alan Wake deserve their flowers - but even those games would wither on the screen if Pyramid Head didn’t bust through a wall from time to time.
One unsung jump scare game in particular pioneered horror in the internet age, blazing everywhere from nascent social media to major television networks. In fact, if you had an internet connection circa 2005, there’s a good chance you played it. Alas, it was too ahead of its time, too successful at leveraging virality before viral horror was sought after. Next time you see a streamer throw their headphones across the room in fright, beware: the spirit of Scary Maze Game is right behind you.

Unsurprisingly, in retrospect, the trailer also has big The Witcher vibes. The stringy orchestral music? The dramatic monologues? The horrible things happening to armoured grunts? This thing’s really playing the Polish fantasy hits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The "spance" of Annihilate The Spance is apparently “an ancient, roiling storm of matter and energy” that harbours both “extreme and inexplicable phenomena” and “unfathomable riches”. I’m happy to discover this explanation, because at first I thought that “spance” was just a litigation-avoiding, supermarket rebrand of “space”. I was bracing to send the good news to developers Skyglow Softworks that, so far, nobody has managed to copyright “space”, though I’m sure somebody’s tried. Maybe, um, God? 


It’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game Obliterate Everything by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL. Anyway, here’s a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2020's Airborne Kingdom, you cobbled together a flying city from sailcloth, smokestacks, wings and flippers, striving to meet a growing population's need for food and shelter while dealing with the more exotic problem of levelling your streets out and generating enough lift. In the process, you explored a beautiful, Orientalist world map of faded mosaic tiles and dusty gold fittings. 
In Airborne Empire, out in early access today, you do much the same again, but this time the world is trying to murder you. A bit. You are no longer alone in the skies: there are merchant dirigibles you can barter with, and pirate airships who'll strafe your suburbs and set your bazaars on fire. As such, the sequel's new city technologies include a choice of offensive and defensive weapons. Here's a launch trailer.

It's a lot of fun for people who enjoy ye olde PS1 aesthetics and foggy throwback horror. The 2024 showcase was supposed to happen in time for Halloween, the night when the spirits of old platformer mascots rise from their graves to gift polygons to small children. But it was postponed due to technical problems. Only now has the 2-hour showcase of game trailers emerged, culminating in a new Haunted PS1 demo disc packed with upcoming games.

Not that anyone should need the lingering threat of getting served a McLungButter to be polite to service workers, but it seems good to have the option. Possibly spurred on by reality-challenged goblins hounding Final Fantasy 7 Remake Aerith actor Brianna White, Square Enix have shared a new policy outlining how they plan to respond to harassment from customers toward their staff and partners. It's obviously a vastly more proper and legally sound approach than the aforementioned sandwich tampering, but I support it nonetheless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dynasty Warriors: Origins. Finally, a game brave enough to ask: "what if everything cool that went down in Romance Of The Three Kingdoms was thanks to you, a magical, beautiful boy that no-one's ever heard of?".
It's a great premise, honestly. The slate wiped clean, what if you got to be mates with everyone from all sides in this grand ensemble tale of warring states? A battle might take eight minutes. The three consecutive bonding cutscenes before the next might take ten. Origins is just as much about fighting thousands at a time as it is about eating lunch with Zhang Fei or discussing the meaning of heroism with Zhou Yu. There's a parallel story about your character and his role in a magical order of destiny godlings I didn't find the least bit interesting, but the rest is thrilling because Romance is already thrilling. The parts that Origins bogs down with its wordier take on already wordy source material are enlivened again by anime vibrance, hijinks, and melodrama.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baví vás bastlení, fyzika, IT a nebo prostě cokoliv technického? Proseděli jste celé Vánoce v záři obrazovky počítače a nebo jste o tom alespoň snili? Chcete se pochlubit technickými vánočními dárky? Pak doražte na Virtuální Bastlírnu - online pokec (nejen) techniků a bastlířů!


Pokud by se konverzace zadrhla, mají organizátoři ze Strahovské Bastlírny připravena i náhradní výplňová témata. Velká studnice je to, co se dělo na hackerské konferenci CCC (Chaos Communication Conference) mezi svátky - mluvilo se tam o tom, jak se dá shodit rozvodná síť po rádiu, jak hacknout nový procesor Raspberry RP2350 a o tom jak pokračuje hackování vlaků v Polsku.


I na svět hardware jsou Strahováci připraveni. Na internetu se objevil postup, jak "snadno" vyrábět doma plošné spoje s pomocí výkonného vláknového laseru. Také se v diskuzi našel skvělý spis o tom, jak poznat falešné teploměry DS18B20 a co to vlastně znamená.


A nebojte, i na bizár může dojít. Věděli jste, že největší sériově vyráběná CRT televize váží přibližně 200 kilogramů a na světě se už ví jenom o jedné existující? A že Windows interně zkoušejí konvertovat znaky z UTF-16 do ASCII podle jejich grafické podobnosti, což vede k velkému množství elegantních exploitů?


Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 14. ledna od 20:00 (pozor, změna) minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

Very little, I suspect. We here are like the chalk cliffs of the South Downs: bright and imposing and subject to inevitable but slow erosion by the sea. Or put another way: I'm thinking about bringing back the bulletpoints to separate different links. How are you?

It's about pumping the gas pedal and wrenching the steering wheel just so, such that you lurch forward and over the obstacles, rather than tumbling backwards. It's MudRunner without the mud, with a knockabout simplicity presumably as a result of its apparently one-man development team. It launched last October but I hadn't heard of it until today, when a new map was added, and now I want to play it.

I played it for three hours today and, among the many build challenges and adventures, a small story formed around a baby pig. We named him Porky, we caged him as our pet, and in an unfortunate accident, we watched as he fell to his death from the sky island that was our home. RPS in peace, Porky.

How many befriended pigs like Porky have there been across the last several hundred hours of play? I'm not sure - dozens, hundreds - but soon such pigs might have a new form. After 15 years, Mojang are adding new types of pig to Minecraft.

The prologue starts you off as the handsomely equipped and fully levelled-up bodyguard of Sir Hans Capon - an exasperating gadabout and your bosom chum from the 2018 game. You're on your way to deliver a message to a distant lord, in hopes that he'll take your own lord's side in the on-going civil war. But Plot intervenes in the shape of some suspiciously familiar bandits, who slaughter your retinue and reduce Henry and Sir Hans to a pair of shirtless runaways.

The researchers who are probably robots and you usually pick because they can be competitive at anything. The diplomacy/espionage ones (humans, or The Greys).
You know what I'm talking about. You may well have thought of a recent exception too, since we've had a fair few 4Xeses experimenting with some of the standard formulae these last few years. It's been a while though since I read through every word of every faction's description and wanted to play all of them. Zephon captured my interest immediately.

The very secret goal of the column is for the guests to name every book ever written. It's a task every single one has failed miserably at with two notable exceptions. One was Dan Griliopoulos, who listed 400 books in a document before he got bored and gave up - a heroic, if ultimately futile effort. The other was Warren Spector back in November, who not only gave me the longest and most detailed reply I'd had before or since, but also followed up several times to add more books to the list.

It then cut to Majima and his crew making celebratory noises on deck. This follows last year's Infinite Wealth catching some backlash for the decision to lock the mode behind a £15/€15/$15 edition upgrade.

You'll need to link to a PlayStation Network account to play The Last Of Us Part II on PC, say Sony. The requirement was reported by Video Games Chronicle, and sure enough, the Steam page for the "Remastered" version of the third-person fungus fighter includes a footnote in the game description that confirms it in plain language - "Account for PlayStation Network required". For a lot of people this is a minor nuisance, for others it more likely means that the game won't be on sale in your country at all. Sony's reasons for enforcing the requirement remain obscure.

According to site's Indian operators, it is not possible to comply with High Court orders because a major DoodStream investor comes from Russia.

It turns out you can turn off a lot of the gore and nudity. You can also swaddle yourself in some nice, sturdy, PG-13 body armor. But you're seemingly stuck with a certain base percentage of bulging, softcore gratuitousness in both the character portrait on bottom left, and in the mildly boobulent background art of the world. I'm not sure I can put up with all that, which is a shame, because Beyond Citadel is otherwise a promising, eerie FPS that mixes ideas from 90s shooters in pretty appealing ways.

Dreams On A Pillow is a stealth adventure that tells the story of a young mother during the Nakba - the 1948 ethnic cleansing, displacement, and cultural suppression of Palestinian Arabs by Israel. As its funding campaign puts it, it’s a game about "a land full of people being made into a people without land."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One for Obra Dinn and Golden Idol fans, this, although also for anyone who just loves a gorgeous map of an alien environment. Locator is a detective puzzler where you play an interstellar cartographer tasked with tracking down a missing archeologist named Abigail Lidari on an alien world. It takes inspiration from browser geography game Geoguessr. You’ll be studying sets of photos and comparing them with notes from Abigail’s journal, then pinpointing her location on a series of lovely maps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals Season 1 is about to begin, adding the Fantastic Four to the free-to-play hero shooter’s roster so that they can beat up Dracula, who has swamped the Earth in eternal night. It launches January 10th at 1 am PT / 4 am ET / 9 am GMT, and developers NetEase are paving the way in the traditional manner by rebalancing the character line-up so as to simultaneously win the adoration of certain player groups, while plunging others into apoplectic fury.
Do you like running rampage as Hela, goddess of death? Was that you who shot me full of crows on Klyntar last night? Well, how does 25 points off your base health suit you? Yeah, that’s what I thought. Screw you too.

The joke stuck with me enough to try the car mechanic sim when it was released into early access back in 2016. I didn't know it would take another nine years to bring this ambitiously hostile Finnish life simulator to a full release. But here it is. If you want a deeply confounding game about putting an old banger together piece by excruciating piece, while periodically sweating the grime off your body in a cramped sauna, then I can think of no better time waster. My Summer Car 1.0 came out yesterday, and a new trailer came with it.

Currently on show at CES 2025, it’s a prototype desktop build that uses clever geometry and an unconventional motherboard I/O layout to hide practically every single wire in the joint, for a clean design that's housed for your viewing pleasure within a four-sided glass chamber. It’s the closest PCs have come to the simple Victorian pleasures of a nice terrarium, and honestly, good on it.
The problem is that if Project Zero X’s components ever actually go on sale, there becomes a non-zero percent chance that I will come into possession of that see-through case. And there is a one hundred percent chance I will ruin it.

Announced over the winter, it’s a spruced-up reimagining of your scientifically determined 22nd favourite space game - the hectic Second Coming of a simulation we’ve devoted 14 whole-ass features to since 2013, including a seven-part diary series featuring many a starfaring Vengabus or Wild Wild Westerly giant robot spider.
It really is high time we gave the new game some attention, then. The very first alpha launches into Steam early access on January 27th. Here’s what’s in store.

It's an idle clicker, obviously, which starts with a single button in the centre of a browser screen. The more "stimulation" you accrue through clicking, the more options become available. It escalates. And escalates. And escalates. I found that my feelings of delight grew roughly in proportion to the toll taken on my computer's processor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year’s annual CPU tug-of-war was cleanly won by AMD, its obscenely fast Ryzen 7 9800X3D almost singlehandedly leaving Intel and their Core Ultra chips in a heap of mud and P.E.-spec rope. Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.
No pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.

The list in question is part of a strategy of counteracting what the US sees as the close relationship between China's armed forces and various civilian technology suppliers and research projects.
At the time of publication yesterday, a Tencent spokesperson had commented that the listing was based on a "misunderstanding". In a statement sent to RPS overnight and also published online, Tencent's chairman Ma Huateng and executive board have now said that they're prepared to get legal if the misunderstanding isn't resolved.

Their wholly owned subsidiaries including League Of Legends developers Riot Games, Path Of Exile developers Grinding Gear Games, and UK outfit Sumo Group. They own shares in everything from Epic Games through Ubisoft to Silent Hill 2 rebooters Bloober Team. Are you a game developer? Odds are that at least one percent of your body belongs to Tencent. Maybe one of your toes.
And now it turns out that Tencent are some kind of military operator, as well. Or at least, that's what the US Department of Defence would have us believe: they've just somewhat randomly added the firm to an infamous list of Chinese military companies, together with lithium-ion battery maker CATL. This potentially makes it difficult for Tencent to do business in the States, but Tencent say that it's all based on a "misunderstanding".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last night, at CES 2025, Nvidia finally announced their RTX 50 series graphics cards, and can I just say that I am wise to the RTX 5090’s tricks. A GPU that eats up to 575W and costs £1939 / $1999? Yeah, nice try, Geoffrey N. Vidia, but such a mad card couldn’t possibly exist in reality. It’s clearly only here to make the other ones, the RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070, look like better deals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Countless are the pretenders to Dungeon Keeper's skull-buttressed throne, but I sense a certain fearful promise in The Deadly Path, a building management and roguelike strategy game from Owlskip Enterprises. The setup here is that you're stuck in a tabletop underworld with a bunch of elder gods, or Dread Deities. As Custodian of this dusty funereal expanse, you must place structures on tiles around your throne room, striving to fulfil the desires of whichever Dread Deity is in play, while fending off pernicious attackers from the realm of light. Here's a trailer.

The development of 2020 FPS Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War cost $700 million, making it the most expensive video game project yet reported. That’s according to a court filing reviewed by Stephen Totilo’s Game File (paywalled) in which Call Of Duty creative head Patrick Kelly divulged the budgets of three games in the series.

Yet that's the challenge taken up yesterday by speedrunners at Awesome Games Done Quick. The UFO 50 speedrun includes an impressive dart through the retro collection's most bewildering game, the ancient and mysterious Barbuta, in which your character is a frustratingly slow hero with a fearfully short attack range. They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gentle reader, I have previously written exactly two boob-related articles in my life. One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.
Now it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs. Behold.

Mass Effect 3 tried voice commands. Socom U.S Navy Seals shipped with a headset. "Dunno if I wanna be shouting out tacticool commands in my living room," wrote a Redditor on the subject four years ago, speaking to my very soul in the process. "Gimme the clunky buttons instead".
Thankfully, you can also use your keyboard to interrogate suspects in murder mystery Dead Meat. It’s a moody, slightly goofy noir puzzler that lets you ask anything you want. Whether this means you’ll always get a worthwhile response, I’m not sure. "Want to discuss their alibi? Probe them on the meaning of life? Confess your love? Or just troll them mercilessly? Your words hold power, and anything goes," reads the Steam page. Here’s a trailer.

Those eventually grew into their PCIe shoes, but only after months of dial-shifting driver updates – whereas the flagship B580 promises Nvidia-besting games performance from the off. Even at such a stage in the current graphics generation (the GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 could be revealed literally tonight, at CES 2025), there is something enticing about that proposition.

Let's see if we fare better this time round: Sonic Galactic is an absurdly accomplished Sonic fangame from Starteam that, broadly, imagines how the Mega Drive and Genesis platformers might have looked and felt had they been made for the Sega Saturn. There's a new demo, if you fancy trying it for yourself. Please find it here on Itch.io. Perhaps if I'd put the download link higher up the page in the other article, people would have got distracted and refrained from dunking on me so awfully.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An upcoming life sim which claims to be a competitor to Grand Theft Auto VI is continuing to amass followers and wishlists on Steam, despite the game being unmasked as a vehicle for a dodgy cryptocurrency. Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules. But it's still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.

That's specifically RPGs with "AAA" budgets, whatever AAA means these days. Cain is, of course, well aware that there are many RPGs from smaller teams that "evolve past the paradigm of violence being the default way in which the player interacts with the world", and that there are plenty of puzzle games, adventure games and the like in which there is no violence at all.

It is, like Dark Souls, a game about equipment and stamina management, but it finds most success as a soulslike in the sensation that you are alone somewhere bad, not able to do very much except hit horrible things in the space between them trying to hit you. It also offers notable moments of lonely, loud footsteps rebounding off cold stone tiles in the seconds after felling some giant man-bastard - one of the subgenre’s greatest un-joys.

Who were these mysterious shufflers, flocking to the deserted, echoing halls of Valve’s disastrous flop like your mate who uses the word ‘liminal’ too much to a dead shopping center? Forbes, who first reported on the phenomena, don’t know. No one knows. Somebody might actually know but writing ‘no one knows’ makes it more dramatic. Let’s dig in.

The peals of celebration travel outward through our atmosphere, exiting the realm of Earthly sound and resonating with interstellar plasma and detritus to form a delicate ripple of comet flakes and stray photons, expanding far beyond our solar system. Where the ripple encounters larger masses, such as planets, suns and... other things, it rebounds, riding the weft of stardust back down to Earth. As it returns home, the signal is modified. Tinkered with. It acquires unsettling harmonics and a guttural undertow. By the time it re-enters our atmosphere, it has condensed to three words, which descend and shrink and spiral into your ear like an octopus entering a crevice: FEED THE MAW.

S úctou a upřímnou pokorou jsem přistoupil k aranžmá národní slovenské hymny "Nad Tatrou sa blýská" již v roce 2016. Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté "hradní" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…]]></summary>

Developers NetEase had recently doled out bans of up to 100 years to players they suspected of cheating, but in their eagerness, failed to distinguish between legitimate compatibility layers – the software that non-Windows operating systems, like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS, use to run native Windows games – and actual hacks. Per IGN, NetEase have now apologised to the affected players, and lifted the bans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll be blunt: the only thing that really entices me about SpaceCraft is that it's from Shiro Games, creators of such robust RPG and strategy fare as Dune: Spice Wars, Evoland, Northgard and Wartales. As a concept, at least, SpaceCraft seems both flavourless and oddly inclined to overplay its own familiarity. I mean, look at that title. Consider its chilly blend of functionality and punmanship. Look at that capital "C", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft. This you may do eternally, for there are thousands of planets in store.

I’m busy replaying The Suffering 2 for the sixth time to see a new 15 second cutscene that recognises which combination of morally aligned beginnings and endings I’ve picked. It reads your save from the first game and everything!". Say ‘memory card’ to a youthful, broccoli-maned Fortnite enjoyer nowadays. Go on, I dare you. You’ll be in a home before you know it.
Still, having new toys at regular intervals is one real upshot of our new live-service barrage of ephemeral novelty, perpetually flung at my dizzy eyeballs like gleaming carnival daggers at exhausted spinning wheels. Especially if they’re for the exquisite strategy of Mechabellum. Season 2 released yesterday alongside patch 1.2, bringing with it a new unit and specialist, some reworks, and lots of cosmetic bits I pretend not to care about but then get excited when I unlock a new one.

The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. "Bioshock Infinite in space", we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.
In Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.

The project is called "Artemis" (at least for now) and you won't be seeing it any time soon. That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. 
Greene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led "multiverse of worlds" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox. He is nonetheless "full of confidence".

It's like scrutinising a Hitman level from above, except that all of these people have evolving relationships and sleeping patterns and they might hunt you down if you murder any of their relatives. Me, I just want to play Where's Wally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ekphrasis is a concept from ancient Greece (who bloody loved a good concept) describing the act of creative writing inspired by a work of art. Is a Ryanair Boeing 737 safety manual art? Well, Johnson A Plane Man has done some ekphrasis with it, so I say yes. It’s a short browser Itch game that chronicles the life and times of a man named Johnson, his love for yellow life vests, his existential feelings of confinement (despite the high number of easily locatable exits), and such emancipatory joys that can only be found in yellow slides.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy new year all! And what better way to kick off another undignified 12 month crawl toward the next Xmas holiday than with the news that one of my favourite dark fantasy storybook extravaganzas, Ghost Of A Tale, is getting a sequel.
The newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel "Seith" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven't updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as "Ghost Of A Tail" is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.

Two of them didn't come out this year, which is an easy disqualification, but the reality is that I also don't think any of them truly deserve a place in one of those hallowed chambers.

Yet all three are games that in some way defined my year, and I feel affection for each of them. Let me explain why.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unlike a lot of the team I'd imagine, my opinion is this: I thought the year was quite middling for games. Or at least, it was middling for my own personal taste, which is quite unsavoury at the best of times. Most of my best picks made it into the calendar proper, but a couple didn't. One I hadn't even played properly until after the vote, and the other? The other is a flawed pick, but one that I couldn't stop thinking about.
Anyway, hope you all have a restful Xmas folks and a cracking new year. I hope Santa bought you some nice warm socks or a chocolate orange so dense, you could tee it off at your local golf club.

All my major choices are in there, plus a few more that I haven't played but I'd watched other people play, and had a swell time doing so. Still, there are always a handful that don't quite make the cut, but still deserve a heaped Christmas plateful of praise at year's end. So here's my selection box, my bonus games of the year for 2024. It's an unusually diverse triad this time.

Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.
