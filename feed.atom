When the infamous 'Willy's Chocolate Experience' event went viral earlier this year, you would think that organisers would learn from its mistakes and strive to avoid similar mishaps.
Unfortunately, it looks like the video game industry now has its own 'Willy Wonka' expo to call its own with the 'Pokeverse' fan convention over in Mandaluyong, Manila in the Phillippines. As highlighted by Eurogamer, an attendee by the name of BintuRita has compiled her own experience of the event on social media, relaying an odyssey of misfortune, disappointment, and flat-out ineptitude on the part of the organisers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The announcement of a new Gears of War game, titled Gears of War: E-Day, was easily one of the highlights of the recent Xbox Games Showcase. It's status as a prequel, however, means fans are still left wanting for a follow-up to Gears 5's storyline, but it sounds like Microsoft and The Coalition haven't ruled out a new sequel for later done the line.


In an Xbox Wire blog post discussing Gears of War: E-Day, series brand director Nicole Fawcette assures that the team at The Coalition are "super proud about Gears 4 and Gears 5" and are "not retreating from that storyline in any way." As for why The Coalition has opted to do a prequel next rather than a Gears 6, Fawcette only says, "In [this] moment, we had an opportunity to write our next step, and this one just felt too good to miss."




Set 14 years before the events of the first Gears of War game, E-Day will depict the Locust's first attack on humanity, and serve as an origin story of sorts for protagonists Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago. As such, Microsoft insists that E-Day isn't a spin-off, but a full-fledged entry in the Gears of War series, saying, "Everything that happens in E-Day will shape the future of Gears of War for the better." 


With any luck, this means Gears 6 will happen eventually and continue the storyline that began with Gears 4. Maybe E-Day will even set up a few plot points for it? It's just a shame that the wait for it is going to be even longer than expected. Gears 5 came out in 2019 and with E-Day lacking a release window, there's no telling when any hypothetical Gears 6 will launch and resolve Gears 5's cliffhanger ending. Especially with how long development times for big-budget games are nowadays. Even so, E-Day has got fans excited, if only to experience a new Gears of War on modern hardware, and spend time with Marcus and Dom once more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will require your PC or console to be connected to the internet at all times to use texture streaming, including when you're playing the game's Campaign mode which doesn't feature any multiplayer elements. 


This was confirmed on the official Activision website, with the section about the decision reading: "To deliver the highest-quality visuals while also reducing the game's overall storage space on your hard drive, Black Ops 6 will use texture streaming across all game modes. This means you'll need a continuous internet connection to play any game mode, including Campaign."


This means that if your internet goes down, or you simply don't have a connection at any time, you won't be able to play Black Ops 6, even though the Campaign doesn't feature multiplayer.


You'll not see any of Black Ops 6's game modes without an internet connection. Image via Activision 


Texture streaming is a tool used in Call of Duty to provide extra detail and quality to the graphics of your game while attempting to keep the game's file size as small as possible. Instead of bundling these graphics into the file to be installed on your computer, on-demand texture streaming downloads them via the internet while you're playing. 


Activision developed it to "reduce the game's overall package size by removing certain textures rarely used or encountered by players. If players encounter an Operator or Weapon that uses a high-resolution texture, it will be streamed to the PC [or console's] cache as needed."


While this is massive for keeping our hard drives from filling up, it does mean that we'll never be able to play the game without an internet connection. However, this trade-off is worth it for many players, and I'd be inclined to agree.


Black Ops 6 will be released on October 26 and will launch with two round-based Zombies maps and a traditional multiplayer prestige system.

What's more, it's been given a release window of early 2025.

Like its predecessor, Starward Vector will see you playing as an android (Sleeper) on the run from the company that made you. You'll have to commandeer a ship, build up a crew and carry out as many tasks as possible before your decaying body halts your progress. A nice, stress-free experience, then...

"Ha ha ha ha ha ha!" Streets of Rogue 2 is looking similarly chaotic. But one thing has been brought to order: its release date. It's coming to early access on August 14th, while a new trailer (below) shows horse riding, flame throwing, and speed boating. My favourite moment is when a man pumps magic gas into a room full of people doing zumba, and it turns them all into giants, and they freak out and start smashing the walls in a panic.

Witch Beam, the Brisbane-based dev team behind BAFTA-winning indie hit Unpacking, has revealed that its next project — a musical puzzler by the name of Tempopo — is coming to Switch sometime in 2024.
With Cult Games on publishing duties, the initial trailer debuted in the recent PC Gaming Show, but you can check out the "Director's Cut" of it above. We recommend watching the whole thing, as the gameplay clips at the end do a better job of explaining the chill vibes and puzzle gameplay than the tone-setting opening.

Following a delay that pushed it out of 2023 into this year, tactical RPG Demonschool is finally coming to Switch (and other platforms) on 13th September — appropriately, it's a Friday.
Announced as part of the PC Gaming Show (with previous showcases containing Meet the Characters and Boss Mechanics trailers), we've been looking forward to this one for a long time — since we went hands-on with it back in 2022 — so we're pleased to see a solid release date on the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Frost Giant Studios revealed its upcoming RTS Stormgate's third playable faction today as the Celestial Armada. An ancient and advanced civilization, the Celestial Armada traverses the universe in massive world-ships ruled by the Sovereigns, immortal beings. Frost Giant also announced an August 13 release date for the RTS Early Access to begin.




Essentially space nomads, the playstyle of the Celestial Armada looks rather unique compared to the two other factions. The Celestial Armada is built around the Arcship, a flying HQ that assists with the creation of new bases rather than utilizing builder units like the other factions. Similar to the Protoss from StarCraft, buildings constructed by the Celestial Armada will generate a cascade field that expands the possible building area for the faction.


Interestingly, the Celestial Armada does not have to worry about supply. This faction starts with the max cap of 300, and can build as many units as their resources allow. Primarily focused on buildings rather than units, the Celestial Armada also has to juggle maintaining an efficient power grid by building power-generating structures to support the many buildings it will construct.


Those wanting to try out the upcoming RTS early can do so by purchasing a Founder's pack for access on July 30, or wait until it releases for free into Early Access on August 13, 2024 on PC via Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CoD Next is back for a third consecutive year and is set to give fans an in-depth look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.  


Anticipation for Black Ops 6 is at an all-time high. During the CoD Direct, Treyarch dropped a boatload of information about the campaign, multiplayer, and zombies. Key highlights included 16 new multiplayer maps, a new omnidirectional movement system, two round-based zombies maps, and a spy action thriller campaign set in a post-cold war landscape in 1991. 


When is CoD Next 2024?




CoD Next 2024 will be held on August 28. Treyarch did not confirm a start time for the event. For reference, CoD Next 2023 started at noon est. 


How to watch CoD Next 2024


CoD Next 2024 will be streamed on the official Call of Duty YouTube and Twitch channels. As was the case last year, we expect there to be exclusive Twitch drops and YouTube rewards for watching the streams. Fans can also watch the event from their favorite streamers' prospective, as dozens of content creators will be flown out to show off their skills. 


What to expect from Cod Next 2024


Fans certainly get their money's worth from CoD Next events. In 2023, Activision gifted fans with a four-hour livestream. Over 100 content creators were flown out and played several Modern Warfare 3 matches across a few of the title's maps. Then, those streamers played several Warzone matches, and gave players a first look at Urzikstan. In between, there were developer interviews filled with new nuggets about every game mode. 


CoD Next 2024 will most likely follow a similar format and provide gameplay footage from some of the 16 new multiplayer maps. Most Warzone information remains shrouded in mystery, as Treyarch kept tight-lipped about the battle royale during the CoD Direct.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the first time since 2021, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 brings back round-based zombies. 


As part of Call of Duty Direct, Treyarch confirmed that Black Ops 6 will launch with two round-based zombie maps. Liberty Falls is set in West Virginia during the day, while Terminus is set in a black site area with a dark setting. 


Zombies in Black Ops 6 continues the narrative that started in Black Ops 6. Treyarch confirmed a mix of new and returning power-ups and a healthy dose of easter eggs for players to put their detective hats on to solve. In addition, the movement overhaul will also be available for players in Zombies. This means that players will be able to slide, dive, and sprint in any direction, and the intelligent movement option allows you to move forward and auto sprint, auto mantle, and auto crouch. Lastly, the new Supine Prone lets you rotate your body while laying prone. Treyarch also teased that there will be new zombie-exclusive features too. 




This has been a long time coming for Zombies fans. Treyarch opted to turn away from round-based gameplay in CoD Vanguard and instead focused on players completing objectives, which went down poorly with the Zombies community. The decision went down poorly, so the development team backtracked and added round-based maps at the end of the title's life cycle. As it turned out, those two maps wound up being the last two round-based environments for several years. 


Thankfully, players won't have to wait much longer, as Treyarch plans to unveil new information about the beloved game mode in the following weeks.

Life is Strange: Double Exposure was dropped seemingly out of nowhere at the Xbox event in a franchise that many assumed was dormant, if not done entirely. Not only does the franchise live on, but it's also bringing back fan-favorite Max, the original game's master photographer with the ability to travel through time. 


Fans are having a huge response on Twitter, and it's honestly heartwarming to see so many people excited for the return of Max after so long. 




Max Caulfield is the protagonist of 2015's Life is Strange, an episodic series about a college student who discovers she can travel…]]></summary>

Clair Obscur's world is at the mercy of the Paintress, who awakens once a year to paint a cursed number on a monolith.

Like all Path to Glory cards, Barcola's item will be eligible for upgrades in the near future. However, this item is pretty easy to obtain as there are only two tasks in his SBC. Moreover, France has a great chance of going all the way to lift the trophy. In that case, Barcola's PTG (Path to Glory) card could end up getting some massive boosts, making this SBC an absolute bargain.

Both tasks of the EA FC 24 Bradley Barcola Path to Glory SBC have different conditions that will need to be satisfied during squad submissions.

With that said, much of the rest of the game does seem to match an expectation of crafting, baking, resource gathering, and many of the other features you’d expect out of a survival game, albeit with an adorable aesthetic of anthropomorphic mice as the visual style.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new storybook-aesthetic survival game, Winter Burrow, has been announced at the Xbox Games Showcase, featuring cute mice trying to outlast a harsh winter.


The story involves a young city mouse returning to her rural childhood home, only to find it abandoned and in disarray. Since her aunt was supposed to be care taking the property, she sets out in search for her, making new friends with the local critters along the way.


In order to stave off the bitter bite of winter, she will have to craft equipment like knitted swearers and adorable little leaf snowshoes that will help traverse the snowy fields. She will have to scavenge supplies to rebuild her modest home and prove herself capable to the community of mice they left behind for the city.


The cold is not the only danger waiting outside her door though, as the wilderness is inhabited by aggressive bugs that pose a threat to our little rodent protagonist. She'll have to adapt to new challenges and fill out her survival handbook in order to learn how to support herself.


Players can spend their time crafting, cooking, or decorating their burrows at a relaxed pace, as the developers at Pine Creek Games strive to ensure a cozy experience for everybody.


Founded in Denmark but operated remotely, the development studio had their premier game picked up by Noodlecake, a Canadian indie publishing group that funds new talent after finding success with their own Super Stickman Golf games in the mobile market.


We'll all have to wait out another winter before we can get our hands on Winter Burrow when it comes out on GamePass, Xbox Series X|S and PC (Steam) in 2025.


This is a developing story.

However, that one is the special edition at a higher price point, which helps make a bit of sense out of it. Even still, you would think the all-digital consoles would benefit from a bigger drive.


Here are all three new Xbox Series X|S consoles coming Holiday 2024:

Alright, I'm sold. The Galaxy Black looks cooler than I had even imagined and officially signals my time to finally get an Xbox Series X.


All three consoles are set to release in Holiday 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next expansion for Fallout 76 is called Skyline Valley and it launches next week. More specifically, Skyline Valley expands the game's map southward to the all-new Shenandoah region on June 12. 
There, players will investigate the cause of an electrical storm circling overhead and unveil the mystery around Vault 63. In this mysterious vault, players will meet its dwellers and discover a new Ghoul type called The Lost, too. 
Check it out for yourself in the Fallout 76: Skyline Valley trailer below: 


As you can see from the trailer above, the Shenandoah region is not looking so great in post-apocalyptic America. Plus, the trailer also reveals that Fallout 76 players can play as Ghouls starting sometime next year.

        <updated>2024-06-09T18:47:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced at the Xbox Games Showcase, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a new fantasy RPG coming to consoles and PC in 2025.


Taking place in a lucid depiction of the world we know, the entire planet is held in the vices of an omnipotent being called the Paintress, who has been slowly whittling down the global population with a curse that erases anybody from existence upon reaching the age painted upon her monolith. With each passing year, she lowers this age limit, eliminating swaths of lives, and spurring those who remain to seek her out and stop her from inking her canvas in blood.




The most striking quality is the dynamic RPG action with real-time prompts, which the developers refer to as reactive turn-based battles. Players are able to take their time selecting which abilities to use but then must perform action commands to execute the moves effectively, such as mashing button presses or aiming at weak points. These actions can also be reactive, allowing players to parry an incoming attack with a well-timed input. Think Paper Mario, but with spells, guns, and fantastical cinematic flare. 


Despite all the added action elements, the game is still first and foremost an RPG with upgradable equipment and branching skill trees that encourage players to craft a playstyle that suits them best.


This ethereal adventure is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and is the first game from developer Sandfall Interactive, with publisher Kepler Interactive backing the project.


Time is ticking away, so look forward to playing this day one on Gamepass, Xbox Series X|S, Playstation 5, and PC (Steam and EGS) when the calendar year is painted to 2025.


This is a developing news story.

As part of that, we learned the series is implementing a new movement system, bringing back round-based Zombies and Classic Prestige, and taking us to the year 1991 for its campaign. We also learned another key piece of information: when we'll be able to play it.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 25. Alongside that, players can expect a campaign that hopes to instill a sense of paranoia and intrigue with the Black Ops team going rogue in order to remove an entity that has infiltrated the highest levels of government, as well as a competitive multiplayer suite that includes 16 all-new maps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft have released a new trailer for South Of Midnight, a third-person action adventure from Compulsion Games, who created dystopian Britpop survival game We Happy Few. I thought We Happy Few had some wonderful ideas and presentation - it's sort of Fable by way of Clockwork Orange and Bioshock - but found its mixture of pill-popping satire and survival game mechanisms self-defeating. South Of Midnight seems no less vivid, but a lot more assured in its God Of War-style action... and it's perhaps a bit less intriguing, as a consequence. Still, don't just sit there reading my opinions. Watch the trailer.

It's one of the largest showcases this weekend at Summer Game Fest in Los Angeles, and it's certainly going to set the tone for Xbox moving forward into late 2024 and beyond.


This showcase arrives amid a tumultuous time for Xbox as a whole. Though it's finally secured its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Xbox has also gone through a streak of layoffs and studio closures in the last few months. And on top of that, the Xbox brand is looking to expand beyond its own box, moving some of its games to other platforms.


Today's show is a unified showcase, almost easy to see as a solidification of the new face of Xbox. So what happened today? Here's every game shown during the Xbox Games Show…]]></summary>

It does have snow nazis in however, possibly the rarest flavour of Nazi after Cookies n’ Cream and Original. You’ll find the trailer below. Be careful: it’s official. Also, it’s mainly just one very long cutscene, so if you want to save that stuff for when the game’s out, maybe don’t bother.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox closed out its mammoth showcase event with a surprise: a new Gears of War game. 


The game is Gears of War: E-Day, and looks to be a prequel to the original 2006 Xbox 360 title and, by extension, its beloved Ultimate Edition remaster.






E-Day, otherwise known as Emergence Day, is the Gears of War event in which the Locust Horde invaded the planet Sera. The original Gears of War starts 14 days after E-Day, with franchise hero Marcus Fenix imprisoned for abandoning his post. 


A new Gears game was the predominant rumor going into the Xbox Showcase, with fans eagerly awaiting a new entry in the store series. Gears has long been a fan-favorite Xbox franchise, praised for its storytelling, visceral action, and first-in-class multiplayer experience. 


This marks the first mainline series entry since 2019's Gears 5. That game ended with Marcus, his son J.D., and allies Del and Marcus forming the new Delta Squad. The last overall release was 2020's RTS experience, Gears Tactics. 


We gave Gears 5 an 8/10, calling it "an amplification of everything every Gears before did well," and "a maturation of everything those same games struggled with."


Gears of War: E-Day does not currently have a release date, but will be available at launch on Game Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has revealed Gears of War: E-Day, and it's a prequel "origin story" set 14 years before the very first Gears of War game. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, E-Day stars fan-favorite hero Marcus Fenix and gives players the chance to experience the terror of the infamous Emergence Day. 
In the trailer, which features an orchestral remix of Gary Jules' Mad World (the very same Mad World from the Gears of War launch trailer), we see Marcus and returning hero Dom Santiago come face to face with the Locust Horde. And though we know the Locust Horde quite well, it appears to be Marcus and Dom's first bout with these infamous enemies. 
Check it out for yourself in the Gears of War: E-Day reveal trailer below: 


"Experience the brutal horror of Emergence Day through the eyes of Marcus Fenix in the origin story of one of gaming's most acclaimed sagas," the trailer's description reads. "Fourteen years before Gears of War, war heroes Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago return home to face a new nightmare: the Locust Horde. These subterranean monsters, grotesque and relentless, erupt from below, laying siege on humanity itself."
Xbox says E-Day has been developed from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5 and promises to deliver "unprecedented graphical fidelity." 
There's no release date or window for E-Day yet.

The Call of Duty franchise has undergone various transformations since its departure from the World War II setting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Indiana Jones and The Great Circle trailer captures everything fans love about the iconic movie franchise, and even includes a nod to where it all started. 


During the Xbox Games Showcase, Bethesda provided another look at Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The trailer did not confirm an official release date beyond the 2024 release window already known. Still, it did show Indy and his sidekick Gina in action deep in the Himalayas as they hunt down an artifact called The Great before the Germans get to it first. 




The first-person, single-player adventure is set between the events of Raiders of the Lost Arc and the Last Crusade, meaning Indiana Jones is still in his prime. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle features a mix of puzzles, dramatic action set pieces, up close and personal fist fights, and gunslinging. Also, it wouldn't be an Indiana Jones title without being able to use his trusty whip in action. 


This is a developing news story and will be updated as new information is available.

Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, the new Avowed trailer highlights more of the game's first-person fantasy RPG action, and it continues to look great. 
"Explore the Living Lands, a mysterious island filled with adventure and danger," the trailer's description reads. "As an envoy of Aedyr, you are sent to investigate rumors of a spreading plague with a secret that threatens to destroy everything. Can you save the island and your soul from the forces threatening to tear them apart?" 
Check it out for yourself in the Avowed gameplay trailer below:

And is also quite informative about the moment-to-moment of the game. The video is framed as the memoir of a paunchy retired champion, Humphry, who once mentored a young heroine I presume will be the game's main character, though it's ambiguous. She could also be the villain. Then again, Fable is a series in which you can be the villain. Egad, such shenanigans!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest footage of MachineGames' Indiana Jones game showed an extended cutscene, some gameplay clips, and a tease of the first film's boulder run. In the footage we see Jones and a companion coming across a battleship somehow perched on top of an icy mountain. What follows is an extended cutscene where Jones comes face to face with a verbose Nazi who really wants the stone Jones discovered. A punchout ensues and the ship begins to fall before the footage switched to a series of gameplay snippets. Perhaps most exciting, however, was a tease of Indiana Jones outrunning the boulder like he did in the first film. Maybe the Great Circle will feature classic moments from the films?


Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is planned for release this year, but we still don't know the release date.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a good time to be a Blizzard fan. Not long after revealing a release date for the upcoming World of Warcraft: The War Within expansion, Blizzard revealed the opening cinematic as well as a release date for the first Diablo 4 expansion, Vessel of Hatred. Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred will be released on all platforms on October 8, 2024.




The cinematic trailer is just as hellish as you've come to expect from Blizzard and its Diablo 4 cinematics. Tempted by the Prime Evil Mephisto, Neyrelle heads to the new jungle region of Nahantu.


Players will follow Neyrell to Nahantu where they can play as the new Spiritborn class, recruit mercenaries to join them in combat, and participate in an all-new PvE co-op activity with friends.


Following the recently released Season 4: Loot Reborn, this feels like a great release time for the expansion. The Loot Reborn season essentially changed how loot works in the popular ARPG, paving the way for a great opportunity for some new Diablo 4 content using the new systems.


Diablo 4: Vessl of Hatred will be released on all platforms on October 8, 2024.

I didn’t really believe Uncanny Valley could be applied to video games until I saw the new Fable. That really hasn’t changed in this trailer. It’s largely cinematic, telling the story of one person who looks like they’ll be your mentor and another who’s maybe your foil.




More importantly, there’s some stuff in there that looks like gameplay. There are interactions with both fans and haters, a little bit of combat, and a few peeks at the world. Neat.


I wonder if you’ll be able to plant a tree and watch it grow over the course of your hero’s life.


Fable is coming to Xbox Series X|S and PC sometime in 2025.

Nine years after her debut in the series, Max Caulfield, the main protagonist of the original Life is Strange, is back in a supernatural murder mystery iteration of the series, Life is Strange: Double Exposure.




The trailer features an aged-up version of Max, now in her adult years, who is here to solve a mystery about what happened to her dead friend. 


As she searches for clues about the murder and determines who's trustworthy or not, we get a glimpse into her thoughts on her powers, which seem to be shunting her into alternate dimensions, and how they'll impact the game's story.


Life is Strange: Double Exposure will be released on October 29, 2024, for Xbox Series X|S and PC

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After revealing the official name as Dragon Age: The Veilguard just a few days ago, not the in-development name of Dreadwolf, BioWare officially revealed the next chapter in the Dragon Age franchise.  


Almost a decade after its last entry, Dragon Age: Inquisition, the upcoming Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be released this Fall 2024. While the first gameplay reveal is coming June 11, the Xbox Showcase revealed the first trailer for the game. 




We already knew that The Veilguard would be taking place roughly a decade after Inquisition, but the trailer shows the current state of Thedas and it looks quite exciting. It also features several returning Dragon Age characters, including fan-favorites Varric and Scout Harding. 


The official gameplay reveal for Dragon Age: The Veilguard is right around the corner on Tuesday, June 11. It'll be exciting to see what direction the popular RPG will be taking after a nearly decade-long hiatus.


Dragon Age: The Veilguard is set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC this Fall 2024.

The trailer shows off what I’d expect from a sequel to the N64 classic. There’s actual stealth and gadgets, and the levels look somewhat non-linear, maybe. I did not, however, see a large-headed alien or a presidential clone, but there’s still time. We do see the series’ protagonist, Joanna Dark, and mention of Daniel Carrington, though he seems to be the target of the mission.




Actually, a lot of the trailer reminds me of marketing material from around the Xbox 360 release. Parkour, gunfights behind fruit, and first-person tricks. Not that I expected it to look like an N64 game. This just looks a little generic. If it borrows the objective-based gameplay of Goldeneye and the original Perfect Dark, that would be a pretty good hook.


A release date hasn’t been stated, and neither have its target platforms. Xbox Series X|S and PC would be a good bet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-lost reboot of Perfect Dark made its grand return during today's Xbox Games Showcase. First announced in 2020 at The Game Awards, the trailer consists almost entirely of gameplay, showing off the reimagined vision of the Nintendo 64 classic. 
The over 3-minute trailer shows off first-person gameplay as Joanna Dark airdrops into a lush sci-fi city. Pursuing a target, she utilizes gadgets that allow her to hack systems to open doors and eavesdrop on nearby conversations. Getting around the city involves first-person parkour as she leaps and swings across balconies. Johanna is eventually greeted by goons that she drops by blasting them with bullets, stunning them with electrical rounds, or humbling them with CQC melee takedowns. She also has a scanner that reveals enemies behind barriers.


Perfect Dark is being developed by The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics. It is coming to Xbox Series X/S, but it still has no release window.]]></summary>

It accompanies the first details of this "immersive single player RPG" - pause for ecstatic applause from Anthem haters - "where you become the leader others believe in". Not miles from the premise of Dragon Age: Inquisition, then. That footage, tho? Not entirely Inquisitiony.

The trailer shows off the action in an open world that recalls titles like God of War and Elden Ring. The team has previously said that the action draws at least some inspiration from Soulslike games.
With today’s announcement, we know we won’t have long to wait until the game is available to try for ourselves, with a release date of July 18 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

It shows off some familiar-looking gameplay with a much-needed new coat of paint and confirms the return of Naked Snake's original voice actor, David Hayter. 


While we've seen snippets of gameplay of the Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater remake before, we've never seen it in action like this. The trailer contains key moments from the game with their fantastic upgraded graphics, but the gameplay seems to remain pretty true to the original. No matter how clunky it might have been. The most exciting part of the trailer is the voice acting, which confirms that David Hayter, the original and best voice for Solid and Naked Snake, is back at the helm as the protagonist for this game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fable will launch sometime next year, developer Playground Games has revealed. It did so during today's Xbox Games Showcase with a new trailer that features quick snippets of gameplay starring our heroine. 
In the trailer, we see our hero waltzing through a large medieval town while a narrator discusses an old threat returning to the world. Our hero wants to save Albion, and to do so, she needs to enlist the help of Humphry, who is the one narrarating the trailer. 
While there appears to be gameplay in the trailer, there's no U.I. and no combat – it's mostly just our hero protagonist walking and running through various fantastical locations. We do see some glimpses of combat, but it looks cinematic so it's hard to tell if it's actual combat gameplay. 
Check it out for yourself in the Fable gameplay trailer below: 


"What does it mean to be a hero," the trailer's description reads. "Humphry, once one of the greatest, will be forced out of retirement when a mysterious figure from his past threatens Albion's very existence." 
Microsoft revealed Fable was coming back in 2020, with a reveal trailer from Forza Horizon developer Playground Games. We then got our next look at the game with a more narrative-focused trailer starring Richard Ayoade last year, and today's new trailer is our first look at the game since then. 
Fable launches on Xbox Series X/S (and presumably PC) in 2025.

The trailer primarily revealed promotional footage, with gameplay elements, release date information, and a surprise content drop coming the same night as the showcase's airing.


When will Starfield's Shattered Space expansion be released?


Starfield's Shattered Space expansion is confirmed to release sometime in 2024, as highlighted in its official trailers and announcement posts. While no exact date was revealed, we can anticipate it coming sometime during Fall 2024 or between September and December. Considering Starfield's release date of September 2023, it would be fitting for its first major expansion to launch a year later.

That Bethesda are leaning into cosmic horror, as the trailer features landscapes that look like they're on the other side of an Oblivion gate than anything I saw during my time with Starfield.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One year after its announcement, Compulsion Games finally gave fans a first look at South of Midnight's gameplay. 


South of Midnight is a third-person action-adventure game set in the American Deep South, and follows a weaver named Hazel who has been tasked with repair tears in the universe by taking down mythical creatures. Compulsion described the project as a wide linear game, meaning there will be limits to how much players will be able to explore the bayou. South of Midnight launches worldwide in 2025 on Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam. 


In South of Midnight's first gameplay trailer, we get our first look at the mix of magical abilities and weapons Hazel uses to fight the swamp's strange and disturbing creatures. 




This is Compulsion Game's first project since We Happy Few in 2018, which was set in a dystopian English city and combined role-playing, survival, and roguelike elements. South of Midnight is a much different project but it still features some of that signature Compulsion Games flair.

State of Decay 3 doesn’t have a release date yet, but we do know that the game will release on Game Pass on day one.
The earlier State of Decay games focused on survival first, rather than simply gunning down hordes of enemies that have infested the world, even if taking out zombies remained a notable part of the experience. Beginning with the second game, there was also a big focus on cooperative play for up to four players. Based on the new trailer, that second feature appears to be a particular focus, as the narrative of the video showcases individuals working together to survive the killer undead all around them.]]></summary>

And, as the name suggests, it brings Doomguy to a more medieval setting. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, The Dark Ages sees the infamous demon defeater shoot and blast his way through a world seemingly inspired by medieval scenery. It will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (and Xbox and PC Game Pass) sometime next year. 
Fret not, though. It's still very much Doom, with plenty of weapons, demons from hell, some fantastic metal music, and a ton of gory first-person shooter action. 
Check it out for yourself in the Doom: The Dark Ages reveal trailer below: 


As you can see from the trailer above, Doom: The Dark Ages is a visual departure from the rest of the series. The scenery, weaponry, and even the enemies look significantly more medieval than anything else seen in the Doom series. There even appears to be a rideable dragon, too. 
Id Software rebooted the series back in 2016 with Doom, which we loved – read why in Game Informer's Doom review. The studio followed it up with Doom Eternal in 2019, which we enjoyed even more. Read Game Informer's Doom Eternal review to find out why we gave it a 9.25 out of 10. 
Interestingly, this is the first Doom game from Id Software and publisher Bethesda Softworks since Microsoft (and Xbox) acquired Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Many have speculated how Xbox will handle exclusivity with its recent years of acquisitions, including whether future Doom, Call of Duty, and other popular IPs now under the Xbox umbrella will get multiplatform releases. It seems, in Doom's case at least, it will still come to PlayStation, which makes sense, considering Doom and Doom Eternal were released there as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Treyarch and publisher Activision have released the first look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's narrative in a new cinematic gameplay trailer. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, todays' trailer highlights some of the strange 1990s conspiracy happening within the United States in Treyarch's long-running Black Ops series alongside some quick looks at the gameplay. 
After the trailer, Microsoft Gaming CEO reiterated that Black Ops 6 will launch on Xbox and PC Game Pass on day one later this year, although no release date was revealed. The game will also come to PlayStation as well. Spencer said this Black Ops 6 trailer is the first time a Call of Duty game has appeared in an Xbox showcase in 10 years, and that going forward, all players (across all platforms) will experience the game, betas, seasonal expansions and updates, and more at the same time.

Back in 2011, Sonic Generations felt like an attempt to win back long-time Sonic fans. Whether they grew up with 2D Sonic or the 3D adventures, both sides of the fanbase were becoming frustrated with the attempts at experimentation, and the supposed abandonment of what made Sonic great – fast, frantic, flowing action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Battle Chef Brigade developer Trinket Studios has unveiled its next project, Battle Suit Aces. Instead of a culinary puzzle battle, you’re hopping into anime-inspired mech suits to take on other mech suits in card-based combat.
Revealed during the Future Game Show, players lead a crew of mech pilots, who take the form of cards, to engage in 5v5 battles against enemies. Not only can you improve their mech suits, of which 30 types exist, but you can grow meaningful relationships with your plucky pilot squad.


The game includes over 50 voiced characters to bond with over 50 story missions, and players can steer the narrative by making decisions such as choosing to side with one of five factions. Gameplay is all about building the most strategically viable hand based on your personal playstyle to wipe out what Trinket Studios describes as a "star-consuming threat." 
Battle Suit Aces is slated to launch for PC via Steam at an unknown date. You can read our review of Battle Chef Brigade here.]]></summary>

Both the hero shooter genre and mainstream Marvel media are currently in interesting places. Overwatch, the most prominent hero shooter of last decade, has experienced a sharp downtown since the late 2019 announcement of its sequel, while the Marvel Cinematic Universe, once a surefire cash cow, has seen a wider range of results since its 2019 culmination with Avengers: Endgame. Marvel Rivals exists at the intersection of these two categories, and my hands-on session gave me hope that it will be able to capture the magic of both of these genre's glory days.

Sonic X Shadow Generations brings one of the most well-liked Sonic games of the last decade and a half forward to modern consoles. What was essentially a "greatest hits" compilation of remade levels from throughout Sonic's history to serve as a celebration of the Blue Blur's 20th anniversary is being remastered for current technology, but that's not all: As part of the package, players can engage in a standalone campaign starring Shadow.

        <updated>2024-06-08T21:15:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Nordcurrent Labs and newcomer developer River End Games have revealed Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream, a narrative-driven stealth-strategy adventure game launching next year. Revealed during today's Future Game Show Summer Showcase, Eriksholm comes from a team of developers whose experience includes Battlefield, Mirror's Edge, Little Nightmares, and Unravel. 
Set in the titular Eriksholm, a fictional city inspired by a Nordic aesthetic of the early 1900s, Eriksholm follows three protagonists united in their hearts to defy their oppressors. In the reveal trailer below, you can see one of those protagonists, Hanna, an adolescent orphan searching for her brother Herman. That journey transforms Hanna into a reluctant hero, inspiring herself and her friends to rise from the gutters of Eriksholm to become symbols of change. 
Check it out for yourself in the Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream reveal trailer below: 


From Eriksholm's top-down 3D perspective, players will control the game's three protagonists to navigate through the city (aboveground and underground) while utilizing unique character skills, tools, weapons, and more to overcome enemies and complete puzzles. River End Games says players can freely move the in-game camera to survey the environment, plan their next steps, and execute strategies with perfect timing. 
"All of us at River End Games are proud to finally reveal Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream to the world," studio founder and creative director Anders Hejdenberg writes in a press release. "This is just the first glimpse of what we've done, and we hope it will capture your hearts and minds, just like it has captured ours. We can't wait to show you even more in the future." 
Here are some screenshots from the game: 

Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream will launch in 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dustborn, the narrative action road trip game developed by Red Thread Games and published by Quantic Dream, received a new trailer during today’s Future Games Show. We also learned that players can get their hands on it before its August launch.
Dustborn stars Pax, an ex-criminal with the unusual ability to weaponize words. As in, words are literally power for her as she can fight with shouts or manipulate people in conversations. While Pax can crack skulls using a bat and create new shouts to battle enemies, the game also focuses on building relationships with her crew of misfits (who have their own special powers). Set in an alternate Neo-western version of the U.S., you’ll travel across the country to transport an important package under the disguise of a traveling punk band. Check out its new trailer below. 


If Dustborn piques your interest, you can play a 30-minute demo next week during Steam Next Fest from June 10-17. Dustborn launches on August 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silver Lining Studio, the developer of Behind The Frame, has revealed its next game, The Star Named EOS, will launch next month. More specifically, the narrative-driven photography-based puzzle game will launch on July 23 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. 
Silver Lining revealed this during today's Wholesome Direct, during which it also showcased some new gameplay from The Star Named EOS. In the gameplay trailer, we see more of this game's beautiful hand-drawn world, unique puzzles solved through photography, and more. 
Check it out for yourself in The Star Named EOS release date trailer below: 


You might recognize someone in the trailer, too, as the main character's mother is voiced by Suzie Yeung, who voices Yuffie in Final Fantasy VII Remake and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. The Japanese dub features the voice of Aoi Yūki, who has voiced characters in Persona 5, Genshin Impact, and more, and the Chinese voice-over is performed by Shandy Ma, who has appeared in more than 20,000 commercials and TV shows. 
"The Star Named EOS is a story-driven puzzle game centered on a love for photography and the pursuit of memory," a press release reads. "As a child, Dei regularly received letters from his mother when she was traveling, each of which came enclosed with a memorable snapshot of the location she was visiting. But one day, Dei notices something peculiar about one of the photographs she left behind, putting everything he believes to the test. Now, guided by his mother's voice deep within himself, it's time for Dei to set out on his own to learn the truth about his family and confront the echoes of the past." 
Here are some additional screenshots from The Star Named EOS: 

The Star Named EOS hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on July 23. If you're curious about the game, you can download its Steam demo right now.

The trailer starts with charming, cozy tea shop tasks like serving customers and collecting tea ingredients but ends with Alta on a bench working through a panic attack while convincing herself she is living her best life. Both The Stanley Parable and The Beginner's Guide are games that play with player perceptions and are some of the best uses of taking the interactive medium to tell stories that only video games can tell. Wanderstop looks like a cozy game, but it's safe to assume there is more to it than that.

Fans have been asking for a Chrono Trigger remake for decades at this point, so now more than ever, with so many other revivals from Square like Dragon Quest, Live A Live, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and more, it just feels like it’s the right moment.
But with multiple ways to remake this game that many herald as one of the greatest of all time, how exactly should Square remake Chrono Trigger?

The weekend is finally upon us and it's time to play some games!
There has been plenty to talk about this week in the world of Nintendo. Yet more 'Switch 2' rumours trickled in with a fresh batch of supposed codenames, Playtonic announced Yooka-Replaylee (maybe our favourite title of the year, so far) and we finally got a release window for Metal Slug Tactics.

When that failed to happen, the terms of the injunction seemed to be up for negotiation, at least for a while. Having done little to convince the court that infringement wouldn't continue, DoodStream's operators and associates are now banned from running the site.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fest up.
Summer Game Fest 2024 is finally up and running following yesterday's Opening Showcase. Geoff Keighley's two-hour show featured a good variety of games, big and small, starting off with a surprise for Switch owners in the form of a flagship Sony series making its debut on a Nintendo platform. Sure, LEGO Horizon Adventures is a fun, tongue-in-cheek spin-off of Guerrilla's series, but we were still a little taken aback to see that Switch logo at the end of the trailer.
Elsewhere, Switch gamers saw announcements and trailers for Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, Neva, Civilization VII, Battle Crush, Monster Hunter Stories, and Sonic X Shadow Generations, plus the 'Outersloth' indie dev initiative from Among Us dev Innersloth will surely yield some fruit on Nintendo's console, too. Not a huge amount of Switch news, then, but we've come to expect as much.

Most of them we can't play yet. But as a general rule, talking about games makes us want to play games, even if they're completely unrelated. Everyone has those moments where they see the trailer for a new multiplayer hero shooter or some such thing, and for reasons only known to themselves, they say, "yes, I really must play more Simpsons: Hit And Run." So: here's what we're all clicking on this weekend!

        <updated>2024-06-08T00:51:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Computer Artworks' 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic "trust" and "fear" systems.
Sadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They've just announced that they're making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.

Shortly after that, though, perhaps the zaniest publisher, Devolver Digital, took to the digital airwaves to showcase six of its games in the 2024 Summer Devolver Direct presentation. 
If you weren't able to catch it, or if you missed the name of the game you're excited to check out (or even its release date maybe), we've got you covered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heart Machine, the team behind Hyper Light Drifter and Solar Ash, has revealed Possessor(s), a side-scrolling action game coming to consoles and PC next year. Revealed during today's Devolver Digital presentation and teased earlier this week, Possessor(s) features action combat inspired by platform fighters like Super Smash Bros. set in a quarantined city destroyed by interdimensional catastrophe. 
In Possessor(s), you control Luca, the host, and Rehm, her less-than-cooperative counterpart as the two venture through a sprawling metropolis filled with collapsed skyscrapers to explore and secrets to uncover. Devolver says the narrative features multiple paths in an "open-ended world structure" as players attempt to learn the truth behind the catastrophe that has wrecked the city (and seemingly the world). 


"Gameplay is centered around tight, fast-paced platforming with a range of unique movement abilities that extends to its tense, precise combat," a press release for Possessor(s) reads. "Balance ground and air attacks, replete with combos and juggles as you encounter a variety of deadly enemies and challenging bosses."
Throughout Possessor(s), players will discover upgrades that allow Luca and Rehm to explore previously inaccessible areas, nodding toward a potential Metroidvania-style city layout. 
Here are some Possessor(s) screenshots: 

Possessor(s) hits consoles and PC in 2025, presumably after Heart Machine's other in-development game, Hyper Light Breaker, hits PC this year.

We got a look at 20 games, including seven World Premieres. These range from the sweet to the silly to the spectacular. Some highly-anticipated indies — including Mossmouth and The Game Bakers' next games — might have stolen the show, but everything here is worth a look. The big question for us is, "Are these coming to Switch?". That's always difficult for these bigger showcases, but we've got all the answers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Door-and-peace-minus-the-peace FPS Anger Foot, the best game ever made, has finally got a release date: July 11th 2024. This is spectacular news, mainly because I’d already printed off a load of shirts that said ‘Anger Foot GOTY 2024.’ I was going to do some socks, too, but I do not trust this game anywhere near footwear.

        <updated>2024-06-08T00:23:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tenjutsu is a jujutsu-inspired action roguelite from Sébastien Benard, lead designer of Dead Cells and solo developer at Deepnight Games, and it's coming to consoles and PC sometime in the future. Revealed during today's Devolver Digital presentation, Tenjutsu is a fully fleshed-out version of Tenjutsu (48h version), which Deepnight released back in 2022.
Devolver describes the game as a "fast and fluid rogue-jutsu," leaning into the game's jujutsu roguelite action. In it, you control a renegade yakuza "hellbent on defying her former associates and loosening their grip on the Secret Garden City." To do so, you must fight four powerful crime syndicates. To defeat them "you must master a brutal brawling system and build a diverse arsenal of weapons, upgrades, and martial arts techniques, breaking their hold on the streets in a flurry of violence." 
Check out the Tenjutsu trailer for yourself below: 


While you must take down all four crime syndicates, the order you do so is up to you. As you take more and more down, you gain control of Secret Garden City and can seemingly upgrade its districts and more for rewards. Doing so will unlock new weapons, combat moves, and additional areas for exploration. However, the longer you spend doing this, the stronger your enemies become. 
Here are some Tenjutsu screenshots: 
There is no release date for Tenjutsu just yet, but it's coming to undisclosed consoles and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Massive Monster still isn't done with its 2022 hit game, Cult of the Lamb, as it's bringing full campaign co-op to it this August. Revealed during today's Devolver Digital presentation, the Unholy Alliance update hits Cult of the Lamb on August 12 and adds a new playable character: the Goat. 
With the Goat joining the titular Lamb, players can now experience the entire campaign in local co-op. Devolver says this update includes two-player twists on existing minigames in Cult of the Lamb, like fishing and kuncklebones, as well as additional corrupted weapons, tarot cards, curses, and relics. 
Check out the two-player action in the Cult of the Lamb: Unholy Alliance trailer below: 


While playing in co-op, players can swap weapons, deal extra damage when fighting back-to-back, and deal critical hits if their attacks are in sync. Plus, solo players get some new powers and abilities to play with, too. 
Elsewhere in the update, Unholy Alliance adds new buildings, fleeces, follower traits, follower quests, and more secrets to discover. 
Here are some Cult of the Lamb: Unholy Alliance screenshots: 

Cult of the Lamb's Unholy Alliance update hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC for free on August 12.

Enter Tides Of Tomorrow. Ok, so I actually don't know if it has anything in common with Waterworld aside from having lots of water everywhere. Still, I'll never pass up an opportunity for a crispy Simpsons reference.

With the ambitious project nearing a decade in its own development, though, those games have now taken on their own real history in addition to their made-up one. Those histories will meet this September, when UFO 50 finally sees the light of day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before we get to the latest trailer for S-Game's soulslike Phantom Blade Zero I have a couple of complaints to lodge about the title. Firstly, this game clearly contains a non-zero quantity of blades, from whacking great axes to katanas. Secondly, I do not accept the premise that these are phantom blades. They are very obviously non-spectral, going by the amount of stabbing and clanging on show in the video. With these potentially ruinous caveats out of the way, I am now free to tell you more about a game that looks like it's out to eat Sekiro's lunch.

Sorry, Petal Runner devs, for opening a news article about your lovely wholesome game talking about stabbings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Monster Hunter Wilds trailer shows off a chase across desert dunes as burrowing, armored reptiles pursue a squad of hunters. It's the latest look at the game following its first gameplay appearance during last week's State of Play. 
Though this squad of hunters tries to fight back with gunfire, the ground gives way beneath them, trapping them inside a cave. We then see clips of a proper battle against these beasts, with one character using a very large gun and unleashing hell while atop a mount. The trailer also gives a few glimpses of story moments, but it's still hard to parse what the plot of Wilds entails. 


Capcom promised to share more detail about the game during Gamescom. Monster Hunter Wilds arrives in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

I didn’t spent quite so many hours of feline enforced stasis with it, but I too was drawn in for a respectable time chunk. It’s those detail-stuffed visuals and caffeinated animations that tipped it for me, and it’s the same art that have me excited for Capybara’s follow-up. Battle Vision Network is an online puzzle battler that pits you head to head against real-life humans (boo those guys). The conceit here is its a televised space sport, in which you’ll steer the fate of its ongoing story arcs by winning or losing as your chosen team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Wolfhound, you play as Capt. Chuck “Wolfhound” Rosetti as he explores an island in the Bermuda Triangle. And that island happens to be structured like a classic Metroid game. Whether intentionally or not by developer Bit Kid (the creator Chasm) the game also has flavors of the NES Metal Gear games.
Join me and Marcus Stewart as we check out the game's demo and get excited for Wolfhound's 2025 release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer S-Game has released a new trailer for its upcoming action game, Phantom Blade Zero, which features plenty of gorgeous (and gory) fast-paced action. Though we still haven't received a release date, the game is looking great, and it will be playable at Summer Game Fest's Play Days this weekend, so we could soon hear how it feels to actually play. 
It will also be playable at a few other locations this year, including Gamescom in August and Tokyo Game Show this September. 
Check out the latest look at Phantom Blade Zero gameplay in the trailer below: 


Revealed as a new entry in the Phantom Blade series during a PlayStation Showcase last year, Phantom Blade Zero is inspired by Chinese martial arts and steampunk. In it, you control the Dark Raider, who is out for revenge against a group called "The Order." 
Watch the Phantom Blade Zero reveal trailer from last year here.

        <updated>2024-06-07T22:50:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of Summer Game Fest’s most intriguing reveals is Killer Bean. This upcoming action roguelite puts you in the boots of a bean who seemingly embodies every awesome trait of every action/spy hero you've ever seen.


The game's Steam page provides the following synopsis: "After being betrayed by the Shadow Agency and learning the truth about their evil ways, Killer Bean has made it his life goal to destroy them. Yet this is easier said than done, as Killer Bean will face armies of enemies, and mysterious Shadow Beans who are better trained and more powerful than him."
The humourous gameplay trailer shows the game's ever-changing open world, which morphs each time you begin a new single-player campaign. As rogue assassin Killer Bean, you can blast apart enemies (in both 1st and 3rd person), which range from soldiers to giant, Metal Gear-esque walking mechs, suplex them with wrestling moves, blow them up with rockets or just plow them with your sports car. The world is your oyster, and the game seems to be a physics showcase, with copious amounts of ragdolling characters and objects. 
Killer Bean is slated to launch into Steam Early Access this summer.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-06-07T22:43:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher EA and developer Full Circle have released a new trailer for their long-in-development Skate, the fourth mainline entry in the Skate series and the first in more than a decade. Revealed during today's Summer Game Fest 2024 showcase, EA announced with the trailer that "console playtesting" for the game will begin this fall; there's still no release date for the game, though. 
In the trailer, which begins with a live-action segment starring comedian Tim Robinson (who actually shreds in real life, by the way), we see him as an employee of the fictional M-Corp before transitioning to a look at pre-pre-alpha gameplay of Skate. The gameplay admittedly looks early, but players can check it out on console this fall when "console playtesting" begins. 
Check it out in the Skate. trailer for yourself below: 


EA announced in 2020 that it was working on a new Skate game, and we later learned it will be called "Skate." instead of Skate 4 like many presumed. We also learned in 2022 that it will be a free-to-play title as well. 
For more, read this behind-the-scenes look at Ful Circle, the newcomer studio making Skate, and then check out this early look at Skate's fluid movements and awesome bails after that.

The ‘next-gen’ part probably refers to Unreal Engine 5, and fair’s fair, it’s a real looker this one. The below trailer is mainly scripted or edited bits, but having played a chunk of the last technical test, there’s some genuinely impressive sci-fi vistas to behold, as well as some absolutely massive bosses. Click on the trailer below, until the purple hat or whatever it is you kids grind for these days, pops out with a synapse-tickling noise workshopped by psychologists for eighteen months.

Yet, when the major Hollywood studios teamed up with Netflix, Amazon, and Apple, to obtain a strict, immediate injunction against a site considered a global piracy threat, early non-compliance wasn't harshly punished. Indeed, documents suggest that injunctions are up for negotiation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stare into an abyss for long enough and, as Nietzsche wrote, a mostly naked man will wobble out of the abyss and try to murder you with a mattock. Inasmuch as can be told in the absence of dialogue or a text preamble, the naked man wants to murder you because you, and not he, are in possession of a hat. The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It's the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman's too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you're trying to fend him off with.


There are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of the Half Sword demo - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.

Even if it doesn’t have the every-last-speck detailing of PowerWash Simulator or Viscera Cleanup Detail, it satisfies in very similar ways, and I would very much like to get back out on the water whenever the full game is complete.

Whereas CES splits its focus across tech, cars, and the occasional overdesigned white good, Computex is all computing, all the time, making it a prime source of reveals and showcases for the hardware bits that make games happen.
Sadly, Computex 2024 is unlikely to go down as a classic, largely because this year’s show has been mesmerised by AI and the most tedious applications thereof: search, but different somehow! Run art-stealing generation tools faster! Oh, Computex, what have they done to you, and why do you have seven fingers on one hand?
Granted, AI is a broad field, and not everything about it is necessarily gross or creatively bankrupting. But it also doesn’t deserve to overshadow all the other useful, unexpected, and curiosity-piquing gaming tech that Computex has to offer, from new Steam Deck alternatives to resurrected CPU lineups and promising graphics card updates. Here are those highlights of the show so far...

But for those who never owned a Windows PC in the 90s, Fucksweeper is a free, titillating, revolting, beautiful, apocalyptic new version of classic avoid-the-bombs grid puzzler Minesweeper that incorporates elements of dating sims and a vast quantity of generative AI filth. Maybe turn down the volume before watching this video.

I got to try out the game and talk to Director Naoki Yoshida (aka Yoshi-P) about new Jobs and the difficulty of incorporating fan feedback (not to mention the reasons the Warrior of Light has such great skin - you'll see). But how can the Square Enix possibly hope to follow the highs of Endwalker, including space travel and a fight against the physical embodiment of sorrow? By taking us on holiday, of course.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hollywood Animal is a management sim about turning a bankrupt movie studio into a money printing machine, set in Hollywood’s golden age. While a Frostpunk 2 or Manor Lords might have you grapple with the elements, here it’s all about balancing a fickle audience and Tinseltown’s seedy underbelly. Maybe making some worthwhile art, too? Sorry, did I say ‘worthwhile art’? I meant to say “lots of money.” Let’s get clicking!
First up, I need to name my studio (I settle on Horace's Revenge) as well as my crack new team of business bastards. There’s my chief legal officer, Jebediah End. My CCO, Anne Egg, and CFO, Rummy McLastdrink. He doesn’t have a sauce problem, because obviously I wouldn’t put him in charge of money if he did. In the wreckage of the studio, we find an unedited film reel hidden in the waffles n’ cocaine cupboard. It’s a noir thriller named ‘Messenger Of Death’. Whatever influential critic is currently directing this era’s discourse has chosen to categorise each film as genre percentages (‘60% detective/40% thriller’), and setting (‘modern American city’.) Let’s just hope those pigs in the stands recognise a solid gold picture when they see one!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Sorry We're Closed, an axe-murdering entrepreneur called Jenny is described in newspaper clippings as both a serial embezzler and as the city's "wealthiest bachelorette". Aside from being a dry reflection of tabloid reporting on women who commit crimes (bad woman! sexy, bad woman!) this is also the kind of incidental character-building you can expect in this perky, retro-styled survival horror. It plays like Silent Hill charged with the hot pink body horror of Porpentine interactive fiction. And judging by my hour of unsettled strolling through the decrepit tube station of the game's demo, it's a powerful combo.

What set this apart from similar lawsuits was a two-line warning in the complaint's introduction. Elsewhere, the statement could've been dismissed as typical anti-piracy posturing, but here, Bungie's relentless deanonymization of targets sends a powerful, credible message.

You answer the questions by looking ponderously down and pressing the big red and yellow buttons on the desk in front of you. The questions begin with relatively innocuous, CAPTCHA-style inquiries, such as "is this a door?" accompanied by a picture of a face. A few minutes later, there's stuff like "Are you alone?" and "Is it safe to be alone?" and "You are alone" and yep, time to smash Pause or better, throw the Steam Deck behind the sofa and go stare out the window for a while.

It takes some of that game’s ideas, mainly those related to shooty and looty, and reforms them into a largely different can o’ campfire beans. This time, it’s less focused on exploration, more on individual, tense shoot-outs. You collect a cast of weirdos, each with different guns and abilities, and form the deadliest dang posse this side of the last tactical overworld map you descision'd your way through. I like what I've played so far, although I think a lot is going to hinge on how much evolution the mid-game offers. As always, here’s a Steam demo, if you want to be all contrary and 'form your own opinions'. Pah.

It's like the hammer of Hephaestus himself was put to work on the entire armory. The Moonstone Axe's heavier attacks now channel faster, for one thing, which could make the most sluggish of the weapons a little more viable. I haven't had a go at the re-jigged bashing yet myself but I trust from these patch notes it will be subtly noticeable.

It is a moody sci-fi extravaganza in which your character, beleaguered offworld miner Jan Dolski, has to create new versions of himself by branching off his own past timeline using a "quantum computer", splitting the chain of events at trigger points by, say, having his younger self stand up to his domineering father rather than leaving home.

Seriously, me and the boys used to roam the streets of Bradford looking for F-Zero players to bully, at least till the RollCagers rocked up and stole our lunch money. Mind you, I think I was probably less interested in WipeoUt's racing than its trackside landscapes, which remain exquisite decades on - all those sweeping album-cover facades with their animate fixtures that thickened and solidified into full-blown peripheral cities as the series progressed. 


I am similarly hooked by the worlds of Ghosts Ehf's Phantom Spark, which are a million lightyears from WiPeout in terms of their influences and atmosphere, much as the underlying hover-jockeying is a million lightyears away from WipeouT in terms of its gentleness and lack of combative elements. But these spaces are just as mesmerising to fly through and think about when not focussed on finding the perfect line through the next corner, or avoiding a patch of grass. Small wonder, given that the game's art director is Joost Eggermont, whose streaking astral contraptions and "small interactive moments" I've long admired, but never managed to write about until now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, I've played a portion of Elden Ring's expansion Shadow Of The Erdtree and I think it's brilliant. But there's one thing I didn't flesh out in the preview and that's the DLC's standalone levelling system, brought to our attention a month or so ago. Well, here I am to flesh it out! Be warned, though, the role of the system is a jarring thing to condense into words.

Life In Jars is this YouTuber I've followed for a while. He makes videos that might involve, say, scooping up some puddle water, leaving it in a sealed jar for a while, then coming back to it a few months later. He'll report on the results, which are often tremendous. Look at the LIFE in that jar! The little wriggly lads just wriggling around. The blobs whose job is to float and squidge indiscriminately. A lovely bit of fauna sloshing about there, like a forest dwelling for those who implement the five-second rule. It's a reminder that bog water is rather beautiful, actually.
Having spent three hours with Elden Ring expansion Shadow Of The Erdtree's opening area, I can't help but think of Life In Jars. What resides in the shadowy dome of the Big Tree is horrendous! Miserable! The forgotten creatures and their crumbling homes are grim. But oh my word, the shadows have spawned a beautiful disasterpiece. Just, errr, those other jars? The fun guys with the scoopy arms and little legs? Yeah. I have bad news.

Please feel free to try any of these on for size: Grunn’s shear sound is the Wilhelm Scream of gardening equipment, sure to be referenced for decades to come. Grunn’s shear sound wormed its way past my eyes and into parts of my brain I’d previously assumed could only be accessed by either masterful ASMR or irresponsibly long Q-tips. I used to have anxiety, but now, my only fear in life is that Grunn’s grass will run out, so I no longer have a reason to click away with its shears. Play Grunn, innit. There are, by the way, lots of other things to like about it, although I cannot hear them over the wonderful sound of these shears.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been one month since the sound of engines began. The hardest track ever created in Trackmania was published by a team of mappers on May 4th, bringing an intimidating 16-floor tower called Deep Dip 2 into the racing game. It became a magnet for competitive drivers after a prize pool of over $30,000 was offered to the first three players to conquer its hellish heights. The prize has yet to be claimed. Even today, determined racers continue to bang their heads against the brutally designed course, featuring icy surfaces, curving rails, and perilous loop-the-loops that hang kilometres about the ground. Some players have parked their hopes and given up. But others persevere. The top three players have reached the final floor and currently stand shoulder to shoulder, eyes focused on the prize.

While most forks are now disabled, the main repository has managed to survive after being given the opportunity to put things right. Whether Nintendo appreciated the irony is unclear, but it appears that use of encoding as a protection measure to obfuscate links, was no match for the video game company's circumvention skills.

Engineering a mech is a Herculean labour whose completion eludes today's puny scientists, and Mech Engineer doesn't aim to make life easier, whatever its putative status as a "means of fun". Mech Engineer is a game with an attitude problem, frankly. I realised this on in-game day two, when the interface coughed up a bunch of damage reports presented as pieces of paper, which I then had to crumple up and toss away individually.

Like A Dragon: Yakuza will be a six-part series following characters in the criminal underbelly of Kamurocho, set to straddle between two time periods: 1995 and 2005. The series "showcases modern Japan and the dramatic stories of these intense characters, such as the legendary Kazuma Kiryu, that games in the past have not been able to explore,” said Amazon, who are releasing it through Prime Video, just like their Fallout series.

Oh, did you like that door? Was it your favourite door? Soz, pal. Strategy game Tactical Breach Wizards just hexed right through it with a new demo as part of Steam Next Fest. I’ve played it, and it’s very exciting stuff, not least for how differently it plays than what I’d expected.

Now, Meridia has imploded and become a radiant, wailing, purple-fringed disc of pure nothingness, with triumphant players rudely ejected from orbit via emergency hyperspace jump, but subsequently allowed to return and gaze into the dark heart of their victory. Great work, Inferno-plungers. I'm sure the consequences of this will be neither cosmic nor horrible.

Dire Decks was released in 2023 on itch.io and was well received there. Kindanice has pointed out the direct likeness between their game and the one released on Steam under another name. Yikes. Thanks to our diligent commenters for catching this. We'll try to find out more. 
Original article: The onslaught of fun Steam Next Fest demos you can play right now continues and will not relent. Card Bard is a deckbuilding roguelike shooter in which your wee gunman is seemingly frozen in abject terror as little pill-shaped baddies creep towards him like bacteria on a petri dish. Good thing you have a hand of cards, each one showing how many bullets will bop forth from your body when you select it. It's surprisingly tough for something so pastel-paletted. I'm 10th on the leaderboard. You can probably beat that, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In EA's Desert Strike - released way back in the dim salvages of 1992 - you are a helicopter pilot scooting around a Sylvester Stallone reinvention of Iraq, shooting down tanks and fighters with guns and missiles while rescuing VIPs and fretting constantly about your wafer-thin armour and espresso-sized fuel reserves. It was a no-frills piece of Gulf War fanfic, complete with George Bush ending cameo, and a well-made shooter that used to drive me nuts on Sega Mega Drive.
Megacopter: Blades Of The Goddess is Desert Strike, but heavily Blood-Dragonified and with a big dollop of Airwolf to boot. Here, the enemy troops are naughty Reptoid aliens, the writing is scattershot-satirical (upgrades are bought with pizza tokens) and your helicopter houses the soul of a blood-drinking "AZ-TECH" goddess. Is it a nuanced parody of the Strike series? It doesn't feel like it. Did I enjoy the demo? Yes. Does it have a crawling tentacle boss called Queen Oildusa? Also yes, and will you please stop asking questions so I can write the rest of this article.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the death of E3, June has descended into a chaotic clusterfunk of trailers, broadcasts, announcements, and a generalised frenzy of publicity-seeking barking noises. Summer Game Fest has emerged as a hub for a lot of developers seeking eyes. The 2-hour show hosted by marketing man Geoff Keighley will be broadcasting on Friday, blasting you in the ocular nerves with, probably, a lot of games. However, most of these games will not be brand new, exciting reveals, said Keighley himself in a fresh Twitch Q & A. "There will be, definitely, new announcements," he said, "but the show is largely focused on, I think, existing games that have new updates for fans." He's mentioning this ahead of time, he said, to set expectations.

Authorities aren't naming the service but if the name TVMucho rings any bells, people are on the right track. That police identified the owner of the service is no surprise. The Dutchman has never hidden away and has continuously claimed his service operates legally. If only in part, it's still streaming channels right now.

Overall, sites are still being blocked in large numbers, but the real growth isn't found on main domains. Easily and quickly deployed at almost no cost, subdomains can circumvent blocking and Spain blocks them in their thousands.
