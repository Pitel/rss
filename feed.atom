He feels great to play, and miserable to play against. He is also, apparently, quite bad - at least according to project lead Ben Brode, who's consulted his big statistics bank to discover that he appears in more losing decks than anyone else. 
Huh. I suppose I can stop agonising over whether he has a place in my latest Patriot deck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spoiled for choice.
Farming games have millions of fans at this point, thanks to the killer combo of Harvest Moon, Story of Seasons, Rune Factory, and Stardew Valley, but they all have one thing in common that has very little to do with farming: The ability to date people in town. Let's be honest, a lot of people who love farming games aren't just doing it for the love of seeds and soil; it's all about getting to know the locals and learning how to win their hearts.
Upcoming Switch game SunnySide is an incredibly detailed farming sim "with the deep social sim aspects of a Persona game", and the new trailer above shows off just what they mean by that. With 24 dateable characters in the rural Japanese town where you find yourself, there's something for everyone — although each of those characters has specific preferences when it comes to a partner!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ) started the New Year with a bang, raising over $2.6 million for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. For the unfamiliar, GDQ is a 24-hour charity live-stream where dedicated gamers show off speedruns of their favorite games. Before 2020, most events were held in person, but since then they've mostly been broadcasted from streamers' homes. This year's event ran from January 8-15 and included over 140 runs.
🏁TIME🏁
#AGDQ2023 has raised a total amount of $2,642,493 for @preventcancer!
#SGDQ2023 from May 28th to June 4th ⏱️ #ThankYouMike 👏 pic.twitter.com/h3lkCmg0J7
January 15, 2023
While most runners don't expect to set new records during the marathon, a whopping four were set this year for the following games: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, PowerWash Simulator, Super Mario Galaxy 2, and Steven Seagal Is: The Final Option (Prototype). Most years have one or two records set, but four is a big deal.
2023 marks the 14th year that the biannual charity marathon has taken place. They have two main events in the winter and summer, but they also hold smaller events throughout the year. One of these is Frost Fatales, an all-women speedrunning event, which will take place from February 26 - March 4, 2023 on Twitch. Since it was founded in 2010, the organization has raised over $43 million for charity.
AGDQ was initially set to be in person but was moved online due to COVID concerns. Their summer event, Summer Games Done Quick, will be held from May 28 - June 4, though it's unclear whether the event will also take place in person.

Due out later this year, you play a deaf hero in search of a cure to a sinister 'howling plague' that's devastated the land around you and turned all its inhabitants into blood-thirsty beasts - and having played its first chapter last week, its combination of tight planning, grid-based shoving and limited ammo a la Into The Breach is very, very moreish indeed. Definitely one to watch for strategy game fans.

In Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, not only can the titular protagonist suffer a variety of gruesome fates if you so much as put a foot wrong, but there's a point where you can soft-lock the entire game by failing to pick up an easily missable single snake scale from a busy crime scene — and you won't even know you did anything wrong for several in-game days. I'm not 100% sure this wasn't an oversight on the part of the developers, but at the same time, that's exactly the sort of shit that Sierra liked to pull.

Cult of the Lamb's adorable cult leader has become iconic in their red fleece, but their wardrobe grows over time. By finishing quests for peripheral characters, like Sozo in Spore Grotto, you will receive a piece of the Holy Talisman. Four pieces will unlock a new fleece for the Lamb to wear on crusades.
The Holy Talismans take time and effort to collect, so it's likely that you will be unlocking them one at a time. Also, some of these side quests can be unthinkable, such as sacrificing sweet Ratau! Deciding which, if any, of the five bonus fleeces to trade your Holy Talisman for is a personal choice, but I ranked them based on their pros and cons to help.

As with those of the FTC and other regulators, their objections are likely to centre on the likelihood of Microsoft saddling Call Of Duty with Xbox or Gamepass exclusivity.

Read on for more details on how to rate the ones you've played and, potentially, influence the ranking below...

It might have taken a while for Nintendo's premier SRPG series to find its feet in the West, but the storming success of 2019's Fire Emblem: Three Houses on Switch proved that Intelligent Systems' turn-based strategy series is now up there with the Marios and the Zeldas in terms of hallowed Nintendo franchises. With so many entries and nary a low point among them, it's about time we invited you, dear readers, to wrangle them into a ranked list ahead of the upcoming launch of the latest game in the series, Fire Emblem Engage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever been in a relationship with somebody who surprised you in all the right ways at the beginning, but eventually frustrated and disappointed you so deeply that it all ended in a messy breakup? Farlanders is my messy breakup.
It's a space colony city builder with a puzzle game mentality - and set on Mars to make things even more enticing. The best part of Farlanders is its story, and while it’s not quite a full-blown commentary on colonialism, it examines what you’re doing and why you’re doing it with a self-awareness that I did not expect at all. That being said, annoying difficulty curves, awkward terraforming, and frustrating progression systems stop this space colony sim from really taking off. A graph charting my enjoyment over time would look like a child’s drawing of a mountain.

Or maybe it was higher-ups forcing releases for profit's sake; who knows? The end result was that we saw a veritable glut of games released this year, and after the Destructoid staff voted on their pick for Game of the Year, we put the vote to you, the readers.

In a time before Splatoon, de Blob was the big name in spreading colourful ink around town. Unlike Nintendo's inky shooter, the series saw you take control of a colour-absorbing ball which would complete various challenges by spreading paint across a monochromatic landscape.
You might remember de Blob on the Wii, its sequel (de Blob 2) on the DS, or the two remastered editions on the Switch, but you won't remember the original's DS release — mainly because it never saw the light of day. At least, that was the case up until recently, when popular gaming YouTuber @RebelTaxi took to Twitter to share an early build of the game that they had been sent (thanks, My Nintendo News).

Players, or at least former players, of Lost Ark left more than 1300 negative reviews of the game on Saturday, and more than 1000 on Sunday. They claimed they’d received bans that appeared on their Steam profile without actually logging into the game recently.

You know, as video game TV shows go. I've yet to sit down and watch it myself, but I'll probably be doing so this evening to see what's what. 
A question I've been pondering in the run-up to The Last Of Us' TV debut, however, is this: if I watch the TV show now, will I really be bothered to actually sit down and play Part 1 when it finally comes to Steam at the beginning of March? 'Cause I sure don't have time (or the inclination) to do both. I think that might be too much The Last Of Us... But what about you, readers? Will you be tuning in, or waiting to play it on PC? Or both! Tell us in the comments below.

The addition of button support now also means that the game can now be played in TV or tabletop mode. In our review for the game, one of our main concerns was the limited gameplay options available to players, but with the addition of this new patch, this is now no longer an issue.

Well, ahead of the game's launch on 24th February, Square Enix has shared some previews of the game's soundtrack over on its Japanese site (via NoisyPixel). And my goodness, if there's one thing we can be sure of, the music sounds like it will be special.
Was there any doubt, with Octopath Traveler composer Yasunori Nishiki returning to the help? Of course not. And from every single trailer we've had so far, the music has sounded magnificent. But Square Enix wants to hammer that home and has shared 42 samples (!!!) of the upcoming soundtrack. That's the first two discs of this behemoth six-disc OST.

We've only just had two more Tera Raid Battle Events announced for Pokémon Scarlet & Violet, but apparently, we need another one! The Pokémon Company has revealed that Drifblim and Mismagius will be the next event coming to the game. (Thanks, Serebii!)
Drifblim will be exclusive to Pokémon Scarlet, while Mismagius will be exclusive to Pokémon Violet. And you'll be able to encounter these two Pokémon more frequently in raids from 20th January through to 22nd January. This event takes place before the new 7-Star raid and the Tandemaus Raids that were announced last week.

One of the most delightful games of 2022 was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge. From the team over at Tribute Games, it was a wonderful return to form for the heroes in a half-shell, capturing the early ‘90s era of great arcade action amidst the current resurgence of the beat’em up genre. The game dropped on all major platforms last year, and earlier this week, it finally made the jump to mobile through Netflix Games. While I’ve already enjoyed Shredder’s Revenge on my Switch, I wanted to see how it played on my Pixel with and without a Bluetooth controller. Let me tell y'all, I am not disappointed.

Every decade or so, something big happens to bring zombies back into our lives. Whether it was the release of George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead in 1978, the publication and subsequent adaptation of The Walking Dead, the hugely popular 'Zombies' mode in the Call of Duty series, or the meteoric rise of The Last of Us, we love a date with the undead.
This fascination with these brain-munching beings has inspired games by the boatload. Yes, there are the two aforementioned series, but the list of great zombie games goes on. The Switch, for the most part, has steered clear of these big titles. There are a lot of zombie games on the console for you to sink your teeth into, but the number of them that we would actually recommend playing? That's a much shorter list.

Additionally, there are improved specs.

In terms of resolution, the game will run at 1080p docked and 720p handheld. In contrast, the PS4 version runs at a consistent 60 FPS, with a resolution of 1080p.

While this news is circulating again now, it seems this upload originally took place a number of months ago (thanks, TheGamer).

Splatoon might be primarily known as a competitive shooter, but since the release of the second game, Nintendo has expanded upon the original concept with its cooperative wave mode Salmon Run. If you do enjoy putting in a shift for Mr. Grizz, you might want to check out the above IGN video.
It's a detailed breakdown of a world-record Salmon Run focused on a group of pro Splatoon 3 players (Brian, Gungee, Marty and Reyko) who were able to gather a whopping 241 golden eggs. What's perhaps even more impressive is the fact it's been done using an online connection - so the team has to factor in latency issues.

Twenty years later - thanks to faster PCs, the Rush Hour expansion, and a huge modding community - SimCity 4 is the best of all SimCity games. If what you care about is simulation, scale, variety, and the beauty of urban sprawl, it's also the best citybuilder.

As of its latest update, there's now a new customisable game mode that lets you make your expeditions even more relaxed - or much harder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Licensing is a killer problem
Last Friday was the 13th, and ironically, it was one of the last Fridays that you'll ever be able to buy Friday the 13th: Killer Puzzle. It's sad to see this young spatial puzzle game, not even old enough to drink, snuffed out so soon.
In all seriousness, Killer Puzzle is as loving a tribute to the slasher franchise as you could ask for. For the most part, it follows the rules of the film series (Jason can just appear behind anyone he sees, is weak against drowning, etc), and features just about every iteration of the hockey-masked horror icon as you could ask for (including his green and purple look from the infamous NES title).
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Ylirqs8To&ab_channel=BlueWizardDigital
So if you want to get this slice of the life (and afterlife) of one of the most loved and feared fictional serial killers in history, you'll have to act fast. Due to an inability to renew the license, this particular Friday the 13th game and all of its DLC are being removed from all available storefronts ( So that's Steam, Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Nintendo eShop, Xbox Store, and Playstation Store) on January 23.
The only encouraging thing about this turn of events is that Killer Puzzle was itself a retooling of an original title called Slayaway Camp that will be available indefinitely. So while this specific game in the horror-puzzle formula subgenre may be sinking into the depths of history forever, there's a chance that it may come back to the dead someday, maybe with a whole new outward-facing look.
Maybe the Killer Klowns are looking for more work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tanks a Lot
For this week's addition to the Arcade Archives, retro-funsters Hamster have gone way back to the early gaming years of Tecmo, with a revisit of the developer's tank-based blaster Senjyo, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to the fledgling arcade market in 1983, Senjyo, (or "Battlefield"), sees players manning the cannon of a hi-tech tank, charged with taking down an attacking force of alien invaders. The player can rotate the tank through a 360-degree landscape, utilizing radar to locate the attackers. Senjyo was highly praised in its day for using parallax scrolling and forced perspective to give the illusion of 3D visuals, though some players were frustrated by the sluggish movement of the tank itself.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Old Classic Retro Gaming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM2HUVMa8vQ&ab_channel=OldClassicRetroGaming
Senjyo would head to western arcades in 1984, arriving just in time for the market crash. Undaunted, developer Tehkan would eventually return with several sizeable hits for the home and arcade market, eventually changes its name to the more localization-friendly "Tecmo". As I'm sure nobody needs reminding, Tecmo would merge with Koei in 2009 to form Koei Tecmo, which is today best known for franchises such as Dead or Alive, Dynasty Warriors, Monster Rancher, and Fatal Frame.
Senjyo is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

All of a sudden, seemingly every developer pivoted to competitive fisticuffs, with seemingly hundreds of Street Fighter-alikes hitting arcade centers — many featuring developers and IPs seemingly plucked out of thin air.
And while a few of these releases would carve out a piece of the pugilistic pie for themselves — such as Mortal Kombat and eventually The King of Fighters, there was a whole wave of titles that fell by the wayside.

I'll start this with a confusing admission: My favourite thing in the world is a trip to an aquarium. I could spend days gazing through the curved glass of a tank, watching sharks glide past me, pressing my hand against the smooth, white underbelly of a stingray, and taking note of the clownfish darting in and out of the swaying mass of a sea anemone. Aquariums are my happy place. They're fascinating, beautiful, entrancing, and for a kid who grew up pretty far away from the ocean, basically magic.
So why do I dislike fish Pokémon so much? It's precisely because they have nothing in common with those actual fish in an aquarium, or in the sea. Let me explain.

Good morning, friends, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? I hope that your year has gotten off to a fine start and that this is a really happy and prosperous weekend for you. My weekend, unfortunately, will be spent with my arch-enemy, Maths. It is January, and that means that the tax office is breathing down my neck even though I paid it last year. How much money do they want? The answer is all of it. Still, this is why the trains run on time, there are fleets of fire engines on our streets, and our beloved, devoted NHS service is fully funded — with all its workers fairly compensated... Hmm...
Anyway, after that grumpy start from yer boy, let's get to matters of all things gaming!

With the Christmas chocolates finally dwindling in number, we think it's fair to say that 2023 is well under way. And as the year kicks off, so too do we see the return of gaming news — nature is healing, people!
This week at Nintendo Life, we have been welcoming in the new year with open arms, looking to the months ahead and talking about some of the upcoming big games. We prepared for some of the titles which are right around the corner as we ranked the best narratives in the Fire Emblem series and asked what is next for Final Fantasy on Switch after the pixel remaster? Then, of course, we looked on to Zelda, pondering which games we should all replay before Tears of the Kingdom comes out.

The pink puff Kirby is still kind of celebrating his 30th birthday and to close the celebrations it seems there'll be a special panel taking place this March at the 2023 Game Developers Conference.
According to the official website, this panel will be a "design session" featuring developers Shinya Kumazaki and Tatsuya Kamiyama. It will focus on Kirby and the Forgotten Land and how it made the leap into the 3D world, along with the new features it adds to the long-running series. This also lines up with the game's first anniversary.

If you've ever wondered what classic game art might look like if it was brought to life, well here's a great example. American animator Parker Simmons has transformed parts of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past SNES manual and other materials into living, breathing animations.
The results are absolutely stunning - with artwork of the Super Nintendo action-adventure from 1991 bursting to life. It's got many Zelda fans on social media requesting an official cartoon in this style, rather than the one we actually got.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is it they say about sunk cost again?
At this point, I don't know where to start with Beyond Good & Evil 2. It holds the record for the game with the most time in development, and has become the poster child for development hell. Seeing as Ubisoft just announced a whole host of game delays and cancellations, I thought for sure the long-awaited sequel would be on that list.
Much to fans' relief, however, Ubisoft has just confirmed that Beyond Good & Evil 2 is still very much alive and well in a conversation with PCGamesN. The game's development is still "underway and the team is hard at work to deliver on its ambitious promise," an unspecified Ubisoft spokesperson disclosed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9VPnI34dPw
Beyond Good & Evil 2 was announced all the way back in 2009, but got its first trailer nearly a decade later at E3 in 2017, as well as a cinematic trailer the following year at the same event. The original is a cult classic that came out in 2003 for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Microsoft Windows, and even if the sequel dropped tomorrow, it would be crazy to think it skipped three whole console generations. If I had to put money on it, I'd bet it'll skip at least for by the time it eventually releases — optimistically assuming that it ever will at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's roll
Katamari Damacy is one of those games that you don't hear about a lot these days, and yet someone everyone seems to have played it at some point in their lives. The premise is simple, but it's so engaging that it'll keep us coming back for more every time. Just when I thought it was impossible to improve on the tried-and-true Katamari formula, a modder came along and proved me wrong in the best way.
Originally spotted by Time Extension, computer scientist and custom controller enthusiast Dr. Tom Tilley created a "super cheap" controller setup to roll his way through the game using some empty roll-on deodorant packaging, some cardboard, a computer mouse, and a soccer ball, or football for the non-Americans. Tilley rigged the setup work with an emulated PS2 version of Katamari Damacy, and the video he posted on YouTube makes me wish I had a version of it myself.
https://youtu.be/PHPJ2wTBJlo
A roller-ball is the way to go with this game, which is evidenced by the fact that Tilley wasn't the first one to build a similar prototype -- back in 2014, a YouTuber by the name of Siage uploaded a video of another prototype for a custom Katamari controller. I think this one might actually be my favorite seeing as it swaps out the soccer ball for one plastered with the faces of Disney princesses.
I can't see a future where mass production for such controllers would make any sense, but I'd love to see some full-scale implementations in the form of some Katamari Damacy arcade machines. I want 2023 to be the year that we bring both arcades and Katamari back into the limelight of public consciousness, and then combine them together to achieve my new life's goal -- playing this game with a roller-ball controller.

That's despite the most recent swing of Ubisoft's game-cancelling scythe, which was brought down on three unannounced games last week due to the company's underperforming sales.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[100% Weird
One of the things I have always loved about beat 'em ups was that, as a genre, they’re a blank canvas. The formula is set, you just have to build the where, why, and how behind it. This lets the developers really go wild when making some of these games. As a child of the arcade heyday, I have fond memories of classic games like Final Fight and X-Men. But one element that always stood out to me was just how batshit crazy some of the boss designs were. 
You could just tell that the developers wanted the biggest, weirdest thing to show up and make the players go “wow”, and it worked. It works so well in fact that decades later I’m here to tell you the top ten weirdest bosses in beat em ups.

For years, if you wanted to play The Division 2, you'd have to go through the Epic Games Store or the Ubisoft Store due to exclusivity contracts. However, it looks like those deals have finally expired, because the sequel to Tom Clancy's online action role-playing game is now available to play through Steam. If you've been wanting to play the title on PC but didn't want to go through either of the Epic or Ubisoft stores for whatever reason, now's your chance to grab it on your platform of choice.
As exciting as it is that The Division 2 is up on Steam there are a few caveats to consider — for one thing, the game doesn't come with any Steam achievements, which can absolutely be a deal breaker for achievement-hunting types. If nothing else, it's a bit of a bummer. Then there's the fact that while you launch the game through the Steam storefront, you still have to go through the Ubisoft Connect launcher, which is another headache in and of itself.
https://twitter.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1613642068043210757
The Division 2 has also been met with mixed reviews on Steam, as many players have encountered bugs and technical issues. A good handful of players have had the game crash on them, which Ubisoft says they are currently looking into. Hopefully they can iron out these issues as the company continues to migrate more of their games to PC, especially with the next title to get this treatment will likely be the behemoth that is Assassin's Creed Valhalla.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Desktop Dungeons is a morish puzzle game from 2010 that channels conventional dungeoning into fiendish headscratching. Every enemy sits still, waiting for you to come and whack it. Whack willy-nilly, though, and they'll kill you in no time - so you have to tactically explore parts of each level to heal, while targeting foes in an order that lets you survive long enough to level up and take on the big bads. 
Desktop Dungeons: Rewind is an upcoming "modern remastering" of the original, with 3D graphics and the ability to rewind time rather than start each level from the very beginning. It's got a demo you can play right now, and it's adding free daily challenges with a sharable leaderboard later this month. I am hyped.

The critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV. Maybe you've heard of it? It's a massive undertaking, stretching across years and expansions, containing huge comeback stories and legions of followers.
It was around this time last year that I first wrote about Final Fantasy XIV. Friends had tried to put me on to it for ages, and I even made a character once before promptly quitting out after seeing all clutter on-screen. But hearing about the sheer fervor, as servers buckled under the weight of new and old users striving to play Endwalker, finally got me to give it an honest try.
I played some Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. And then I journeyed to Ishgard, and Heavensward. Then onto the deep-seated conflicts of Stormblood, the sorrow of Shadowbringe…]]></summary>

It took a while, but the Persona series has finally made the jump to Switch. After stealing our hearts in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (and a spin-off 'sequel' and spin-off remaster found their way onto the console), the main series finally made its way to Nintendo's hybrid console in late 2022 with Persona 5 Royal.
Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden are following this up on 19th January 2023, and ahead of their joint release, we wanted to ask the ultimate question — what is Persona? Well, not really, but with lots of names, Goldens, Royals, and FES' being thrown around, just what on earth are the differences? What versions can we play on Switch? And, if you've only played the spin-offs or Persona 5 Royal, what should you play next?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not available on the NHS
Tonic masters GameFlavor have teamed up with Capcom to produce a limited edition box of drinks stylized after the famous "First Aid Spray" health items from survival horror series Resident Evil. The Resident Evil First Aid Drink Collector's Box is available to pre-order now from the GameFlavor website.
According to the press release, the box contains 10 x 330ml First Aid Spray Cans, each containing a uniquely flavored drink based upon the herby nature of the Resi series. Also included are four "Ink Ribbon" cases, filled with a distinctly blended spice mix, as well as a pseudo spray cap for the can, and a list of cocktail recipes. Each set is housed in a replica "Storage Crate", individually numbered to one of 4,750 available sets.

 
As you might have guessed from its extremely limited nature, the Resident Evil First Aid Drink Collector's Box does not come cheap, and will retail for a princely €199.90, (or roughly $210). Not a typo. At that price, I'm assuming that the drink has the exact same magical restoration properties of its video game counterpart, but that's probably pretty unlikely. Still, if you're an ultra die-hard Resident Evil fan, or you simply like crazily expensive "on trend" drinks — I hear that's a thing for The Kids these days — then you can pre-order your own set right now from the official GameFlavor website.

The Resident Evil First Aid Drink Collector's Box is expected to ship in the third quarter of 2023.

Retro platformers are not hard to come by. I count myself among the group of video game players who welcome efforts from small development teams that play to our nostalgia for an era where playing video games meant tuning to channel 3. Some are fantastic, some are too hard to be enjoyable, but most land somewhere in the middle. Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider won’t go down in history as one of the greats that both embraces the past and modernizes the action, but I would place it closer to the fantastic side of the scale, even if it doesn’…]]></summary>

The Nintendo Switch is almost six years old... Can you believe it?
The console first launched worldwide on March 3rd, 2017 and it's now 20-ruddy-23. Understandably of course, there are whispers and speculation surrounding Nintendo's next piece of major hardware, but really, does the Switch actually feel old yet?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Make no bones about it: Ubisoft's perennially delayed Skull & Bones is still coming. A new developer video proves that, offering a fresh look at some sumptuous seas during a hunt for an Ungwanan renegade. The most interesting part of Skull & Bones is still its tortured history, with a recent sixth delay pushing it even further back from the original 2018 release date - but oh, maybe I do want to be a boat after all. At least for a bit.

Yet it was also tempered fun: a brutal AI Director could easily tip manageable chaos into a fatiguing onslaught of fishy alien minibosses, and I still remember my will to persevere being sapped by connectivity issues and a general lack of weight to the otherwise enticing pew-pew gunplay.


Happily, following a year of tweaks and additions, The Anacrusis is in a much better place. Even if that place is still turtleneck-deep in extraterrestrial viscera. Ahead of the game’s first anniversary, I poked developers Stray Bombay for a chat on how their early access approach is working out, the impact of long-awaited mod tools, and what’s next for this most stylish of space shooters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Yo (Yo)
Damn, it looks like the era of BRIDGET is set to continue — Not only has the Guilty Gear star made her GG Strive debut, appeared in some fun fan projects, AND received her own, real-life Bullet Yo-Yo, but merch maker Spiritale has now revealed a prototype wicked-looking figurine, currently in production.
The prototype captures Brisket in all of her glory, posed exactly as she is in her Guilty Gear Strive splash art. Rocking her big ol' shoes — Bullet Yo-Yo in one hand and haunted companion Roger in the either, our girl looks set and ready to embark upon her next Bridgetquest. The fixed-pose figurine looks very similar in quality and design to Kotobukiya's "Bishoujo" range, though Bridget is also sporting a nicely detailed base as she comes kick-kicking her way into the next battle.
https://twitter.com/Spiritale_shop/status/1613453295808569345?s=20&t=YPDS_v7VvYZruEFEXsxmHg
Unfortunately, Spiratale has not revealed a price nor a release window for the Bridget figurine. For whatever it's worth, Spiratale's typical character figurines tend to stand at a 1/7 scale and usually run around the $200-$300 dollar mark. So the more hardcore fans among you might have to start saving up the pennies. To be clear, this price is pure speculation on my part, merely based on the company's previous releases. We'll be sure to give you a heads-up when Bridget is ready for pre-order.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms. An Xbox port arrives this spring.

Every so often, things pass us by. October in particular was a packed month, full of games like Vampire Survivors, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, A Plague Tale 2, Alan Wake Remastered Switch, Scorn, Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, NHL 23, and No Man's Sky Switch: to name a few (and in this case, I'm being literal, comparatively!).
So it makes sense that Gotham Knights would slip through the cracks, especially when codes were semi-limited for it at the time. It's time for Gotham's crew to face the music.

It's a pretty but largely empty-feeling time, with woefully repetitive mission design and characters I only have a passive interest in. It's good, therefore, to see Assassin's Creed Mirage creative director Stéphane Boudon make more noises about how the next Creed game will be smaller and "more intimate".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It'll run through January 15
A few weeks back, Pokemon Scarlet & Violet players had the opportunity to take down Cinderace in a 7-star Tera Raid (Fighting Tera type) and earn the Pokemon for themselves. Just like the Charizard event, there's a second chance weekend.
That second chance kicks off today (right now actually), and will run through January 15. You have roughly two full days to unlock 7-star raids if you haven't already, then locate and take down the Cinderace. As a reminder you can only get one Cinderace per save file, but you can take the raid on an unlimited amount of times to amass rewards, and you can breed that Cinderace into a Scorbunny.
If you still aren't raid-ready, it's currently unknown if this Cinderace will be distributed again in the future. Right now all we have to go with is wording on the Charizard news post (which Cinderace did not get), which technically only applies to Charizard currently: "Charizard may appear again in other events or be encounterable in different ways in the future."
You still have time if you haven't clean up that postgame path to 7-star raids yet! With a strong team you can get it done fairly quickly.
If you need help, we have numerous resources for the Cinderace event, including:
A full guide on the easiest ways to clear the Cinderace raid
How to find the Cinderace raid
A breakdown of the Cinderace raid rewards and Pokemon stats
A reminder that the event Cinderace is available for breeding

Calling Kandria a platformer feels a little reductive, so there's a need to clarify why it works. You play as an android revived several decades after an apocalypse, by a tiny camp of survivors who inevitably need your help. A lot of this help involves, well, platforming. To the point of having nonsensical areas of pure platforming in between you and a destination or secret area. You'll climb, jump, do the little dash thing that recharges when you touch the ground or pick up a hovering lamp thingy. You'll land on a lot of thorny instakill spikes.


So yeh, lots of the old platforming, but it feels more like an exploration and scavenging game, with a side order of light-light-heavy-dodge combat too. And a plot with varied dialogue options and mysteries about the world and its history. It's immediately and consistently fun, but I'm not sure exactly how to recommend it. Hmm.

This year, believe it or not, sees the Street Fighter franchise celebrate its 35th anniversary. And alongside the anticipated release of Street Fighter 6, the fan community can undoubtedly look forward to a bevy of fantastic fan tributes, designed to acknowledge over three decades of fighting game excellence.
And we're kicking off the year with a doozy of an example, as director Jeremy Mansford, audio engineers White Owl Studio, and musician/narrator Vo Williams have come together to produce a stunning piece of animation celebrating Capcom's iconic series and, more specifically, the legacy of its most notable of World Warriors, Ryu.
https://youtu.be/FVSgnfDc3aI
Titled "Fight Your Rival", the gorgeous, 80-second animated film captures the wandering hero's journey through the franchise, from the early mastery of the martial arts, through his battles with the Four Kings of Shadaloo, the war with his inner demons, powered by the frightening form of the Satsui no Hado. The animation ends with his twilight era, which sees Ryu a wiser, more spiritually content warrior who — despite his advancing years — will never cease pursuing the thrill of the fight. Not until his final breath.
And with a whole new generation of opponents awaiting him, it seems that the fight is far from over.
Street Fighter 6 launches June 2 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Considering Carpenter hasn’t made a film in 13 years it does seem a bit of a wild idea, but then the director is both a horror auteur and video game fan.

Epic Games Store has revealed the next title that it will be offering up gratis for its huge army of users — Available to download from January 19 to all users, it's the unique, narratively driven Epistory: Typing Chronicles.
Developed by Belgian studio Fishing Cactus and released back in 2016, Epistory is the tale of a young girl, who rides a three-tailed fox around a constantly evolving origami world, under attack from an array of paper spiders and other crease-tastic bugs. Epistory: Typing Chronicles is a particularly original title from both an aesthetic and gameplay standpoint. Not only is its delightful paper world incredibly cool and inviting, but the game's story and world unfolds, (quite literally), via the player's typing ability. It's a unique, smartly conceived concept, which you can see in action for yourself in the trailer below.

The player follows on-screen typing prompts in order to control our hero, defeat their enemies, and advance the core story itself. Much like other word-based video games, such as The Typing of the Dead, speed and accuracy will be the tools necessary to progress through the adventure, accessing new areas, while protecting our foxy friend from an increasingly aggressive army of bugs. Epistory is a very novel release, and almost worth the price of admission alone for its beautifully crafted origami universe.
Epistory: Typing Chronicles will be available to download from the Epic Games Store from January 19. Until then, you can still pick up murder mystery freebie First Class Trouble from the EGS dashboard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Writing up our big guide on all the upcoming PC games of 2023, I was introduced to a number of smaller games in development I hadn't heard about before. One of them was Broken Roads, an isometric RPG set in a post-apocalypse Australia. The gorgeous artwork was enough for me to click on the Steam page and read more, and while scrolling through the screenshots something strange caught my eye.
It was a screenshot of a fairly traditional RPG dialogue scene, with a panel at the bottom displaying all the possible dialogue options for the player. But what caught my eye was an unusual radial graphic on the right-hand side of the options. Reading on, I discovered that Broken Roads uses a rather unique Moral Compass, one which plots your overall moral stance towards the world and its people with a golden arc. Different decisions may rotate the arc, expand it, contract it, lengthen it, or shorten it. And in so doing, you'll unlock various traits dotted about the Compass, which only remain in effect for as long as that golden arc covers those traits within the wheel.
I can see a dozen different ways in which this Moral Compass may end up being a bad idea in practice. But I don't care. I adore it. And I'm going to play Broken Roads solely so I can see the consequences of my actions in satisfying radial form.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did they only just hear about it?
In the latest chapter of a story set to run throughout 2023 and beyond, industry giants Google and Nvidia have reportedly expressed concern to the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over the proposed purchase of Activision Blizzard by publisher Microsoft.
According to a new report by Bloomberg, internet developer Google and graphics card company Nvidia have both provided the FTC with testimony in preparation for the latter's upcoming lawsuit, filed against Microsoft in early December 2022. It is reported that the testimony demonstrates concern that the purchase could give Microsoft an unfair advantage in regards to lucrative issues such as gaming subscription services, mobile gaming content, and cloud gaming support.
The supposed complaints from Google and Nvidia would join the previously aired opposition from Sony, which is most likely concerned over the possibility of losing access to Activision's billion-dollar shooter franchise Call of Duty. Should the lawsuit go to trial, which at this point seems incredibly likely, then spokespeople for all three companies could, in theory, be called as witnesses for the FTC's case. And that's a particularly mighty trio of brands to face down, even for Microsoft.
Microsoft needs to find favor of the FTC before its $68.7 billion dollar purchase of Activision Blizzard can go ahead. Even once the lawsuit clears, MS would still need to seek approval from other global regulators, including the European Commission and the UK Market Authority. Furthermore, regardless of the result of the trial, both parties have the option to appeal the judge's decision, seemingly guaranteeing this debacle will run into the tail-end of the year and perhaps even into 2024.

GOG confirmed the closure of Connect to RPS fan site PC Gamer, saying “for a long time nothing really happened there, so we've decided to shut it down”. Fair enough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fork over that extra dollar
HBO has always been one of the pricier streaming services, but with shows like Succession, White Lotus, and the show that arguably kicked off the current golden era of television, The Sopranos, you're basically always guaranteed to get a good bang for your buck. We'll have to see if that holds true after yet another price increase, because the cost of HBO Max has risen yet again.
The change went into effect today, January 12, making the service's former $14.99/month price for the ad-free tier has increased $1 to $15.99. It's the first price hike since the launch of HBO Max back in March of 2020.
https://twitter.com/hbomax/status/1613672303090335746
While it's impossible to know for sure why the company decided to raise the price, there's a chance that they're simply keeping up with the rising costs of inflation, especially after their competitors like Netflix have done the same. Of course, it does seem a bit convenient that this change is happening only days before the premiere of The Last of Us TV adaptation on HBO Max, which will likely be one of the biggest streaming events of the year.
The show has been receiving rave reviews from critics, and as a fan of the series myself, I'll be interested to see how they translate such a beloved game to a live action television format. Here's hoping the price increase is worth it.

Perhaps he meant that only in the sense that, long-term, the game would come to Steam anyway. That's what has happened now. As announced late last year, the open world cover shooter is now available on Steam after a period of Epic and Ubisoft store exclusivity.

Obsidian is in peak form, if you ask me
We're already looking ahead to an amazing year of releases in 2023, but part of me still can't let go of one of my favorite games of last year: Pentiment. Although it was released mid November of 2022, I didn't play it until a month later when we were in the midst of the end of year rush, so I didn't get to give it as much attention as I thought it deserved. So here I am, taking a moment to highlight not only what a great game I think Pentiment is, but also my thoughts on how this game's mere existence, along with its subsequent success, is actually a good thing for the games industry as a whole. Let's get into it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A long-awaited reset
Assassin's Creed is one of those game series that's been around for decades at this point, and in that time, the titles have evolved a lot. From the tightly-focused stories of its early days to its sprawling open world adventures in recent years, there's something in there for everybody. Long time fans of the games, though, have requested that the series take a step back and make a return to its older games, and this time, Ubisoft has taken fans' requests to heart.
In an interview with GamesRadar+, Assassin's Creed creative director Stéphane Boudon confirmed that while the series' sprawling titles like Odyssey and Valhalla are "great games with the promise to live an epic journey in a strong fantasy," they will be pivoting to place a greater focus on "character-driven story" and "the core pillars of the first ACs in a more intimate scale." This is music to my ears as a fan of shorter single player experiences, so I'll be excited to check out a new Assassin's Creed title that presents a more streamlined experience.
https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1568690133666340864
Ubisoft announced that Assassin's Creed: Mirage would be the next entry in the series last September, and soon after revealed that the game would follow Basim from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. The story will follow his coming-of-age in the backdrop of ninth century Baghdad.
As much as I love hearing that Assassin's Creed is going back to its roots, part of me wonders if scaling back was a necessity first. Ubisoft's release lineup has already been hit by another wave of cancellations and delays, so cutting back to a smaller scale for the AC series would help relive some of the pressure on the development team. Whether it was a survival move or a creative on, I think it's a smart move -- players have been asking for more narrative-heavy AC games for years now.

Sony has released a new firmware update for its still-far-too-big-for-its-own-good platform PlayStation 5 — Update 22.02-06.50.00, which is now available to download, paves the way for the arrival of the PS5 premium controller DualSense Edge, which will launch worldwide on January 26.
Officially revealed in October 2022, the DualSense Edge is a component-based version of the standard PS5 controller, which comes packaged with various modules to allow complete customization of the premium unit. DualSense Edge features full programmable buttons, as well as adjustable trigger pressure, custom dead-zone positioning, and save states for different users and games. In addition, the DualSense comes with its own storage case, which doubles as a charging dock.

While an impressive piece of technology, the DualSense Edge comes at a cost, namely $199.99 USD, which equates to a staggering £209.99 GBP or €239.99 EUR, half the cost of the digital edition of the PS5 console itself. Sony has also noted that DualSense Edge will have a "moderately" shorter battery life than the original DualSense, which makes the new controller an exceptionally niche purchase.
Can you put a price on adjustable Haptic Feedback? Sony sure has
The PS5 DualSense Edge launches January 26, exclusively on the PlayStation Direct store. It will be made available at other retailers, online and offline, from February 23. For more details, see our previous report.

It's a big day for Pokémon. The series has finally crossed over the four digit mark for their total number of pocket monsters -- a milestone they celebrated with an nine minute-long video. Another piece of information that shouldn't go overlooked, though, is that they also announced that another patch is on the way in a press release that came alongside the video. The Pokémon Company said that the update will be coming sometime in "late February," although that's as specific as it gets for now.

Scarlet & Violet have been heralded as some of the best entries in the series that we've seen in a few years, but it's undeniable that they got off to a rocky start. Since the release in November, there has already been a 1.1 patch to try to squash some of the games' myriad of bugs -- this new one coming up in February will be 1.2. The only details the press release divulges is that the update "will include bug fixes and add functionality," but also says to "please look forward to more details soon." Some players are hoping to finally see the update integrate Pokémon Go into the mainline series, but as of now, the integration of any new features outside of fixing issues and quality-of-life features is entirely up in the air.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sinister skin returns to Fortnite store
The sinister Plague Doctor skin has returned to the in-game store of Epic Games' juggernaut battle royale title, Fortnite. The purchasable costume has been conspicuous by its absence since January 2020, notably the same timeframe that saw the growing status of the global COVID-19 pandemic.
As noted by Eurogamer, the "Scourge" and "Plague" skins have made frequent appearances in Fortnite's rotational shop since their 2018 debut, available to purchase for 1500 V-Bucks each. But both outfits have been missing for two years, finally making a reappearance in-store earlier this week. The skins depict the frightening, beaked "plague doctors" of the 16th century, who would fill the beaked masks with herbal remedies in an effort to stave off infection as they visited the slums of working-class patients.
While Epic Games never made any open statement as to the reasoning behind the costume's removal, it's not hard to imagine that somebody might have thought it a wise and prudent move to not fill the world's most popular video game with Plague Doctors during a period of global sickness.
The COVID-19 pandemic is, of course, very much still with us, but enough time has passed that many companies and communities are readjusting to a "Post-COVID" status, though it should be clearly noted that the coronavirus and its variants are still infecting hundreds of thousands of people on a daily basis. In total, some 13.2 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered since 2020.

After ruling the home console roost for almost a decade, the mid-nineties were a turning point for Nintendo, and not in a “they finally quit cocaine and got their act together” kind of way. After creating their own worst enemy by screwing Sony in an effort to make a CD expansion for the Super Nintendo, they were struggling with getting their own next-generation console to the market. A lot of other companies were touting their fancy 32-bit monstrosities, and Nintendo needed something to convince people that they were still on the cutting edge. Otherwise, they might turn to Phillips, Atari, or 3DO to satiate their need for extra bits.
So, they turned to the inventor of the Game Boy, Gunpei Yokoi, had him put a bow around that virtual reality thing he was tinkerin…]]></summary>

I liked time-travelling between Dracula's abode and ancient greece, chopping a variety of killer goblins that squawked, "NICE TO MEET YOU!", in varying octaves.
While another FPS of the "micro" variety would be grand, I'd love a "microracer". Much in the same vein as my beloved Screamer, I'm desperate for a – linear or otherwise – arcade racer whose only concern is to burn rubber through all manner of world stages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linda Tiger's career in gaming started two decades ago, in a test house in Glasgow. “I started in QA back in 2002. I worked on functionality and localisation testing. Eventually, I became a lead and then a QA manager at a studio,” she tells me, as we talk at India Game Developers Conference in Hyderabad, India. Now, Tiger is at Paradox Development Studio as the studio manager of Studio Black, and the former lead producer for Crusader Kings 3. She even stood in front of a suit of armor to drop the game's first tease.


 An RPG-esque lifestyle system and neat backstab choices that deal with information round out Crusader Kings 3's host of improvements over its excellent predecessor. A court-themed expansion and a revamp of the game’s culture system after launch are a testament to Paradox’s resolve to deliver a refined plotting experience. Holy wars and illicit affairs go hand in hand in the world of Crusader Kings and the third iteration is no different. Weaving together systems to consistently deliver emergent gameplay is no simple feat, and it turns out that production also covers all manner of small but essential, and practical things. As the lead producer on a game as complex as Crusader Kings 3, Tiger had her work cut out for her.

This new trailer provides yet another beautiful glimpse into the painterly world of Season while providing new details about what our protagonist is doing: archiving the end of the Earth and the final people still living on it. She strives to capture their final moments in her journal and with her camera, aiming to learn why they're still around and ultimately, what kept them going. It sounds like quite the emotional journey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Motive Studio and publisher EA have released a new story trailer for its upcoming remake of Dead Space, and the game continues to look terrifying and beautiful. 
Due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC later this month on January 27, this might be one of our last looks at the remake before it's in the hands of players. Fortunately, this new trailer is nearly two minutes of cinematics and gameplay from the remake focused on the story of Dead Space. As expected, this remake isn't changing much at all, utilizing the same story from the original 2008 release with updated visuals and audio (plus some new voice lines for protagonist Isaac Clarke). 
Check out the new Dead Space Remake "Humanity Ends Here" trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Dead Space Remake continues to look great and we can't wait to play it in just a few weeks. 
For more about the game, check out this extended Dead Space Remake gameplay look and then read why it's one of Game Informer's 25 most anticipated games of 2023. Check out Game Informer's big list of upcoming video game remakes after that.

Marvel Snap has been a resounding success since its release, allowing players to compete against other real-world players with a variety of cards, random locations, and more. Despite the positive reception, one thing players have been asking for has been missing: the ability to play against your friends. Developer Second Dinner announced in November that it was working on an update to allow friends to battle each other and now, it has announced that this update is expected at the end of the month. 
More specifically, the update is expected in a January 31 update, but Second Dinner says if it runs "into any last minutes issues, we may choose to delay for a little longer t…]]></summary>

Indeed, the debate over whether the little reward messages add anything to games or not has been reignited today on Twitter by developers, with Ubisoft Massive's lead gameplay designer Fredrik Thylander saying they've been actively "bad for gaming". So we thought we'd put the question to you, readers. Do you agree and think achievements have been a blight on the industry, or do you think they're actually good way of getting more out of a game?

That’s looking less likely now that the US Federal Trade Commission have published a schedule that sets dates for final hearings to decide on the merger, and they're going to begin on August 2nd. As this is just the kick off for hearings about the case, it’s likely that any FTC decision on whether the $68.7 billion (£56 billion) deal can go ahead will take some time to emerge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Space is fine, but it could do with more disco. The Wild Gentlemen agree, so they're making RetroSpace, a colourful yet horror-filled immersive sim set on a city-sized, time-hopping spaceship from the 60's. It's got creepy bug men, creepier flower ladies, and drugs that can turn you into "a tentacle-armed, mind-controlling, shadow-lurking mutant".  
The Wild Gentlemen are the developers behind noir detective game Chicken Police, making this a pleasing pivot from grizzled chickens to grizzly chic ions.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/01/11/final-fantasy-16-producer-naoki-yoshida-isnt-sure-why-people-are-talking-about-a-pc"/>
        <updated>2023-01-11T13:42:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI is due out June 22 exclusively on PlayStation 5, but some fans believe a PC version of the game could release as soon as six months after its console debut. However, FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida isn't sure why. 
During a recent Final Fantasy XIV stream, Yoshida, who is a director on that game, was asked about rumors surrounding a PC version of FF16, and he responded, "I don't know where the notion of a PC version releasing six months after the game is out came from as none of us have ever said that," according to a translator, as reported by Eurogamer. He followed it up with two instances urging fans to buy the PS5 version. 
According to a translation by Siliconera, Yoshida also said, "There's been talk that the PC version will come out, but no one on the team has said anything about the PC version. I wonder why people assume the PC version will arrive six months after [the PS5 version], so just go ahead and buy a PS5." 
The talk of a PC version of the game stems from a promotional PlayStation 5 video released last year that says in small print that FF16 will be a "PS5 exclusive for six months." Some extrapolated from this small print that a PC release of the game will come after that six months of exclusivity is up, but if Yoshida's recent comments are any indication, the team has nothing to say in regards to a PC version. 
Final Fantasy XVI hits PlayStation 5 on June 22. While waiting for more information, watch this "Ambition" trailer that reveals more about Valisthea's kingdoms, dominants, and eikons, and then check out our interview with Yoshida about the game's boss fights.

Case in point: Goldhawk Interactive's long-awaited Xenonauts 2 has just been confirmed to be heading to Steam early access later this year. Huzzah! The original Xenonauts was an excellent homage to the hyphenated school of X-COMs / UFO: Enemy Unknowns of old, so I'm feeling pretty pumped to find out how its sequel builds on its classic, squad-based tactics.

Every breathtaking thing down there, from jellyfish to giant squids to killer whales, either wants to kill you (see killer whales) or is so frigidly indifferent to human existence that it might as well want you dead. After all, you might be able to scare off a predator, but there’s no negotiating with an ocean current.
Aquatico promises city-building enthusiasts a deep dive into this nearly untapped environ (nearly untapped, I’ll get into that later) but while this game delivers on the ocean’s beauty, it’s disappointingly light on peril.

"Nobody said a word about a PC version release," said Yoshi P, the producer on both FFXIV and FFXVI. "Why is it like a PC version is releasing 6 months later? Don't worry about that, buy a PS5!" he said, laughing.

We've been working under the assumption that Final Fantasy 16 would come to PC after a period of PlayStation 5 exclusivity, but in fairness, that's because that's what the Final Fantasy 16 trailers have said would happen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As anyone who’s played Bethesda’s fantasy RPG might tell you, it can get lonely being the only Dragonborn in Skyrim. How wonderful, then, that one modder has bestowed upon the denizens of Tamriel’s chillest, chilliest province the ability to use their very own Dragon Shouts. Now any speaking NPC in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim can let rip with a big old Fus Ro Dah and fire you straight into the sky, thanks to the Everyone Is The Dragonborn mod. Truly, egalitarianism in action.

Too many mods got waylaid in Planet Half-Life screenshot roundup hell by a desire to make everything expansive and professional-grade. So I'm delighted by a mod for 2017's Star Wars Battlefront 2 which knows its core: it is funny to see dinosaurs do things that dinosaurs shouldn't be doing. So the JurassicFront replaces character models with dinosaurs, and away you go, shooting dinos around Naboo and the Death Star. That's the joke.

First revealed back in 2014, Dead Island 2 was in development at Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager, with Dead Island developer Techland having parted ways with the property to work on Dying Light. Publisher Deep Silver handed over development of the game to LittleBigPlanet 3 developer Sumo Digital in 2016, and then, in 2019, the company announced that Homefront: The Revolution developer Dambuster Studios would be developing Dead Island 2. It's now 2023 and Dambuster's Dead Island 2 is due out in April, finally.

The next 12 months is set to be a banner year for interstellar adventuring, and kicking us off in just under four weeks time on February 2nd is KeokeN Interactive's Deliver Us Mars. As I found out last year, Deliver Us Mars looks like it's going to be quite the step up from its prequel, Deliver Us The Moon, both in terms of its cerebral, pulse-racing puzzle-solving, and its shift from a silent, first-person protagonist to fully-voiced, third-person heroine, Kathy Johanson - a fact that game director and co-founder Koen Deetman tells me has been long in the making. 
"You have to bear in mind that Deliver Us The Moon was our debut into the games industry," he tells me. "We’d envisioned multiple ways to make this the greatest game of all time, but to some extent you are bound by reality and what you can make within a budget and timeline, so some of these decisions were made out of necessity. That’s why the narrative and its scale has significantly risen with Deliver Us Mars – we’ve had the opportunity to give that side of the game a lot of more of our time and attention."

Unfortunately, while superhero movies have improved dramatically over the last decade, superheroes haven’t been as powerful in the realm of video games. In fact, nearly 40 years after the first superhero video game, many developers still struggle to create worthwhile experiences using some of the biggest names in entertainment today.
While not all superhero games are monumental duds like Superman on Nintendo 64, many tend to deliver middling, forgettable experiences. However, a select few that defy the stereotype to become superb titles we still look back on fondly as not only great superhero games, but terrific video games in their own rights.

This seems to be exclusive to Valve’s storefront, as the Epic Games Store isn’t listing the offer on their pre-order page for the Dead Space remake. Oh, and even though Dead Space 2’s been available for more than a decade you’ll have to wait until the Dead Space remake goes live to play your complimentary copy.

Unlike the standard PS5 DualSense controller, however, Project Leonardo won’t be compatible with the PC when it eventually launches.


In a response to tech site Digital Trends, Sony Interactive Entertainment confirmed that the kit – which allows for extensive customisation of button layouts and joystick positioning – will be built exclusivly for the PS5, with no native support for the PC or older consoles like the PS4.

That suit alleged that CDPR had "made materially false or misleading statements" regarding the game, particularly as related to the condition of its console release, and sought damages.

Now a proposed settlement has been approved by a federal judge in California's Central District. The settlement reached will see CDPR pay out $1.85 million USD (around £1.52m GBP), or roughly $0.49 per eligible share.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't expect The Last of Us HBO show to extend beyond the story of the two games in the series. That's because The Last of Us game director Neil Druckmann says there are no plans for stories beyond the games in this show.
This news comes by way of a new interview with Druckmann from The Hollywood Reporter, as reported by GameSpot. Here's what Druckmann told THR specifically: "We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games. We won't run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since The Last of Us Part: II doesn't end on a cliffhanger." 


Druckmann and TV series writer Craig Mazin have mentioned that a second season of this show might cover the events of The Last of Us Part II (personally, I think The Last of Us Part II could cover two seasons of television). Despite the duo not wanting the show to go beyond the games, there might be a way for the show to cover more ground after the events of The Last of Us Part II. If Naughty Dog were to develop a theoretical The Last of Us Part III, it wouldn't be surprising if the HBO show covered that down the road. Chances seem pretty good considering Druckmann told THR that there is "more story to tell" in the world of The Last of Us games. 
Mazin also touched on his desire not to extend the show beyond the games in the THR interview, as noted by GameSpot, stating that he doesn't "have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show." 
"When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can't help but get kind of...stupid," he continued. "Endings mean everything to me." 
For more about The Last of Us on HBO, read our interview with Joel actor Pedro Pascal and Druckmann about the changes made for this TV show. Check out this new piece of concept art from The Last of Us multiplayer game that Naughty Dog is currently developing after that.

But perhaps more than any property that has moved from interactive medium to passive television, The Last of Us seems most suited to make the transition. Joel and Ellie’s story is an emotional and cinematic one that does not rely on player choice.
Ahead of the show’s premiere we spoke with some of the actors about the adaptation, as well as Neil Druckmann, co-creator of The Last of Us, who was heavily involved in writing the show and directed a few episodes.
Druckmann is no stranger to directing actors, even if the recording process of a TV show is different from how it works in a video game. “There is a certain luxury we have in video games that when we capture a performance, we have eve…]]></summary>

Players control Kai, a lone warrior battling an evil robotic army in a post-apocalyptic world. This side-scrolling action title boasts plenty of satisfying action thanks to Kai’s fun melee combat, nimble platforming abilities, and his signature grappling hook, which he uses to traverse levels as well as yank and toss enemies. Sporting great 16-bit art and a strong soundtrack, Gravity Circuit is worth keeping an eye on for fans of classic throwbacks. 
Join editors Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart as they explore Gravity Circuit’s free Steam demo and discuss why it may be one of the year’s most exciting indie gems.

Many JRPGs have slow openings, taking their time to establish the story and familiarize the player with the mechanics before letting them loose into the world. I figured that was the case after playing an hour of Dragon Quest Treasures, so I said to myself, “It’ll get good soon!” I said it again two hours in, three hours in, and five hours in, until eventually, I was forced to accept that this was as good as the game would get. Dragon Quest Treasures is never short on charm or style, but simple, sub-par combat and loot-hunting mechanics had me scraping the bo…]]></summary>

In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
Episode 1 - The Harry Mason Shuffle

Episode 3 - Bible.

Episode 5 - Map Daddy
Watch on Twitch!
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony released a sneak peek of its upcoming Gran Turismo movie yesterday evening during its CES 2023 press conference, and as expected, it features a lot of fast vehicles. 
Starring David Harbour (Stranger Things), Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lord of the Rings), and David Barnet (Never Have I Ever), and directed by Neil Blomkamp (District 9, Elysium, Chappie), Gran Turismo is based on a true story. That story is about the GT Academy contest, which was a real contest held between 2008 and 2016 by Sony and Nissan. Winners were given entrance into Nissan's Driver Development Program, as noted by Video Games Chronicle. The film appears to be telling the tale of someone who won entrance into this program and then went on to become a real success in the racing world. 
Check out the Gran Turismo sneak peek for yourself below: 


As you can see, this sneak peek is a mix of what appears to be movie footage and behind-the-scenes footage, with stars like Harbour, Barnet, and Bloom talking about their excitement for the film. 
Gran Turismo hits theaters later this year on August 11. 
Alongside this sneak peek, Sony also revealed that Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the long-running series released last year, will be getting an update that makes the game playable on its upcoming PSVR2 platform. 
While waiting to learn more about this Gran Turismo movie, read about Project Leonardo, a new customizable accessibility controller kit PlayStation unveiled yesterday and then read about how the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 30 million units sold.

I had always observed the Fire Emblem series from a distance, worried its strategy gameplay wouldn’t be for me or stressed determining where best to start and how to play through the franchise’s various entries. Fire Emblem Three Houses was the first I gave a good try and 80-plus hours later, it’s one of my favorite games on Switch and turned me into a Fire Emblem fan. Since its reveal, I’ve looked at Fire Emblem Engage as a test bed: am I actually a Fire Emblem fan, or did I just really like Three Houses and its engaging Hogwarts-like school mechanics? If the 10 hours I’ve put into Engage so far are any indication, I’m happy to say it’s the former.

This news comes by way of the company's recent CES 2023 appearance, where PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan revealed these numbers alongside words that seem to indicate the PS5 shortage might be over, or at least coming to an end soon. PlayStation also touched on its upcoming PSVR2 release and accompanying 30-plus game lineup, and pulled back the curtains on its new customizable accessibility controller kit, Project Leonardo. 
As you can see, it seems Ryan and PlayStation are confident in the supply of PS5 consoles around the world. If you're still on the lookout for one, it seems now is the time to start searching retail stores again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us turns 10 years old in June, and Naughty Dog plans to celebrate the milestone with an array of special announcements along the way. One of those updates involves a closer look at the upcoming standalone multiplayer title.
In a blog post, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann reflects on The Last of Us’ legacy as well as the franchise’s future. In addition to the HBO adaptation premiering on January 15 and the PC port of The Last of Us Part 1 hitting in March, Druckmann states fans will learn more about the long-awaited multiplayer experience that serves as a follow-up to the original game’s Factions mode. Druckmann writes,
“We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game. With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”
Naughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. 
Though we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we'll have to wait and see over the coming months. Until then, be sure to check out this feature on how The Last of Us Part 1 proves there's no such thing as a faithful remake.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wizards of the Coast, the company behind Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering, has reportedly canceled five unannounced games alongside layoffs affecting "fewer than 15 people," according to a new Bloomberg report. 
The people that will lose their jobs will be given a chance to apply for new roles within WotC, but this apparent business restructuring will affect others outside of the company as well. Bloomberg reports that this reorganization will hit Otherside Entertainment and Hidden Path Entertainment, both working on games for WotC, hard. News of this change follows the release of Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance's release last year, which didn't fare too well with critics and players, amidst Larian Studios' continued development on Baldur's Gate 3 (which does not seem to be affected by this reorganization despite WotC serving as the game's publisher). 
These two games, in part, represented WotC's bigger forray into the video game space as Bloomberg reports that the company had signed contracts with several studios to make games. WotC also "built at least six of its own game studios," according to the publication. 
One project in the works that is now canceled went under the codename "Jabberwocky," according to Bloomberg, and two more externally developed games early in development are no longer moving forward as well. These cancelations and layoffs comes as parent company Hasbro's shares fell 40% last year. 
Wotc told IGN that it remains "committed to using digital games as a cornerstone of our strategy for bringing our games to players around the world," adding that it has "made some changes to our long-term portfolio to focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing our existing brands and those which show promise in expanding or engaging our audience in new ways."

Roughly 300 QA workers at ZeniMax voted to indicate they wish to join this union, equating to a supermajority vote, and Microsoft has opted to recognize it. This lines up with what Microsoft said last month, where it announced that if these workers vote to unionize, it would voluntarily recognize the union.

With season 2 of Invincible set to premiere on Amazon Prime sometime this year, Fall Guys is whetting fans’ appetite with skins for Mark, Omni-Man, and Atom Eve. The outfits hit the in-game store on January 5, and that hopefully means a release date announcement for the series won't be too far behind.

Fall Guys enjoyed a bit of a renaissance in 2022. In addition to its usual deluge of seasonal content updates, it went free-to-play in May and launched on Xbox and Switch, gaining a larger player base of contestants and renewed interest in general. We look forward to seeing what 2023 brings for the title, but this is a pretty good start.

        <updated>2023-01-03T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polish developer The Astronauts have revealed a new trailer for their upcoming rogue-lite shooter Witchfire. In addition to showing off some new gameplay clips, it announces that the game will use NVIDIA DLSS3 technology, which a press release says will "massively boost performance." You can watch the trailer below.


Announced by NVIDIA last September, DLSS 3 can boost a game's performance by a significant margin. One demo on NVIDIA's site shows two instances of Cyberpunk 2077 running at 96 FPS with ray tracing still enabled. "DLSS 3 allows the seemingly impossible, high framerate without compromising the visuals," Adrian Chmielarz, creative director and co-founder of The Astronauts says in a press release. "A no brainer for a game like Witchfire, which is both action and beauty."
Witchfire is a dark fantasy first-person shooter from the creators of Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Set in an alternate reality, players are caught in the middle of a war between witches and the Church, and must use weapons and powers from Vatican sorcerers to defeat their enemies. 
The game is set to enter Early Access in the Epic Games Store sometime later this year, though that wasn't always the case. It was delayed last October because the team decided to overhaul the world's design and make it more open. This trailer is a good indication that the studio is still hard at work, though; here's hoping that "early 2023" ends up being as soon as possible.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New year, new content: Cult of the Lamb is getting a "major content update" sometime in 2023. According to a Twitter thread posted to the official Cult of the Lamb account, this update will introduce features many players have requested, including accessibility improvements, quality-of-life features, new difficulty options, and more depth.
This Major Content Update will release in 2023 and be FREE to all players!
pic.twitter.com/FWFW7sC7F0
December 30, 2022
The biggest change they showcase in this thread is the introduction of heavy attacks, which can be activated by holding down the attack button. These are more than slow swings that do more damage; in Cult of the Lamb, every heavy attack has a unique effect. For example, the sword's heavy attack smashes the ground, doing an explosion of damage that harms any enemy caught in its range. Meanwhile, the dagger creates a line of knives that fall from the sky, and the axe can be thrown around like a boomerang. This is just the tip of the iceberg; developer Massive Monster says it's "just one small tidbit" of what's still to come.
The update should come soon, but not that soon. The last tweet of the thread clarifies that the developers are currently working on a patch to fix some console bugs and that the major update won't be released until after that. Their release window also isn't any more specific than "2023," so it could come out any time this year.
If you're interested in learning more about the game, you can check out our review.

        <updated>2023-01-03T15:24:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IO Interactive has announced that Hitman 3 will become Hitman World of Assassination later this month and will include all levels from Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 in it for free. 
More specifically, this big update for the Hitman trilogy arrives on January 26 and includes two major changes: 
"Hitman 3 will become 'Hitman World of Assassination,' which will also include access to Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 through our existing Access Pass system. Current Hitman 3 owners will get a free upgrade to Hitman World of Assassination on all platforms."
"We're drastically simplifying the purchase experience for new players. Hitman World of Assassination will be the single experience option to start playing." 


This update makes it so that all Hitman 3 owners will have the same base content ownership, and it attempts to eliminate confusion over which edition to buy to obtain certain levels by making it so that there is only one purchase option. The other DLC will apparently still be available for purchase, but owning all the IO Interactive Hitman trilogy levels will be easier than ever now. 
Hitman World of Assassination will cost $70, and it includes Hitman 3, the Hitman 1 Game of the Year Access Pass, and the Hitman 2 Standard Access Pass. You can also purchase the Hitman World of Assassination Deluxe Pack for $30 to get the Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack, the Hitman 3 Seven Deadly Sins Collection, and the Hitman 2 Expansion Access Pass. 
"Those are the only two products that new players need to consider when buying any Hitman game digitially as of January 26, 2023," IO writes in a blog post. "The changes have also been made with the Freelancer game mode in mind, where being able to easily access all locations from across the World of Assassination is parmount to maximizing your enjoyment." 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Hitman 3 review and then read about the new Hitman 3 Freelancer mode.

This news comes by way of a new Kickstarter update from developer Nightdive Studios, which states the team has picked "a few last things to share before our quickly approaching launch window of March 2023." as reported by Video Games Chronicle. This remake, which is set to hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC has had a 2023 release year attached to it for a minute now, but this new Kickstarter update points attention to the game's Steam page, which now features a "March 2023" release window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Starbreeze Studios and publisher Koch Media have released a new teaser trailer that calls 2023 "the year of PayDay 3." Presumably, this means the co-op shooter is still on track to release sometime this year. 
Koch gave PayDay 3 a 2023 release window way back in March of 2021, detailing the game's new publishing deal alongside news that there is at least 18 months of post-launch support planned for the title. Later that year, in June, Koch released a new piece of concept art, citing that PayDay 3 will feature a "fully-fledged social heist universe" set within a Hollywood-like setting. That was the last we saw of PayDay 3 until yesterday, when IGN revealed the "official reveal trailer" for the game, although considering how little is shown in it, it's less of a reveal and more of a teaser. 
Check out this new PayDay 3 trailer below: 


As you can see, there's not much to this trailer other than it calling 2023 "the year of PayDay 3." Here's hoping that holds true.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield, the new and upcoming sci-fi RPG from Skyrim makers Bethesda Softworks, was originally due out in November of 2022, but it was delayed to the first half of 2023 last May. Starfield was then a big part of an Xbox showcase last summer and during that showcase, Microsoft revealed that every game shown would be coming in the first half of 2023. 
Now, a new Bethesda support page for the game has reconfirmed this "first half of 2023" window, as spotted by Klobrille on Twitter.
"Starfield arrives exclusively on Xbox Series X/S and PC in the first half of 2023," the support page reads.
This isn't the biggest surprise; Xbox has discussed this release window for Starfield on two occasions before this support page, but it seems the company is really dedicated to getting it out in the coming months. 
While waiting for an official release date, read about why Bethesda's Starfield delay is key to its new-gen success and then check out this story about how your Starfield character will not have a voice. Read about how Starfield's ambitious scale might be worrisome after that and then read about how Xbox Series X/S first-party games will cost $70 starting this year.

By graduation, I’d worked as a writer/narrative designer on prototypes, vertical slices, documentation – you name it. And after many adjustments, my thesis even won a highly competitive grant to assist post-grad development! Short deadlines and secondary assignments led to high-stress periods, albeit in a controlled, academic environment, but the lessons about collaboration and creativity were invaluable.
It’s an ordinary school night, and I’m in a video call with my friend Jude. I watch them casually scroll through graffiti-adjacent concept art and brief clips of a passion project called Ponch: Cyberspace Investigator. They give me a rundown of the game’s mechanics, inspirations, and vibe, which includes phrases like “platformer,” “Ace Attorney-inspired dialogue puzzles,” “detective work,” and “hack the internet.” Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Island 2 was announced just a few years after the release of the first Dead Island and a little over a year after Dead Island Riptide – the forgettable and repetitive sequel that did, at least, continue the story of the first game’s survivors. Publisher Deep Silver released some spinoffs after Riptide, like Escape Dead Island, Dead Island: Epidemic, and the 16-bit beat ‘em up Dead Island Retro Revenge, but a full-scale, numbered sequel hasn’t yet happened, despite being announced nearly a decade ago. 
The first iteration of Dead Island 2 was helmed by Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager, as Dead Island developer Techland had parted ways with the property and worked on Dying Light. Deep Silver then handed over development of the game to LittleBigPlanet 3 developer Sumo Digital in 2016, …]]></summary>

Until you look around, then, all of a sudden, you can see through time.
I’m standing in the Shibuya ward of Tokyo, Japan, which, if it’s famous for anything, is its crosswalk, Shibuya Crossing, a massive scramble intersection allowing foot traffic to cross in all directions. For lack of a better analogy, you could call it Japan’s Times Square. You’ve seen it in everything about modern Japan ever. Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Images of what appears to be a special The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED model have leaked online, but it's currently unclear if this is a real console or a believable fake. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that the images of this console appeared on the Famiiboard forum last night from user Kysen. The user didn't provide many details about the potential special edition Switch, but as you can see in the images below, the photos are quite believable. There are pictures of the console, the packaging, the Joy-Con, and more.
Check out the possible leaked images of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED special edition for yourself below:

As you can see, it appears that this model of the Switch is real. However, elaborate and well-done fakes have been done before so there's no telling if this is actually real until we learn more information. It wouldn't be the most surprising thing ever, considering Nintendo tends to release special edition OLED models for big releases like this year's Splatoon 3 and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. 
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom hits Switch on May 12 so it might be a while before we learn if this special edition OLED model is real. In the meantime, check out our list of the biggest 2022 games delayed to 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metal Gear Solid creator and Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima and Metal Gear Solid publisher Konami parted ways with each other back in 2015 and since then, there hasn't been a mainline entry in the famed MGS series (although there was the not-so-great Metal Gear Survive in 2018). 
While there's no reason to believe Kojima and Konami are teaming up again anytime soon, it seems the latter might be preparing for some kind of return to MGS. Longtime MGS producer Noriaki Okamura wrote in a recent issue of Famitsu that "2023 will be a year of many announcements," as reported by Gematsu. 
In this special end-of-the-year issue of Famitsu, multiple Japanese developers and producers wrote quick teases about what 2023 might hold for them. It's here where Okamura teased that 2023 will be a year of announcements for Konami Digital Entertainment. More specifically, he said "Other than [the educational edition of Momotaro Dentetsu announced last year], 2023 will be a year of many announcements," and that his keyword for 2023 is "long-awaited," as noted by Gematsu. 
Now, this could just be his way of saying that Konami, as a whole, will make some announcements and that maybe some of them will be long-awaited by fans. However, given that it's Okamura – a longtime MGS producer – saying this, there's reason to believe that maybe he's teasing a return to the MGS series. Perhaps we're getting a remake of one of the games, or maybe a new mainline entry. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of the Metal Gear Solid series.

Arc Raiders
Arc Raiders was set to be the debut title from Embark Studios, a team of ex-DICE talent led by former EA head Patrick Söderlund. The co-op shooter about fighting off robots from space made a splash during last year's Game Awards. In a surprising twist, however, Embark announced months later it was delaying Arc Raiders to next year to focus on launching another shooter pro…]]></summary>
