It's been a productive Alpha for Smite 2 which in that time has grown its arsenal of playable gods from 14 to an impressive 45. The number of game modes in the MOBA has also grown from just one to six, with a new mode called Joust launching alongside the Open Beta release.


During the Alpha, Smite 2 has also received a plethora of improvements and enhancements to the core game to really flesh out what Titan Forge Games and Hi-Rez Studios had envisioned for the sequel for the popular MOBA.

While it's a relatively simple clicker game, seeing various popular stimuli bounce around your page is still oddly satisfying.


Can you win Stimulation Clicker, though? Is that even the ultimate goal of the game? Surprisingly, yes, you can win it. Although it'll take a little while without speedrunning strategies or autoclickers, you can still reach the end and achieve ultimate relaxation if you dedicate enough time to unlocking random stimuli.

How to win Stimulation Clicker


Yes, it is possible to win Stimulation Clicker and reach an end credits scene. You do this by buying every upgrade and raising your stimulation. Over time, you'll unlock various features, from rain sounds to Mukbang videos and popcorn popping everywhere. 


However, this isn't something you'll accomplish in a few minutes unless you're speedrunning the game or using autoclickers. You need millions of stimulation to reach the end, all the while dealing with stimulating videos and images across your screen. Imagine a few dozen DVD logos bouncing around your screen rapidly as just one of many distractions you'll find here.


It's all worth it, though, once you buy the final upgrade. I won't spoil exactly what you'll see, but let's just say you'll feel relaxed once you reach it. The credits will roll once you reach this ending, showing that you've completed the game and are ready to try again or tell everyone you won Neal.fun's latest game.

These guns are practically designed for fast-paced gameplay, always keeping you on the move and offering much better handling through their light build.

After spending quite a while leveling up camos, it was clear to see which SMGs stood above the rest. However, there were a couple of letdowns, specifically with the Saug and Tanto .22.

The US Department of Defense has officially added Chinese megacorp Tencent to the federal register of companies deemed to have ties to the Chinese military (thanks, Bloomberg).
The addition to the list does not come with any specific sanctions for Tencent, though it may affect the company's ability to do business in the United States in the future, with US companies being discouraged from dealing with any of those mentioned on the 'blacklist'.

Their wholly owned subsidiaries including League Of Legends developers Riot Games, Path Of Exile developers Grinding Gear Games, and UK outfit Sumo Group. They own shares in everything from Epic Games through Ubisoft to Silent Hill 2 rebooters Bloober Team. Are you a game developer? Odds are that at least one percent of your body belongs to Tencent. Maybe one of your toes.
And now it turns out that Tencent are some kind of military operator, as well. Or at least, that's what the US Department of Defence would have us believe: they've just somewhat randomly added the firm to an infamous list of Chinese military companies, together with lithium-ion battery maker CATL. This potentially makes it difficult for Tencent to do business in the States, but Tencent say that it's all based on a "misunderstanding".

That's a problem. Sometimes, when a classic is too classical, it can become a bit of a headache. Revisiting a really beloved game can become a chore when you've seen its best ideas executed better by games that came later.


Not so with Metroid. Nearly every 2D Metroid game is still a great time, even when placed next to the wave of wonderful indie Metroidvanias we've seen recently. Unfortunately, "nearly" is the operative word in that sentence. There are definitely downright bad 2D Metroid games, just as there are great ones. So allow me to walk you through every 2D Metroid game, from the clunky to the clever.

Weirdly, the name has been tweaked in the smallest possible way, and the title has come to Steam as ‘That’s Not Your Neighbor,’ but it’s still very much the same game that was previously only available as a direct download from the creator Nacho’s itch.io page. Sadly, it seems that the itch.io page no longer works, so if you want to play, you’ll need to get the game through Steam instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's hard to concentrate on the future of the Like a Dragon series when we're already staring down the barrel of Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. With the side story setting sail for launch next month, now is the perfect time for a new Like a Dragon Direct presentation.


That certainly sounds like it'll be the main focus of the next video from SEGA and the folks at Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio. The Like a Dragon Direct is set to start streaming via YouTube and Twitch on January 9 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time. 




According to the description, the video will "reveal various updates and first-looks at new features" for Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. Considering how much there typically is to do in one of these games — even the spinoffs — the results could end up being fairly exhaustive. A Famitsu interview with Ryu Ga Gotoku boss Masayoshi Yokoyama recently revealed that Pirate Yakuza will be even longer than Like a Dragon: The Man Who Erased His Name. 


While this spinoff is enough to fill out a full presentation and then some, we'll have to watch and see if the team has any surprises in store. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is already staying plenty busy beyond the main Like a Dragon series, and The Game Awards 2024 saw both a new Virtua Fighter and the currently enigmatic Project Century announced. The latter is a period piece set in 1915, and the former is, well, Virtua Fighter.


In the meantime, we can focus on Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, which heads for ridiculously choppy waters on February 21.

Since it's so far from everything else, your best bet is to drop from the Battle Bus directly to this spot before searching the factory building for the portraits.

Upon landing in Flush Factory, you may notice small white exclamation mark icons indicating the location of each portrait. They'll only appear if you get close, though, so you may have to run around a bit until you spot them.


The first missing portrait is stuck on top of a toilet lid in the bottom left part of the factory. You can access this spot by passing through the main factory area with the toilet conveyors until you find several half-assembled toilets on the ground and the portrait next to them.

The second missing portrait is in the bottom right part of Flush Factory, next to a massive green generator. If you're at the first location, head east through the factory and past the metal fences until you enter a small area with various wooden crates and the generator. You'll find the portrait inside a turtle object.

Once you find both portraits, you'll automatically complete this part of Fortnite OG's Chapter One Greatest Hits quest list, rewarding you with XP. You can now officially say you've returned to or experienced a part of Fortnite 2017 for the first time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of Ghost of Tsushima will soon be able to experience the dramatic samurai adventure in a new way. During Sony's CES 2025 press conference, Crunchyroll announced that an anime series is in the works, with Ghost of Tsushima: Legends set to premiere in 2027.


As the title implies, the Ghost of Tsushima anime takes inspiration from both Sucker Punch's original 2020 game and the Legends multiplayer mode that was released later that same year. There's no footage at the time of this writing, but the announcement came with the moody key visual above.

While details overall are fairly light, we at least know the names of a couple of main staff members, consisting of some notable creators. Takanobu Mizuno is at the helm, and while this will be the director's first full series, Mizuno has already done some impressive work at anime studio Kamikaze Douga. In addition to handling CGI direction for the Batman Ninja movie, Mizuno directed one of the standout shorts in Star Wars: Visions, "The Duel." Kamikaze Douga will animate Ghost of Tsushima: Legends, as well.


Story composition comes from an even bigger name: Gen Urobuchi. The novelist and screenwriter has left a big mark on the industry in recent years, including writing Puella Magi Madoka Magica and creating and writing Fate/Zero. Urobuchi is also known for PSYCHO-PASS and working on the epic Japanese-Taiwanese puppet wuxia collaboration Thunderbolt Fantasy.


We've still got quite the wait ahead of us, but hopefully, we'll learn more about what to expect from Ghost of Tsushima: Legends soon. It'll give us plenty of time to play through the upcoming sequel, Ghost of Yotei, after it launches sometime this year.

Nintendo is very much aware of this, seeing as it recently added the music from the first and second entries to the new Nintendo Music app.


Back in November, after the company added the Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy Kong's Quest soundtrack to the app, I was left wondering if it was going to take long to add music from the third game to the trilogy. After more than 2 months, it finally happened: the soundtrack of Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong’s Double Trouble is now available on the Nintendo Music app for Donkey Kong fans all around the world to listen to anywhere and anytime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long before the likes of Oblivion, I recall the OG PlayStation console. Its 3D capabilities and catalog of releases turned Sony into a powerhouse in the video games industry. Nostalgic though that time was, we have truly moved on since those low-poly, low-pixel days. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't return to them every so often.


That's exactly what Nexus Mods user gong has done. Making sure we never forget the PS1 era of gaming, they've managed to "demake" The Elder Scrolls 4, turning it into a blocky facsimile of its formerly smooth (though now dated) self.


Image via gong/Nexus Mods.


"Oblivion Umastered," as it's called, has taken the classic Bethesda RPG and "decimally crunched" the textures, turning it into something that would sit more at home in 1995. The modder has also – if you'll pardon the language – "rampantly polyfucked" the meshes, and has also "bit crushed" the audio. I speak for myself, but I kind of like the way gong describes things...


Obliviating the visuals


Visually and audibly, it may have been altered to an eye-bleeding quality that many of us still recall fondly, but it's the same ol' Oblivion. The modder describes it as being like a PS1-era game, but it's functionally still TES4, so nothing else has been tinkered with outside the graphics and sound.


They also recommend running their unmastered mod with the included shader preset, saying that it's "actually a pretty cool experience." All I can say is it really makes me miss my youth.


Of course, we can't talk about The Elder Scrolls without mentioning the elusive sixth entry. Skyrim came out over 13 years ago and while Bethesda is working on the next game, many of us are starting to grow impatient. On top of that, there are still rumors that Oblivion will be getting a remake at some point. Counter that with this PS1 demake mod and we could potentially have it all from the nearly 18-year-old RPG.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forza Motorsport has enjoyed a rather transformative 2024. The game runs well now, has plenty of permanent content, and even features ray-traced global illumination if you've got the rig for it. Developer Turn 10 is now continuing its winning streak with Update 16: the month of BMW cars.


In the broadest sense possible, Update 16 may well be somewhat disappointing from a feature and core gameplay improvement point of view. The focus falls squarely on the frankly impressive suite of new BMW vehicles, and so we're not getting a new track or anything of the kind this time around. In fact, the three tracks that received visual overhauls in the recent updates (Homestead-Miami, Hakone, Maple Valley) have been reverted to their original designs, which is a bit of a bummer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-awaited remaster of the remake.
Way back in 1989, Nihon Falcom released Ys III: Wanderers from Ys for various PC-based platforms and eventually consoles like the Genesis and SNES. This 2D side-scroller was well-respected in the community and eventually acted as the basis for 2005's 3D reimagining, Ys: The Oath in Felghana, though this didn’t receive a Western release until a PSP version in 2010. Now, hot off the recent Western release of Ys X: Nordics, Falcom brings this remake to modern platforms as Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana. Sporting a few quality-of-life updates, this throwback to simpler times (which debuted in Japan back in September 2023) offers up an enjoyable and tightly designed action-RPG experience that you shouldn't miss out on.
Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana covers one of the earlier adventures of series star Adol Christin, following a journey to longtime companion Dogi's homeland of Felghana. They arrive and are warmly welcomed by Dogi’s friends and family, but it doesn’t take long for Adol to get caught up in a larger struggle. The king of Felghana seeks to claim a series of statues to loosen the seal placed upon a demon he wishes to release. Adol thus sets out to retrieve these statues before the king can, hoping to stop his nefarious plan.

GUN

When you think of Western-styled games, the Red Dead Redemption series is probably the first one that comes to mind. But before this franchise took off, PlayStation 2 had titles like Red Dead Revolver and GUN. While Red Dead Revolver could be seen as a hidden gem, GUN is definitely the more underrated one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us season 2 is on the way, and it turns out we don't have much longer to wait for it. As revealed during Sony's CES press conference this week, the next season is officially set to kick off this April. 


Like the first, the second season will be airing on HBO and streaming on Max. Co-creator, writer, and executive producer Neil Druckmann reiterated that this season will run for seven episodes, which we previously learned about back in June 2024. Along with this news, we got a nice minute-long teaser offering up a look at the next set of episodes.




The season 2 logline paves the way for an adaptation of The Last of Us Part II. Set five years after the first season's events, Joel and Ellie have to deal with interpersonal conflict and "a world even more dangerous and unpredictable than the one they left behind." 


It's been two years since The Last of Us started its nine-episode run on HBO. In the time since its conclusion, we've been reacquainted with the returning cast and introduced to a few of the newcomers. In addition to Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie, we'll see more of Gabriel Luna's Tommy and Rutina Wesley's Maria in season 2. As for the newcomers, here's an overview of some of the previously announced cast additions:


New to The Last of Us Season 2 Cast



Kaitlyn Dever as Abby


Isabela Merced as Dina


Young Mazino as Jesse


Ariela Barer as Mel


Tati Gabrielle as Nora


Spencer Lord as Owen


Danny Ramirez as Manny


Jeffrey Wright as Isaac


Catherine O'Hara (guest star)



The first season of The Last of Us was intense, but anyone who has played The Last of Us Part II is no doubt eager to see how they handle some of the darker turns. Thankfully, we'll get to see how it all plays out in just a short few months.

Visible on the dock itself, the text states that the input voltage is 20V, while the output voltage is 15V. By comparison, the Switch OLED dock states that both the input and output is 15V.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nagi and Isagi styles are two of the three new styles that have been released as part of Blue Lock Rivals' latest update, and you can unlock them to power yourself up further inside the game.


Unlocking new abilities is always a fun job in Blue Lock Rivals. A new style changes the way you play, and they have unique abilities as well. But to use them, you'll have to obtain them first inside the game. Let's take a look at how you can obtain the Nagi and Isagi styles in Blue Lock Rivals.


How to get Nagi Style in Blue Lock Rivals


To get the Nagi Style, you'll have to rely on luck. You will have to try and pull it out of a spin, but the job won't be easy. Being a Legendary Style, the odds of obtaining it will be as low as 2 percent. There are three Legendary Styles, so the odds of getting the Nagi Style are actually approximately 0.67 percent. You can always try your luck with the Premium Lucky Spins, which will raise the chance to 15 percent.


Naturally, it will be an expensive process, and you'll need a lot of spins (unless you get to be super lucky with your pulls).




How to get the Isagi Style in Blue Lock Rivals


The process of obtaining the Isagi Style is the same, and you'll have to hope to get lucky from your spins. However, the Isagi Style is a Rare Style, which raises the odds to 62.5%. There are 2 Rare Styles in the draw, which puts the odds for the Isagi Style at 31.25%. Compared to the Nagi Style, this is a massively improved number, making it quite possible for you to obtain it.


Do note that the Isagi Style can't be obtained from Premium Lucky Spins. Once again, you can always get more spins by using different codes or just by buying them directly via microtransactions in Blue Lock Rivals.

Amidst a dizzying array of announcements made at CES 2025, Nvidia has also published a blog on its upcoming GeForce Now application for the Steam Deck. Up until now, the impromptu "solution" has been to simply install Google Chrome onto the Deck and run GeForce Now that way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a lot of resources in Disney Dreamlight Valley, all of which can be found in certain locations or at different times. One resource you’ll need if you’re wanting to increase your friendship level with Maui is Worms, but they’re only available for a limited time. 


Worms are required to complete Maui’s level 2 friendship quest “Burying the Eel”. The worms will eventually be used as bait in a Fishing Trap, but before you can place it down in the water, you need to locate the worms and craft the Trap itself.

While you could be forgiven for thinking that the worms needed for this quest will be found on Dazzle Beach, this is not the case. Instead, you’ll need to head up the stairs to Peaceful Meadow. Head to the small ponds in the biome and check the edge of the water. You’ll find some shiny, glittering spots that can be dug up using the Royal Shovel to provide you with Worms. 


Remember, these spots are only available to dig once you’ve reached friendship level 2 with Maui. 


How to use Worms in Disney Dreamlight Valley

Once you’ve got your hands on the wriggly little Worms, you can progress through the “Burying the Eel” quest by using them to craft a Fishing Trap. To do this, you’ll need the following materials:



3 Worms


8 Softwood



After placing the Fishing Trap in the waters off Dazzle Beach, you’ll eventually capture an Eel which you’ll then need to give to Maui. He’ll plant the Eel, and it will eventually grow into your first Coconut Tree. This is the only way you can unlock Coconut Trees in the Valley, and you’ll eventually end up with three of them in total. 


You can also find two Coconut Trees in the Moana realm. Coconut Trees will give three Coconuts every 33 minutes.

Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection.

One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.
Now it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs. Behold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At CES 2025, Nvidia announced the next line of its powerful graphics cards. Now, if you know your Nvidia, you've likely already been waiting for this, with leaks and rumors attempting to spill the beans early. Well, it's now been officially confirmed.


The GeForce RTX 5000 series is coming soon. How soon, you ask? Well, if you've read the title of this piece, you already have some inkling. According to a recent post on the Nvidia website, you can expect to see the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 "on store shelves" come January 30. Then in February (though no exact date has been given yet), the 5070 and 5070 Ti will launch.




As for price, well the 5090 will be – as you would expect – quite the drain on the ol' wallet. The RRP for this beast will start (START) at $1,999, while the 5080 will be $99…]]></summary>

After a little slice of something Super Mario 64 flavoured? Perhaps with a side of Banjo-Kazooie collection? Well, Kero Quest 64, a new Kickstarter project, might have you covered (thanks, GamesRadar).
This N64-inspired platformer comes from Stratobox, a team of modders and game devs, turning from the modding scene to create something new (albeit, something that looks immediately familiar). Zelda modder MelonSpeedruns takes on lead programming duties here, with Mario 64 ROM Hacker BroDute joining on level design. The modding pair are joined by 3D modeller/animator TheRidiculousR and composer Jamphibious. In short, this is a team that knows their '90s platformers.

That is definitely the case in Subnautica since those shiny stones are essential to upgrading your vehicle and getting the tools necessary for your survival.


Naturally, they are not easy to find at all, but we have a list of tips for you so you can hunt for diamonds fast and easily.


How to find diamonds in Subnautica


There are two main methods to gather diamonds in the game. You can find them freely floating around the seabed or you can break open Shale outcrops to reveal diamonds. 


Diamonds can usually be found in several seabeds, even in places where no Shale outcrops are around. They can be found in the following locations:

You read that right: Sony Pictures is now working on an honest-to-goodness Helldivers film, as shared by none other than Geoff Keighley on Twitter. Further, IGN has reported on an upcoming collaboration between PlayStation Studios and Columbia Pictures to produce a re-telling of Horizon: Zero Dawn, which is in a category all of its own. These announcements kind of overshadowed the smaller one that Crunchyroll will host the upcoming Ghost of Tsushima anime, which is set to release sometime in 2027.…]]></summary>

It's the Big Thing™ at the moment, and manufacturers are understandably eager to get a foothold over their competitors in terms of power, approachability, and – in Acer's case at least – size.
Yes, Acer has revealed what might be one of the largest gaming handhelds we've ever seen with the Nitro Blaze 11. With a screen clocking in at 10.95 inches, it's a powerful beast with a hefty price tag to boot, costing users a minimum of $1,099.99 when it launches in Q2 2025.

Thankfully, you can also use your keyboard to interrogate suspects in murder mystery Dead Meat. It’s a moody, slightly goofy noir puzzler that lets you ask anything you want. Whether this means you’ll always get a worthwhile response, I’m not sure. "Want to discuss their alibi? Probe them on the meaning of life? Confess your love? Or just troll them mercilessly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Expect lots of PS4 ports.
The tech experts over at Digital Foundry have weighed in on the recent 'Switch 2' motherboard leak, presenting their views on what the apparent compenents included mean for the power and performance of the upcoming console.
If you've been following along with the Switch 2 rumours for some time now, then much of what DF says probably won't actually come as much of a shock. In a nutshell, the team believes that the console will probably be capable of playing any PS4 game, albeit at a slightly lower native resolution. They're also quick to clarify, however, that this likely won't matter with the additional upscaling from Nvidia's DLSS.

Those eventually grew into their PCIe shoes, but only after months of dial-shifting driver updates – whereas the flagship B580 promises Nvidia-besting games performance from the off. Even at such a stage in the current graphics generation (the GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 could be revealed literally tonight, at CES 2025), there is something enticing about that proposition.

We are mere days away from the arrival of the former PlayStation Vita exclusive, Freedom Wars, on Switch. Ahead of its 10th January release date, Bandai Namco has shared a new trailer, setting up the story and showcasing all the fresh features we can expect to find in Freedom Wars Remastered.
The trailer serves as a good starting point for those unfamiliar with the 2014 Monster Hunter-esque action title. Narrated by your AI assistant, Percy Propa (complete with a nasty AI voice, we might add), the trailer explains that Freedom Wars sees you thrown into a dystopian future, where everyone is forced into a life of servitude under a one-million-year prison sentence. Those who want to make it out will have to prove they are worthy on the battlefield, teaming up with other trendy teens to take down massive foes.

Let's see if we fare better this time round: Sonic Galactic is an absurdly accomplished Sonic fangame from Starteam that, broadly, imagines how the Mega Drive and Genesis platformers might have looked and felt had they been made for the Sega Saturn. There's a new demo, if you fancy trying it for yourself. Please find it here on Itch.io. Perhaps if I'd put the download link higher up the page in the other article, people would have got distracted and refrained from dunking on me so awfully.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An upcoming life sim which claims to be a competitor to Grand Theft Auto VI is continuing to amass followers and wishlists on Steam, despite the game being unmasked as a vehicle for a dodgy cryptocurrency. Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules. But it's still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sunshine, lollipops and chainsaws everywhere.
Cutting a bloody swathe through an army of the undead, Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP joins Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered on Switch. Both games complement each other as flawed but enjoyable examples of Grasshopper Studios' beloved catalogue. An idiosyncratic collaboration between Suda 51 and filmmaker James Gunn, Lollipop Chainsaw highlights the unique style of both creators. It’s a hyper-stylised, quip-heavy action game that remains a uniquely demented experience. Sadly, content omissions and some choppy performance hamper this remaster, tainting the colourful mayhem.
The plot is both a perfect representation of its era and a great opportunity to experience Gunn in a goofy horror mode that was stifled when the MCU beckoned. On the morning of her eighteenth birthday, cheerleader Juliet Starling is inconvenienced by a zombie outbreak in her hometown. Luckily, Juliet comes from a long line of zombie hunters, the undead horde is no match for her skills with a chainsaw and a set of pom poms. Unable to save her boyfriend from a bite, Juliet decapitates him and carries his magically animated head on her belt. Together, they must battle through high school and defeat five musically themed dark lords, summoned by an angry goth kid named Swan to end the world.

This past weekend brought us one of the most convincing leaks yet with a pair of photos depicting what appears to be the left Joy-Con from the upcoming 'Switch 2'.
At first glance, it looks pretty much how we'd expected: larger yet with a familiar design, and a new magnetic rail that backs up previous reports on the console's upgrades over the current Switch. Upon closer inspection, however, the Joy-Con may also be housing an optical sensor on the side, right next to the 'SL' button.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original Fallout designer Tim Cain, also known for co-directing The Outer Worlds at Obsidian, has published a video responding to a player's question about why violence is the "default" path in so many big budget RPGs. That's specifically RPGs with "AAA" budgets, whatever AAA means these days. Cain is, of course, well aware that there are many RPGs from smaller teams that "evolve past the paradigm of violence being the default way in which the player interacts with the world", and that there are plenty of puzzle games, adventure games and the like in which there is no violence at all.

It is, like Dark Souls, a game about equipment and stamina management, but it finds most success as a soulslike in the sensation that you are alone somewhere bad, not able to do very much except hit horrible things in the space between them trying to hit you. It also offers notable moments of lonely, loud footsteps rebounding off cold stone tiles in the seconds after felling some giant man-bastard - one of the subgenre’s greatest un-joys.

We'll start off with the biggie. The dev named Animal Well his personal game of the year, describing Billy Basso's mystery-filled metroidbrania as "an engrossing experience" and "a true masterpiece" — honestly, we'd have to agree on those points.

Those after a bit more Batman on the go might be in luck since it seems that Gotham Knights is still set for a couple of console releases, and speculation is already leaning in Switch 2's favour (thanks, UniversoNintendo).
That is according to the LinkedIn resume of former QLOC Senior Programmer Łukasz Łoziński (spotted by YouTuber Doctre81), where the 2022 action game is still listed for two "unreleased platforms". Łoziński lists his work on the Unreal Engine 4 "cpu/gameplay optimisation" for the PS5 version of the game, but he also claims to have done the same — as well as "lead, vulkan rendering" duties — on two further, unspecified platforms.

November was a little rosier for the abandoned multiplayer game, with a monthly peak of 1,028. Then, on New Year’s Day, that number jumped to 11,900 players on Steam - its second highest concurrent besides launch. Soon after, they vanished. Who were these mysterious shufflers, flocking to the deserted, echoing halls of Valve’s disastrous flop like your mate who uses the word ‘liminal’ too much to a dead shopping center? Forbes, who first reported on the phenomena, don’t know. No one knows. Somebody might actually know but writing ‘no one knows’ makes it more dramatic. Let’s dig in.

The peals of celebration travel outward through our atmosphere, exiting the realm of Earthly sound and resonating with interstellar plasma and detritus to form a delicate ripple of comet flakes and stray photons, expanding far beyond our solar system. Where the ripple encounters larger masses, such as planets, suns and... other things, it rebounds, riding the weft of stardust back down to Earth. As it returns home, the signal is modified. Tinkered with. It acquires unsettling harmonics and a guttural undertow. By the time it re-enters our atmosphere, it has condensed to three words, which descend and shrink and spiral into your ear like an octopus entering a crevice: FEED THE MAW.

Per IGN, NetEase have now apologised to the affected players, and lifted the bans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll be blunt: the only thing that really entices me about SpaceCraft is that it's from Shiro Games, creators of such robust RPG and strategy fare as Dune: Spice Wars, Evoland, Northgard and Wartales. As a concept, at least, SpaceCraft seems both flavourless and oddly inclined to overplay its own familiarity. I mean, look at that title. Consider its chilly blend of functionality and punmanship. Look at that capital "C", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft. This you may do eternally, for there are thousands of planets in store.

I’m busy replaying The Suffering 2 for the sixth time to see a new 15 second cutscene that recognises which combination of morally aligned beginnings and endings I’ve picked. It reads your save from the first game and everything!". Say ‘memory card’ to a youthful, broccoli-maned Fortnite enjoyer nowadays. Go on, I dare you. You’ll be in a home before you know it.
Still, having new toys at regular intervals is one real upshot of our new live-service barrage of ephemeral novelty, perpetually flung at my dizzy eyeballs like gleaming carnival daggers at exhausted spinning wheels. Especially if they’re for the exquisite strategy of Mechabellum. Season 2 released yesterday alongside patch 1.2, bringing with it a new unit and specialist, some reworks, and lots of cosmetic bits I pretend not to care about but then get excited when I unlock a new one.

The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. "Bioshock Infinite in space", we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.
In Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.

Indiana Jones And The Great Circle’s writers knew about having hands. They’d picked up a thing or two. Turned the odd key. Raised the occasional entire lemon to their lips and devoured it whole. Clicked a camera button. Placed an object upon a table. They had touched things, and beyond this, they had felt them. They knew that the player could never truly be Indiana Jones, but they could be allowed to make a pretend man who sounded at least 83% like Indiana Jones do things with his hands that very much resemble the sort of things Indiana Jones might do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brendan Greene, the modder-turned-millionaire who designed battle royale game PUBG: Battlegrounds, wants to make his studio's next game a "metaverse", although he says he's wary of using the term. The project is called "Artemis" (at least for now) and you won't be seeing it any time soon. That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. 
Greene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led "multiverse of worlds" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox. He is nonetheless "full of confidence".

The latest trailer is a series of sweeping yet intimate, colourful urban cross-sections, showing dozens of NPCs selling fish, shaking hands on balconies, shouldering barrels, dancing with fans, honing their feng shui, and various other pursuits that allegedly form part of full NPC life simulations. It's like scrutinising a Hitman level from above, except that all of these people have evolving relationships and sleeping patterns and they might hunt you down if you murder any of their relatives. Me, I just want to play Where's Wally.

Intervention by Cloudflare ended that dream and 2.5 years later, despite other measures targeting the sites, it appears that at least one is still going strong. The TV companies are now taking legal action against UK ISPs; they're unlikely to put up a fight, they may not even turn up in court.

It’s a short browser Itch game that chronicles the life and times of a man named Johnson, his love for yellow life vests, his existential feelings of confinement (despite the high number of easily locatable exits), and such emancipatory joys that can only be found in yellow slides.

The newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel "Seith" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven't updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as "Ghost Of A Tail" is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. 


So! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.

Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

Despite the win, the broadcaster was disappointed that the court had found the company behind Rojadirecta liable, but not company owner Igor Seoane. After the Supreme Court held that Seoane could be held liable, last Friday a court confirmed total damages of $33 million, with Seoane and the company jointly liable for half of that amount.

The only thing missing from his account of the game was the bread needed to make that rich, meaty concoction a tasty, nourishing sandwich.
And by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m hoping you’ll forgive a spot of mission-bending here, given Should You Bother With? Is usually intended to test out the new and the strange of gaming hardware. Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.
Recently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clambering deep out of the Contemplation Pit, where reading reviews or opinions or, god help you, Takes, is forbidden, I am curious to learn how people have been categorising Songs of Silence. Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.
Taxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time. But even if you absolutely, utterly, and correctly loathe card-based systems, this game has none.

It begins as a "fireball of occult potentiality," dangling in the Great Hall of the Unseen University, which evolves into a ghostly "embryo universe." The embryo expands "lightly as a thought," with spectral continents "sleeting" through walls and people. It surges across the landscape until the entire population and geography of the Disc is exactly duplicated and enclosed by a shimmering shadow-self of "shining threads that followed every movement."

Naughty Tencent! Naughty Epic! And, yes, naughty Riot Games!

Earlier this month, the Thargoid menace finally landed in the Sol system, putting earth itself under threat for the first time, not to mention other human homeworlds and colonies. This meant players were invited to drop everything and head for home - to embark on one last great stand against the final, desperate, and dangerous alien attacker: a Thargoid Titan called "Cocijo". Don't worry, they got him.

As a consequence, a number of 11 bit staff are going to lose their jobs, though at least half of the affected development team are being offered the chance to move to other projects, including a few unannounced ones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At any given moment I am in the center of a wonderful vortex of skeletons. Bones splash and rattle and burst out of the ground in sharp, horrible spurs. My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.
This is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. 


Speaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.

The dog was called Senator Umeshefaat, and he was very civil, even if he was shedding his black and white fur everywhere. We spoke in his home village at dawn. Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was "hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal." I suppose every politician has their enemies. 
That Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.

Previously, on my mission to survive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl with only wild mutants as my weapons, I’d discovered clues that someone else was attempting to tame the Zone’s beastly inhabitants. With one of their electronic tracking collars in hand and absolutely no preexisting knowledge of their location, I set out to find this kindred spirit, only for the Zone to once again slam a door in my face.
A cold, steel, very literal door to boot. It turns out that the scientist’s laboratory is locked up tight, and will remain so until I delve about twenty hours deeper into the faction war that’s bubbled up while I’ve been running around throwing irradiated rats at people in tracksuits. Fine. Fine! But I’m keeping the collar.

Since then the modding team has grown to 40 people and the scope of the mod's features has ballooned. It's now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff 'em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First revealed all the way back in December 2023, Archetype Entertainment and Blur Studio's sci-fi action adventure Exodus hit us with a few things: Matthew McConaughey is involved, it looks a bit like Mass Effect, it's being developed by BioWare veterans, and it loves a bit of time dilation. In October of this year, we got a look at some icky celestial faction and zero in the way of actual gameplay. And now? Now we finally get a look at how you do things. Like sucker-punching armoured space bears in the face with electro-pistols.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After much teasing, the vicious tyrants of Arrowhead Games and their noxious puppets, the "democratic government" of Super Earth, have announced the very first Helldivers 2 licensed crossover. In yet another hollow display of solidarity and "Liber-tea", they've teamed up with the loathsome fascists of Killzone, the elderly shooter series from Sony and Guerrilla Games.
From today, you'll be able to buy weapons, armour and cosmetics belonging to Killzone's despicable stormtroopers from the Helldivers Superstore, and there's the suggestion of an additional Killzone-themed reward depending on the fortunes of the so-called Galactic War, a xenocidal bloodbath couched as an exercise in bringing "freedom" to the upstanding socialist Automatons, the blameless wildlife of the Tyranids, and the Wellsian cosplayers of the recently added Illuminate faction.
We here at Rock Paper Shotgun stand against Super Earth and Arrowhead's wanton aggression, which absolutely isn't a big satirical joke based on some Verhoeven film or other. Anyway, those capes. Find an image and further details below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Times Of Progress is a special game for me, because it's the first news tip I have ever received from Sin Vega, Prime Minister of Strategy Gaming. Sin once described writing news articles for our former news editor Alice0 (RPS in peace) as like practising backflips in front of the kung fu master. Writing about a new city builder at Sin's suggestion is like being invited to budget the development of Londinium by Julius Caesar.
The terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences - has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months. Today I bite the bullet, and emerge from my lodgings to issue a hesitant speech to the masses, hoping like hell that Caesar is too preoccupied with the latest Gaul uprising to notice my errors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toy Box sounds like a very Xmassy game, but then you watch a trailer, and realise that it is not very Xmassy at all. It's a free visual novel with a macabre puzzling element. The setup is that you're a toy inspector working for a jovial Grand Toy Maker, his face hidden above the top of the screen. Your job is to disassemble toys - five in all - according to his eldritch written instructions, and either "salvage" them or "sentence" them to the incinerator.

If you missed the reveal, perhaps because you value sleep over the spectacle of Geoff Keighley's fashion friends, let me catch you up: in Nightreign, you pick one of eight preset characters and explore a parallel-universe version of Elden Ring's Limgrave map, fighting lesser foes and levelling up quickly so that you can battle a boss at the end of each 15-minute in-game day.

Guess you'll be happy to learn that the Witcher 4 developers have more or less confirmed that Gwent will be making a return in the recently trailered Ciri-led sequel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Will the bulletting of my beloved dinosaurs never cease? Turok: Origins will revisit the dino-hunting archery of ye olde Nintendo 64, reimagining it as a story of three native huntsfolk out to lambast large lizards. The big new angle is that it'll be a third-person shooter and you can play in online co-op as a team of T-rex wreckers. You then slurp up their dino DNA to upgrade your character. Come and watch these crimes against nature in the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week we heard rumblings of a new character announcement for Tekken 8, and at the same time a trailer dropped a big unmistakable hint for red-dressed rabble rouser Anna Williams. Turns out that unmistakable hint was mistakable. My mistake. At last night's Game Awards we learned that the next fighter to come to the game will be... Clive? From Final Fantasy XVI? Sure. Why not.

Dispatch is a story-focused strategy game where you’ll play a broke superhero trying to get himself a new mech suit by working at a hero dispatch center. Having trouble tracking a trailer down for this one, but you can find it here on Steam.
Wait. I’ve found it! Leaving that last bit in though. Consider it my gift to you reader. The gift of visible workflow at 4am.
