The rumours about a supposed successor to the Switch continue, and the latest report (which admittedly supports a lot of previous claims) comes from an "exclusive" by Reuters.
According to the news agency, Nvidia is currently "building a new business unit" specialising in "designing bespoke chips" for hardware firms - with its "source" claiming the tech giant has crafted a "custom design" for Nintendo's next-generation handheld system.

Remember The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess manga series that began life in February 2016 and ended its run in early 2022? It was created by Akira Himekawa (the combined name for the two artists behind this series) and will later this year be available as a complete set.
According to online listings on Amazon, VIZ Media (which was responsible for the localisation of this manga), is now offering a box set featuring "all 11 volumes" as well as a collectible, double-sided poster. The whole set combined adds up to 2,040 pages. Here's the official description:

According to Collider, the trailer for the new series (featuring the voice of Idris Elba) has already "smashed the viewership records" for Paramount Plus across all platforms, trending across both social media and YouTube. Exact figures were not provided.

American football — or just football depending on where you are in the world. For some, it's a way of life. For others, it's another sport. But the thrill of watching teams duke it out over control of the ball is simply unmatched.

Players could survive in the gas endlessly in the past using a Stim tactical item. The same bug has returned, with different steps to make it work, what seems like every six months since Warzone came out. For the start of season two, a Warzone perk added in season one, combined with an old one, makes it nearly impossible to die in the gas. Don't worry, the developers have a solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have looked at any website for the past month or so, you have heard about Palworld. It is avoidable. Inescapable. Inevitable. 


Everyone knew Palworld was going to be a big deal after its earliest announcement trailers, but nobody was prepared for just how huge it would be when it was released on January 19. 


Perhaps most surprised by its success was developer Pocket Pair, who are now pleading with interested parties to come work on the game. 


PocketPair puts out a plea for Palworld developer applications


In a message on the official Palworld Twitter/X page, PocketPair shared a message seemingly from the point of view of a lonely pal.


"There are still many things I want to do in Palworld, but we are severely lacking in friends!!!" the message  (which we machine translated) begins. 




"We are recruiting for all positions, but we are especially looking for planning/engineering positions!" the message continues. "It doesn't matter what engine you have experience with, so if you are interested in creating a completely new game, please apply!!"


There are not a lot of specifics available about just how big (or small) Pocket Pair is. However, we know from a post on Pocket Pair CEO Takuro Mizobe's Note page that it was as small as a 10-person team at one point, where he referred to the game's release as "Miracle 4."


"Palworld was originally intended to be completed in one year." Mizobe wrote in the January 16th blog. "I have no desire to create a major title in the first place. I don't have any desire to make the same thing over and over again. And no matter how you look at it, the company Pocketpair is not suited to making large titles. Actually, there were only 10 people at the time, so I didn't have that image at all."


Palworld is available now on Steam, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever wanted to listen to the music of The Legend of Zelda live? Well, consider your wish granted. Nintendo has dropped the VOD for The Legend of Zelda Orchestra Concert onto their YouTube after canceling the originally Tokyo-exclusive performance at Nintendo Live 2024 TOKYO.




Some of the tracks performed include Kakariko Village, The Ballad of the Goddess, and the main theme of Tears of the Kingdom. The orchestra beautifully showcases the series' rich musical history through powerful renditions of the beloved classics. At a runtime of almost a half hour, it'll make for a pretty nice trip down memory lane if you're up for that adventure. 


Also posted were statues of the Tears of the Kingdom's versions of Zelda, Link, and our no.1 hottie (according to Zoey Handley), Ganondorf. 




The concert was originally planned for Nintendo Live TOKYO in January. Nintendo canceled the event after receiving threats targeting the audience and workers. 


In addition to the Zelda concert, Nintendo also held a Splatoon 3-themed concert the morning of February 10. 


Musically Inclined


Whether you like The Legend of Zelda or not, you have to agree the music is amazing. Whether it's the classic Koji Kondo tracks or the newer Manaka Kataoka compositions, all Zelda music is downright memorable. So, to be able to have a whole concert dedicated to it and done live is pretty awesome. 


Watching the concert made me realize something: I really want to see it live. The closest I got to that was Lindsey Stirling with her Zelda melody years ago. And, as someone who's watched the trailers for Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wind multiple times for the songs, I'd pay good money. I feel the same way about Final Fantasy and Sonic, as all of them have amazing orchestral tracks that'd be amazing to see live. So, Nintendo, maybe you could plan a national tour or something? Fine, I'll just play my ocarina in private.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the recent Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Volume 1 and the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Hideo Kojima's iconic tactical espionage action franchise has been on our minds. And miraculously, somehow, across approximately 588 episodes of Replay, we have never revisited Metal Gear Solid. This week I am happy to correct that monumental mistake.
We will get back to Majora's Mask soon (Marcus is out on assignment this week) but we took that opportunity to revisit one of, if not the, best PlayStation games with Metal Gear Solid. It just so happens that Alex Van Aken is playing through the game for fun, so I asked him if we could just jump into his save for an hour. And you know what? It just so happened to be one of the best hours of the whole game. Alex takes out Liquid Snake in the HIND, meets the invisible overweight soldiers, and defeats Sniper Wolf. It's a fantastic snapshot of a fantastic game.

In the latest episode of his YouTube series, HideoTube, Kojima says that returning to the same genre as Metal Gear was inspired by players asking for it "every day on social media", and by a brush with death he experienced in 2020.

Anyway, we got news that the Nintendo Switch has now sold over 139 million units, which is just astonishing, while Mario Kart 8 Deluxe passes the 60 million mark. Nintendo has also confirmed that the Switch will remain its 'main business' going into 2024, but we're all still pretty confident that a new console is on its way...

However, the experiences I had playing Yoshi’s Cookie and Kirby’s Avalanche with her have left me with some nostalgia for the titles. I don’t actually play them much, but they feel good to my soul, at least.


One game I used to play with her is different, however. It’s a puzzle game that I’m actually enthusiastic about and dust off every so often. It's one that I can enjoy without the sentimental attachment, even if some sentiment is still there. That is 1997’s Tetrisphere for the N64.

Ripped heroes brandished blades and vile wizards attempted to stop them at every turn, and that spirit is very much alive in Abathor, which is available to try out as part of Steam Next Fest.


Abathor comes from developer Pow Pixel Games, and upon firing the demo up I was whisked away to a world full of bold box art, Fabio's hair blowing in the breeze. The demo conjures thoughts of games like Rastan, Magic Sword, or even Turbografx-16 adventure Legendary Axe. 


The nostalgic journey offers four playable adventurers to choose from as you embark upon what certainly appears to be an epic quest, from blustery beaches to massive seafaring vessels and treacherous forests. There's enemies abound in each sampl…]]></summary>

For some formulas, there’s plenty of room in the market for pretenders. Consumer hunger may wane over time, but genres like open-world, survival, RPG, or fighting have always had an audience. However, this doesn’t hold true with Games as a Service, whether it’s subscriptions or microtransactions. Publishers rushed into the MMO market following the explosive success of World of Warcraft, and now we have a trail of very expensive corpses littering the past two decades.

        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/mutant-football-league-2-kicks-off-into-early-access-this-march/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=mutant-football-league-2-kicks-off-into-early-access-this-march"/>
        <updated>2024-02-09T20:59:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to the recently listed Steam store page, Digital Dreams Entertainment’s Mutant Football League 2 will launch into Early Access in March 2024.


Released in 2017, Mutant Football League serves as the spiritual revival of the 1993 Sega Genesis/Mega Drive game, Mutant League Football. But beyond just slyly changing around the word order to avoid retribution from EA, MFL is helmed by the creator of the original 16-bit titles, Michael Mendheim.


Mutant Football League 2 is the sequel to the only football game that I actually enjoy and continue to play. Other reception I’ve seen has been lukewarm, but I’m serious. I’ve tried multiple times to get into other football titles like NFL Blitz, but I felt doomed to forever hate the sport. I mean American football, not real football. I suppose the secret sauce to get me interested is to just somehow make it more violent.


Mutant Football League has you choose a team made up of skeletons, werewolves, and robots and kick the pigskin or something. Beyond just being American football with furries, cheating is encouraged, and violence is an inevitability. The inclusion of dirty tricks just adds an extra layer of fun strategy. Murder is a legitimate strategy, allowing you to focus on eliminating your opponent's best players.


The Early Access release will start with just 12 teams and arenas out of the planned 48. It will be offline only at first, and the team is giving the heads up that it will initially be reusing the audio assets from the first game but will be updated with its own music and VO over time. They’re hoping that the full version will be ready in Fall 2024.


The team has had some difficulty in developing Mutant Football League 2, as many of the developer’s staff are located in Ukraine, which is currently under invasion by Russia.


Mutant Football League 2 is set to release on Steam Early Access on PC in March

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had your eye on that Destiny 2 Exotic weapon ornament or emote but find yourself Bright Dust poor? There is no need to despair or mindlessly grind out Bounties. Bungie announced it will start giving away Bright Dust for free every week beginning in March. 


The gifting is set to go on until the launch of The Final Shape expansion in June. And at 700 Bright Dust per weekly reset, it's certainly no small amount to gloss over.


Bright Dust is one of the premium currencies found within Destiny 2. While players can earn it in-game through various means, it's usually nothing too substantial. Bright Dust is used alongside Silver for purchases through the Eververse Store. It's primarily a shop for cosmetic items like shaders, weapon ornaments, vehicles, or exclusive armor appearances. Though much of the Eververse Store demands Silver, every week, various goodies are sold for Bright Dust instead.


Bungie dropped this unexpected and generous news in Destiny 2's latest This Week In Destiny communication. In a short section titled "The Future Is Bright," Bungie explained, "As we head toward The Final Shape, we're honoring Guardians with a new weekly gift of Bright Dust. Starting on March 5, players can visit the Eververse store to claim 700 Bright Dust each week leading up to the launch of The Final Shape. Make sure to log in, get your Dust, and spend wisely, Guardians."


Bright Dust transactions have historically been absent for some of the hottest Destiny 2 cosmetics, like the Witcher crossover armor. That said, plenty of spend-worthy choices are available each week, especially if players have missed past seasons or holiday events. With (by my count) 9100 extra Bright Dust, do yourself a favor and treat yourself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every RPG faithful has that formative experience that turned them into a lifelong fan. But what if you could experience it again for the first time? Or if you could recommend it to those who haven’t played it without needing to explain away the parts that haven’t aged well? In today’s gaming landscape, remasters are common, but we’ve seen an influx of full-on remakes of classic role-playing games in recent years.
While 1990’s Ys I & II is likely the earliest example of remade role-playing games, perhaps the most prominent early examples came in the form of the Pokémon franchise. Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, 2004 remakes of the series’ debut titles less than a decade after their initial release, showcased the technological leap from original Game Boy to Game Boy Advance. However, when tho…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My excitement for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth went into overdrive this week. Not only did we get 20 more minutes of its gorgeous open worlds, mini-games and story nuggets to gawp over this week thanks to Sony's dedicated State Of Play stream for it, but the internet has also been awash with previews, interviews and all sorts of other Final Fantasy-shaped goodies. Honestly, it's like a second Christmas for me over here at the moment, it's great. 
But one thing that really stuck out to me this week was a comment made by series producer Yoshinori Kitase in an interview with our friends at Eurogamer. When they asked him why remake Final Fantasy 7 at all, his response hit me much harder than I was expecting. He said that the original FF7 is "probably going to be always that game my dad played, and I don't want it to be that." Aside from making me crumble to dust with irrelevancy, this really got me thinking about older games, the way we play them now, and just what role remakes and remasters have in today's PC gaming landscape. So come and feel incredibly old with me as I try and get my (very jumbled and loosely-related) thoughts in order.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When playing any character-driven videogame I sometimes experience a sensation akin to my eyes unfocussing, and remember that I'm not, strictly speaking, controlling a body in a world, but interacting with a simulation that includes representations of a body and a world. The character is just an interfacial node in a vast tangle of visible and invisible elements; by moving the character, I cause objects, surfaces, creatures to load or unload, spring into motion or change colour and a million things besides.
Some games foreground these interdependencies by fictionalising the simulation as a giant organism or ecosystem, a more intriguing kind of "living, breathing" environment which is aware of your presence within it. Amongst these games is Ultros, a side-scrolling, psychedelic metroidvania - or as developers Hadoque might prefer, "gardenvania" - which launches next week.

According to a recent update on Unknown World's website – the developer behind the Subnautica series – there are no plans to implement GaaS for the next installment. This is almost certainly a response to what publisher Krafton said in a recent earnings call.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a dismal time to be in video game development, as companies continue to announce layoffs. Now, Take-Two Interactive – the parent company of Rockstar – is looking to enact a "significant cost reduction plan," but it doesn't necessarily mean redundancies.


That's according to CEO and chairman Strauss Zelnick, who told IGN recently that there are "no current plans" to lay staff off. The specifics of this plan are said to still being worked out, but Zelnick says there are other areas that need looking at, such as marketing, third-party expenses, supply services, etc.




He also adds that the "hardest thing to do is to lay off colleagues," though that phrasing sort of suggests one would do it if it was easier. Whether that happens or not remains to be seen.


I'm a cynic, what can I say?


It's difficult to talk about Take-Two without mentioning GTA 6. Last year's reveal trailer has been viewed a squillion times, making it one of the most-viewed video game teasers in existence. If the parent company does eventually decide it needs to initiate layoffs, there's no telling whether this would potentially affect the next Grand Theft Auto game.


Again, this is just a complete guess from me. While there aren't any "current" plans for layoffs, that doesn't necessarily mean things won't change in the future, near or far.


Just recently, Take-Two was also in the headlines, facing a class-action lawsuit regarding microtransactions in NBA games. Hard to find two topics that get people more riled up than layoffs and microtransactions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios is teasing some of the enhancements coming to GOTY Baldur's Gate 3 upcoming Patch 6. According to Larian, improvements have been made to smooching in the cRPG, as can be seen in the brief video clip they provided. In this teaser, Halsin follows up a passionate kiss with a peck on the forehead, which does not exist in the current build.




Further enhancements include new camp idle animations, new Legendary Actions in Honour Mode, and a trove of bug fixes. Larian states Patch 6 is a hefty one, so it will be providing full patch notes on the BG3 website at a later date.


No release timeframe was given for the update, but with Valentine's Day right around the corner, I'd have to imagine a kissing-centric patch may try to coincide with that timeframe.


Patch 6 marks the sixth big addition to Baldur's Gate 3 that Larian has developed since the cRPG released in August. Each one has added something new while also implementing a ton of bug fixes between the patch and hotfix releases. On our end, we've been tracking Larian's patch cadence with a BG3 update history and schedule. 


I don't know about you but it may be time to finally start that next BG3 playthrough. I've been wanting to try a Dark Urge run, but I'm not too sure that fits the theme of the romantic improvements. Or does it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whatever happened to the old Discworld games? Well, they pretty much ceased to be a thing around the late 90s. However, there is a glimmer of hope that the retro point-and-click adventure series may return, so long as it bypasses a small bit of red tape.


In a recent interview with Time Extension, developer Gregg Barnett – co-founder of the now-defunct Perfect Entertainment studio – suggests a rerelease of Discworld could happen. Now, this is a big "if" and it's dependent on what the Crown has to say about it.

You see, thanks to a rather unusual law surrounding intellectual properties from UK outfits that are no longer in operation, King Charles III technically owns the rights to the games. Barnett says that "whenever something closes in the UK, intellectual property rights revert 50% to the original creator and 50% to the Crown." In short: it sounds like he'd need to go ask the British head of state for permission before any rerelease can happen.


A blast from the royal past


For those who don't know, the late Terry Pratchett's famed fantasy series was adapted into a number of video games back in the day. Discworlds 1 and 2 released in 1995 and 1996, respectively, while Discworld: Noir came out in 1999. After that, we never saw hide nor her of them in digital format.


However, King Charles' technical ownership of the franchise aside, we may get to see them live again at some point. Whether they'll just be rereleases or full remasters can't be said at this stage. Barnett says that it could potentially "advance to new versions." However, it's a "complicated process when you’re dealing with the Crown." Ain't that the truth...


If you want to learn more about intellectual property rights in the UK (and who doesn't), you can read about it here. Big shoutout to our own Paula for sending that my way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Cells was developed and released by Motion Twin in 2018, and in an atypical move in the world of game development, members of that team branched off to form Evil Empire, which in turn supported Dead Cells with new content for many years. Arguably its biggest and most notable expansion was the Return to Castlevania DLC, which added all kinds of Castlevania content to the game.
The developer announced this morning, however, that it is officially time to move on. You can see the developer's full statement below.
After 5 years of service, we're hanging up the Dead Cells coat. We're extremely proud of our work on countless updates & DLC, but now it's time for something shiny and new, or maybe more than one thing 😏 More on that very soon...

Along with issuing apologies for any broken controllers related to the Derelict Distillery addition, Evil Empire also shared its appreciation for being able to add so much to Dead Cells. It also wrote, "The good news is that our Dead Cells team have been unleashed to pump their talent into our secret projects, and we'll be revealing what their crazy minds have been coming up with very soon!" while also wishing luck to Motion Twin's next announced project, Windblown, and teasing perhaps more than one project.

The answer is apparently "be ruddy heroes in a cute Soulslike". I think this game, too, looks very cute, although Slime Heroes doesn't have a release window yet.
You know what does have a launch date now? Botany Manor, a lovely 3D puzzle game about growing plants, which I first learned about via the Steam Next Fest demo, and with which I immediately fell in love. I am heartened to know it is coming out really quite soon - April 9th. A mere two months from now!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hooded Horse and Eremite Games have revealed their plans for 2023’s survival town builder, Against the Storm. It includes two free updates to further polish the game, as well as DLC with additional content.


Against the Storm was among my favorite games released last year for combining city building with roguelite elements to create a meaningful experience about efficiency and adaptability. It puts you in a fight against the harsh elements of a beleaguered world and the extremely short patience of a powerful monarch. Your only weapon is your well-honed urban planning skills.


Only the contents of the first patch (1.2) are revealed on the roadmap and consist mostly of aesthetic and quality-of-life updates. 1.3 is still yet to be confirmed. Beyond that, the team intends to release a DLC (assumedly paid) expansion. While the contents of the DLC are still being decided, they suggest it will include things like an additional playable species, another biome, and new buildings, events, perks, and orders. 


A 1.1 patch including new decorations and portraits released mid-January. Today, alongside the announcement, patch 1.16 dropped, but is entirely bug fixes.


If you haven’t played Against the Storm, I can hardly muster a more enthusiastic recommendation. I know “roguelite” is a word that can cause a lot of people to immediately abandon interest, but I promise you that randomization and run-based features are harnessed for good and not tedium.


Against the Storm is available now for PC.

When it comes to remaking and re-releasing a game, it's easy to assume every publisher out there is plundering its back catalogue to refurbish and resell treasured games to a nostalgia-laced audience happy to pay for the comfort of childhood classics brought up to date on their current consoles.
However, looking back at Nintendo's library of remade games, there aren't quite as many as you might assume considering the candidates the Kyoto firm could revive if it so chose. That's not to say there haven't been a good handful — 30 in the ranked list below, including only games released in the West — but there are dozens of games that remain untouched that we'd personally love to see come back.

After selling out rapidly, Newegg has restocked and is offering the same deal again, giving you a second chance to get a PSU that could well outlast every other component in your system! 
To get the quoted $160 price rather than the standard $220, you'll need to use code YPCDP6233 at the checkout!

        <updated>2024-02-08T22:26:51.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take-Two Interactive has an interesting response to gamers upset with what the company does with the in-game currency they buy. In an ongoing dispute over whether money is essentially stolen when a game's servers shut down, Take-Two characterized in-game virtual currency as "fictions created by game publishers."


Currently Take-Two is facing a class-action lawsuit in California related to microtransactions in the NBA 2K games. Particularly, the lawsuit takes issue with the fact that when Take-Two takes down servers for old games, players lose access to the virtual currency (VC) that they bought.


According to Axios, the suit alleges that: “By removing Plaintiff and the Class members' VC, Defendants took and stole their personal property, or fraudulently appropriated property that had been entrusted to Defendant.”


In response to the lawsuit, Take-Two’s lawyers are targeting the claim that virtual currency is property. Game File reports that the company’s attorneys filed a request to dismiss the lawsuit last week. The argument goes that  gamers might have paid to obtain the currency, but it’s not something they can actually own. 


In the filing, Take-Two’s attorneys write: “VC is not plaintiff’s property. Instead, in-game VC are fictions created by game publishers, subject to the publishers’ terms of service and user agreements.” 


That said, lawsuits targeting microtransactions of all kinds seem to be popping up more frequently. In May 2023, Nintendo faced a class-action suit over the loot boxes in Mario Kart Tour. And NBA 2K has run afoul of microtransaction issues before, with Belgian and Dutch gambling laws in 2018.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The outstanding Persona 3 Reload sales have led to it being the fastest-selling Atlus game in its history. One million copies of Persona 3 Reload were sold in its first week, according to Atlus.





"Persona 3 Reload sold 1,000,000 copies worldwide within its first week, becoming the fastest-selling game in ATLUS history!" said Atlus West on its Facebook page. "A huge thank you to our community for your incredible support!" Additionally, the publisher seems confident about its future lineup because it says "We look forward to breaking more records with you" in the message as well. 


Despite the game being available on Xbox Game Pass day one, that doesn't seem to have affected its sales in the slightest. In fact, the potential word of mouth may have even helped.


Reception seems to be positive, too. On Steam, the current review score is Overwhelmingly Positive with a 97% rating. Additionally, it has an 88 Metacritic score from 61 critics as of the time of writing.


Persona 3 Reload is an updated version of the original PS2 game, for better or for worse. It has an all-new UI, a talented voice cast, updated graphics similar to Persona 5, and both remade tracks and new music. It also lets you control all of your party members during battle rather than the AI taking measures into its own hands. The Persona 3 Reload sales prove there's still interest in this gang's adventures in Tartarus and beyond.

Thankfully, that never feels gimmicky, and the Steam Next Fest sampling is packed with enough emotion to make the grumpiest grouch's heart melt. 


Copycat illustrates a somber mix of both loss and belonging through Dawn, the cat, and Olive, an older lady who adopts her. Dawn isn't receptive at all to her new home where even the ring of a telephone has the feline racing for cover. Before her adoption, somewhere along the line, the cat learned to be cautious around humans — honestly, not a bad stance to take. 


The woman has experienced her fair share of loss as well, and you learn this as you take control of Dawn and do all the usual daily cat duties, like …]]></summary>

Access real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio

Device streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google's secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.

After connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.
During Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though sunsetting has technically stopped being a thing in Destiny 2 in 2022, the concept is still looming over the game's proverbial head thanks to its long-term effects. Notably, the community still wishes for some of Destiny 2's vaulted content to return, with Black Armory spearheading the list.


Destiny 2's Black Armory is a unique piece of kinda-sorta seasonal content that came out before Bungie settled on the game's current, transient seasons. Whereas modern seasons (e.g. The Season of the Wish) get entirely removed from the game upon the release of a new DLC (The Final Shape, in this case), pre-Shadowkeep seasons stuck around for years at a time, and Black Armory was one of them.

        <updated>2024-02-08T19:21:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've known for just about two years now that a Knuckles TV series was on the way. Today, we get our first taste of what to expect when the show drops on April 26.


If you enjoyed Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2, it looks like we're in store for more of the same. Just with more Knuckles, still played by Idris Elba, which is great! This first Knuckles trailer is meaty with a duration of about two-and-a-half minutes. It sets the tone for the Paramount Plus series as we see some of the Echidna's purpose, villains, and more. 




Just the other day we saw our first Sonic the Hedgehog 3 teaser drop, which also confirmed the return of Jim Carrey's Dr. Robotnik. In this first Knuckles trailer, we see a new villain that seems like a solid foil for to the great Echidna Warrior. 


This unnamed villain is played by Rory McCann. The actor is perhaps best known for portraying the massive fan-favorite Sandor Clegane, also known as The Hound, in HBO's Game of Thrones.


McCann's character and his underlings have access to Knuckles' powers in the streaming series. This seemingly sets up equally powered battles between the opposing factions. 


What has Knuckles been up to?


As for Knuckles' motivations, he appears to have hit a bit of a slump following the Sonic 2 movie. This series takes place directly after the sequel but before the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog 3. Knuckles finally finds purpose in training a new warrior though. That student? Tom Wachowski's Deputy of Green Hills, Wade Whipple.


There's likely to be plenty of buddy cop-esque comedy between Knuckles and Wade throughout the six-episode limited series. The short episode count may have been a great decision for the show because it looks fantastic quality-wise. We'll see how this new chapter of the Sonic cinematic universe turns out when Knuckles begins streaming via Paramount Plus on April 26.

That game, which easily earned Game Informer's Game of the Year in 2016, started with such promise and a massive, enthusiastic audience, but following the 2019 announcement of Overwatch 2, support for the original Overwatch floundered, and so, too, did the community. Last year's release of Overwatch 2's PvE elements in its Invasion update pushed the hero shooter back in the right direction, but it didn't make the splash Blizzard had hoped for. With Overwatch 2 Season 9, which kicks off next week, Blizzard is making a ton of sweeping behind-the-scenes changes to make the game more approachable for players.

On the one hand, there's arguably a hungry new audience for such games; on the other, you're going up against one of the best RPGs ever made. Expectations are high, but Tiny Trinket Games' co-founder Stefan Nitescu remains unfazed as his three-strong team prepare to release Zoria: Age Of Shattering on March 7th. Zoria is carving an altogether different path through the RPG landscape, fusing isometric exploration with XCOM-like combat and 50 playable characters who are more like unit classes than personalities. The latter is a decision that comes with its own "repercussions", says Nitescu, but he's confident that it will help Zoria stand apart, with character abilities being unusually central to exploration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Calling dusty post-apocalyptic city builders a trend is probably a stretch, but not by much. I suppose it's a natural extension of the post-2000s explosion of the survival sim from "literally about 3 ever made" to "does your tetris remake really need the hunger meter". Games like Against The Storm porting over the roguelike element as well certainly suggest it. In my head, that's probably why New Cycle hangs out more with Endzone Dash A World Apart, and Surviving The Aftermath. It's more a traditional building game than a punishing test to be retaken, or the intense "survive the ordeal" narrative of Frostpunk, despite the superficial similarity that your town expects to be ravaged by scorching solar flares.
But it might also be because after playing it more than I really wanted to, New Cycle matches those two peers by leaving me with a vague feeling of disappointment. I'm just not sure what it really has to say.

I think that's a thing inherent in me, as I've never taken great pleasure in snapping together pieces of Lego, and would much rather earn killstreaks than decorate a back garden. For me, building in most games is laborious and predictable and does not sate my impatient brain.
But I like Neal Agarwal's Infinite Craft, a browser game where you slide words on top of each other and see if they generate something new. For instance, "water" and "fire" combine to make "steam", with what's practically infinitesimal possibilities. It is immediate, simple, and unpredictable. More games should facilitate haphazard engineering and silliness.

For real though it's been a long time since these games were released (28, 27, and 26 years respectively), so I can see why people would be rusty. Regardless of how well this Asypr set turns out, it'll be interesting to see old-school Tomb Raider talk flowing again. If you haven't run around like an idiot in Croft Manor with Lara's butler yet, now is your chance.

Though movie magic you will never know the difference, except I just told you. Oh no! Anyway, with the Steam Next Fest ongoing, I noticed an uptick in games and demos for games that are just about making a nice diorama, and have no goals or real restrictions. Interesting! I ask my co-hosts why they think this is, if that even makes a game a game, is making your own play less fun if you're not breaking someone else's rules, and so on. Plus: we reveal why James was in LA before!

Originally released on the PlayStation 2, Persona 3 was the first game in its series to define its modern formula, combining social responsibilities with dungeon crawling and a lengthy, emotional story. It's been re-released multiple times and was even ported to modern consoles last year, but even the upgraded versions don't hold a candle to the mind-bending masterpiece that is Persona 5 Royal. Persona 3 Reload closes that gap, however, introducing overhauled visuals and mechanics to bring the game that started it all up to the level of quality fans of the series have come to expect. If the sales numbers and our glowing review are any indication, the upgrade has been well worth the wait.
To put these numbers in context, here are some other games that have recently reached comparable significant milestones: Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth shipped 1 million copies as of Feb 1, Nintendo's quarterly report revealed Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20 million copies, and viral hit Palworld continues to smash record after record.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've played Daggerfall Unity, you'll know it's the best way to experience The Elder Scrolls 2 in the modern gaming climate. Now, with the full thing having recently launched, the creator of the project is looking to make their own game.


In a recent interview with DualShockers, developer Gavin Clayton said he's now working on his own idea, which will be styled after Daggerfall. He has this to say about the project:



I do genuinely love that old style of game. The thing I’m building is in the same vein. You’re talking big world, complex systems, mod support, that’s all of the stuff I want to explore, and I want to take that experience of Daggerfall Unity and put it in the new game.




Essentially, Clayton wants to realize his dream of making a game from scratch, something he's dreamed of since he was a kid.


With some D&D influence in there, perhaps


While there are no details about what this game will actually be, he's been open to answering a few questions on Twitter/X.


For example, when asked whether he was going to be using Unity, Clayton said he's building his own engine, or, more accurately, he's "revived an engine I spent some years on."


As for any kind of lore or narrative, the project is still in the early stages, but when asked, the response was that the "world and main story have their roots in a D&D 2ED campaign I created and ran for friends in the 90s."


Daggerfall Unity has been an enormous task for anyone to complete, especially as it was a full remake using a different engine. It's almost certainly reinvigorated interest in Bethesda's classic RPG, and I would personally recommend anyone interested in retro Elder Scrolls games to check it out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funimation and Crunchyroll, two competing anime streaming services, merged in 2021 and announced in 2022 that all of the content would eventually combine under the Crunchyroll banner. That event officially has a date, and it's April 2.
For Funimation subscribers, you will have to go through the process of merging your account before the April 2 date, and, frustratingly, any shows that were outright purchased through Funimation will not transfer to Crunchyroll. Just another reminder that when you purchase digital content, true ownership does not technically exist and you will always be at the mercy of the platform holders when it comes to access.
Crunchyroll subscribers do not need to make any changes, but the price of the subscription will rise to $100 a year soon. The merger officially going through does mean Crunchyroll will feature more content, but a price increase will always be frustrating.
Alongside this merger finally completing, Crunchyroll is also entering the video game space as a publisher. It remains to be seen what kind of video tames the anime company will help produce, but you can check out this package it sent over on Game Informer's TikTok account.
As a subscriber to both services who somehow has managed to continue to have a need for both (Outlaw Star is curiously currently only available on Funimation) the merger is bittersweet. I embrace the simplicity of one anime streaming service but don't look forward to paying more, and will forever be wary of mergers being a good thing.]]></summary>

The series officially takes place between the second and third movie and will apparently follow Knuckles (Idris Elba) has he helps Wade (Adam Pally), Tom Wachowski's (James Marsden) bumbling police partner, become a true warrior. The trailer also reveals the antagonist will be played by Rory McCann, who is best known for playing Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane in Game of Thrones, and features a two-thirds Human Giant reunion cameo with Rob Huebel and Paul Scheer. Curiously, they're sitting at an ESPN8 The Ocho desk, a gag born from the 2004 film Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story that eventually became a real thing.
Other interesting details from the trailer? Jim Carrey does not appear, nor does James Marsden, but both Sonic and Tails appear and are played by film voice actors, Ben Schwarz and Colleen O'Shaughnessey.


The series, simply titled Knuckles, will be six episodes long and begins streaming on April 26 on Paramount+. For more on the Sonic the Hedgehog Movie universe, you can read our review of the second film here.]]></summary>

Notably, Turn 10 has gone back to the drawing board with Forza Motorsport's Car Level mechanic, as promised earlier this year. From the very start, a vocal portion of the player base has been highly critical of Turn 10's decision to lock vehicle upgrades behind level gates that, granted, do take a while to reach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a game that was built in collaboration with AMD, it seems surprising that it's taken this long for Starfield to support FidelityFX Super Resolution 3. However, the most recent update now makes it compatible with the image upscaling algorithm. But of course, there's a slight catch.


The recent patch notes, as well as a message on Twitter/X, show that Bethesda has finally enabled the option for FSR 3. The slight downside to this is that it's only released in Steam Beta, but at least it's started rolling out now, I guess.




As for what else version 1.9.67 of Starfield includes, we're being told that Intel's own Xe Super Sampling – a rival to FSR and Nvidia's DLSS – is also supported now. There have also been a few other fixes, but apart from the aforementioned AMD and Intel tech, this seems like a relatively small update.


The future of Starfield...


We all know the story now, but it's worth repeating. For what was the most hyped-up game of this generation, many of us were left largely shrugging our shoulders after a few hours of playing.


At the time of writing, SteamDB shows that 5,310 people are currently playing Starfield on PC. That's not enough for a Bethesda game that – as the studio continued to remind us – was almost 25 years in the making.


We've been promised some major updates to the game in the future, which may or may not represent turning points. The reality of the situation, however, is that while some people will be happy FSR 3 is now an option, it's going to take more than that to get people interested in the game again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, we brought news that Embracer Group was laying off staff at Eidos Montreal. This brought to the fore the uncertainty of the Deus Ex franchise, and now some words of thanks have come from the voice of Adam Jensen himself.


In a recent post on the Mankind Divided subreddit, Elias Toufexis wanted to express his appreciation for the support over the years. With this, the actor has essentially said goodbye to Jensen, adding that "his story seems done."




With the future of Deus Ex uncertain, Toufexis has said that the recent layoffs and the alleged cancellation of a potential new game have "angered" him. However, he does – jokingly, it seems – suggest that someone like Elon Musk ("I think he has some money") could possibly take over the franchise and keep it going.


Who better to take the reins on dystopian sci-fi..?


We will likely never know what would have become of Adam Jensen. Toufexis seems certain that, had the studio been working on a new story based around the character, he would have been contacted.


His message is also the culmination of ongoing dismay within the gaming industry, as huge companies make cutbacks, with some studios shutting down entirely. Eidos Montreal is sadly one of the more recent examples of this swathe of job losses.


But it seems Toufexis wants to try and put a more positive spin on things, hoping fans will continue to like his non-Jensen work. Whether we will ever see a new Deus Ex game again remains to be seen, but with Mankind Divided coming up on the eight-year anniversary of its release, a lot of us are more than hungry for a return to this universe.

This week's Japanese charts are in from Famitsu (via Gematsu) and things are looking rather PlayStation-heavy compared to what we are used to seeing.
It's the new releases that are dominating the competition this time around. Persona 3 Reload's PS5 version tops the charts with 76,368 copies sold, while its PS4 counterpart takes the bronze. Another PS5 title, Granblue Fantasy: Relink slots into the podium line-up, leaving the only Switch newbie, Jujutsu Kaisen: Cursed Clash to take bronze with 25,242 sales in its opening week.

Inkulinati, a turn-based strategy game where you play a medieval artist duking it out with another artist on the pages of an illuminated manuscript, is one such. It's been kicking about on Steam since at least 2019, and in fairness to me it did launch in January last year - it just went into early access. These factors contributed to me being sort of surprised at the reveal of the actual release date for 1.0, which is February 22nd.

The associated joint statement from developers Blackbird Interactive and publishers Gearbox arrived within hours of me posting about said Homeworld 3 demo and saying that while I am fully onboard with many aspects of the new space strategy game, I do have reservations about its controls. 


Naturally, and self-flatteringly, I'm now petrified that I'm single-handedly responsible for the delay. Please come back, Homeworld 3! I didn't mean it! I'm pretty sure I'll acclimatise to the control scheme with practice! True-3D starfleet management is always a bit fiddly! Besides which, I might not get to review it now!! I'm moving flat in May!!!

The Legion Go debuted at £699, a price at which we found it largely compelling, but now it's dropped to something a bit more reasonable - £649. 
That £50 discount doesn't make it a budget option by any means, especially with the most affordable Steam Deck at £349 and an OLED model at £479, but it's still a welcome price drop on one of the most intriguing PC handhelds we've seen yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“I really fight being envious of Larian,” says indie RPG designer Jeff Vogel. “Or any other big company. Because everyone’s scared, everyone has hard times, and the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. I’ve had a very successful life where I’ve earned enough and gotten enough stability. And so I'm really happy with my choices. It would be awesome if I could write a big hit that everyone played, or had a big team and could do a big thing. But you know, I’m content. I’ve had enough people play my games.”

It's been live for a few days, actually, but whether due to the bombardment of other Steam Fest goodies or my being led astray by the similar-but-nerdier Nebulous: Fleet Command, I didn't try it till last night. The demo includes a tutorial mission, four maps and the War Games mode, a one-to-three player affair which essentially turns Homeworld into a roguelike - pitching you up against unpredictable opposition while unlocking new fleets and doling out Artifacts that augment your vessels.

The Ryzen 5 8500G ends up being decent on the GPU side but making me genuinely excited is the Zen 4C prospects in the low-power space for AI workloads at the edge, low power servers, and other different deployments for great low-power performance.

I've played many variations of this mode - which was originally a mod, Gun Game - over the years in other games, and it's always a laugh, for the simple reason that it can be tuned to allow less proficient FPS players to catch up with their brethren, by introducing less powerful or harder-to-master weapons at certain levels as "speed bumps".

He shoots sauce and says things like "You just don't cut the mustard, Batman!".

During today's PlayStation State of Play devoted to the upcoming exclusive title, we got a new look at various impactful scenes set to take place in this retelling of the middle portion of the Final Fantasy VII Remake series. 
The footage in this trailer shows off various scenes we haven't yet witnessed and characters we've seen very little of. The main thrust is Sephiroth's quest for the Black Materia and the party's efforts to save the world. As you might imagine, it's all set to the amazing soundtrack fans have come to expect from the game.
You can check out this cinematic trailer below.

There might be someone else in battles with the power to tip the scales, however: an omniscient game master, employed by developers Arrowhead, who can monitor the fight and drop in buffs and debuffs to change the flow of the fight.

It makes me think of sleepy suburban soap operas, slightly worrying brands of shampoo or chocolate, and easy listening radio shows on long-haul train journeys.

Perhaps it will take you the same amount of time to sail across it: this is Ubisoft's "biggest open world" offering, in the words of former creative director Elisabeth Pellen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A story about a girl who has a ghost best friend nobody else can see, and has to juggle that relationship with her interactions with living people? Sounds fake. Haha, but seriously folks. There's a demo for Paper Ghost Stories: Third Eye Open in the Steam Next Fest, and boy howdy did I like just looking at this game in motion. The clue is in the name, as all the characters look like 2D paper cut out dolls, and all the environments are like papercraft models. It's pretty gorge.
Third Eye Open, out this year, is inspired by the Joss-Papercraft of Southeast Asia (indeed, the start menu is a stage). You play as Ting, a pre-adolescent girl living in Malaysia with her parents. Ting discovers her supernatural ability to see ghosts at a camp, where she meets Xiu, a ghost girl about her own age. The two become friends, and the demo starts in media res when the two are back home.

Rocksteady’s long-awaited live service shooter is aggressively unambitious and seemingly petrified of risk, marrying tight, combo-ratcheting, flow-state combat with some awfully familiar and conventional loot-chasing guff.

        <updated>2024-02-06T16:02:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Project Orion is still a deeply mysterious game. We know it is a follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, we know CD Projekt Red is developing the game in North America (Boston, specifically) as opposed to Poland where the main studio is based, and eventually development will expand to Vancouver, with support from the main Polish headquarters. Beyond those details, we don't know much. Implications from CD Projekt point to it being a sequel, but it could be a spin-off, or something entirely different. Of note, Project Orion was a study from the 50s and 60s about the viability of nuclear power for space travel. Maybe that's what CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up will be about.
We may not know much about the game, but based on a press release from CD Projekt this morning, we now know some of the folks who will be working on it. Dan Hernberg is now a Project Orion executive producer who was head of production at Amazon Games, and also has history at Panic Button and Blizzard Entertainment.  Ryan Barnard was a game director at Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft, but perhaps most notably, was the gameplay director at Hitman for developer IO Interactive. Barnard is joining Project Orion as a design director. Alan Villani is now an engineering director on Project Orion and worked on several Mortal Kombat titles. Anna Megill is a Project Orion lead writer with history on titles like Control, Dishonored: Death of The Outsider, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Guild Wars 2, and the upcoming Fable from Playground Games. Alexander Freed is an additional writer on Project Orion and is a New York Times bestselling novelist and comic book writer who previously worked at Bioware on Star Wars: The Old Republic and more.
We're eager to learn more about Project Orion, but suspect it will be some time before we do. For more on Cyberpunk 2077, follow the link to read Game Informer's review of Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. You can also read about how CD Projekt has no interest in being acquired here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every so often, there are games that come out that are made with real models. They're sometimes called "handmade" games, implying pure coders use their prehensile toes, but I really like it every time I see one because I love models. I like little versions of regular things! I just think they're neat. But it really is every so often, presumably because it takes even longer to make a tiny little man out of twigs and spit and scan him into a computer than it does to make him in the computer to start with. Cute miniature puzzle game Lumino City is ten years old, and Trüberbrook is coming up on five. And I first played a tiny snippet of Harold Halibut in 2018. Now, a larger snippet is available for everyone in the Steam Next Fest.
Harold Halibut is a sort of sci-fi, slightly retrofuturist point and click puzzle game about an undersea society on an alien planet. These people's ancestors blasted off to an ocean planet using the technology of a big science corporation and now, though they can't remember why, they're all pootling about under the water looking at fish. In this world of exaggerated sea-science nonsense, Harold stands out as a sort of beige lab handyman.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has released its latest quarterly sales numbers, and they are overall expectedly impressive considering 2023 saw the releases of new mainline Zelda and Mario games. But Pikmin 4 and Super Mario RPG, the remake of the 1996 Super Nintendo game, also delivered some notable sales numbers.
You can find the full report here, but here are the notable highlights:
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20.28 million copies since its launch on May 12, 2023
Pikmin 4 has sold 3.33 million copies since its launch on July 21, 2023
Super Mario Bros Wonder has sold 11.96 million copies since its launch on October 20, 2023
Super Mario RPG has sold 3.14 million copies since its launch on November 17, 2023
Other highlights, found here, include Switch hardware sales, which have reached 139.36 million units. It's also always interesting to watch the list of best-selling Switch games, which you can find here. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is still king, now boasting 60.58 million units sold. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is in a distant second with 44.79 million units sold and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is in third with 33.67 million units sold. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey take fourth and fifth place, respectively.
Nintendo also confirmed what we all suspected, writing in its report, "The Super Mario Bros. Movie, released in April, had a positive impact on sales of Mario related titles. As a result, there were 24 titles that sold over a million copies during the period, including titles from other software publishers." It also mentions in the report that Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the fastest-selling Super Mario title to date.

Miniatures is not one of those games. Oh certainly you will open boxes and organise items and assemble furniture in its Steam Next Fest demo, but it's not cute or colourful or wholesome. Miniatures is more of a psychological horror game, laden with tension and uncertainty. For such a short demo, it built a great mood, and I'm excited for the full game to come later this year.

Or maybe that should be struck gold, as this mining roguelike is all about collecting little gem-like nuggets while boring deep underground for treasure and fending off all manner of flying eyeballs, bats and other unmentionable horrors with wings. I've been playing its Steam Next Fest demo this morning, and my initial impression is that it's a little bit Dome Keeper, a little bit SteamWorld Dig, and very, very good. Even better, developers 8BitSkull have just announced it's coming out in full next month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2021 I went through a bit of a rally phase with WRC 9, as I discovered the joys of watching people play rally games beautifully. And as much as I enjoyed my brief stints with those semi-realistic rally games, I've since longed for more of a blend between a rally-er and a colourful arcade jaunt. For those seeking a similar swinging-the-back-out experience, I'd recommend giving #Drive Rally's demo a go. It might not be as colourful as I'd like, but it's got lovely, errr, dirt feel?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Action-RPG colossus Elden Ring is reportedly getting a free-to-play mobile adaptation with in-app purchases, which takes inspiration from miHoYo's Genshin Impact. It's being published by Tencent, who apparently acquired the licensing rights to Elden Ring back in 2022 and put a few dozen people to work on a prototype, even as the company acquired a 16% stake in Elden Ring developer From Software.
All that's according to Reuters, who cite three sources "familiar with the matter". I realise that "free-to-play mobile version of Elden Ring with in-app purchases" is a phrase tailormade to give certain players hives and/or cause the speaker to be struck by lightning, but much as I can't help looking over cliff edges, I do find the idea fascinating.

While this high-speed FPS has been playable in a number of semi-open alpha tests already, trying it out is now as easy as sliding into its Steam page and hitting the big green demo download button.
The demo launch is accompanied by a shiny new trailer, showing more of Rivals’ skiing shenanigans, aurally satisfying airshots, and flag-throwing tricks that I will never, ever be able to successfully pull off in a real match. Also, a confirmation that it’s launching into early access, though there’s no date beyond “soon.”

Years ago, when I first heard about the provocative title for Rocksteady’s follow-up to the Arkham games, I recall wondering what mental gymnastics were in store to not actually murder the well-liked central characters of the DC mythos, including the version of Batman the studio had so expertly developed over prior titles. Credit where it’s due: Rocksteady followed through, and Kill the Justice League does just that. Unfortunately, it also killed my interest or enthusiasm through a story that feels juvenile and…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft had a strong start to 2024 thanks to their Developer Direct Showcase, but it sounds like we'll get even more information on what the gaming giant is up to very soon. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer gathered the attention of gamers everywhere this afternoon with a post announcing an upcoming "business update event." You can see the post for yourself below.
We're listening and we hear you. We've been planning a business update event for next week, where we look forward to sharing more details with you about our vision for the future of Xbox. Stay tuned.
February 5, 2024
The post itself doesn't have any concrete details on what to expect, but there's a likely subject. Just this morning, The Verge reported that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, one of Xbox's biggest first-party games of the year, might be headed to PlayStation after a short exclusivity window. Combined with other recent rumors, like Hi-Fi Rush and Starfield coming to other platforms, it seems like Xbox might be loosening its grip on its exclusive games. That said, Spencer didn't give us any idea as to what the announcement would be about, so we'll have to wait until next week to know for sure.
For more on Xbox's plans for the coming year, check out some of the reveals from the Developer Direct, like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Visions of Mana, and Avowed.
What do you think Xbox will announce next week? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

To be fair, this is essentially two 32-inch 4K 240Hz monitors without the gap in the middle, with a Mini LED backlight that delivers 1000-nit HDR highlights, an absolute beast of a monitor... but I'm guessing that most people that can drop nearly $2000 on a monitor aren't waiting for a deals post on Rock Paper Shotgun to do so. 
Still, I can dream, and this monitor is pretty cool, so let's take a closer look at this absolute bargain.

That's more than £75 cheaper than the 13th and 14th-gen equivalents, which add on only meagre levels of performance, and a great price for a CPU that can use the same DDR4 or DDR5 motherboards with PCIe 5.0 support. If you're building an Intel-based gaming PC, I'd argue that this is the best budget option going!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of our Apex Legends magazine cover story, we interviewed several key Apex Legends developers – Steven Ferreira, Evan Nikolich, Josh Mohan, and John Larson – about how Respawn Entertainment is shaking up its battle royale with a new Legend Upgrade System in the game's twentieth season. We learn how the team has gradually been auditing the core systems in Apex to trim the fat accumulated since the battle royale entered the scene five years ago and how exactly those gameplay changes affect the core player base.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yu-Gi-Oh is celebrating its 25th anniversary, and Konami held a special event in Tokyo to commemorate the occasion. In addition to touting an AI learning opponent feature for Master Duel and VR experience with Duel Links, a collection of classic Yu-Gi-Oh titles served as the big new game announcement.
Dubbed Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection, this compilation consists of the very first Yu-Gi-Oh games ever released, including titles only available in Japan. Konami only revealed one game in the collection: Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters 4: Battle of Great Duelists for the Game Boy Color, which launched in Japan in 2000 and never came to the West. 
Yu-Gi-Oh Early Days Collection has no release window, but it will be available for Switch and PC via Steam. Konami plans to announce the other titles in the collection in the future, so you can start building your wishlist now. There are a ton of Yu-Gi-Oh games (to say the least), but as a long-time fan, I’ll be happy if Forbidden Memories, The Eternal Duelist Soul, or (perhaps less likely) The Duelists of the Roses make the cut.]]></summary>

On the surface, this might look like your typical fantasy dungeon crawler, but Pyrene has some neat tricks of its own, combining its own blend of resource gathering and roguelike citybuilding with Inscryption's number-crunching battles and a dash of Foretales' card-based exploration. And it has a lovely piano soundtrack to boot, too.

But in the years that followed, after you'd been sent to the slammer for crashing through my window bellowing about cheap Audible subscriptions, I might have checked out games like Ghost Trick and Phantom Brigade - each sort of an exercise in placing actions on a timeline like audio layers to produce a winning composition - and thought "hey, that hysterical burglar was onto something".
I wouldn't say there's an abundance of games in which you place actions on timelines, mind you. But those that do exist are neat, as Marge Simpson would say. Take Tarnished Blood.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is one of the biggest Xbox exclusives on the horizon. According to a new report, however, Microsoft might be thinking of bringing Indy to other platforms.
The Verge has spoken to an insider familiar with Microsoft’s plans who claims the publisher is considering the idea of bringing several first-party titles to other consoles, like releasing Indiana Jones on the PlayStation 5. The source claims that Bethesda is tentatively targeting a December release for the title and that it will launch as an Xbox/PC title before possibly coming to PlayStation 5 after a short exclusivity window. 


Remember that nothing has been officially announced or confirmed, so take this report with a grain of salt. It’s worth noting, though, that during Microsoft’s trial with the FTC over its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Bethesda’s then head of publishing, Pete Hines, testified that parent company ZeniMax had initially signed an agreement with Disney to make Indiana Jones a multiplatform game. Microsoft later amended this deal to make the game an Xbox exclusive after it acquired ZeniMax in 2020, with Hines explaining the decision was made in the name of "reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity."
Microsoft’s rumored multi-platform approach has garnered plenty of speculation in recent months. The publisher is reportedly looking to bring first-party games like Hi-Fi Rush and Sea of Thieves to rival platforms in the near future. Starfield is also rumored for a PS5 launch, as reported by XboxEra. 
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was first announced in 2021 and had its full reveal during the Xbox Developer Direct last month. The first-person action-adventure romp stars Troy Baker as Indy in a story set between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. The game is slated to launch sometime this year for Xbox Series X/S and PC.

Indeed, an unannounced single-player Titanfall game was quietly shelved last year, and if there’s any burning sense of unfinished business among series devs Respawn Entertainment, it wasn’t evident during my recent visit to try out Apex Legends’ Season 20 update.
Even so, it turns out some still carry the fire, at least as source of inspiration for Apex lore and mechanics. I asked Respawn’s narrative lead Ashley Reed whether Titanfall was keeping in anyone’s minds, and was told that if anything, the references need reining in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there’s a secret to how Apex Legends has endured the past five years, an era marked by as many FPS failures as successes, then it might be this: there are no sacred cows in live service. Since its surprise launch in February 2019, developers Respawn Entertainment have chopped and changed everything from hitbox-shrinking Naruto run animations to entire character designs and ability kits, gutting and reworking gear and class mechanics along the way. The incoming Season 20 update, titled Breakout, represents the latest large-scale rejig, adding upgradeable skill tress for its playable Legends that promise MOBA-esque progression and the maddest fights yet.
Then again, if you actually ask Respawn’s Apex team how they reached this point – as I did when I visited their Los Angeles offices for a Season 20 test run – you’re unlikely to get just one answer. Rather, the battle royale’s unusual longevity in a fiercely contested space is more often attributed to those ongoing work-and-rework efforts themselves, the scope of which sometimes remains a surprise to the developers themselves. As does, according to lead game designer Devan McGuire, Apex’s success.

It's all thanks to a drastically expanded Evo experience system, one that now not only boosts your shield capacity, but unlocks the branches of a MOBA-style skill tree that permanently buffs your character for the duration of a match. Even for a season with no new playable Legend to headline, it’s an update that feels exciting and genuinely game-changing – if a little scary at the same time.

We're a bit short this week because of the rolling technical disaster that is modern Twitter, but I've still enjoyed ogling everything from a must-have immersive sim feature and a very unpleasant nighttime drive to lovely simulated water and strange spaceship shenanigans. Check out all these attractive and interesting indie games!

There are extinct species of fern growing through the vents of my i7 12700F. All these troubling signs point to but one, dire outcome: it's time for another week of new videogame releases, and another week of feeding videogame gossip and reportage to the Maw, our weekly news liveblog.
Here are a few games we're aiming the ol' scrying crystals at this week: alchemy-themed puzzle adventure CLeM (6th Feb); 1980s-styled "Tetris + flying car" puzzler Space Garbage (6th Feb); Coven-building "4X card game" WitchHand (7th Feb); spoofy sci-fascist shooter Helldivers 2 (8th Feb); alt-theological dark fantasy The Inquisitor (8th Feb). Mind you, this week it's all about the demos. That's right, it's time for another Steam Next Fest - have you had a chance to play any demos so far? Participating developers have taken to stuffing them up a few days in advance to beat the rush.

While various action scenes served as fan-pleasing sequences, the series was maligned among the community for simply not feeling true to the source material. In addition to focusing on too many side characters and interpersonal drama, the series also took far too many liberties with its main protagonist, Master Chief. With Season 2 starting on Paramount+ this week, I sat down with Xbox's head of IP expansion and entertainment Kiki Wolfkill and Halo Season 2 showrunner and writer David Wiener to learn more about the direction they're taking.

It’s packed with 40 new features, 80 changes, and almost 150 fixes. In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Death Stranding 2: On The Beach’s latest trailer is aggressively bizarre. In 9 minutes and 40 seconds, the video assaults us with talking stop-motion puppets, sentient gloves wrapped around people’s necks, throat babies vomiting out spaceships, a samurai that sounds like an infant, and somehow, Higgs returned. 
It’s so densely packed with weird stuff that, upon repeat viewings, I actually had to go out of my way to pinpoint anything remotely mundane. In a humorous turn of events, Death Stranding 2 is so overwhelmingly odd that every eye-brow-raising visual element is par for the course. Anything that isn’t a black oil-covered tube baby with a hilariously literal moniker voiced by Troy Baker is now the minority and, in turn, the “weird” stuff. They’re not easy to spot, so I took the liberty…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not reviewing Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League for Game Informer (that privilege belongs to looter-shooter expert Matt Miller), and for that I am grateful. But it’s not because the game is terrible. It’s because even after five hours, I still have no idea how I feel about it.
There is a scene in The Dark Knight Rises that I always assumed would become a meme, but never did. When Anne Hathaway’s Selina Kyle gets stopped trying to escape at the airport by Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s John Blake, he asks her about Bruce Wayne’s fate. In a fantastic one-line performance, she looks into his eyes with genuine uncertainty and fear and says simply, “I’m not sure.” And that’s exactly how I feel when someone asks me what I think of Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad.

I am not a fan of the genre Suicid…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's February, which means Steam Next Fest is upon us! If you're unfamiliar with what this festive celebration of games is, every year, Steam holds its Next Fest to highlight (mostly) indie games coming out this year and beyond with fun, often bite-sized demos. And the best part is the demos are completely free! 
Game Informer got access to some of these demos before their launch when Steam Next Fest begins on Monday, February 5, and enjoyed quite a few. That's why in today's installment of New Gameplay Today, hosts Wesely LeBlanc and Kyle Hilliard want to showcase three games: Pepper Grinder, a fun momentum-based platformer, Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge, a cozy frog farming sim, and Dystopika, a chill cyberpunk city builder. 
Check out gameplay of all three of these demos in the NGT below: 


All three of these games are set to launch sometime later this year, but if you're interested, you can try each out (and dozens more) as part of Steam Next Fest, which begins Monday, February 5, and ends Monday, February 12.

Sonic Mania is widely regarded as one of the blue blur’s best games. More than six years after its 2017 release, that sentiment remains as strong as ever, even after recent outings like 2022’s Sonic Frontiers and this year’s Sonic Superstars. While published by Sega, longtime Sonic fans who grew up playing the series, like Christian Whitehead, Hunter Bridges, Dave Padilla, Brad Flick, Tom Fry, and others, led the game’s development. And without speculating too much, the degree of separation afforded to these fans-turned-developers allowed Sonic Mania to feel l…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill: The Short Message shadow dropped yesterday following the conclusion of the PlayStation State of Play for the affordable price of free-ninety-free. The PS5-exclusive adventure follows a troubled teenager named Anita as she searches for her friend Maya in a decidedly not-okay apartment building. From the first-person perspective to psychological tricks and an oppressive atmosphere, The Short Message sports heavy P.T. vibes. If that sounds too terrifying, or if you don't own a PS5, you can watch me play the brief adventure from start to finish in this archived live stream.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year’s remake of Resident Evil 4 was a fantastic game, and the addition of a revamped Separate Ways DLC made it even better. But if you’ve been holding out on jumping into Leon’s mission to save Ashley, now may be a good time to take on Las Plagas with the announcement of Resident Evil 4 Gold Edition.


Launching on February 9, this version includes the base game, Separate Ways, and the Extra DLC pack (previously only available in the Deluxe Edition) of character skins, weapons, and items. Of course, The Mercenaries mode serves as free DLC. The price is unknown at the time of publishing, but if you haven't picked up the game on console, PC, iOS, or PS VR2, this looks to be a good way to get everything in one neat package. 
Resident Evil 4 Gold Edition is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2013, an unassuming Xbox Live Arcade game was released called Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Early looks made it seem like a pleasant environmental puzzle game about a pair of brothers going on an adventure, but actually playing the game showcased an impressive and specific point of view from its creator, Josef Fares. You can read Game Informer's review of the original Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons by following the link. The game was both heartwarming and heartbreaking, and to this day still features some of the best examples of gameplay as storytelling, and it's all done without any proper dialogue. After Brothers' release, Fares went on to found Hazelight, the studio behind A Way Out and It Takes Two.
Now, 10 years later, developer Avantgarden Games is preparing to release a remake of the game on February 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Join Marcus Stewart and me as we take a look at the new version and reminisce about the original.

WWE 2K has steadily climbed the ladder of quality over the past two entries. A strong comeback in 2K22 saw initiative but meaningful improvements in 2K23, and the series is arguably the strongest it's ever been. But a new year means another opportunity to retain the title for best wrestling sim or drop it to someone else. On the morning of the Royal Rumble last Saturday, I got to sample WWE 2K24’s notable new additions at a special preview event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's announcement of Sonic x Shadow Generations brought all kinds of love for Sonic's dark doppelganger as longtime fans celebrate Shadow's return after being absent from recent projects like Sonic Superstars and Sonic Frontiers. However, players won't need to wait for the fall launch of Sonic x Shadow Generations to enjoy speeding around as Shadow, as Sega also announced it is celebrating today's announcement by releasing a free equippable DLC costume to Sonic Superstars on February 15.
Sonic Superstars already includes several other skins you can equip onto your characters, ranging from Lego costumes to a Santa costume for Sonic to even the original prototype rabbit design. No screenshots or photos have been released for the newly announced Shadow costume in Sonic Superstars.
In July 2023, I asked Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka why Shadow isn't in Sonic Superstars. "Shadow is from the Modern series of characters and gameplay that we have introduced," Iizuka says. "The Classic series exists before the Modern series, so they haven't met at that time. There's no relationship, so we won't be bringing Shadow into the Classic series. Unfortunately, Shadow was in a capsule at that time."
By adding Shadow as an equippable skin, Iizuka and the rest of Sonic Team are able to circumvent the lore reasoning for leaving Shadow on the sidelines for Superstars. This year is shaping up to be the Year of Shadow for the Sonic brand. Shadow is coming to Sonic Superstars as an equippable skin, he's co-headlining the aforementioned Sonic Generations remaster in the fall, and he figures to be one of the main attractions in the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film when that hits theaters in December.
Sonic Superstars launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 17, 2023. The free Shadow costume arrives in Sonic Superstars as free DLC on February 15. For more on that game, check out our review here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[V Rising, the popular survival action RPG, is branching away from PC and making its way to PS5 sometime this year. The news was announced during today’s State of Play.
The game, which first entered Steam Early Access in May 2022, puts players in the immortal shoes of a weak vampire who awakens after slumbering for centuries. Players must regain their strength and rebuild their castle, which, among other things, involves enslaving humans to do their bidding. Whatever your method of rebuilding your might and fending off foes, you’ll have to plan around a day/night cycle since sunlight is a big no-no for your well being. V Rising can be played alone or alongside friends in multiplayer. 


Interestingly, since Sony doesn't have an Early Access style program, one has to wonder if V Rising’s arrival will coincide with an impending 1.0 launch on PC. V Rising was a big hit when it first arrived on Steam and has garnered positive reviews, so here's hoping the experience translates well on console.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot on the heels of the latest Death Stranding 2 trailer during Sony's most recent State of Play livestream, Hideo Kojima, the head of Kojima Productions, announced that alongside Sony, his company is making a brand new IP. Not only that, but it is, as Kojima put it, an "action espionage" game.
If that genre sounds vaguely familiar in relation to Kojima, that might be because the tagline of his global breakthrough, Metal Gear Solid, released in 1998, used the tagline "Tactical Espionage Action." In normal people's terms, that means a stealth game. 


Kojima's return to the stealth genre, one he pioneered decades ago with the Metal Gear series, is still quite a ways off. As he tells it, development will begin in earnest after Death Stranding 2 is released sometime in 2025. 
He then went on to say a bunch of stuff that didn't make a ton of sense, though maybe one day it will in retrospect. This new game will also apparently be a movie "in terms of look, story, theme, cast, acting, fashion, and sound," Kojima said, before adding that with this new game, Kojima Productions hopes to "transcend the barriers between film and video games."]]></summary>

There wasn't much new in the trailer, but it does tease the action that awaits players when the full game launches this March. 
In combat, various weapons can be used, including Japanese swords and spears. As you develop a connection with the inventor Igashichi, you'll gain more access to devices like the Fire Pipe, which is basically a long-range flamethrower. There are also bayonets, which can provide quick melee hits when using ranged weapons. 
Rise of the Ronin takes place during the Bakumatsu period, and your connection with the people of Japan will greatly influence how your Ronin's story plays out. You can read more about that in Game Informer's Rise of the Ronin preview here. 
Check out all the new gameplay in the latest Rise of the Ronin trailer below: 


Rise of the Ronin hits PlayStation 5 exclusively on March 22, 2024.

As we highlighted in the game’s review, Dave the Diver was one of the welcome surprises of last year, offering a novel and amusing mix of gameplay experiences. Part of the game focuses on scuba diving and fishing, while another section of the game is about managing and growing a sushi restaurant, using the ingredients you gathered from the ocean. The game has a whimsical, lighthearted vibe and consistently entertaining gameplay, which together has garnered a lot of praise.


Alongside the release on PlayStation consoles, we also got a tease of a new crossover coming to Dave the Diver, in which Godzilla shows up in the strange waters of the Blue Hole. If we get to make sushi from a kaiju, it will be an awesome day, indeed. That new expansion to Dave’s adventure is set to arrive in May.]]></summary>

Notably, this PC release means more people will get to experience developer Supermassive Games' breakout narrative-driven horror. However, it's unclear if Supermassive is developing this or if a different team is handling it. 
PlayStation revealed this new version of Until Dawn, which it says has been "rebuilt" for PS5, during today's State of Play in a new cinematic trailer that highlights the improved fidelity. This new and improved version of Until Dawn comes hot on the heels of Sony announcing earlier this month that Shazam! director David F. Sandberg is directing a film adaptation of the game. 
Check out the Until Dawn remake trailer for yourself below: 


For more, read Game Informer's review of Until Dawn, and then check out our thoughts on its PlayStation VR spin-off, Until Dawn: Rush of Blood. Supermassive released a spiritual successor to Until Dawn in 2022 called The Quarry – read Game Informer's review here – but its next game is Little Nightmares III, which is due out sometime this year.

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for Orion Burger, the classic game by Sanctuary Woods. The engine also adds a few niceties that the original didn't have, such as mouse wheel handling, and using the spacebar to skip walk animations - something the original didn't do properly.
Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game's logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation. And please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, luck be with you. And remember, with the aliens cheating on the tests they set up for you, this will be no easy task.
