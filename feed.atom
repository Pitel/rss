        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven't played it, it's new to you
One might assume that the dawning of a new gaming generation would essentially bring an end to the flurry of remasters and remakes that we saw flood the market in the most recent decade. But of course not. Much like the film industry, the concept of taking a second pass at some beloved (and even not-so-beloved classics) is clearly here to stay — with no sign from the cash registers that it isn't still a hugely lucrative endeavor.
2022 contained two very extreme examples of the remaster/remake concept, namely in the form of Square Enix sliding-door RPG Live a Live and Naughty Dog's The Last of Us Part I. On one hand, we had a long-lost RPG dating back to 1994 and Nintendo's Super Famicom, while on the other we had a remake of a game less than 10 years old — one that had already been remastered at that.
It will be interesting to see how blurry the lines become in regards to how long is "long enough"? And while I have zero problem with the concept of remakes and remasters per se, it's worth raising an eyebrow at the idea that each new generation of hardware immediately requires the re-establishment of the previous generation's best-selling games. Not franchises. Games. Time — and the creativity of the next wave of studios, developers, and players — will tell.
Here are the nominees for Destructoid’s Best Remaster/Remake of 2022
Live a Live
Metal Max Xeno Reborn
Pac-Man World Re-Pac
Tactics Ogre: Reborn
The Last of Us Part I
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe
World of Warcraft Classic: Wrath of the Lich King

Every new generation of Pokémon offers new stories, makeovers, and evolutions to some of the more overlooked 'mons in the 'dex, and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is no different. Although we've only got a handful of regional variations in Paldea, that doesn't mean that ScarVi hasn't revitalised and re-imagined some of the returning Pokémon that frolic across its open world.
We've rounded up our favourite Pokémon glow ups from Gen 9, from the cool redesigns to the rehabilitation of some Pokémon that we thought were kinda uncool before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Switch and last-gen versions of Hogwarts Legacy have been delayed. The game is still slated to release on February 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. However, everyone else will have to wait a few more months. 
The open-world Wizarding World adventure now has two additional release dates. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions launch on April 4. The Switch port comes a few months later, on July 25. Developer Avalanche says it decided to stagger the release to ensure the best possible experience on each platform. 
Hogwarts Legacy will launch on April 4, 2023 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and on July 25, 2023 for Nintendo Switch. The team is looking forward to bringing you the game and we want to deliver the best possible game experience across all platforms.
December 13, 2022
Additionally, a game FAQ about the change in dates clarifies that the PS4/XB1 Deluxe Editions will not include the 72-hour early access that the current-gen and PC bundle is receiving.

Hogwarts Legacy will be taking some extra time to open its doors for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch owners. Warner Bros. Games and Avalanche confirm today that these three versions are all being pushed back later into 2023.
The PS4 and Xbox One versions of Hogwarts Legacy will be launching on April 4, 2023. Meanwhile, the Nintendo Switch option will go live on July 25, 2023. PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC are still getting Hogwarts Legacy on its original release date of February 10.
While Hogwarts Legacy is also slotted to have 72-hour early access for those who put up some extra cash for the Deluxe Edition, that will only apply to the newer versions of the game. PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC purchases will be able to get the three-day early access, but PS4 and Xbox One Deluxe buyers will have their games go live on April 4, same as the Standard Edition.

"The team is looking forward to bringing you the game and we want to deliver the best possible game experience across all platforms," said the Hogwarts Legacy team in a statement on social media.
School's out
Several studios have been grappling with launching on multiple generations of consoles. While Marvel's Midnight Suns is live right now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, the previous generation's console versions (and Switch too) have been pushed back to an indeterminate date. Gotham Knights dropped its last-gen versions, instead launching only for the newer hardware and PC.
Seeing as Hogwarts Legacy has already encountered some delays and its Nintendo Switch version was set to move too, the launch focus now sits squarely on new consoles. It might make some folks wary of how the project will turn out, though others may be thankful that it's not the book series' author creating problems for once.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 'Everything Must Go' bundle is priced to move
The virtual DJ sim Fuser is set to shut down its online services next week. But before that, Harmonix is clearing the shelves of its Diamond Shop.
Harmonix is giving away all the Diamond Shop items in Fuser, through an "Everything Must Go" bundle. The Diamond Shop is Fuser's extra cosmetics shop, where players could previous spend an in-game currency to pick up special aesthetic pieces.
Since the online and store services of Fuser will be shutting down on December 19, it looks like Harmonix has decided to just let everyone grab what they want before it's gone forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2lE0BY26dw
While the online portion of the game will be shut down, Fuser will still be playable offline. So if you want to look good while you grind the campaign or just freestyle, this is your chance to pick these up.
The Diamond Shop notably doesn't include DLC tracks, though. If you want to add any music to your crate before the store shuts down, you'll need to do that before December 19.
Give the beat, boys, and free my soul
It's still a bummer to see Fuser shutting down like this. I just did a multiplayer session over the weekend with some friends, and was reminded of how fun Fuser can be to play in a group.
Though the actual tech and solo side will stay up, the multiplayer will be turning off and no more new music will be on the way. If you're looking to grab what you can, while you can, the time to do so is gradually winding down to Fuser's live service shutdown on the 19th.

But even I have to admit that it's a platform that has some of the most compelling releases of the year, every year. When it's easier for small, independent teams to publish to platforms like Steam or itch.io, the cream usually tends to rise to the top, so that PC is always one of the most stacked "best of the year" categories, in my opinion. 2022 was no exception, because this banger-filled list is making it really difficult to try and decide which game is gonna take my vote.

Today marks the 20th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker’s Japanese release and after all of these years, we think that it is finally safe to say that Nintendo’s punt paid off. By ‘punt’ we don’t refer to the idea of putting Link on a boat – whatever will they think of next, putting him on a train?? – nor the chance to freely move the camera ourselves. We’re talking about the decision to take the grizzled hero of Ocarina of Time and Majora’s Mask and make him look like he had gone 12 rounds with Walt Disney.
In the ensuing 20 years, this so-called ‘Toon Link’ has appeared in a number of locations. From handheld series entries to Smash Bros. fighters and amiibo figures, this little guy has been there, done that and got the t-shirt (cue ‘Get Item’ sound effect); but the last time we saw him leading his own adventure was in Tri Force Heroes – securely hammering the final nail into the coffin of the cel-shaded hero.

Following on from its official reveal at last week's Game Awards, studio Housemarque has released the PC specifications for its wicked, chrono-confusing blaster Returnal — which, following its celebrated run on PS5, will finally be headed to the PC platform (via Steam) in early 2023.
As those who have played Returnal will attest, the sci-fi epic is a visually dazzling experience, jam-packed with sparkling effects, intricately designed enemies, and almost constant, even chaotic, action setpieces. The "Recommended" PC specs reflect this, asking for a pretty beefy 32GB in RAM, as well as an nVidia RTX 2070 (8GB) and a six-core processor. In addition, the specs strongly recommend that Returnal be installed on an SSD, with a footprint of 60GB.

With few execeptions, World of Warcraft expansions generally deliver at launch. This is the honeymoon period. The part where you're just getting to a new theme park for the first time, all the rides are fresh, and the food tastes good: before you start to get bored, and you realize they use too much salt.
WoW: Dragonflight takes a long time to get to that point: perhaps longer than most expansions in the series' history. It's a great direction for WoW, and it'll be interesting to see if they keep it up.

World of Warcraft: Dragonflight (PC)
Developer: Blizzard
Publisher: Blizzard
Released: November 28, 2022
MSRP: $39.99
Dragonflight's big gimmick involves flying mounts: but with a twist. After the initial hour intro, you're given the opportunity to command your own dr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No relation to the Scottish soap opera.
Wayforward is on the top level when it comes to long-standing indie developers. Sure, not every game is a winner but when they do land, the studio knocks it out of the park. A long history of bangers has made it one of the most respected developers in the game, and one genre it consistently excels in is the old-school beat ‘em’ up. Even with pedigree that includes the highly underappreciated Double Dragon Neon, we were shocked with just how amazing 2019’s River City Girls was, ending up as one of our favourite games in an extremely strong year. Three years later comes River City Girls 2, which continues the adventure of Misako and Kyoko in a strong follow-up that maybe treads too much familiar ground and stumbles a little, at least on Switch.
Right away we’re treated to another gorgeous animated opening, with another cracking intro song from Megan McDuffee. One of the standouts from the 2019 original was McDuffee's fantastic soundtrack, and thankfully River City Girls 2 does not disappoint in that department. Each area of the game brings its own set of tracks, including the return of the vocal tracks themed to each boss, and even ventures into different genres with Mega Ran’s River City Girls Anthem. Luckily, if you liked the first game's tunes a lot, they play throughout this game and are unlockables that can be played in your hideout.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII first came out in 2007 as part of Square Enix's somewhat indulgent (and merely so-so) FF7 Compilation project, it was intended to fill in the backstory of one of the main game's most mysterious and spoilerific character twists. Namely that FF7 hero and perpetual mopey boy Cloud Strife wasn't quite who he thought he was, and that he actually owes a lot of his life (literally and figuratively) to the peppy, squat-loving ShinRa go-getter Zack Fair. (And if you're mad about me spoiling that 25-year-old story beat, wait until you see what they've done with FF7 Remake).
It's with FF7 Remake in mind, though, that many of you will probably be wondering where this swanky new remaster of FF7's PSP prequel fits into the increasingly up for grabs timeline of Squeenix's ongoing Remake trilogy. And just as the original Crisis Core was almost impossible to talk about without entering major spoiler territory for the main game of Final Fantasy VII, so it goes for Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion. For the spoiler-averse, I'll say this. If you don't already know the backstory of Zack and his relationship with arch mega villain Sephiroth, this is a perfectly fine action game that's received a lot of welcome polish for a 15-year old PSP title, but is probably still best experienced through a comprehensive YouTube retrospective as opposed to forking out £40 / $50 for it. For everyone else out there, though, let's get into it.

A hotfixing tool that was used for the first time today means there shouldn’t be any need for more weeks-long absences such as Bastion and Mei’s in Season 1. According to a Twitter thread by Overwatch 2’s commercial lead Jon Spector, the hotfix tool also lets Blizzard apply hero rebalances much more quickly. It doesn’t all sound like plain sailing, though.

If there's one thing can agree on about Persona 5's cast of characters: They're a good-looking bunch. of hipsters. And now, you too can adapt the visual style of your favorite heart-stealer or confidant, thanks to this mega make-up kit, now available to order from the face-plasterers at Game Beauty.
The Persona 5 x Game Beauty collection features a wide variety of lipsticks, shadows, pencils, blushers, and eyeliners, with colours and shades stylized after those lovable roustabouts, The Phantom Thieves. There are various items and sets available to order, ranging from bundles of character blushes to a $196 dollar Limited Edition set, which includes a variety of items from the new line in a slick collector's box.

Each item is based on a different element of Persona 5. We have a palette for the thieves themselves, eyeshadow for the palaces, and lipstick and further shadows repping the individual personas.

All items ship globally (excluding Japan) and all products are cruelty-free and vegan-friendly. The set appears to have a vivid and delightful color palette, and is sure to get you looking pretty anime for the coming Holidays. Speaking of which, the makeup would also make a fine gift for the many beautiful Persona fans in your life. I'm hoping that just a few swabs of shadow and a dab of eyeliner will instantly turn me into Sae Niijima. This might be wishful thinking for The Industry's Chris Moyse, but we all gotta dream...
The Persona x Game Beauty collection is available now from the Game Beauty website.

While the mid-'90s fast gave way to a love of 3D fighting titles, spearheaded by the success of Virtua Fighter, Tekken, and Dead or Alive, there were still plenty of developers who knew that the 2D aesthetic was where it was at. And due to budgetary or stylistic reasons, some franchises retained the flat-planed approach to the act of kicking names and taking ass.
And while Street Fighter III might not have quite been the launch success Capcom had hoped, the love for the game demonstrated by the most "hardcore" of the fighting game community was enough to ensure that many 2D fighters would continue to spill into the market, particularly in Japan, where the traditional look was perhaps better appreciated by digital sluggers.

Sega has announced that the most recent entry in its iconic Sonic the Hedgehog series, Sonic Frontiers, has smashed past 2.5 million global sales since its launch on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms earlier last month.
The new titles, which is considered to be the start of a fresh direction for the tumultuous platforming franchise, sees The Blue Blur whisked away to a strange and somewhat dystopian new world: The Starfall Islands. There, our hero embarks upon a quest to gather up the Chaos Emeralds and restore order, while locating the whereabouts of his equally at-sea friends. As the first truly "open-world" Sonic title, Sonic Frontiers aims to breath new life into the dice-roll series, offering up mechanics and features that are new to the Sonic the Hedgehog universe.
https://twitter.com/SEGA_OFFICIAL/status/1602468395512758274?s=20&t=HGjIckVkbEMy3ILyPxdFog
Launching on November 8, critics and fans have remained divisive in regard to the title, with some taking to the new direction, while others have felt that, while a gameplay overhaul was necessary, Sonic Frontiers' path isn't quite "it". The title also launched with various technical issues, with Sonic Team director likening the launch to a "global playtest". A statement that understandably raised eyebrows among some of those who had just dropped $60 on the new title. On the whole, Sonic Frontiers has been seen as a positive for the franchise, offering hope that perhaps that gen-yoo-ine top-tier Sonic title could see the light of day... someday.
Sonic Frontiers is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Triumph or Die.
Jitsu Squad is a beat 'em up heavily inspired by '90s classics like belt-scroller Final Fight and fighter Marvel vs. Capcom. You control the titular squad as they seek to stop the evil demon Origami from getting his hands on the Kusanagi Stone, a legendary MacGuffin which grants godly powers to anyone who can attain it. After a successful Kickstarter in early 2021 and a Steam release in March this year, Dutch indie team Tanuki Creative Studio’s exhilarating debut has come to Switch with an adequate conversion that could use some touching up.
As you boot up the game, it’s immediately apparent where the inspirations for Jitsu Squad lie. The character select screen feels ripped out of Street Fighter Alpha, it has a Saturday morning cartoon-esque art style, and references to a host of Capcom classics. The game anchors itself on nostalgia for the Marvel Vs. Capcom games, with enemies with claws running around shouting “berserker barrage” and super moves having character cut-ins with the name of said move. Even animations like Aros’ shoulder bash are almost one-to-one recreations of Hulk from MVC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Platinum Games vice president Hideki Kamiya doesn't see the Bayonetta series ever ending. 
He told IGN Japan this during a new interview, which touches on the creator's post-Bayonetta 3 thoughts, possible spin-off games, and a brand new game with the codename Project G.G. When asked if there's a chance players get a Bayonetta 4 or even a Bayonetta 5, Kamiya said he wants to make both of those games. 


"I personally can't conceive the Bayonetta series ever ending," Kamiya told IGN Japan. "I want to make a Bayonetta 4 and Bayonetta 5, and I intend on pitching them to the company."
Kamiya goes further, revealing that the team often talks "internally about how we could make nine of them." He also said he wants people to believe him when he says, "I'm not going to do anything that will betray the players." 
While not official announcements, it seems players hoping for a Bayonetta 4, 5, or even Bayonetta 9 are in luck if Kamiya remains at Platinum Games. While waiting for additional Bayonetta sequels, read about the upcoming spin-off, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, and then read Game Informer's Bayonetta 3 review.

A few months breaking the BioShock series on the Steam Deck, this pernicious piece of software now appears to be a major cause of Midnight Suns' stuttering issues, while seriously hobbling performance more generally. 


If you're playing via Steam, I strongly suggest following the lead of the, uh, thousands of people who’ve discovered this before me by disabling the 2K Launcher entirely. I’ve just tried this out and not only did the majority of the stuttering vanish, but my average frames per second shot up by nearly 62%. 62% better performance! From nixing a launcher that serves absolutely no purpose when you’re launching from Steam anyway! Madness.

The event began on 5th December and will run through until 16th December with a brand new game being made available for free on each day. It's also worth mentioning right off the bat that this offer only applies to North American eShop accounts.

This has an unfortunate heavy impact on the system and thus the detector was added to report it to the kernel log when a split-lock occurs. But earlier this year starting with Linux 5.19, kernel developers decided to "make life miserable" and intentionally slow down bad behaving apps that abuse split-locks. That in turn has caused problems for some games -- so far select Windows games running under Steam Play -- and thus a new kernel knob is being added to more easily adjust the behavior...]]></summary>

More specifically, Microsoft would reportedly allow Sony to put Call of Duty in the PlayStation Plus subscription service for the first time. Bloomberg reports that Sony is yet to take this offer.
The easiest explanation for Microsoft's sudden change of heart is likely the Federal Trade Commission's lawsuit, which was filed against the company under the suspicion that the acquisition would stifle competition in the games industry.

Crisis Core originally made its debut on the PlayStation Portable in 2007 and now returns with updated 3D models, full voiceovers, new music arrangements and much more. It stars Zack Fair, who is a rather important character in the Final Fantasy VII mythos. You can learn more in our review:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a tactics veteran on board, too
Adglobe and Binary Haze Interactive have announced their next project, heading into the realm of tactics. Redemption Reapers is a tactical RPG set to arrive on PC, PlayStation 4, and Switch in February 2023.
This new RPG is being developed by Adglobe and published by Binary Haze, both of which collaborated on 2021's Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights. But rather than tackle the Metroidvania genre again, they're looking towards tactics.
Redemption Reapers follows the Ashen Hawk Brigade as it battles against an invading legion. It looks very grim, with the hordes of monsters rampaging across the countryside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkYM9qfdXwU
Longtime Fire Emblem developer Masayuki Horikawa is working on the project, so it's got some of that lineage. Redemption Reapers also has a strong voice cast cued up, and a fairly different look from the usual tactics RPG.
"Following the success of Ender Lilies, we aimed to approach a new genre ideal for sharing our love of dark fantasy stories," said Binary Haze CEO Hiroyuki Kobayashi in a press release. "Redemption Reapers’ tactical RPG combat and emotional storytelling combine for a memorable experience we cannot wait to share with the world in early 2023."
Search for redemption
We certainly saw a lot of tactics in 2022. Games like Tactics Ogre: Reborn, Triangle Strategy, and Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope have made for a hefty backlog for most tactics fans.
Still, there's always room for something fresh and new. Ender Lilies, from what I've seen other folks say about it, certainly seems like it did that. And Redemption Reapers could see this team-up work out for a surprise hit once again.
It won't be a long wait, either way. Redemption Reapers aims to charge into a stacked early 2023 season, with a February launch window in mind. We'll see how it holds up against the horde in a few months' time.

Since its inception nearly three decades ago, Need for Speed’s best entries have combined style and substance to produce thrilling homages to the street racing scene. Need for Speed Unbound feels like the ultimate realization of that philosophy, creating one of the franchise’s best in years.
Sliding into the driver seat of the nearly 150 cars in Need for Speed Unbound feels terrific. Blasting down a straightaway in a McLaren delivers a remarkable sense of speed but nailing a corner drift in a Mitsubishi feels just as good.…]]></summary>

Chained Echoes is a new RPG from developer Matthias Linda, a communication designer who started working on the game in his spare time after work back in 2016. The project went on Kickstarter in 2019, and launched on December 8, 2022 for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC via Steam.

Video game movies have been the subject of plenty of ridicule over the last handful of decades. Wounded fans have long complained that out-of-touch Hollywood bigwigs just don't get the things they're adapting, and conventional wisdom has always held that video game movies are simply bad.
Fortunately for me, conventional wisdom is wrong. Yes, there are a lot of awful video game movies made by lazy filmmakers trying to cash in on a brand name. But there are also a lot of really excellent films based on video games - particularly in recent years. Video game movies show no sign of slowing down, so I'd like to go through ten of the finest examples ever made.

Licensed video games have always been like the interior of an abandoned barn. Sometimes you might find a long-abandoned car that is in dire need of restoration, but more likely, it’s just full of spiders. Die Hard on NES is neither of those things. It’s more like finding a long-abandoned lunar lander in an old barn. You wonder how it got there and if it’s a good idea to try it out.
It’s an absolutely bizarre game that transcends the discussion of whether it’s good or crap. It’s fascinating. The design is something that isn’t exactly without comparison, but the way it functions is out of this world.

Haaaaans!
I’d recommend watching Die Hard before playing this game. While knowing the movie is rarely needed for playing the licensed game, it’s practically requir…]]></summary>

I have a confession to make. I love buying gifts for people. Birthdays, Secret Santa, weddings, you name it, I look forward to the challenge! And the reason is that I used to be an absolutely terrible gift giver. I once gave a grown man a box of tea bags and a USB bracelet that ended up being too small to fit around his wrist.
I'm still embarrassed by these gifts, but I've learned my lesson. I've been on my gift-giving game ever since. Now I'm here to help you! You're already moving in the right direction by pinpointing a favorite hobby. Here are 10 gift ideas to get you thinking about the gamer in your life.

Hold the phone, readers — it's Snowboard Kids' (Snowboard Kiiiiiiids~) 25th anniversary, and we now feel really ancient. More importantly, the game's publisher, Atlus, acknowledged the game's birthday by announcing that all the games' soundtracks would be available on streaming services on Christmas day!
If you missed out on this back in the day, Snowboard Kids is one of the greatest snowboarding games around — 1080 Snowboarding wishes it could be this good (we kid, we kid). But this colourful Mario Kart take on snowboarding saw you play as one of six racers — Slash, Nancy, Jam, Tommy, Linda, or Shinobin — each with a fun design and personality traits that meant each of us at Nintendo Life Towers has one we can relate to the most. (This writer always liked Nancy because look at those '90s-as-heck pink dungarees and those bunny ears — and she always donned a lot of pink on the slopes, too.)

Armored Core VI: Fires Of Rubicon marks the return of the mechs they used to make before Demon's Souls set them on a different, swordier path, and IGN have just published a big interview that pokes into what bearing the Soulsbourne lineage might have on a game about flying mechs with guns and missiles. 
Armored Core director (and Sekiro lead designer) Masaru Yamamura welcomed Sekiro comparisons, while FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki was keen to stress they're treating it as an Armored Core game rather than a Soulsborne game.

The year is coming to a close, and so it's time to look back at what 2022 held, particularly for Xbox fans. Microsoft had a seemingly quiet year, but this year's nominees for Destructoid's best-in-class Xbox games spoke volumes.
As a reminder, our awards season here at Destructoid runs December-to-December. So while Halo Infinite wasn't eligible last year, it is this year, and it's likely better off for it. While 343 Industries' FPS struggled right out of the gate, a series of updates have been gradually turning the narrative around. The recent Forge beta and quality-of-life improvements are starting to make Infinite feel a bit more like what folks might have hoped for at launch, and so it's worth noting that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can you even buy a PS5 yet?
2022 has been a pretty action-packed year for Sony's premier gaming brand. And while arguably the first year that saw its two-year-old platform, PlayStation 5, accelerate its sales past the 25 million mark, the past 12 months have still seen a wide variety of new releases squeezed onto its best-selling predecessor, PS4, hardware that simply refuses to go gently into that good night.
Even visual stunners such as Guerrilla Games' Horizon Forbidden West and Sony Santa Monica's God of War Ragnarok were causing the PS4's modest CPU to sweat away, ensuring that the full transition to the ninth generation remains mired in a strange limbo. It's a good situation for the players, as the PS4 has an incredible install base of over 100 million users. But, as someone who previously worked retail for many generations, I can't remember a gaming generation that took this long to become mainline.
Still, there were some PS5-only releases, many of which boasted incredible visuals, dazzling effects, and very welcome high-speed load times. All in, it's a pretty good time to be a PlayStation owner. Many new titles are still compatible with PS4, while its bigger brother spearheads the charge into the next half-decade of gaming... Even if the physical console itself is still far, far too large for anybody's TV stand.
Here are the nominees for Destructoid's Best PlayStation Game of 2022:
Cult of The Lamb
Elden Ring
God of War: Ragnarok
Horizon Forbidden West
Sifu
Stranger in Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin
Stray

Ah, water. Calming, tranquil, fun. You’d struggle to find a game that doesn’t have some body of water in it. But Wavetale dives into the deep end. This adventure title from Thunderful sees players exploring by walking, running, and gliding on water. Initially released for Stadia, it has now spread to PC and consoles. For the most part, it’s relaxing to play, although it struggles a little on Switch.
Wavetale takes place in the aptly-named Strandville, a town that has been literally and figuratively flooded by baddies known as the Dirty Paws. You play as heroine Sigrid – a sarcastic, cynical young adult whose temperament comes through in the talented voice over actor’s sighs and mumbles. She lives with a grandmother who won’t even let her dip her toe in the surrounding sea, because the world beyond is covered with dark perilous clouds (‘Gloom’). Naturally, she longs to explore those uncharted waters.

It looks like updates for Mario Strikers: Battle League are coming to a close, and they're doing it with two familiar faces. The Wave 3 update adds Bowser Jr. and Birdo to the soccer title, in what Nintendo says is the final free update for Mario Strikers: Battle League.
Shown off in the latest trailer, Bowser Jr. is a balanced competitor with accurate passes. I guess the little dude learned teamwork somewhere. Birdo, meanwhile, is an offensive powerhouse with powerful shots. See them in action below:

While Mario Strikers has added three batches of post-launch characters and other updates, like special gear and arenas, it looks like the free updates are coming to a close. Over on social media, Nintendo UK says this is the "final free update" for Mario Strikers: Battle League.
Though the door may still be open for paid DLC somewhere down the line, it looks like this particular sports spinoff is coming to a close soon.
End of regulation
Mario Strikers: Battle League went live back in June of this year, and it seemed to deliver some high-octane soccer to fans. Soccer hadn't seen much love in the Mario sports-sphere in some time, so it was nice to see this particular line of spin-offs get a new entry.
While most of the Switch-era sports spinoffs have seen a decent number of free post-launch updates, it's sad to see this particular one come to a close. Whether this means we'll see another entry on the way soon or not isn't clear yet, but since the Switch seems to be sticking around a while, I'm hopeful we see some other sports entries revived. Mario needs to play some baseball again, is all I'm saying.
The third free update for Mario Strikers: Battle League goes live on December 13.

He also mentioned he plans to "create even more interesting games", if a triumph like Elden Ring still isn't good enough for you.

Bandai Namco has proudly announced that Tekken 7, one of the longest-life fighting games of all time, has smashed past an amazing 10 million sales. The announcement was made on the official Tekken Twitter, accompanied by an image of the entire cast at a very confusing dinner party, where people seem to float in mid-air, perspective is for the weak, and Kazumi brought a tiger.
Tekken 7 initially launched in Japanese arcades in the spring of 2015 (yep), before the expanded and rebalanced Fated Retribution hit the coin-op market one year later. This edition of the game would launch on PC and consoles worldwide in the summer of 2017 as simply Tekken 7.

It has roguelite bits to help it stand out a touch, with the ability to command your own shiny gem pal to bash enemies. But from what I've played so far, its lack of clarity makes its grind for currencies and mod slots and whatever else a tired affair that probably won't pull you away from the bazillion other games that require a lifetime investment.

AMD’s two new high-end GPUs, therefore, have a golden chance to be the more modestly designed, affordable alternatives that prospective 4K players were waiting for.

After the curtain fell on Keighley-fest '22, some Xbox fans took to social media to express their concern, disappointed that they didn't walk away with their own Death Stranding 2, Forspoken, or Bayonetta Origins. Vice President of Xbox Marketing, Aaron Greenberg, seemingly took note of this, and soon popped up on Twitter with a brief message hoping to reassure Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S owners.

At last week's The Game Awards show, Nintendo and Illumination unveiled a new clip from the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie, showcasing the main guy himself exploring Mushroom Kingdom alongside Keegan-Michael Key's character, Toad.
Something that long-time fans of Mario will have immediately noticed was the lovely background music, which was almost entirely comprised of tunes inspired by the video game series. While it probably isn't necessary to point out which game each and every tune comes from (we know you're a clever bunch, after all), it's nevertheless fun to see it in practice. Which is why YouTuber SuperWiiBros08 has uploaded a new video highlighting which Mario game each tune was inspired by.

The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series, which rolled out across late 2021 and early 2022 feature the original games in their entirety, spruced up with crisp HD visuals, overhauled U.I., tweaked gameplay, and beautifully rearranged scores, overseen by Final Fantasy's veteran composer Nobuo Uematsu.

Oh geez High on Life. You know, like, on one hand I'm keen on the whole "Justin Roiland voice" shtick, especially when it comes to Solar Opposites. But oh man....on the other....it's getting a little old, you know? Especially if most people in those worlds feel like they're just riffing, like everything is a stream of consciousness...like we're all just...part of one big galactic party that never ends? Like how Shrek was mostly just a series of riffs from the actors, and a lot of it didn't work? Look it up! On...Wikipedia...or Bing...or something.

Anyway, yeah, a lot of the Roiland shtick does still make me laugh, but there isn't a strong enough game around it to really hold up High on Life.

I’ve been excited about Forspoken since its reveal as Project Athia in 2020. The fish-out-of-water game set in a medieval fantasy realm is developed by Luminous Productions – an internal Square Enix team that helped develop Final Fantasy XV, a game I quite enjoyed despite its problems. It also features the talents of Uncharted series creator Amy Hennig and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story writer Gary Whitta on the narrative side, which makes me interested in playing through protagonist Frey Holland’s journey. 
On paper, it’s precisely the type of RPG I like to spend my time playing. After going hands-on for a few hour…]]></summary>

Digerati later shared their own video response on Twitter, with owner Sarah Alfieri saying Digerati have been “blindsided” by Grindheim’s statement.

They don't ship their games day and date on PC, they do not put their games into their subscription [service] when they launch their games."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are pleased to announce that ScummVM now supports Adibou 2, a popular educational game developed by Coktel Vision in 1996.
Designed for children from 4 to 7 years old, the world of Adibou is warm and full of surprises. It offers an intelligent and appealing introduction to essential knowledge like reading and math.
Whether you have young kids in your family, or are keen on reliving your childhood memories for a while, fetch the latest daily build of ScummVM, your own copy of Adibou 2, and start learning having fun with Adibou, Plop, Robitoc and Kicook!
You must copy the content of your Adibou “Environment” CD into the game directory added to ScummVM. Then, for any Adibou Application you want to add, just copy the content of their CD into a freely named subdirectory of the main game directory.
Only Read/Count 4-5 years, Read/Count 6-7 years applications are supported for now, but we hope Science, Music and English will come soon.
Currently ScummVM is aware of several Adibou versions in French, German and English, let us know if you own any language/version not yet registered. Please also report to the issue tracker any glitch you may encounter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The impact of the 2D Fallouts still reverberates, and the latest result of that is Space Wreck, an isometric RPG with a huge emphasis on screwing up.
Okay, maybe that's just my bad decisions talking. You're stranded on a wrecked space station after a failed pirate attack, and must get back to your ship. It's not super secret, but I almost don't want to say more than that, because this is a game overflowing with possibilities in a way that even Fallout seldom matched. It is not quite ready, but if the bugs can be ironed out, and perhaps more crucially, the save system reorganised, this could easily become one of the best RPGs of its kind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch each Friday at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.


If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I haven't been active in fandom spaces for years now, but lurking on the edges of social media forums dedicated to games I find cool does technically fall under the remit of my job. And let me tell you, the lead-up to a night like The Game Awards is always something else. Fringes of the Tomb Raider fanbase were getting hyped for the announcement of the next game because… well, it just feels like about time, right? The same went for Life Is Strange, but then, Life Is Strange fans have been predicting the imminent reveal of LIS3 literally on a weekly basis ever since True Colors launched, so they're bound to be right eventually. Ace Attorney stans were using numerology to predict that AA7 would finally get announced. Incredible scenes of completely baseless hype, and despite myself, I wanted to believe.
I genuinely daren't check in on any of those conversations today, because, honestly, it wasn't a massive night for long-running franchises, and I don't think I can handle the lamentations. And, while I'll admit that my initial skim of the trailers for familiar names came up a tad short, I'm not at all disappointed, because it looks like 2023 is going to be a stellar year for devs doing something cool with a new IP while learning a lot from their older projects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of today, Marvel Snap is giving away a fantastic new Storm variant, has put together a very pretty animated music video featuring music by Martin Garrix and JVKE, and combined it with a new in-game event called Hype the Hero. It’s a shame it hasn’t all been more clearly implemented, but we’ve got your back.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, the new horror game Choo-Choo Charles went viral online thanks to a very good trailer that teased a cat-and-mouse game with an evil train with spider legs. The train itself was pure nightmare fuel to behold, and the gameplay looked intense and fun and unlike any other game out there. Now, after playing it,…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year I compared the MMO Lost Ark to grey carpet, in the sense that the MMO Lost Ark is exactly like a grey carpet: trendy yet drab. At the time I'd been in the market for a new – and entirely necessary - underfoot experience, so I turned to a local Carpet Man to procure said plush. In the end he seemed pleased that I rebelled against the majority and opted for a sunny corn colour.
But the latest Armored Core VI trailer from this year's Geoff Awards had me in a contemplative mood. "Perhaps", I thought, "Carpet Man would appreciate FromSoftware's use of grey". Even though there isn't a fuzzy floor surface to be seen, could the trailer have triggered grey's redemption arc?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaking as a grown-ass man, I love trains. Not to the extent that I will ever bother to learn anything about them, or to identify one with any more specificity than “the pointy type”, “the blunt type” and “the chugga chugga choo choo all-aboard type”, but to the far milder extent that I simply enjoy watching them whizz around the place like big metal worms, and hearing their various little noises and honks. It’s trains! 
Just as a train might be lured into a station with the promise of fresh passengers (which are like treats to trains), I have been drawn inexorably toward Choo-Choo Charles, a ramshackle joke-game about a scary train that chases you around. Marooned on a perpetually dark island, you’re stalked by a monstrous locomotive with a set of great big spider legs and an unquenchable thirst for human blood.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the same way that shoulderpads sometimes become cool again, and everyone is buying over-sized hair scrunchies like wot I used to have when I was 11, games journalists are destined to be trapped in repeating discourse cycles of ever-decreasing size. This is why I will often specifically advise people to never, ever pitch me opinions about BioShock. Any opinions about BioShock have already been had. There are no more opinions to have about it.

My state of peace in this area was just scuppered by that utter bastard Ken Levine, the creative director and writing lead on both BioShock and BioShock Infinite, when he revealed some of the new game by his studio Ghost Story Games (aka The Developers Formerly Known As Irrational). As observed by everyone who saw the reveal at The Game Awards last night, Judas is basically BioShock in space. The bad news is that this will put more fuel in Thomas The Take Engine, but the good news is that, if it is indeed like BioShock, we can save ourselves a lot of time. When Judas comes out please just return to this article and insert a specific title and delete options as applicable.

This time around we'll be playing as Melinoë, modelled after the Greek goddess of nightmares and madness. She's also Zag's half-sister — yet another of the dozens of children, step-children, and foster-children of Hades knocking about the place — which brings me to my main take-away from the newly-confirmed existence of a Hades sequel: the title character is a really bad dad.

The paranormal game leans heavily into the PSX generation of survival horrors, with its fixed camera angles and even optional tank controls.

The Lords Of The Fallen was previously announced as a reboot to the 2014 game of almost the same name (they added a The this time), although it now seems to be a sort-of sequel. Judging from this trailer the devs would be quite happy if someone thought it was Dark Souls 4 by mistake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 16 got a fiery new trailer tonight, as well as a final release date of June 22nd 2023. At least that's the date for PS5 players. For us folks on PC, tonight's Game Awards trailer confirmed in tiny small print that Square Enix's next JRPG epic won't be landing on "other platforms" until December 31st 2023 at the earliest. So, unless Squeenix are going to deliver us a belated Christmas New Year special next year, I think it's safe to assume that FF16's PC release won't be available to summon until 2024. Still, based on what we've seen in its new "Revenge" trailer tonight, I reckon it will be well worth the wait.

I’ve been a card-carrying Transformers fan since Generation 1, so I’m somewhat confused by the trailer shown at The Game Awards tonight for Gears studio Splash Damage’s upcoming co-op action game Transformers: Reactivate. Yes, theoretically any rather large robot that changes shape counts as a Transformer. Possibly a GoBot, I’m not going to judge anyone on their lifestyle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A generation of fans may love From Software for its litany of Souls games, but the studio was once primarily known for its other beloved series, Armored Core. Tonight at The Game Awards, the studio revealed a new entry in its mech shooter franchise: Armored Core IV: Fires of Rubicon. 
A cinematic trailer set the table, which begins on a rather gloomy (and lava-filled) note before the mechs emerge to kick up the tempo a few notches. Fires of Rubicon is the first entry in the series since 2013’s Armored Core: Verdict Day, so fans have waited a long time for tonight’s news. Check out the trailer below.

Few concrete details are apparent from the trailer, but the spirit and visual styling of Cyberpunk 2077 remains in clear evidence. We know that Phantom Liberty is built as a spy-thriller set in a new district of Night City and that V somehow works together with the government of the New United States of America, and presumably alongside the newly revealed Solomon Reed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer for its upcoming sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, and it's another dark and terrifying look at the Soulslike series. 
Lords of the Fallen was released back in 2014, and GI Games revealed its long-awaited sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, during Gamescom's Opening Night Live back in August. A new trailer showcasing another look at the world of this sequel was released during The Game Awards 2022 tonight, and while it only featured a few glimpses of gameplay, it seems The Lords of the Fallen is shaping up to be a worthy successor. 
Watch The Lords of the Fallen gameplay teaser below: 


The Lords of the Fallen is set 1,000 years after the original Lords of the Fallen, and it's been designed with cooperative play in mind, according to Hexworks. Two players can play together in uninterrupted online play and experience an "expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative," according to a press release from earlier this year. 
The Lords of the Fallen will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. A release date has not yet been revealed, but it's due out sometime in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision has announced Crash Team Rumble, a 4v4 team-based online multiplayer game starring Crash Bandicoot and his furry/scaly friends. The game sees Toys for Bob, the studio behind Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, step back into the developer role for the Crash Bandicoot series, but with a decidedly different approach in tow.
Crash Team Rumble puts players in the shoes of Crash, Dingodile, and the Bandicoot's stable of friends and enemies. Each character has their own powers, personality, and playstyle as they duke it out in 4v4 competitions across a wide array of arenas. The teams compete in a variety of activities to bank the most Wumpa fruit in their drop-off zone while simultaneously defending it.
"We're so excited to unveil our fresh new take on multiplayer in the Crash universe with Crash Team Rumble," Paul Yan, co-studio head at Toys for Bob said in a press release. "Crash Team Rumble has something for everyone – easy pick-up and play for those who just want to jump in, while also providing skilled gamers the opportunity to leverage and master their hero's unique abilities."
You can see the reveal trailer below.


Crash Team Rumble comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2023. The game features cross-platform play, so you thankfully won't need to coordinate with friends or agonize over which version to pick up.]]></summary>

While Dontnod is known best for its work on the Life is Strange series, Banishers is an action/RPG, and it might share more in common with the studio's 2018 game Vampyr. For a better look at the game, check out the teaser below.


In the reveal trailer, a man sits across the table from a woman, holding her hand. Another person in the room calls the man a banisher, one who hunts ghosts. Then, the woman at the table dissolves away into a blue light, indicating that she was a ghost the whole time. Afterward, we get a glimpse at what gameplay might look like, with the man and his ghostly companion leaping into battle with an undead creature called a bonewalker.
Outside that brief trailer, we got a release window. Near the end of 2023, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

While the trailer didn’t offer a wealth of new details about the game, it did show off a pretty epic battle between the forces of Heaven and Hell. The forces seem to be led by Tyrael on one side and Lilith on the other side, and two massive armies clash over the course of the battle.

However, if you were hoping to get in on some PC / console crossplay action regarding the game's multiplayer, you may be disappointed, as publisher Sega confirmed to me today that they have "no plans to support crossplay between PC and consoles for multiplayer at launch".

Those cel-shaded visuals instantly got my attention when the new trailer for free-to-play MMORPG Blue Protocol popped up at The Game Awards this evening - and that Hiroyuki Sawano soundtrack ain't bad either (that's one for the Gundam Unicorn and Attack On Titan fans out there). It's being developed by Bandai Namco, but for some reason New World and Lost Ark publisher Amazon Games will be the ones bringing the MMO to the west in the second half of 2023. Either way, you can watch the trailer below and repeat my own very succinct inner monologue, if you like. Repeat after me: “Ooh, cel-shading. Nice.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 launches in August 2023, developer Larian Studios announced during tonight's The Game Awards. The announcement arrived alongside a new trailer and details surrounding the game's Collector's Edition.
The Collector's Edition includes a 25-centimeter Mindflayer vs. Drow battle diorama made from high-quality PVC/ABS plastic, an approximately 160-page hardcover art book, character sheets, a cloth map, a tadpole keyring, 32 die-cut stickers, three Magic: The Gathering booster packs featuring characters from Baldur's Gate 3, an oversized metal Baldur's Gate 3 D20 die, and a Collector's Edition certificate. The Collector's Edition will cost $270 and will be limited to 25,000 units worldwide.
On top of that news, we also received a trailer showing beloved characters Minsc and Jaheira's return, as well as the gameplay debut of the City of Baldur's Gate. You can see the trailer below.


Prior to the August 2023 1.0 launch, Larian will release Patch 9, which will include various improvements to the Early Access version, including a new playable class. Details of that will be revealed during a special streamed panel on December 14.
Baldur's Gate 3 has been in Early Access since 2020, so this August 2023 release window is a long time coming. Since that Early Access launch, Baldur's Gate 3 has achieved a "very positive" rating on Steam user reviews, with nearly 50,000 reviews logged as of this writing. According to the Steam page, version 1.0 will include all classes and races, and most spells from the Dungeons & Dragons Player's Handbook, plus Acts 2 and 3 of the Baldur's Gate 3 story.]]></summary>

In case you've forgotten, Nightingale is a PvE crafting survival game with a strong Victoriana vibe, but since our chat with them back at Summer Games Fest in June, and an early access delay into the first half of 2023 to accommodate the switch to Unreal Engine 5, we haven't heard too much about the game.


I got to natter with Flynn, director of production Leah Summers, and art director Neil Thompson earlier this week, ahead of the debut of a new trailer for Nightingale at The Game Awards this evening. They filled me in on how the game's blend of fairies and reality-hopping realmwalkers has progressed over the past year - and it turns out that players have had a lot to do with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for Tekken 8 and it features our first look at gameplay. 
The trailer showcases various Tekken 8 fighters, including series mainstay Jin Kazama. His mother, Jun Kazama, makes an appearance in the trailer as well to tell Jin that together, they'll "cleanse the world of its evil and corruption." 
Check out the Tekken 8 gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Tekken 8 is looking great. The trailer above is mostly focused on teasing details about the game's story, which will seemingly feature Jin and the struggles of his family dynamic (thanks, Heihachi). There are also quick clips of Tekken 8 gameplay, although it's void of the UI that showcases each fighter's HP and other elements. 
Tekken 8 was revealed earlier this year during a PlayStation State of Play held in September. That reveal trailer focused on Kazuya and his son, Jin, and you can watch it here. 
Tekken 8 will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam. It does not yet have a release date.

We got another glimpse at Inflexion's survival craft ‘em up during tonight's Game Awards, which showed off some of the magical enchantments you’ll get to encounter. Case in point: flying brollies. Have a watch below and tell me this don’t look like a right lark, guv’nor. What? I’m British, I can talk like Dick Van Dyke if I want.

        <updated>2022-12-09T02:10:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Death Stranding 2 – the sequel to one of the best games of the previous console generation – was announced tonight during The Game Awards. As you might expect from director Hideo Kojima, it was baffling. 
The trailer begins with Fragile, played by Lea Seydoux (No Time to Die, Crimes of the Future), running from some kind of threat while carrying a BB (a baby in an artificial womb; it's a whole thing) in tow. We then get a brief look at Sam Porter Bridges – the protagonist of the first game, played by Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) – who Fragile tells, "It's time for you to hit the road and start a new journey." Then everything truly goes off the rails. 
Giant mecha vehicles (not too unlike the titular Metal Gears from Kojima's previous series at Konami, Metal Gear Solid). Primary antagonist Higgs dressed like President Amelie Strand and playing an electric guitar. A BB pod full of tentacles. The ominous question, "Should we have connected," casting doubts on the entire objective of the first game – connecting the United States – all quickly flashes onscreen. If it sounds like a lot, it is. Check it out for yourself below:


We're calling it Death Stranding 2, but from the looks of it, the game is actually named DS2. Also, aside from the previously mentioned movie stars, it features Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon) and Shioli Kutsuna (Deadpool 2). 
During a brief interview after the trailer, Kojima revealed he and his company, Kojima Productions, are also working on another video game project and other "visual" works.
No real release information was given, though the game is once again being published by Sony. The trailer also said the footage was captured on a PS5. So, it might be safe to assume Death Stranding 2, like Death Stranding before it, will have some window of exclusivity on Sony platforms. Guerilla Games will also be acting as a support studio, and its proprietary engine, Decima, will once again be used for the game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new clip from Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League reveals that Kevin Conroy, who passed away earlier this year, will return to play Batman. Conroy made his first appearance as Batman in 1992’s Batman: The Animated Series and has continued to play the character in countless shows, movies, and games. He portrayed Batman in the Arkham games, the series Rocksteady is best known for.


Unlike the Arkham games, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a co-op shooter. Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, King Shark, and Deadshot are on a mission to stop the Justice League after supervillain Brainiac corrupts them and forces them to wreak havoc on humanity. While it sounds like a bleak premise, this trailer also gives a good look at the dark humor the Suicide Squad is known for.
Rocksteady also announced that the game would be coming out on May 26, 2023, just a few months from now. This news comes following years of delays and will set it eight years after the studio’s last game, Batman: Arkham Knight.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-12-09T01:44:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kratos voice actor Christopher Judge has revealed that he initially quit when he learned that someone other than God of War (2018) director Cory Barlog was directing God of War Ragnarök. Longtime Santa Monica Studios lead Eric Williams directed the sequel, which released last month. 
Fortunately for all of us, though, Barlog was able to convince Judge that quitting was not the right call. Judge touched on this during his lengthy speech at The Game Awards 2022 after accepting the award for best performance in a video game.


Here's what he said: 
"I think it's kind of common knowledge that we were honored to go to Tribeca after 2018, and when Cory took me outside and said he wouldn't be directing the next one, I literally did quit. I quit. And he said, 'Nah, I vouch for Eric.' And I said, 'Eric Williams better be a beast.' Eric Williams is a motherf---ing beast."
It's unclear if Judge legitimately quit or if he was just using these words to express his initial disappointment that Barlog was not returning to direct Ragnarök. Nonetheless, Barlog vouched for Williams, and now we have Ragnarök, one of our highest-rated games of 2022 here at Game Informer.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helping to ramp up an evening of world premieres at The Game Awards this evening, Supergiant Games revealed its newest game. Hot on the heels of the wild success of Hades, Supergiant is doing something it’s never done before: crafting a sequel.
After its previous work on titles like Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre, the studio’s new game takes us back to the roguelike playstyle of the original game, but with a new female lead fighting their way through hordes of enemies.
Instead of Zagreus’ attempted escape from Hades, Hades 2 sees players attempting to descend to fight against the titan named Kronos. The character is dubbed the “Princess of the Underworld” but given the previous game’s nod to Greek mythology, there’s a good bet that this new character has some interesting ties to the big players in that well-known pantheon.
Beyond the intriguing trailer, there’s no word on release date or console platform plans, but we do know to expect new details on Early Access in 2023, and that the game is coming to both Steam and Epic Game Store on PC.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-12-09T01:34:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost Story Games, the team led by BioShock creator Ken Levine, finally unveiled its first project. It's called Judas, and if you're a BioShock fan, you'll be happy with what you're about to see. 
To say this title follows in BioShock's footsteps would be an understatement. From its industrial sci-fi look to its first-person dual-wielding, superpowered action, Judas sports the familiar trappings of Levine's work at Irrational Games. Ghost Story describes it as a single-player, narrative-driven shooter and provided this tantalizing synopsis:
"You are the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to make or break alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you broke – or will you leave it to burn?"


Levine formed Ghost Story games in 2014 after he closed Irrational, only taking on a small group of designers from the former studio. They've been working on its first title ever since, though whether that game has always been Judas remains to be seen. After years of mostly silence, many wondered if we'd see anything come out of the studio; it was reported earlier this year that the team's first project had gone through a rocky patch. Thus, it's nice to see the fruits of their labor finally.
Judas doesn't have a release window, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At long last, Street Fighter 6 has a release date. Hot on the heels of a second beta test announcement (and retailer leaks earlier this morning), Capcom announced that the next entry arrives on June 2. On top of that, we received a new trailer and details on the Deluxe Edition.
When Street Fighter 6 launches, it will deliver new innovations like real-time commentary, multiple control schemes, and World Tour mode. The base game includes 18 characters ranging from iconic names like Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, and Blanka to new faces like Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly. For the full list of characters coming to the base game, head here.
The new trailer showed off the World Tour mode, which lets you customize your avatar and travel the world to locations like the US, France, and more. We also got a new look at several previously announced but not-yet-revealed characters, including Dee Jay, Manon, Marisa, and JP.


An earlier leak on Amazon also revealed Street Fighter 6's Deluxe Edition, which includes the base game, the Year 1 Character Pass featuring four characters, colors 3 through 10 of each Year 1 character, and a bonus 4,200 Drive Tickets for in-game purchases.
We recently flew to Osaka, Japan for our most recent cover story and came away impressed with the studio's vision and our extended hands-on time with the game. For more on our trip to Capcom's headquarters, including a fun Rapid-Fire interview and deep dives into the character designs, visit the cover hub by clicking on the banner below. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2, 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Piccolo Studio, the makers of 2019's Arise: A Simple Story, unveiled its next project, After Us, during The Game Awards.
Set on a dead Earth after the extinction of humans and wildlife, players control Gaia, the Spirit of Life, who must recover what’s left by restoring the souls of perished animals while learning how they met their fate. Unfortunately, the ravaged planet is now occupied by dangerous oil-drenched creatures called Devourers that Gaia must contend with as she clears the world of their corruption. After Us places a big emphasis on traversal, as Gaia can glide, jump, and dash across abstract environments, spreading beauty along the way.  


After Us will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next Spring.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 12/9/2022:
A "brief playable teaser" for Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon is available now within Bayonetta 3. According to Nintendo, "Players who purchased the Old Picture Book at Rodin’s shop, The Gates of Hell, using in-game currency and unlocked it with three keys will be able to access the teaser."
Original Story, 12/8/2022:
Hot on the heels of Bayonetta 3's release in October, tonight during The Game Awards, Platinum Games and Nintendo announced Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon. 
Stepping away from the series' traditional gameplay and visual style, Origins plays out in a cel-shaded art style and an isometric camera angle. It was hard to get too good a grasp on the gameplay from the trailer, though it does look akin to the Viola chapters from Bayonetta 3 – where the player character's combat actions are deemphasized over summons instead. Additionally, it appears that the main summon is Cheshire, who indeed was Viola's only summon in Bayonetta 3. Though time will tell if Origins fairs better. 
Narratively, you play as a young Bayonetta – or Cereza, as is her actual name. You can get a better idea of the overall story and see the game in action in the trailer below:


Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon will be released on Nintendo Switch on March 17, 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Upstream Arcade and publisher Good Shepherd Entertainment have revealed Mike Mignola's Hellboy Web of Wyrd, an upcoming roguelite action game with an art style reminiscent of classic Hellboy comics. 
This news was revealed during the pre-show segment of The Game Awards 2022 by way of a fancy trailer showcasing some of the game's methodical but (literally) punchy combat. The game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC sometime in the future, but a release date was not revealed. 


"Hellboy Web of Wyrd is a roguelite action adventure with an original story created in partnership with Dark Horse Comics and creator Mike Mignola," the game's Steam page reads. "When an agent goes missing, Hellboy investigates. Prepare for monstrous toe-to-toe brawling." 
As you can see in the trailer above, it's clear Upstream Arcade is aiming for Hellboy Web of Wyrd to feature a visual style reminiscent of Mike Mignola's original Hellboy comics. It's easy to see how characters, enemies, and more from those comics could be integrated into the game with such an art style as well.

Unfortunately, we'll have to wait to learn more but Hellboy fans will want to keep Web of Wyrd on their radar (especially given how tragically few Hellboy games out there exist).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Cells is getting an official Castlevania DLC crossover sometime early next year, called Dead Cells: Return To Castlevania, as announced today during The Game Awards pre-show. The news was announced via a brief animated trailer. 
The trailer didn't reveal too much about the DLC, nor did it show any looks at gameplay. Though, given Dead Cells is a Castlevania-inspired indie rogue-lite, we likely assume the core formula will remain roughly the same. The game's Steam page offers a bit more info: A gateway to a striking castle has suddenly appeared, and an imposing warrior called Richter asks you to help him vanquish the great evil within. Enticed by the promise of new loot rather than a sense of moral duty, you strike out through the grounds and corridors of the gothic castle to find and kill this mysterious Dracula.


 Additionally, the Steam page boats 51 classic Castlevania songs, 12 newly reimagined tracks, and a brand-new storyline. Gameplay unfolds throughout a fully-explorable Dracula's castle and will feature 14 Castlevania weapons, readapted into Dead Cell's gameplay, three "epic" boss fights, and 20 outfits from "Alucard, Richter Belmont, Simon Belmont, Maria Renard, Trevor Belmont, Sypha Belnades, or even Dracula himself."
No specific release date was given, but Return To Castlevania is expected to be released sometime during "Q1" 2023. It will be available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s still so much we don’t know about the next stealth strategy game from the makers of Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun. Until yesterday, all we had was a codename (“Süßkartoffel”, or Sweet Potato), and a few other scant business facts developer Mimimi Games posted about on their blog last year. In fact, the only concrete thing we really know about it right now is that it’s not going to be Shadow Tactics 2. 
However, in chatting to Mimimi this week about leaving real-time tactics behind in favour of their new "Stealth Strategy" label, I’ve managed to glean a few more details. Alas, Mimimi still aren’t ready to reveal Süßkartoffel’s official name just yet, but head of design Moritz Wagner told me it’s not only going to be much more beginner-friendly than their previous games, but that it will also be much more like one big sandbox this time, resisting the urge to limit players by strict level constraints. To me, it all sounded a bit like they were aiming for something akin to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, so I asked him about whether that was an accurate assessment of it. “Yes and no,” he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The makers of Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun and Desperados 3 have been thinking a lot about real-time tactics recently. Not just because they’re knee-deep in making their next tactics game at the moment, currently known as Codename Süßkartoffel (the word for "Sweet Potato" in their native German), but because they feel the genre as a whole doesn’t quite convey what’s so special about their catalogue of excellent stealth ‘em ups anymore. It’s a fair cop – despite appearing in our best strategy games list for many years, even I’ve struggled to come up with a succinct way of describing them. Thus, it’s time for a change, say the studio. 
In a blog post published today on Mimimi Games’ website, the studio announced they’re going to be referring to their work as “Stealth Strategy” games going forward, and they’re hoping this new genre label will help prospective players better understand their special blend of silent assassination tactics. This kind of shift isn’t without its challenges, though, so I caught up with the team at Mimimi to talk more about this newfound shift, and how it’s going to lay the foundations for what’s to come in Codename Süßkartoffel.

The colorful adventure game was first revealed at the same event in 2020. It stars a young woman who leaves her isolated village to explore the world for the first time on her bike. Unfortunately, the world is on the brink of suffering a mysterious catastrophe, and the woman collects memories of her experiences before everything falls apart. The bulk of the gameplay, naturally, consists of cycling to different locations and meeting the colorful personalities who inhabit them. You’ll document your adventures by taking photographs and making recordings. 


Season: A Letter to the Future will be available on PlayStation consoles and PC (both Steam and Epic). It's worth noting that pricing differs by platform. The game costs $29.99 on console and $24.99 on PC with an additional 10% launch discount until February 7.]]></summary>

Still, I will write about the game here! Sorry supporters.
Anyway, what I want to talk about is Xenoblade 3 – so far, at least – never losing sight of its inner tutorial. I've been hit with new, sometimes dizzying tutorials, tens of hours into the game's story. Rather than being bummed out by this, I'm ecstatic. In fact, I'd argue it's what makes the experience so special.

The game was almost unplayable on PC because shader compilation was causing stuttering whenever anything new happened for the first time, which is not ideal in any game, but especially not an atmospheric horror game with jump scares. It's hard to be terrified by something if the game pauses for over a second when it happens.
Anyway, the point is that a patch was released over the weekend, and another yesterday. I'm out of town right now, so I haven't been able to install the second, but I did play test the first one, and whaddaya know? The Callisto Protocol ran smooth for me, using a PC with the recommended specs.

That's probably why the 5800X3D is reportedly AMD's most popular CPU by sales - and it's also why this deal is coming to the fore. Right now, you can pick up this fast AF CPU for $300 thanks to an Ebay code (JOLLY15), a hefty reduction from its launch price of $450.

That's because it's designed to undercut the likes of the WD SN850, Seagate Firecuda 530 and Samsung 980 Pro, offering slightly slower sequential speeds at a lower price point. That tradeoff is one that I'd make in almost every situation, as you'll definitely notice the extra money in your wallet more than you'll notice a fractional difference in game load times!
The P5 Plus's 1TB model is the one discounted today, with a drop to £90.86 - that's the lowest price we've ever recorded for this model and a good value for a high-end SSD suitable for PC and PS5.

But Mina The Hollower was never meant to be the studio’s next game. It was a side project of Yacht Club Games designer Alec Faulkner - one that no one but him knew existed.
After raising over $1.2M on Kickstarter in February, I wanted to learn more about Alec’s journey from intern to game director, how he pitched his “Gothic Prototype” to the Yacht Club, and ultimately, how the team rallied behind him in hopes of delivering another series as prolific as Shovel Knight. The result is a 36-minute documentary covering the making of Mina The Hollower, which you can watch below.

Final Fantasy VII is experiencing a strange identity shift. The ongoing remake is changing the original canon in bold ways while spin-offs like the 2006 PlayStation 2 game Dirge of Cerberus are being folded in for larger roles in the main story. And then there are new spin-offs, like First Soldier, the online mobile battle royale shutting down early next year, and also plans for another remake called Ever Crisis, a mobile game that will reexamine Final Fantasy VII’s timeline. With all that swirling …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Quest Treasures is a prequel to Dragon Quest 11. It follows the exploits of Erik and his sister, Mia, well before they met up with The Luminary and follows them on their adventure to find treasure, escape vikings, and jump on top of the heads of monsters in order to reach higher platforms. Unlike Dragon Quest 11, Treasures is an action game with open environments and a focus on collecting valuables. It releases December 9 on Nintendo Switch and we will have a review for the game on gameinformer.com soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiple beta releases often indicate lots of bugs to be fixed, but in this case we got carried away adding features and thought more testing was needed. New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details). If you’ve been working on an entry for the title game competition, it’s time to finish and submit it! Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>
