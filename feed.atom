When I first played Astro's Playroom on the PlayStation 5, I was blown away by its gorgeous art style, engaging level design, and overwhelming charm. Each level was so carefully packed with easter eggs and fun platforming challenges that I assumed it was a positive side-effect of the game's short playtime; the only way so much delight could be crammed into each stage was because the development team only had so many levels to work with, so a longer game would probably feel less impressive. But after going hands-on with Astro Bot, the full-fledged sequel from Team Asobi, I can …]]></summary>

This update might not allow you to play as a Ghoul, but it does open up an interesting new location and the opportunity to delve for more loot, so it's well worth jumping into. 


You'll pick up An Unlikely Invitation when you next launch Fallout 76. The quest will be automatically added to your Main Quests on your PipBoy. You should open it and track it so you can follow each step as it evolves because this one involves a lot of trekking across the map.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 users can finally join Discord voice chat directly from their console, thanks to the rollout of a new system update. The PS5 update will roll out gradually over the coming weeks for all accounts. 


With the coming update, PS5 players will be able to join a Discord voice chat without any need to rely on Discord PC or mobile application.


How to join Discord voice chat on PS5


Once the update becomes available, install it. You also need to make sure that your PlayStation Network and Discord accounts are linked. Open the Discord tab in Game Base. For those unfamiliar, the Game Base is part of the PS5 Control Center. Then, choose the desired Discord server or DM group. After selecting your preferred voice channel, you will see more details such as the existing Discord members in the channel. 


The new update will also bring PS5 console notification whenever a Discord user calls you, and opening that notification will allow you to instantly join the Discord voice chat on your PS5.


Sony is rolling out the update gradually in all regions, starting with Japan/Asia. The update will then be made available in Europe, Australia/New Zealand, and the Middle East, followed by the Americas.


Profile Share featuring coming next week

Moreover, Sony is also rolling out the Profile Share feature next week. This feature will allow players to share their PlayStation Network profile on messaging, and social apps. To share your PSN profile, select “Share Profile” from the PlayStation App or the PS5 console. This will create a shareable link or QR code. When the intended recipient opens the link or scans the QR code, they will receive the option to add you as a friend on the PlayStation Network.

Featuring interviews with current and past employees at the company, it’s been revealed that a stand-alone expansion for Disco Elysium was well into development when it was canceled, and much of the team was laid off.


Disco Elysium was released in 2019 to wide acclaim, and it seemed like fertile ground for ZA/UM to develop a series around. However, in 2022, three of the lead developers on the team, Robert Kurvitz, Aleksander Rostov, and Helen Hindpere, departed. Reports on these departures are conflicting, with Kurvitz and Rostov accusing the management of financial malfeasance, while official statements from the company say that they were fired for misconduct.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting today at 10 a.m. PST, players in Palia have a chance to band together and "bug out" as they strive to catch 25 million collective insects. If the goal is reached, all players will receive some special rewards.


Apparently, Tish bet Auni that he couldn’t catch 25 million insects before June 20, which seems a little unfair coming from a grown woman aimed at a child boasting just a net and some Smoke Bombs. However, that’s where we come in. 


Thankfully, in return for our help, Auni is willing to share the loot and if he wins the bet, we’ll get the following rewards:



Leafy Flutterfox Plush, a brand new plush designed with the Spring season in mind


3 Mixed Hydrangea flower seedlings



In order to get these rewards, you’ll need to log in between 11 a.m. PST on June 20 and 7 a.m. on June 25. If you do, you can expect to have some mail waiting for you from Auni, including the loot.

Now I know, 25 million seems like a gargantuan amount of insects (I hope we’re releasing them afterwards, or there’s going to be a bit of an infestation going on somewhere), but the dev team at Singularity 6 have some advice to offer. 


They recommend joining the official Palia Discord server, where there is a dedicated Bug Hunting channel where people can organize groups to head out in search of bugs to catch. I can attest to this, as the channel is currently the most active on the whole server. 


They also recommend crafting and using Honey Lures. This item is used to attract insects to your location for three minutes. To unlock the Honey Lure recipe, you’ll need to reach at least level 7 in Bug Catching and the recipe costs 2,000 Gold. You can also purchase them for 75 Bug Catching Medals once you reach level 10.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long after its 2019 release, the Kingdom Hearts 3 mod scene is still thriving, especially with the Steam launch this week. And thanks to one modder, Larxian, Final Fantasy may have a little more to explore in Kingdom Hearts as they've dropped Sora right into the Final Fantasy 15 city, Insomnia, with their in-development mod. 


Sora uses his flowmotion abilities all over Insomnia


Insomnia is the crown city of Final Fantasy 15, in which Noctis lived throughout his childhood and he returns to later in life. In this mod, we can play as Sora swinging on the architecture of the city and zooming from place to place in an instant. It's reminiscent of Noctis maneuvering his way around the skyscraper in the initial Final Fantasy Versus XIII reveal trailer...just less gory, a little more Disney. 




Larxian began to share details on social media about the mod project in March 2023. They have since added NPCs to the city and even included a Moogle Shop. The modder tracks their progress on X, and you can follow along by searching for #InsomniaMod. While there's no ETA just yet, it looks like they've made plenty of headway in bringing Insomnia to life. 


This Kingdom Hearts 3 mod might be the beginning of what's to come


Ever since the Kingdom Hearts 3 secret movie, many fans have speculated on the parallels between the Versus XIII marketing and the secret movie. It's all thanks to Kingdom Hearts director Tetsuya Nomura's history as the director of the Versus XIII project before it transitioned to Final Fantasy 15. One of the last shots of the Kingdom Hearts 3 Re: Mind secret movie is influenced by the scene in which Noctis is sitting at the back of a limousine car, looking out towards the window. Yozora is doing the exact same motion. 




Perhaps in Kingdom Hearts 4, we'll see Quadratum's version of Insomnia and the skyscraper, like those we see in this mod.

Helldivers 2 has 51 armor sets to mix and match. They're separated into three types — Heavy, Medium, and Light — and come equipped with an Armor Passive that gives you a small boon. Developer Arrowhead Games is constantly delivering more armor sets via monthly Warbonds and the Superstore, so be sure to keep an eye out for more ways to increase your style points.

Some of these games offer pure cozy vibes, while others may be better described as cozy-adjacent. They’re not all life-sims, but they all offer something unique and provided me with positive vibes while I played. Here’s the ten that came out on top in my playtesting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony released the list of its highest-downloaded games across all its platforms in May, and Rare’s Sea of Thieves has topped the PS5 charts in two territories. The former Xbox exclusive first arrived on the platform on April 30. 
A PlayStation Blog post reveals that Sea of Thieves was the best-selling PS5 title across the US/Canada and the EU, beating out top-performing games like Grand Theft Auto V, Madden NFL 24, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. That's quite the debut and shows that PlayStation owners have an appetite for the open-world co-op pirate game. It’s also worth noting that Grounded, another first-party Xbox exclusive that was brought to PlayStation in April, placed 11th on this list (for the US/Canada). 
Here’s the full list of top 20 best-selling PS5 games in the US/Canada for May:
Sea of Thieves
Madden NFL 24
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III
Helldivers 2
NBA 2K24
MLB The Show 24
Stellar Blade
Fallout 4
Who’s Your Daddy?!
Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege
Grounded
Another Crab’s Treasure
Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
NHL 24
Killer Klown’s From Outer Space: The Game
Rise of the Ronin
Assassin’s Creed Mirage
WWE 2K24
Elden Ring
For more on Sea of Thieves, we spoke to Rare to reflect on the series shortly before its PS5 launch. You can read that retrospective here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fortnite x Metallica event is now live, with several cosmetics, quests, and Metallica skins available to obtain. If you're trying to finish every quest, you'll have to learn how to spray Metallica concert images around the map to show your dedication and spread the word. 


How to spray Metallica concert images in Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 3


Spraying Metallica concert images during the Chapter 5, Season 3 event requires travelling to three different locations around Fortnite's map, opening your emote wheel, and using a Metallica spray on the location. You won't have to unlock the spray beforehand, as it'll automatically appear as the only option in your emote wheel once you approach a spot.


There are three named locations you can visit to spray Metallica images:



Sandy Steppes


Restored Reels


Reckless Railways



Each POI has two spray locations you can use, so you only need to visit two landmarks if you get two in one spot. Since you only need three of the six available spray locations, you can use the spray at two walls in one area before quickly running to another and getting one last spray down.

You also don't need to get all three sprays down during one match. If you land in a POI, get a spray or two down, and then are eliminated during a fight, you can hop in during your next round and finish the quest. Finishing it in one go makes the process slightly faster, but generally speaking, you don't have to stress about it too much.


Once you finish the Metallica event quest, you'll unlock the Lightning Star spray to use during any of your matches. You'll also get one step closer to completing every quest, rewarding you with posters, emotes, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Leaked reports that a Final Fantasy Tactics remaster is in development have been confirmed by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier’s verified Reddit account today.


Rumors have been circulating since 2021, when a leak of the Geforce Now games database suggested its existence. Since then, other games named on that list have been released or announced, suggesting the accuracy of it.


The Reddit thread is part of revelations around the prolific leaker of information about Sega and Atlus, Midori. News about their identity raised discussion over the accuracy of their previous leaks, with the thread singling out reports that Visions of Mana is being delayed on PS4. A comment questioning the Final Fantasy Tactics remaster was brought up by another user, and noted newshound Jason Schreier stepped in to say, “Hi. The Final Fantasy Tactics remaster is real and happening.”


This news is not arriving from Square Enix, so it shouldn’t be taken as official confirmation. However, the Reddit account is verified as belonging to Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier, and he is a generally reliable source.


A remaster of 1997’s Final Fantasy Tactics wouldn’t be all that surprising, as Tactics Ogre just received a similar treatment in 2022, and the two games are cut from the same cloth. A suggested remake of Final Fantasy IX was also part of the Geforce Now leak, which is a much more difficult-to-believe possibility, but given the accuracy of the list so far, anything could happen.

You can find the Viper Commandos Warbond in the Acquisition Menu, accessible while in your Super Destroyer ship. Scroll down until you see it below the previous Warbond, Polar Patriots. As it is a Premium Warbond, you can only get it by exchanging 1,000 Super Credits (SC). If you haven't farmed enough credits, you can consider purchasing the currency you need via the 'Super Credits' tab in the Acquisition Center. Keep in mind that it's $10 for 1,000 SC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was almost a year ago that we learned of modern console port plans for Parasol Stars: The Story of Bubble Bobble 3. Now ININ has come through with a date, opening the umbrella for a smooth glide to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox consoles on July 11, 2024.


With that lovely news comes an appropriately bubbly release date trailer, showing some footage of the port and promising "many quality-of-life enhancements." Please, enjoy another pre-release peek at Bub and Bob in their stout little human forms and prep for the arrival of the Rainbow Islands sequel below.




As for what those enhancements are, the updated port has added in the usual retro bells and whistles, namely the inclusion of save states and the ability to rewind gameplay. There are also shaders and filters that aim to recreate the experience of playing on a CRT screen. Beyond that, the hook here is very much the ability to play and own a relatively obscure entry in Taito's storied series.


There's no mention of including the other versions — which spanned Atari ST, Amiga, Game Boy, and NES — so it looks like we're just getting the PC Engine/Turbografx-16 version of Parasol Stars. That's fine and dandy, especially considering the fact that it's priced at a cool $9.99. Nintendo Switch pre-orders are live now and 10 percent off until July 12, with Xbox pre-orders to follow on June 19. The game can also be wishlisted on PlayStation.

Players assume the role of a pilot tasked with navigating treacherous undersea environments teeming with monstrous creatures. Drawing from the survival roguelike elements of Vampire Survivors, the game challenges players to scavenge for resources, upgrade their mech, and battle increasingly formidable adversaries.

Summer Game Fest is over for another year, and it was a pretty jam-packed event. There are still plenty of stuff to come out of the show over the coming weeks, but what did we get up to while we were in Downtown Los Angeles for a week?
Well, we'll spare you the details of the refreshing drinks and poolside antics — it wasn't really that glamourous — but we're ready to talk about most of the games we played.

There's no release date at the time of this writing, but just knowing that Delicious in Dungeon season 2 has been greenlit is enough to sate our mighty appetites for now. While we wait for more info on the followup, a new trailer and key visual made their way online along with the reveal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of the mods you'll acquire in Warframe are easy to obtain. I couldn't keep track of the hundreds of copies I've gotten for certain mods like Steel Fiber and Vitality, but I'll be happy to get some free Endo. While some like this are simple, a lot of mods are very specific and have a low chance of dropping. They also drop from certain activities only, like this mod. Here's how to get the Hammer Shot mod in Warframe.


Where to get the Hammer Shot mod in Warframe


Image via Destructoid.


The Hammer Shot mod drops exclusively from Nightmare missions, which are found under the Alerts tab on your Star Chart. Here, you'll find an array of Nightmare mode missions that you can complete. The Hammer Shot has a 1.01% chance to drop from Rotation A, so you'll either need to run the mission until receiving the first reward or pick a short mission such as Rescue.


Alongside Hammer Shot, you can get the following rewards for Nightmare missions at the following chances:



Chilling Reload - 22.11%


Accelerated Blast - 18.97%


Ice Storm - 18.97%


Stunning Speed - 18.97%


Wildfire - 18.97%


Blaze - 1.01%



Among these, Blaze is naturally the most useful since it's a great source of Heat Status Chance for a Shotgun.


Is the Hammer Shot mod worth using?


Hammer Shot is a Rifle mod that grants 60% increased Critical Damage while upping your Status Chance by 80%. This makes the mod great in builds that want both Status Chance and Critical Damage while pairing nicely with similar mods. For example, combining this mod with Vital Sense can grant 180% increased Critical Damage, thanks to mods being additive. If you want to farm Nightmare missions anyway, this is a worthy addition to your arsenal.

After its initial launch in 2017, the game is getting a major update, and Nintendo Switch launch with VideogameDunkey's publisher, Bigmode. 


The first game that Bigmode ever published was the phenomenal Animal Well. Star of Providence already has a big fan base on Steam, but the Nintendo Switch release, alongside a major update, will bring new players who have never experienced it before and could be a massive moment for developer Team D13. Bigmode picked a fantastic game to help bring to market with Animal Well, and I'm confident that when released, the Switch version and major update for this next game will feel just as good to play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's always fun trying to track down Minerva so you can acquire her valuable rare goodies, but with the new Skyline Valley update for Fallout 76 things have shifted a little bit for Minerva. While her location always jumps around, thankfully we already know her plans for the first couple of weeks of Skyline Valley. Here is where to find Minerva in Fallout 76 with the Skyline Valley update.


Where to find Minerva in Skyline Valley now (Week of June 13)


Unfortunately, Minerva is not in Fallout 76 this week. If you’re hoping to trade with her, you’ll need to wait a little longer until next week. Sadly, there was no indication she would be leaving, so those looking to settle up with her ahead of the Skyline Valley release will not be able to do so. While this gives players time to explore the new Skyline Valley region of the Appalachia, we will have to do so without being able to trade with Minerva until she returns the following week in a new location.





Where Minerva be located starting June 20


Minerva will return to the Appalachia region on June 20. When she does, you will be able to find her at The Whitespring Resort, located in the Forest Region. It's a bit strange she isn't going to locate to the new Skyline Valley region since that's where most players will be with it being the new content. However, it's likely that Bethesda wanted to make sure she's in a more accessible location.


We also know the items Minerva will have available once she moves to The Winterspring Resort. Here is everything you can buy from Minerva starting June 20:


Item
Gold Bullion Cost




Gauss Pistol

Floater Gnasher Grenades

I must now hang my head and await the executioner's ludicrously oversized hammer, for while Phantom Blade Zero's ambience and layouts owe something to From's work, the moment-to-moment has just as much in common with older hack-and-slash games such as Ninja Gaiden. I played a bit of it at Summer Game Fest this week, and while I’m not rushing out to preorder (I never am, in fairness), I think it could be a good ‘un.

As it turns out, the game is scheduled to launch in just a few months, which makes me wonder why Microsoft didn't highlight it at all during the showcase.


According to a June 12 Xbox Wire post, Ara: History Untold will launch on Xbox Series X|S and PC on September 24, with it also slated to be available via PC Game Pass. The post also shared further details provided by Marc Meyer, president of developer Oxide Games, and Brian Stone, head of Ara for Xbox Game Studios, who appeared on the official Xbox podcast to talk about how the game is structured and how its multiplayer mode works.

Much like the Sonic DLC, you can gain access to Axel by either grabbing the Digital Deluxe edition of the game, purchasing the 'Sega Pass' DLC separately, or opting for individual character packs for £4.49 each. When playing as Axel, the in-game collectable bananas will also change to coins to better reflect the Crazy Taxi branding.

Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure really sets itself apart from other puzzle games. We’ve seen plenty of sliding-tile puzzlers over the years, but Furniture & Mattress’ adventure is defined by its framing. It’s not an RPG, but it absolutely feels like one in many different ways. You have to use weapons to defeat certain monsters blocking your path. There’s a whole coming-of-age story about leaving home and growing up. There are even boss battles.
It’s as if puzzle designer Nico Recabarren (developer on Ethereal) built a completely new Rubix Cube, artist David Hellman (Braid) painted that Rubix Cube, and writer Nick Suttner (Carto) sketched out a world of fun and adventure around it, with everything taking place on a bunch of interconnected square grids. We’ve been enamoured since its reveal during the February 2024 Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, and going hands-on with the game at Summer Game Fest Play Days, we can’t wait to cause chaos by moving tiles around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just waiting on that call from Nintendo.
In a move that very few of us saw coming, PlayStation's Horizon series is heading to Nintendo Switch (albeit in the slightly more family-friendly, LEGO Horizon Adventures form). Is this a crossover episode? Are we witnessing the start of a bold new partnership between Sony and the Big N? Does this mean PlayStation IP will start leaking into the likes of Super Smash Bros.? We'd have to assume 'no' for that last one, but that's not to say that the devs of this latest LEGO adventure wouldn't be up for it.
In a new feature from Kotaku, Guerrilla Games' franchise development lead producer Tim Symons (who previously spent a decade at Nintendo of Europe as a Product Development Manager amongst other roles) was asked whether Horizon on Switch might lead to a Smash collaboration at some point down the line. While the dev hardly answered in the affirmative, he did confess that it would be "nice" to see. "If you speak to Nintendo and they want to invite us," Symons told Kotaku, "let me know".

Growing up, I didn't spend much time watching anime outside of the Pokémon animated series after school each day. However, friends kept telling me about this incredible show from Japan called Dragon Ball Z. While I have gone back and experienced the legendary anime in adulthood, as a kid, streaming wasn't an option, so outside of catching a few episodes airing on Toonami, I was extremely late to the DBZ anime party. However, in early 2003, I went to my local game rental shop and picked up Dragon Ball Z: Budokai. For this reason, Dragon Ball Z: Budokai became the primary way I interacted with the Dragon …]]></summary>

Rust pit monstrous players against one another, DayZ had us dashing around for beans and bleach, while The Forest creeped us the hell out in a dark jungle. There was even a week-long celebration here at RPS called survival week to get the genre out of our systems. A lot of those games have since graduated to a full 1.0 release, but one survivalist shambled on. 7 Days To Die is a solid sandbox craft 'em up with zombie hordes, and it never left the comfort of its early access log cabin surrounded by spikes and land mines. But a (tentative) release date is finally on the horizon, according to the developers. And it's quite soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation is rolling out an update in the coming weeks that will finally allow players to join a Discord voice chat directly from their PS5 consoles. Currently, you can only use Discord on PS5 after first joining a voice chat group via a PC or phone, which is quite a cumbersome step to take in order to talk with friends while gaming. 
The update will gradually roll out to PS5 players in the coming weeks, starting first with Japan and Asia, followed by Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally, North and South America. You will need to update your console to the latest system software and link your PlayStation Network and Discord accounts in order to take advantage of this upcoming feature. 


To start a Discord voice chat directly from a PS5, players need to select the Discord tab in the Control Center's Game Base. Here, choose a Discord server or DM group you'd like to join, select your preferred voice channel, and you're set. You will receive a notification when another Discord user calls you, too, allowing you to join immediately. 
This upcoming update will arrive more than two years after PlayStation gave players the ability to link their PSN accounts to Discord back in 2021. 
Are you excited about this update? Let us know in the coming weeks!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Portable monsters for the kids (and kids at heart).
When Capcom released Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin on Nintendo Switch back in 2021, there may have been some that said, "Wait, there was a first game?" It's worth remembering that the original outing of Monster Hunter Stories came towards the end of the 3DS era; in fact, it was released after the Switch had launched in 2017. It'd be understandable, then, if it was missed by plenty of gamers in a way that its sequel — on the current and dominant Nintendo system — was not.
Now we have Monster Hunter Stories on Switch to right that wrong, and to ensure that Nintendo fans have both tales readily available. It's welcome, too; though these kid-friendly RPG outings for the series don't push the boundaries of the genre or even add much to the IP's impressive global reach, they are a pleasant introduction to a franchise that is traditionally rather challenging. This first entry comes with some enhancements, too, but it also feels unabashedly like the 3DS original, which isn't always a good thing.

An unofficial reproduction of the NES Nintendo World Championships cartridge has been successfully backed via Kickstarter, raising a total of £16,593 at the time of writing with an initial goal of £8,452.
Labelled as a new 'pro' version to celebrate the upcoming 35th anniversary of the 1990 World Championships event, it will contain the original version of the cartridge alongside the new pro version. What's the difference, you might ask? Well, the pro version is more difficult, to put it bluntly.

Were this a game from a triple-A publisher, I'd be heading down to their compound with some powerful magnets and cannisters of highly concentrated acid to wipe out their ungodly creation before it replaces the fundamental particles of our universe with waypoints. But Mental Salvo is actually the work of new indie imaginini (yes, no capital-I), and is a "top down art adventure with light RPG elements" that is perhaps a bit ZANY but also, refreshingly playful in essentially being about poking a big white screen to see what tumbles out of it.

However, it does seem BioWare learned some lessons in the 13…

While rumors for LEGO Horizon Adventures had been making the rounds the week leading up to Summer Game Fest, we never could have imagined we’d see the Nintendo Switch logo appear at the end of its hilarious reveal at the live show. PC, for sure, but Aloy on Nintendo? This made us wipe our eyes in amazement, as other than the MLB: The Show series (which before 2021 was a successful exclusive for Sony’s own gaming boxes) this is the first time we’ve seen one of its biggest IPs make the leap to a rival console, albeit in a slightly more family-friendly form.

I’ll need to clean my keyboard soon. I keep taking screenshots of Felvidek. I can’t take enough. I want to make a scrapbook of every character and every line. Neither my laundry nor keyboard will ever be clean forever either, but if I hate Felvidek for emphasising that, I love it for reminding me that all the best art is buttressed by an irremovable layer of deep, thick grime.

Citizen Sleeper took me by surprise in 2022, giving me a rare new video game experience, both mechanically and narratively, and my dice-centric role-playing adventure has stuck with me since.

The newly established EpicDB (which is now offline) was intended to provide all the same information for titles on the Epic Games Store but it looks like a little too much information was put on display. Within hours of going live, users were seemingly able to see codenames and titles for a multitude of unannounced projects from publishers including SEGA, Ubisoft, Saber Interactive and many more.

It’s been nearly three years now since the launch of the original Shin Megami Tensei V and as is tradition at Atlus, the obligatory enhanced re-release (complete with a new storyline centered around a new girl) has now come to all modern platforms in the form of Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance. Boasting a full-length, alternate storyline and a host of gameplay and balance adjustments, SMTV: V is easily the definitive version of an already excellent entry in the long-running series. If you’re at all a fan of SMT, Persona, or JRPGs in general, you owe it to yourself to pick this up at the earliest opportunity.
For this review, we’ll be focusing more on the additions and adjustments being made to the core SMT V experience with this release—if you’d like to get a more detailed evaluation of the underlying gameplay mechanics and such, we’d encourage you to read through our review of the 2021 version, which still largely applies here, as well.

Despite being a flagship franchise, Atlus has never shied away from taking risks and experimenting with Shin Megami Tensei. Even without taking spinoffs like Persona or Devil Summoner into consideration, the “core” series has taken new forms and reinvented itself over multiple decades and platforms. 2021’s Shin Megami Tensei V was a prime example, both respecting its oppressive, hardcore roots while embracing Atlus’ evolving audience and conventional shifts in games as a whole.

The lucky players who took a chance on 2021’s Before Your Eyes were rewarded with a well-written, highly emotional narrative adventure with a unique mechanical twist. Players control a departed soul traversing the afterlife who relives his entire life, and it can be played entirely by blinking, utilizing webcams to capture their optical input (though the best version is on PlayStation VR2). I loved it, writing in my review, “It’s a concept I’d love to see further explored in a follow-up, and I couldn’t be happier that something like this exists.”

Released on 30th May 2024, it's a monochrome take on classic top-down Zelda gameplay in which you take on the role of a fox who discovers a mysterious key hidden in a cave. To find out what the key is for, you must embark on a quest that will take you across dangerous lands filled with enemies, items, shops, and more.

Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is a sci-fi RPG with plenty of dice and a heavy nod towards tabletop role-playing. The first Citizen Sleeper saw your bio-robotic protagonist landing on a donut-shaped space station where they learned to make a new life for themselves among interstellar farmers and ramen-serving rapscallions. In the sequel, a demo of which I've played [smug face], the hook is a little different. This time you're being pursued across a bunch of backwater truck stops, colonies, depots, and derelicts. All the while your misfit crew will clash and commingle. You still haven't got it, have you? Ugh. I suppose I'll let the game's designer tell you then.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/12/visions-of-mana-gets-august-release-date-in-new-trailer"/>
        <updated>2024-06-12T12:26:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enis has announced that Visions of Mana launches August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It did so with a new Visions of Mana trailer that runs for nearly four minutes and features plenty of gameplay and details about the upcoming RPG. 
For the uninitiated, Visions of Mana is the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Across its 30 years of existence as a franchise, there have been 17 games, though what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991.
In the trailer, we get a look at the five playable characters, including Soul Guard Val (voiced by Stephen Fu), Oracle of Wind Careena (voiced by Rachel Rial), Radiant Sword Morley, (voiced by Kaiji Tang), Queen of the Deep Palamena (voiced by Vanessa Lemonides), and Woodland Custodian Julei (voiced by Amber Aviles). Players can swap these characters in and out to create three-person parties and can change each character's class to attune to different elements. They won't be alone, though, as non-player companions can assist the player's party in combat, according to the trailer. 
Check out the Visions of Mana release date trailer for yourself below:


The standard edition of Visions of Mana will cost $59.99, but there is a Collector's Edition for $199.99 that features a Ramcoh plush, the Art of Mana special issue, a Visions of Mana original soundtrack collector's edition special box, and of course, the physical game. However, Square Enix says the PlayStation 4 standard and collector's edition will not be available in the U.S. 
Here's a look at the Visions of Mana Collector's Edition: 
Visions of Mana hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 29. 
For more about the game, watch the Visions of Mana reveal trailer, and then check out this gameplay trailer from earlier this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disco Samurai is a game that’s so difficult I’d have given up playing sooner if it didn’t contain so many of my absolute favourite action game things. Tense, decisive duels. Violence that’s both brutal and a little silly. Scalpel-sharp parry n' strike back-and-forths. Short stages that dole out chunky progression hits of dopamine, as quickly as they wrest those hits away from you with another humbling beatdown. Perhaps most importantly, it aims to do one thing - rhythm combat - and does it brilliantly. It's got teeth, but it's also got groove.

On the back of the video game company showing positive signs of growth with a boost in employees over the previous fiscal year, Nintendo is now looking to fill Switch Online roles tied to 'game software development', front-end and back-end engineer services, and a director/planner job.

That’s exactly what director Katsura Hashino, art director Shigenori Soejima, and composer Shoji Meguro, the trio best known for the beloved Persona series, is doing with Metaphor: ReFantazio.

The reigning NFL Offensive Player of the Year will grace the standard and Deluxe Editions. You can view both covers in the gallery below.

EA has yet to detail Madden 25’s gameplay but teases the next evolution of current-gen/PC exclusive features such as FieldSense, new commentary and presentation, and updates to Franchise and other modes. A press release states EA plans to announce gameplay details "soon." 
Madden NFL 25 launches on August 16 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You can read our review of last year's Madden NFL 24 here. For the first time in years, Madden won't be EA's only licensed football sim this year, as EA Sports College Football makes its comeback on July 19. You can watch the first trailer here.]]></summary>

Ahead of that happening, it's received a final major content update which seeks to make the complex, detailed roguelike more approachable. The Spring Molting update, which is out now, makes the user interface work with both mouse and gamepad, adds Steam cloud saves, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix had released a new trailer for Season 2 of Arcane, the hit animated series set in the League of Legends universe. Set to premiere in November, show creators Christian Linke and Alex Yee confirm the upcoming season will be the show's last.


Season 2 is billed as "the final chapter" and will center on Jinx's attack on the Council, which will be the centerpiece of the escalating Piltover/Zaun conflict. Hailee Steinfeld (Vi) and Ella Purnell (Jinx) will reprise their roles in Season 2. While Arcane will conclude, Christian Link stated during a League of Legends dev update today that it won't be the last animated tale based on the franchise. 
“Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche," said Linke. "From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with this second season. But Arcane is just the first of many stories that we want to tell in Runeterra.”
You can watch the first teaser for Arcane Season 2 here. For more on League of Legends, check out our in-depth preview of 2XKO, the franchise's upcoming fighting game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer BioWare has released the first official gameplay trailer for its upcoming RPG, Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Featuring more than 20 minutes of gameplay, this is the first look at the game's action combat, the magical city of Minrathous, the player-character Rook, some of the companions who are joining Rook's journey, how dialogue choices work, and more. 
In the gameplay trailer, which begins in Minrathous, we see returning fan favorites Varric Tethras and Lace Harding alongside newcomer companion Neve Gallus, a private detective mage, and Rook. Solas, the once-ally mage turned foe at the end of Dragon Age: Inquisition's Trespasser DLC, is attempting to destroy the Veil, a barrier between the magical Fade and the continent of Thedas. Our team, seemingly not quite the titular Veilguard just yet, is attempting to stop him. 
Check it out for yourself in the official gameplay trailer for Dragon Age: The Veilguard below:


At just 20 minutes, this gameplay reveal is a tease of what's to come in the final game when it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this fall. However, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is Game Informer's next cover story, and in the latest issue, you can get an exclusive in-depth look at what happens next in the game alongside new details about the extensive character creator, the game's main hub location, the action combat, and so much more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It took over a month of racing and 220 hours of playtime but a Trackmania player has finally beaten the racing game's most horrendously difficult map. For those of you only now noticing that tens of thousands of Twitch viewers have been religiously watching video game Hot Wheels, let me elucidate. Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him. Third place is still up for grabs but, mate, I wouldn't recommend it.

A suit inspired by Peter B. Parker's look will be available for Peter Parker, seen below, although it does lack his telltale gut. The other seven suits, which can be seen on PlayStation's blog, have been created by guest designers KidSuper, Vini Jr, Lando Norris, and Rina Sawayama. There are also a few suits referencing specific Spider-Man lore, and a new Mile Morales suit (seen above) that "is reminiscent of classic cartoons and comics of old."

Dragon Age: The Veilguard - previously Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, strictly speaking Dragon Age 4 - is not the bantzy heist romp suggested by its debut trailer. Less Good News for returning players: going by the 45 minute segment I was shown at Summer Game Fest, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is more of a single-character action-RPG plus entourage, than a proper party-based affair in the vein of 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. You do get a party, drawn from a retinue of seven, larger-than-life, romanceable companions encompassing a range of classes, abilities and go-faster hairdos, but control of that party has been streamlined, and there's a God Of Warlike emphasis on booting Fade demons into pits. Hmmm.

For as long as I’ve been excited, I’ve also been worried. It’s been a polarising experience, like being alternately fed delicious sandwiches and those inedible rotlogs they sell at Subway. Still, I’ve remained cautious: is all this great pixel-art just a shroud pulled over a ho-hum tactics game to rescue it from naffness? It’s with this in mind I hungrily dove into the Steam Next Fest demo, as one might hungrily dive into a bin to eat literal garbage if their only other option was Subway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The playable area in Caravan SandWitch’s Steam Next Fest demo isn’t all that big, but within seconds you’re plonked at the rusty wheel of an offroading motorhome and let loose to roam it. It’s a figurative "Go nuts," and given how much more this narrative-heavy, third-person exploration yarn seemingly has to give, it's an attitude I’m seriously hoping holds firm throughout the full game.

Nearby to this now-famous site of grace camps a merry band of blood-cursed Albinaurics, as well as a stupid gross bird you can trick into killing itself over and over again. I do not give a single solitary biscuit about that leperous avian, but I’ll be damned if I’m going to waste my new-found position of prominence on this glorious website by not moralising at you heartless rune-hoarders about the unconscionable violence you keep inflicting on my bulbous, shiny frog sons. With Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree out soon, the amount of violence the community is collectively inflicting is breaking my tiny heart.

Piracy Shield launched in February under new law that compels all 300+ of the country's ISPs to block pirate streaming services. It now transpires that Italy's blocking system was only designed to accommodate 70 ISPs and now times out under the strain. By end of 2024, Piracy Shield Phase 2 will make its debut.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil continues to gradually infect Apple platforms with the reveal that Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and the remake of Resident Evil 2 are coming to iOS. The series’ first foray into first-person arrives first on July 2, while the RE2 port is "currently in development."
Both entries will be playable on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. Both games will feature enhanced controls and a new Auto Fire feature, a more approachable option that causes guns to automatically fire when aimed at enemies.
RE7 will also include the Not A Hero story DLC starring Chris Redfield. You can also purchase the Gold Edition that includes additional DLC such as the End of Zoe, Vol. 1 and 2. of Banned Footage, the Madhouse difficulty mode, and more. At launch, players can try a slice of each game via a free download before making a purchase. 
Resident Evil 7: Biohazard launched in 2017 and introduced fans to Ethan Winters, who travels to a terrifying house in the backcountry in search of his missing wife. The game kicks off the current storylines for the mainline series, which continued in Resident Evil Village. Speaking of Village, that game, along with the Resident Evil 4 remake, was ported to Apple platforms last year. You can watch us play Resident Evil Village on iPhone in this episode of New Gameplay Today for a look at how well Capcom has managed to get these games to run on phones.]]></summary>

There don’t seem to be turds of any kind in upcoming sandbox RPG Streets of Fortuna, but that’s about the only thing that this ambitious “megasim” appears to be missing in its sprawling go-anywhere, do-anything open world.

Here are some basically non-scoundrelly, very Ubisofty things I did during my 60 minutes with Massive Entertainment's open world adaptation at Summer Game Fest this week: climbed around rectangular arrangements of yellow handholds. Shot at baddies over rectangular cover layouts. Collected 7/10 pieces of scrap with some Star Wars flavour text that unlocked an item recipe of some kind. Deployed my chibi Chewbacca sidekick Nix to distract Imperials with cute wiggles and belly boops so I could sneak behind them. Got discovered sneaking behind them and murdered them all before one could run to a terminal and summon reinforcements. OK, maybe that last one is getting there.

I was similarly tickled by the sight of her breathing through a bamboo pipe while swimming underwater, and I emitted a gentle hum of approval, like a smartphone switching on for the very first time, when she impaled a silhouette through a paper door. Respectable shinobing, for sure. Papa Tenchu would be proud.

Assassin's Creed Shadows is the answer to that oft-repeated request, but it's far more than that, thanks to the introduction of a second protagonist, Yasuke the samurai. He's a playable historical figure (a first for the series) and his approach varies wildly from the shinobi protagonist, Naoe. We got a first-hand look at this during a behind-closed-doors demo in Los Angeles.


It opens with Yasuke entering a town, drawing everyone's attention. As if his ornate armor wasn't enough to set him apart, Yasuke is a huge person, and people in the street stare as he walks by. The developers ex…]]></summary>

Plus, publisher Ubisoft has revealed Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's "Mask of Darkness" story DLC hits the game this September. 
Unfortunately, the tease for Mask of Darkness was quite short, showing just quick look and an image revealing the September release window. However, the Divine Trials DLC, which follows the free Warrior's Path and Boss Attack DLC from earlier this year, looked great in a new trailer released during today's Ubisoft Forward showcase. 
Check out a glimpse of Mask of Darkness and a look at Divine Trials in the trailer below:

The game has hit some development difficulties over to course of its creation. When announced, Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai were said to be developing the game, but in 2022 it was shared that development duties would be handed over to Ubisoft Montreal. It seems at that time development was effectively fully reset because it will be some time before release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft Forward kicked off with a lengthy gameplay demonstration for Star Wars Outlaws. The open-world scoundrel game shows protagonist Kay Vess, a thief looking to start a new life, trying to hunt down a gunslinger to learn her talents. This takes her from a space station marketplace to Tatooine's iconic Mos Eisley. 
The 10-minute guided walkthrough focuses on one aspect of Outlaws, which is tracking down elusive experts in order to learn their craft. From being the fastest draw in the galaxy to mastering sleight of hand, these skills will help Kay go from a common (though wanted) thief to a legendary outlaw. The video shows off the seamless ground-to-ship gameplay, one of the optional space dogfights you can engage in, speeder bike gameplay across the sands of Tatooine, as well as stealth and shootout sequences. 


If you'd like a more condensed summary of what Star Wars Outlaws entails, another trailer serves as a shorter tour through some of the planets players will visit, the characters they'll meet, the systems at play, and a glimpse into some story moments. 


Star Wars Outlaws launches on August 30 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can learn more about it by visiting our cover story hub.]]></summary>

Metal Slug made its name as a fast-paced, run-and-gun explosive arcade shooter, making it all the more surprising how well it seemingly fits into a slower, turn-based strategy format. Since Metal Slug Tactics’ reveal at the final E3 in 2021, both series fans and tactics aficionados have been waiting with bated breath to get their hands on it. I count myself among them and was anxious to play a preview build to finally see how well this marriage of genres blends.

The multi-limbed coffee shop owner of Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is, indeed, a reassuring sight, since they are the ones who sell the player fashionable jackets and trousers to wear while you axe enemy heads to bloody fragments. In this soon-to-sally-forth soulslike from the makers of Ashen, the creature design is a highlight. Whether it's a good souls 'em up remains to be seen. I've only played a couple of hours in the Steam Next Fest demo. But I want to make clear that, among the reservations I've collected on my murder jaunt, nothing will diminish the espresso-pumping hand-haver of the game's first café.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my absolute most favouritest Steam Deck cases, besides the one you get for free with the Steam Deck OLED, is the Dbrand Project Killswitch. It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.
Thank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.

Then I kick the elevator control panel to pieces, climb out the hatch, and cut the cord with a buzzsaw I smuggled in earlier. "It's also total chaos!" I yell, as the elevator plummets. "Ha ha ha ha ha ha!" Streets of Rogue 2 is looking similarly chaotic. But one thing has been brought to order: its release date. It's coming to early access on August 14th, while a new trailer (below) shows horse riding, flame throwing, and speed boating. My favourite moment is when a man pumps magic gas into a room full of people doing zumba, and it turns them all into giants, and they freak out and start smashing the walls in a panic.

Clair Obscur's world is at the mercy of the Paintress, who awakens once a year to paint a cursed number on a monolith.

With that said, much of the rest of the game does seem to match an expectation of crafting, baking, resource gathering, and many of the other features you’d expect out of a survival game, albeit with an adorable aesthetic of anthropomorphic mice as the visual style.
Publisher Noodlecake intends to release the game on Xbox consoles, and PC in early 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl, the long-awaited sequel to the FPS that perhaps emanates the most shame in my backlog, has a new combat-focused trailer showing off the many dangers of the enigmatic Zone. You’ll also be pleased to know that the release date remains the same as the previous announcement: September 5th 2024, where it will be coming to Game Pass day one. Here’s the tray-tray:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This month, Dragon Age: The Veilguard (you read that right – Dreadwolf is no more) graces the cover of Game Informer. After years developing Baldur's Gate and its sequel early in its history, BioWare struck out to create its own fantasy RPG. That series began with Dragon Age: Origins in 2009. It was followed up with Dragon Age II in 2011, and then Dragon Age: Inquisition in 2014. While the Dragon Age series' history has its ups and downs, fans have been patiently waiting for BioWare to return to the franchise, and 2024 is finally the year. 
We visited BioWare's Edmonton, Canada, office for an exclusive look at Dragon Age: The Veilguard, including a look at its character creator, its prologue and opening missions, and more. We also spoke to many of the game's leads about the name change, th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next expansion for Fallout 76 is called Skyline Valley and it launches next week. More specifically, Skyline Valley expands the game's map southward to the all-new Shenandoah region on June 12. 
There, players will investigate the cause of an electrical storm circling overhead and unveil the mystery around Vault 63. In this mysterious vault, players will meet its dwellers and discover a new Ghoul type called The Lost, too. 
Check it out for yourself in the Fallout 76: Skyline Valley trailer below: 


As you can see from the trailer above, the Shenandoah region is not looking so great in post-apocalyptic America. Plus, the trailer also reveals that Fallout 76 players can play as Ghouls starting sometime next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, we received an in-depth look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, the latest entry in Treyarch's popular, long-running subseries to one of gaming's biggest franchises. As part of that, we learned the series is implementing a new movement system, bringing back round-based Zombies and Classic Prestige, and taking us to the year 1991 for its campaign. We also learned another key piece of information: when we'll be able to play it.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 25. Alongside that, players can expect a campaign that hopes to instill a sense of paranoia and intrigue with the Black Ops team going rogue in order to remove an entity that has infiltrated the highest levels of government, as well as a competitive multiplayer suite that includes 16 all-new maps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft have released a new trailer for South Of Midnight, a third-person action adventure from Compulsion Games, who created dystopian Britpop survival game We Happy Few. I thought We Happy Few had some wonderful ideas and presentation - it's sort of Fable by way of Clockwork Orange and Bioshock - but found its mixture of pill-popping satire and survival game mechanisms self-defeating. South Of Midnight seems no less vivid, but a lot more assured in its God Of War-style action... and it's perhaps a bit less intriguing, as a consequence. Still, don't just sit there reading my opinions. Watch the trailer.

Also, it’s mainly just one very long cutscene, so if you want to save that stuff for when the game’s out, maybe don’t bother.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has revealed Gears of War: E-Day, and it's a prequel "origin story" set 14 years before the very first Gears of War game. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, E-Day stars fan-favorite hero Marcus Fenix and gives players the chance to experience the terror of the infamous Emergence Day. 
In the trailer, which features an orchestral remix of Gary Jules' Mad World (the very same Mad World from the Gears of War launch trailer), we see Marcus and returning hero Dom Santiago come face to face with the Locust Horde. And though we know the Locust Horde quite well, it appears to be Marcus and Dom's first bout with these infamous enemies. 
Check it out for yourself in the Gears of War: E-Day reveal trailer below: 


"Experience the brutal horror of Emergence Day through the eyes of Marcus Fenix in the origin story of one of gaming's most acclaimed sagas," the trailer's description reads. "Fourteen years before Gears of War, war heroes Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago return home to face a new nightmare: the Locust Horde. These subterranean monsters, grotesque and relentless, erupt from below, laying siege on humanity itself."
Xbox says E-Day has been developed from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5 and promises to deliver "unprecedented graphical fidelity." 
There's no release date or window for E-Day yet.

The Call of Duty franchise has undergone various transformations since its departure from the World War II setting. From modern and near-future settings to distant-future adventures in space, the franchise has explored the reaches of theoretical conflicts. However, the series may well be at its best when focusing on historical time periods and events, as has largely been the case with Treyarch's long-running Black Ops series. This subseries, which debuted in 2010, focuses on historical time periods and conspiracies surrounding them, creating narratives ripe with intri…]]></summary>

She could also be the villain. Then again, Fable is a series in which you can be the villain. Egad, such shenanigans!

In the footage we see Jones and a companion coming across a battleship somehow perched on top of an icy mountain. What follows is an extended cutscene where Jones comes face to face with a verbose Nazi who really wants the stone Jones discovered. A punchout ensues and the ship begins to fall before the footage switched to a series of gameplay snippets. Perhaps most exciting, however, was a tease of Indiana Jones outrunning the boulder like he did in the first film. Maybe the Great Circle will feature classic moments from the films?

In the cinematic trailer, we get another look at the terrifying and dark world of Diablo IV by way of Vessel of Hatred's opening cinematic. If you're curious about what to expect, give it a watch – otherwise, it's likely the cinematic that will play at the start of the expansion later this year when Vessel of Hatred hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
Check it out for yourself in the Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred cinematic below: 


Pre-purchasing the expansion will give players instant rewards in the game.

The twist is that she experiences that death in one timeline, and her unusual powers allow her to transition into one where the murder didn’t happen, leaving her to try and figure out what happened, and somehow prevent the death in the first place in both timelines.
The new game comes to us courtesy of Square Enix and Deck Nine Games, and is targeting release on Xbox Series X/S and PC on October 29.]]></summary>

We still don’t have a release date, despite signs we might see the remake of the 2004 game this year, but we did get a pretty good look at a bunch of key moments from the original remade in the shiny Unreal Engine 5 do-over - including a look at The Boss and the familiar gravelly tones of Snake actor David Hayter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-lost reboot of Perfect Dark made its grand return during today's Xbox Games Showcase. First announced in 2020 at The Game Awards, the trailer consists almost entirely of gameplay, showing off the reimagined vision of the Nintendo 64 classic. 
The over 3-minute trailer shows off first-person gameplay as Joanna Dark airdrops into a lush sci-fi city. Pursuing a target, she utilizes gadgets that allow her to hack systems to open doors and eavesdrop on nearby conversations. Getting around the city involves first-person parkour as she leaps and swings across balconies. Johanna is eventually greeted by goons that she drops by blasting them with bullets, stunning them with electrical rounds, or humbling them with CQC melee takedowns. She also has a scanner that reveals enemies behind barriers.


Perfect Dark is being developed by The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics. It is coming to Xbox Series X/S, but it still has no release window.]]></summary>

It accompanies the first details of this "immersive single player RPG" - pause for ecstatic applause from Anthem haters - "where you become the leader others believe in". Not miles from the premise of Dragon Age: Inquisition, then. That footage, tho? Not entirely Inquisitiony.

The trailer shows off the action in an open world that recalls titles like God of War and Elden Ring. The team has previously said that the action draws at least some inspiration from Soulslike games.
With today’s announcement, we know we won’t have long to wait until the game is available to try for ourselves, with a release date of July 18 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
Check out the new release date announcement trailer below for a glimpse of the action.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-06-09T17:45:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fable will launch sometime next year, developer Playground Games has revealed. It did so during today's Xbox Games Showcase with a new trailer that features quick snippets of gameplay starring our heroine. 
In the trailer, we see our hero waltzing through a large medieval town while a narrator discusses an old threat returning to the world. Our hero wants to save Albion, and to do so, she needs to enlist the help of Humphry, who is the one narrarating the trailer. 
While there appears to be gameplay in the trailer, there's no U.I. and no combat – it's mostly just our hero protagonist walking and running through various fantastical locations. We do see some glimpses of combat, but it looks cinematic so it's hard to tell if it's actual combat gameplay. 
Check it out for yourself in the Fable gameplay trailer below: 


"What does it mean to be a hero," the trailer's description reads. "Humphry, once one of the greatest, will be forced out of retirement when a mysterious figure from his past threatens Albion's very existence." 
Microsoft revealed Fable was coming back in 2020, with a reveal trailer from Forza Horizon developer Playground Games. We then got our next look at the game with a more narrative-focused trailer starring Richard Ayoade last year, and today's new trailer is our first look at the game since then. 
Fable launches on Xbox Series X/S (and presumably PC) in 2025.

My main takeaway? That Bethesda are leaning into cosmic horror, as the trailer features landscapes that look like they're on the other side of an Oblivion gate than anything I saw during my time with Starfield.

State Of Decay 2, on the other hand, I found to be disappointing - the same game with more money behind it in a way that seemed to magnify its faults. The threequel? I have tempered expectations, but I do want it to be good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The advertising bonanza formerly known as E3 continues into its second day with another set of streams. The Wholesome Direct was today's highlight, in my mind. The yearly collection of games that may or may not be cosy, but which definitely do not involve stabbing men in the neck, always contains some games worth keeping an eye on. This year was no different, and you'll find the archived stream below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of a copyright infringement lawsuit against DoodStream, the cyberlocker platform was handed orders by a court in India to remove links to all content owned by the major Hollywood studios, Netflix, Amazon, and Apple, within 24 hours. When that failed to happen, the terms of the injunction seemed to be up for negotiation, at least for a while. Having done little to convince the court that infringement wouldn't continue, DoodStream's operators and associates are now banned from running the site.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Busy week, this one. We've had a whole load of games announced over the past few days, and there'll doubtless be a whole lot more this weekend. Most of them we can't play yet. But as a general rule, talking about games makes us want to play games, even if they're completely unrelated. Everyone has those moments where they see the trailer for a new multiplayer hero shooter or some such thing, and for reasons only known to themselves, they say, "yes, I really must play more Simpsons: Hit And Run." So: here's what we're all clicking on this weekend!

        <updated>2024-06-08T00:51:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Computer Artworks' 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic "trust" and "fear" systems.
Sadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They've just announced that they're making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A goat or a lamb - which makes the better sacrifice? Trick question, it's neither. The best sacrifices are old rich people. In Cult of the Lamb's next update, Unholy Alliance, you can sacrifice folks with a pal. The upcoming free update will add a co-op goat character so a friend can indoctrinate and stab alongside you. The developers have shown off the two-player update amid the summer news plague that is threatening to tear entire branches off the RPS treehouse this week. "Summoned by blood and born in corruption, this wicked new ally can join the holy Lamb in local co-op," say publishers Devolver. Ah, local co-op. Not online then. I guess this is for real-life people with real-life friends and a proper real-life sofa. Well. Good for them. I'm happy for them. Couldn't be happier. Happy happy happy.

Philosophy-obsessed puzzler The Talos Principle 2 is getting a big three-part DLC expansion, and some of the environments look lush. Not least this humongous cube sticking out from the sands of a tropical island at a jaunty angle. It is called the Hexahedron, and its interior constitutes a “large, continuous puzzle cluster” that the player will navigate. As one of those dweebs who has walked around London saying “aha, brutalism” at every insignificant piece of concrete he sees, this pleases me. Come and see it up close in the trailer.

Enter Tides Of Tomorrow. Ok, so I actually don't know if it has anything in common with Waterworld aside from having lots of water everywhere.

Firstly, this game clearly contains a non-zero quantity of blades, from whacking great axes to katanas. Secondly, I do not accept the premise that these are phantom blades. They are very obviously non-spectral, going by the amount of stabbing and clanging on show in the video. With these potentially ruinous caveats out of the way, I am now free to tell you more about a game that looks like it's out to eat Sekiro's lunch.

It’s those detail-stuffed visuals and caffeinated animations that tipped it for me, and it’s the same art that have me excited for Capybara’s follow-up. Battle Vision Network is an online puzzle battler that pits you head to head against real-life humans (boo those guys).

I want you to have nice things. Here are the new things coming to Palworld: a new island. Some new Pals. A new level cap. A new arena. A new subspecies. A new raid. A new oil rig stronghold. A new faction and boss. Maybe some other, secret things? All this newness comes as part of the ‘Sakurajima’ update, which releases on June 27th, 2024.

The ‘next-gen’ part probably refers to Unreal Engine 5, and fair’s fair, it’s a real looker this one. The below trailer is mainly scripted or edited bits, but having played a chunk of the last technical test, there’s some genuinely impressive sci-fi vistas to behold, as well as some absolutely massive bosses. Click on the trailer below, until the purple hat or whatever it is you kids grind for these days, pops out with a synapse-tickling noise workshopped by psychologists for eighteen months.

Regardless, I’ve been won over by the upcoming video game of the same name from original creator Jeff Lew, which looks to blend together Just Cause stunt shenanigans, John Woo slo-mo gunfights and the energy of a third-person action game you would’ve found in a bargain bin for the PlayStation 2 in 2002. It’ll hit early access this summer, courtesy of a fresh look from tonight’s Summer Game Fest showcase.
