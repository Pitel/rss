Given that The Crew is an online-only game, that signalled its death knell… or death horn, more accurately. Then in April, they tow-trucked the game out of people's libraries and revoked their purchases.

Bot of War is the last level you need to finish in the second galaxy of Astro Bot, called the Tentacle System. After the boss is gone, travel to the new location for a chilly reception. 


The first raven is a gimme. But before you can start hunting down the rest, you'll need to meet the bot facsimiles of Kratos and Atreus. Once you get your hands on the Leviathan Axe and gain its power, it's time to take it for a spin.

Hot off the heels of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (and the Paramount+ meme-fest that is Knuckles), Sonic the Hedgehog 3 sees Shadow the Hedgehog (Keanu Reeves) emerge from the, well, shadows, to menace the world. As the film's surprisingly epic trailer explains via voiceover, Shadow was born out of Project Shadow, a sinister government operation with shocking ties to Sonic's (Ben Schwartz) archenemy, Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey).

The Tyranids may be the main enemy featured throughout Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, but the game only scratches the surface of the lore. The Tyranids are not an organized faction; it's a hive mind. That is to say, every individual form and creature that's classified as a Tyranid acts in unison as one organism.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Considering that Astro Bot harnesses more than 100 cameo bots, keeping track of them will often prove difficult. There's even more to deal with once you unlock the Gatcha Lab, bringing exclusive showcases for the characters. So, if you don't want to get lost at the Crash Site, here's how to look at your collection in Astro Bot.


How to keep track of your Astro Bot collection


Rather than exploring around to find every Astro Bot, use the A5081 memory card at the Crash Site to look at your entire collection. The feature unlocks after you complete the Gorilla Nebula's Sky Garden. Once you've done this, locate the card near the PlayStation 5 ship at the center, near the group of bots.


Hit the A5081 card to transfer to the collection page. Currently, there are 169 slots to fill up, featuring the Astro Bot character and their Gatcha Lab showcase. Select them to get a better view of their animation, and use the zoom feature to discover hidden details. Any bots that haven't been found yet display PlayStation control icons, which will be inaccessible until they are acquired.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Filling out the entire Astro Bot collection requires much time and patience. Plus, some characters only unlock after you've achieved the game's hidden trophies, ending with a grueling challenge mode.


Although it's handy to use the memory card's collection hub, I still recommend interacting with the special cameo bots in the Crash Site. You'll uncover plenty of fun-filled animations the collection doesn't show; some even have a trophy tied to them. All you need to do is hit the Astro Bot and see how they react to your sudden punches. It's a fun and surprising experience, as each bot's reaction is unique and pays homage to their respective franchises.

Seafood Platter is a 2-star recipe, but it still only technically requires you to find one item, and you even get a choice. 


To make a Seafood Platter, you simply need to head down to Dazzle Beach (or select other waters) and find two pieces of Seafood. My usual go-to for this is either Clam or Scallop, which can be found on the shore of Dazzle Beach and don’t require any fishing. 


Once you’ve got two Seafood, you just need to make sure you’ve got some Coal in your inventory or storage and then use a Cooking Station to make your Seafood Platter.

There was a time when the yearly NBA 2K Switch entry was something to look forward to. Each year was a step back from the next-gen counterpart, of course, but the Nintendo port offered a near-full-fat experience with the added bonus of portability. Those were the days, eh?
Anyone who picked up NBA 2K24 will have realised this is no longer the case and, unfortunately, the same can be said this time around. NBA 2K25 is the same game we saw 12 months ago, but, somehow, with even fewer features than its predecessor. The gap between the Switch port and next-gen has become a gaping chasm and, with a £50 price tag attached, 2K25 might be the most egregious example of a Switch ‘Legacy Edition’ to date.

Ahead of the big patch next week, the Helldivers 2 team will showcase daily previews of what's to come, starting with a Flamethrower buff.


A Flamethrower buff has been in high demand (a rebuff, technically), but so have many things regarding the game. The disgruntled Helldivers 2 community has bemoaned Arrowhead's handling of the game since its explosive launch. Weapon nerfs, bugs (no, not the crawly kinds), balance issues, more nerfs... the list goes on. Some Helldivers have even turned treasonous, stepping out of the way of enemy forces as they marched to Super Earth.

We've seen updates like Chapter 1's Part 3 storyline, which introduces new Stands for your arsenal. So, whether you want to stay informed or connect with the community, we'll show you the links for World of Stands' Trello and Discord links.


World of Stands Trello and Discord links

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Musician Martyn Ware has taken to Twitter recently to air his frustration with Rockstar Games. The source of the Heaven 17 member's dismay is an offer he allegedly received from the acclaimed studio to put his song in Grand Theft Auto 6, which he refused.


Ware claims Rockstar contacted his publisher about the band's song "Temptation" possibly being used in the studio's upcoming title Grand Theft Auto 6. The offer was $7,500 for each of the three writers of the song, which would serve as a buyout of the band's claim to royalties.


Ware learned the details of Rockstar's offer in an email sent to him from his publisher. The musician wasn't impressed with the amount offered by Rockstar, and he was upset that accepting the money would lock him out of receiving any royalties due to the game's success. Martyn's publisher attempted to make a counter-offer of $75,000 up front or $7,500 with a royalty fee. However, the studio allegedly refused to negotiate.


Via @martynware


Some Twitter users are claiming that the amount offered was a standard rate, going so far as to call Ware greedy. Others claimed the exposure and uptick in digital streams of "Temptation" would make up for the lack of royalties. Martyn responded to these claims by pointing out Grand Theft Auto V grossed $8,600,000,000 and that every one million streams of the song would net each writer around $1,000 each, concluding with a "go fuck yourself."


Rockstar has yet to make an official statement on the matter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rainbow Six Siege Operation Twin Shells has finally been released and we have a new Defender joining the roster, Skopós.


Skopós is the 37th Defender, and another 2-Speed 2-Health Operator, joining Rainbow Six Siege in Year 9 Season 3. She will be rocking two Pantheon Shells, basically robots acting as Operators, in a single round. Although you can control only one at a time, the inactive Shell will still provide a lot of value to a round.


Screenshot by Destructoid


All Skopós weapons and gadgets


Skopós uses the new PCX-33 as the only primary weapon. It's a .308 caliber Assault Rifle with a 745 RPM fire rate and comes with a 3.30-second reload speed.


For the secondary firearm, you get to use the P229 pistol. Other Operators such as Hibana, Echo, Goyo, and Grim also have this weapon choice in their loadouts.


Coming to the gadgets, you get to choose between Impact Grenades or Proximity Alarms.


Skopós abilities explained


Skopós controls a pair of V10 Pantheon Shells and justifies the intel or support role in a match. The active Pantheon Shell acts as an Operator while the other acts as an Observation Tool, protected by a reinforced shield.


While playing as Skopós, you can operate only one Shell at a time but you can always switch between them at will. If an enemy kills one shell, you lose connection to both shells. That's how you eliminate Skopós while playing as an Attacker.


How to unlock Skopós in Rainbow Six Siege


To unlock Skopós immediately in Rainbow Six Siege Year 9 Season 3, you have to purchase the Premium Battle Pass which costs 1,200 Credits.


Otherwise, you have to wait 14 days (from September 10) for the early access period to get over and spend 25,000 Renown to unlock her.

These submissions guide the EC as it updates its 'Counterfeit and Piracy Watch List' and this time around some rightsholders want intermediaries to receive special attention. Sky's submission dedicates more space to Cloudflare than even the most egregious pirate IPTV hosting providers, and Facebook doesn't get off lightly either.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following an Early Access launch in March 2024, Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist now has a date for its full release. The sequel to acclaimed 2021 Metroidvania Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights will leave Early Access and make its way to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC on January 22, 2025.


Binary Haze Interactive is on publishing duties for the game from developers Live Wire and Adglobe. In Early Access, the sequel has netted Overwhelmingly Positive review status on Steam, and you can get a feel for the journey through the Land of Fumes in the new trailer below. 




The story of Ender Magnolia is set decades after the events of the first game. Artificial life forms now run rampant throughout the land, and it's up to a corruption-cleansing Attuner named Lilac to set things straight. Players will need to guide Lilac through the land to find the source of the discord between humans and Homunculi, taking on 10 possessed bosses and gaining their abilities in the process.


The 10 abilities earned from bosses each come with three alt-fires, so Lilac will essentially pick up 30 new skills over the course of Ender Magnolia. Up to four abilities can be equipped at a time, so you'll be able to mix up your attacks however you see fit. The music pumping behind all the exploratory action once again comes from indie band Mili.  


Physical versions will go up for pre-order in Japan soon, and there are also plans for other regions. We'll have to wait for more information on boxed releases outside of Japan, so stay tuned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA Sports has revealed the top 25 footballers in EA FC 25 from the WSL in the UK, and some amazing-looking cards will be part of the league.


Sam Kerr headlines the list this year with an overall rating of 90. She's also the second highest-rated card in women's football this year, just behind Aitana Bonmati's 91-rated card. While there are no other WSL cards in the 90-ratings club, a few other items are definitely going to be favorites of the community when the game comes out.


Top 25 WSL stars in EA FC 25


Let's first take a look at the complete list before we start dissecting the numbers.



Sam Kerr ST 90


Beth Mead ST 88


Guro Reiten LW 88


Khadija Shaw ST 86


Lauren Hemp LW 86


Lauren James RW 86


Chloe Kelly RW 86


Jill Roord CAM 86


Kim Little CM 86


Alessia Russo ST 85


Lucy Bronze RB 85


Rachel Daly ST 85


Katie McCabe LB 85


Millie Bright CB 85


Caitlin Foord LW 85


Ashley Lawrence RB 85


Vivianne Miedema ST 85


Leah Williamson CB 85


Hasegawa CDM 84


Mariona LW 84


Sandy Baltimore RM 84


Alex Greenwood CB 84


Ella Toone CAM 84


Fran Kirby CAM 84


Kadeisha Buchanan CB 84





Arsenal's Beth Mead and Chelsea's Guro Reiten are the second-highest cards, with overall ratings of 88. Mead has actually received a slight buff to her overall from EA FC 24, as it has risen by +1. Chelsea and Arsenal have a bunch of footballers on this list, as does Manchester City.


Lauren James, Lauren Hemp, and Chloe Kelly are expected to be community favorites in Ultimate Team. In EA FC 24, they ranked high on the meta and are likely to do so once again in EA FC 25. We will have a detailed guide and analysis piece about the best cards in terms of in-game performance once the game goes live on September 20 (in early access).

Whenever I visit family in the States and find myself in a derelict shopping plaza or some other place affected by America's depressing sense of architectural planning and overreliance on cars, I can't help but feel a sense of dread.
Devil's Hideout, a point and click horror game made by indie dev Cosmic Void, takes place in one such abandoned American city, and manages to deliver on this sense of dread even if its eerie hellscape is rough around the edges.

Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2 are beloved among Sonic fans, but not just for the fast-paced Sonic (or Shadow) stages or the cracking music. The Chao Garden, a side activity in both games, is beloved even today, and fans have been dying to see a standalone Chao Garden game where we can raise our cute little critters.
However, we should probably start tempering our expectations: in an interview with VGC, Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka suggested that there are no plans for a standalone Chao game because it's a "piece" of other games.

All those onscreen 'Nids, yeah? And the stutterfest that was the recent preview build? Surely enough to make a Tech-Priest shed at least one oily tear.
But nah, turns out it’s fine. Pretty good, actually – perhaps not to the extent that you should tackle Space Marine 2 on a crusty notebook (or, for the record, a Steam Deck), but it runs decently on minimum specs and is noticeably more stable than in that preview. The only thing that might offend your PC’s machine spirit is some quality setting weirdness, where dropping or raising the graphics options can produce inconsistent results.

Over the past few years, Atari has been revisiting its storied history with compilation titles, remakes, reboots, and surprise sequels. So while a revival of Yars’ Revenge really shouldn’t have come as much of a surprise, we have to admit to being a bit taken aback by Yars Rising. After all, what was once a stylish, yet basic top-down shooter has now been transformed into a full-blown Metroidvania with anime-inspired character design, a bonkers, world-ending plot, and gameplay that blends stealth, hacking, and good ol’-fashioned gunplay. Atari, yer mad.
The thing is, though, it works. We can’t imagine that this is the future kids in the early ‘80s had in mind when they first shoved that massive Yars’ Revenge cartridge into an Atari 2600 (and maybe OG developer Howard Scott Warshaw’s long-gestating sequel will be more on par with expectations), but after completing Yars Rising, we honestly couldn’t be more thrilled by developer WayForward’s ambitious interpretation of such a classic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A baby's gotta do what a baby's gotta do.
That Rugrats has somehow managed to remain in the public consciousness for so long is impressive in its own right. This is in part down to Nickelodeon continuing to screen it for younger generations, and that the show ran for 13 years across 172 episodes and spawned two feature films. The most important reason for its extended shelf life, though, is its unexpectedly broad appeal. Formulated by Hungarian-born Gábor Csupó and his wife, Arlene Klasky, Rugrats appeared to be a show about babies for babies, but it was actually a show about babies for children and adults. Thanks to clever writing and a deeper maturity — commonplace during the Simpsons-inspired '90s — those who loved it 30 years ago will still enjoy it today.
Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland’s most essential victory, then, isn’t necessarily its stage design or graphical style, but tapping into the show's intelligence. It's a shame the original voice cast is unavailable, with exchanges instead represented in text, but you can still recall Tommy’s raspy tones in your head.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is absolutely stuffed to the brim with characters, mechanics, enemies, and things to do. However, one glaring omission is Kass, Breath of the Wild's travelling Rito minstrel. Luckily for fans, the recently released Master Works Book does propose a few scenarios as to where Kass may be in the sequel.
Zelda Lore shared an excerpt of the book on Twitter (thanks to Gaming Reinvented for the tip) which covers the potential whereabouts of Kass in Tears of the Kingdom. The bird isn't present in Hyrule at all in the game, with no explanation at all given for his absence. He's not even mentioned. At least, until the Master Works book.

Revealed by IGN, Carmen Sandiego appears to be based on the 2019-2021 Netflix series, where the titular thief is no longer the one you're chasing — you're now rooting for her. Controlling Carmen Sandiego, you'll be attempting to defeat the Villains' International League of Evil (VILE), which she once belonged to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wanna take you for a ride.
There was some deserved hype surrounding Capcom’s first Fighting Collection, preserving the best of Street Fighter and Darkstalkers, and including a delicious Red Earth bonus for good measure. The furore across the internet upon the announcement of the Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics, however, seemed to burn twice as bright.
Featuring seven titles, there’s nothing but gold across the board. It includes every pixel-drawn Marvel fighting game up to and including Marvel vs. Capcom 2, and all arcade originals. Capcom has ploughed the package with bonuses, from beautifully defined CRT filters and music players to original arcade art galleries, region switching, superb training modes, save states, and 4:3 screen bezels. For online play, Capcom's own rollback netcode is present and working fluidly. Although we can’t comment on how it will hold up when the servers go global, we’re optimistic it will be well maintained. You can hop in and out of matches, take on casual and ranked match-ups, and spectate freely. It’s quite the fighting festival, and buffed to a shine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[KimCartoon, a pirate site dedicated to all things cartoon, surprised users this week with a sudden "That's All Folks" before shutting itself down. With an estimated 120 million visits over the last 12 months alone, KimCartoon was a very busy site and with that kind of traffic, life can get complicated. The site's operator says the site was shut down "due to DMCA" but, after weathering many storms over the years, maybe there's a little bit more to it than that.

It is hammier than a hamster eating a ham sandwich in Hamburg during a performance of Hamlet. It starts with "The Whispers [of the Eyeless] call to me!!!" and does not improve from there. Beyond that, colour me fairly enthused.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll admit it, I downloaded the free prologue for horror game Baby Blues Nightmares mostly because I couldn't stop giggling at the offer to "utilize the unique abilities of a toddler", encompassing "stealth gameplay", "survival elements" and "upgradeable abilities". It's as though a toddler were actually an undersung class of special operator from a Tom Clancy shooter, rather than a wailing, hyperactive ball of tears and poop. Then again, I imagine Sam Fisher was a toddler once. Perhaps this is how he got started: escaping a smashed-up house full of roaming demon toys.

They've now published another blog post that torches the vagueness of the previous post with the righteously democratic flames of specificity. Overhauls to enemies are on the way, less-loved guns will be more effective, reworks to armor penetration and health values are on the boil, and they're taking inspiration from "player fantasies" for certain weapons and stratagems. All of these tweaks are set to go live on the 17th September, so not long to wait.

The recent DLC for the action roguelike came out of the oven a little doughy, with enough game-breaking bugs to thoroughly upset some fans. Including one bug that sometimes made the game's final boss accidentally invincible. Ah. Yesterday's patch seems to target the worst of these bugs, and the dev team promise there are more fixes are to come.

"It was too big for a single person to make," Byrne wrote at the time. "This is the root of the problem. It wasn't that I fell out of love with the idea, just that I can't physically do it." That was then and this, thankfully, is now. Byrne has tentatively returned to the project and begun sharing screens on social media.

It's a crying shame that it's not currently available to buy anywhere digitally, presumably because the rights are soaked in a gutter between EA (the original publisher) and Microsoft (who bought and closed developers Lionhead).

If you do still own a physical copy of Black & White however, you might be interested in Openblack. It's a fan-led project to create a modern, open source engine for running Black & White, and its first build was just released yesterday.

This week's new hotness is Parking Garage Rally Circuit, which is about powersliding around multi-storey car parks and is designed to look like a lost Sega Saturn game. It now has a release date: September 20th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every time you load up Agentia you are reincarnated as a different creature. "Creature" is perhaps too narrow a word - the game's "playable characters" range from geese, microscopic life and triceratops to menhirs and small rocky islands. Each forms the heart of a diamond of delicately drawn, isometric grid terrain with a baby mobile canopy of clouds and sun. It looks like an illustration from an old botanical or geographical textbook, although the inviting emptiness around the visible area also dimly reminds  me of certain elder RPGs I used to play on Macintosh.

Specifically, it did not forget about the incorrigible evil-doers amongst you who've been gunning for some additional plot catharsis. Larian's very bestest RPG has been biding its time in the shadows while you've been busy with other games. It has lingered silently while you've been off heisting on Tatooine or getting all messed up by Golden-Eyed Beasts, waiting and watching for the perfect moment - and now, it has finally struck with an unholy new patch, which adds 13 new Evil Endings, revamped splitscreen and an official modding toolkit. Foolish summer child! It is too late to flee.

I grab the faulty power transformer without listening, and am immediately electrocuted. Worse still, I have to hammer a quick-time button to recover. This is what it is like to be Jerry, the janitor of a cheap and poorly maintained space station. Jerry is being tasked with repair work beyond his job description, learning the ins and outs of an escape pod's machinery from his co-worker via radio. This may come in handy, as the station is about to explode. Tin Can is not a new game (it came out in 2022) but it is on sale as part of Steam's space exploration fest. And I enjoy a space game that makes me panic while alarms go off everywhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Full disclosure: I hadn't heard of Bakeru until Graham mentioned it to me. Graham always has his hands on the video game pulse, gliding them over Xwitter or Steam or wherever and waiting for that "ker kun, ker kun" of a new Cool Thing. And that cool thing is Bakeru, described by its Steam page as "Japan-esque", but is in actual fact, very Japanese. I mean, you travel around 47 Japanese prefectures as a metamorphing tanuki who bashes evilness with his taiko drum sticks. Come on.
What I hadn't suspected was Bakeru's chops not only as a platformer, but as a means to increase your chances at success in pub quizzes. The game is a certified trivia Tardis, where you'll learn all sorts about Japanese culture as well as just like, the colour sepia being a genus of cuttlefish.

With a keen eye (and a beefy PC) you can capture some wonderfully violent moments.

They're claiming (via in-game broadcast) that the fleeting appearance of a weird purple blob on the map screen is actually the result of fluids leaking from the corpse of a long-dead comms technician, stranded on a server farm somewhere. Who to believe? Ah, if only we had some means of shedding light on the reports. Some way of Illuminating the situation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bear with me on this, but I adore how swordfighting works in Dune. Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.
MOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation is a "postcolonial 4X game", which might sound like a contradiction in terms. While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been 13 years since the first Space Marine came out. While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.

Quick disclosure: I worked with Mojang and Microsoft on a book about Minecraft's first 15 years, shortly before joining Rock Paper Shotgun. As such, I am now obliged by the eternal laws of journalistic accountability to state that anything Minecraft-related is rubbish.

Snuck out over winter 2022, it was a sombre but delightful freebie with immense though well-hidden imagination, in which your only explicit objective was to find a way out of a small concrete city.
Now, developers Lemaitre Bros are making a gott-dang 1v1 FPS called Straftat, slated for release on 24th October 2024 with over 100 arenas. It's similarly in love with concrete, but it also has blunderbusses, dual-wielding, Gatling guns, corner-peeking, curved swords, cowboy hats and beehive hairdos.

Deliver At All Costs is a chaotic courier sim set in those heady days that sees the player barrelling around a "semi-open" US town as they take on absurd odd jobs. "From delivering a giant flailing Marlin, to the disposal of an atomic bomb teetering on the edge of explosion," say the developers, "always expect the unexpected." It's maybe best understood by witnessing the moment in the trailer below where the player drifts right through a menswear store, bringing the whole building down. Yep, that looks like a good time.

I, a terrestrial chump, cannot help be taken in by it all. But I get the sense all this spacey wonder is just so much unremarkable grease pooling at the rim of a diner plate for my Star Trucker. He’s seen a couple things, that’s for sure. Taken the long way round the spiral arm to slip past security checkpoints and offload cases of booze for off-the-record cash.

To shreds, I say - it’s currently sitting at 79% ‘mostly negative’ rating on Steam. Among the chief complaints are…uh, everything, it looks like. The DLC is reportedly so bug-ridden that it’s taken many of the base game’s core systems down with it.
Gearbox - who acquired Risk Of Rain from Hopoo Games in 2022 - have since put out a blog with a list of known issues they’re targeting, and encourage players to keep submitting bug reports. Among the listed issues are a boss named Mithrix becoming invincible (“definitely not intentional”), and “an issue that allowed players to get stuck while smelling the flowers”.

Well, this'll make things easier: both games are currently free to keep as part of the Fallout Classic Collection over on the Epic Games Store.

Fallout Tactics is free, too, but I don't know whether Todd's cruel enough to want people to experience that one as it was.

Fortunately, I've spent my penance playing the demo for Witching Stone, which applies the magic of shape-matching to the magic of, well, magic. Out on 16th September, it's a pixelart charmer that "combines elements of puzzle games, roguelites and deckbuilders", much as you'd combine a red circle and two golden triangles to spark a lightning bolt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first post for my series on "saving" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.
CD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh.

If you missed its announcement in May, The Forever Winter is a co-op extraction shooter set in a grim future where you struggle to survive amid an unending hyperindustrial war. Since that reveal developers Fun Dog Studios have mostly been sending out small "burst transmissions" - essentially footage from the hellfront - like this patriotic beheading and some panicked gunfights. But today they've made a longer video revealing an early access release date. And - oh! - it's quite soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I won an awful board game from Nickelodeon once. I say “won”. Actually, I got disconnected phoning into a competition line after I’d gotten through, got upset loudly, my mum called them to complain, they fast tracked me to the next competition thing, I got the quiz answer wrong, and the presenter pretended he’d heard the right answer and pulled a prize out of the big prize bucket. It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.
The game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter. Some of you will already hate it from the header screenshot, I imagine. Personally, the art drew me right in.

It’ll set you back $25, £20 or €25, and my drive-by analysis of the trailer below is that they've done a decent job with the ports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I encountered Jack King-Spooner's work, it was when he sent me a copy of Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus over hospital wifi late at night. The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.
The same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a "pagan seer" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it. It's also now got a release date - 16th September - and a new trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would not be at all surprised to learn that the voice actors in stealthy Mimimi-style cone’em up Sumerian Six are Americans doing impressions of British accents. The opening radio chat between starting squad member Sid and a pal has that telltale charming tinge of overeager cockney. It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.
“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.

It seems there was more to that story than concern about the progress of Marathon. According to a new Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources, Barrett was in fact fired this spring after he was accused by several female Bungie staff of inappropriate behaviour.

Please let it still be under 40 – and realise with alarm that, by extrapolation, a lot of the people reading this probably have children. Augh, children! Please excuse me while I go stand on a chair, clutching a broom. I’ve never understood the craze for generating smaller versions of yourself. It’s one of those weirder subcultures you read about in the papers, but rarely observe in daily life. 


I do, however, understand the appeal of same-screen co-op games like Run From Mummies - which, being a bloodless comedy dungeon romp, seems like a fair pick for those encumbered with boisterous selfspawn. Don’t worry, the “mummies” of the title are just regular old disembowelled corpses wrapped in cloth, not those sinister, non-embalmed “mothers” you’ve been hearing about down the grocers.

When ten citizens dropped dead on the roads of one of my settlements in post-apocalyptic city builder Endzone 2, I had to work fast to avoid a sickness breaking out. But graveyards require a lot of space, and if you've already filled your shanty town with a sea of corrugated metal roofs, this poses a problem. Welcome to the pleasant headache of town planning in a post-nuclear world, where most of the land is brown and uninhabitable.

While it's not quite as chaotic and entangled as say, Disgaea, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of those games. I'd call it "baroque", but that would be out of synch with developer Sandfall Interactive's stated influences: the new RPG takes place in a molten and fragmented fantasy world based on the Belle Époque or "beautiful era" of late 19th century France. Your job as player is to stop a sorcerous Paintress from painting everybody over a certain age out of existence. We'll circle back to the plot, though. First, the excessively ornate battlin'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stormgate is a confusing proposition. It's an RTS directed by former Blizzard developers that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike StarCraft. It's a free-to-play game, but has a business model that makes you feel like you're getting a rougher deal than if you just dropped thirty notes for it outright. It's available now in Early Access, but has already been available in a kind of gravity-defying Super Early Access for several weeks (which you had to pay to get into).


All of which has made me feel very tired, and yearn for the days when you went into a shop and bought a game in a box for a set amount of money, and the whole game was in the box and you went home and put it on your PC and played it until your mum said "Richard!" (only my mum calls me Richard) "get off that computer and go outside and get some exercise! Do you want to be dead at 35?" Well, I'm 36 now mum. Nearly 37. So who's laughing through their heart palpitations now?

Paris, 28th August 2024 – The Union of Video Game Workers (Syndicat des
Travailleurs (ses) du Jeu Vidéo) has publicly relayed allegations concerning the
working environment at Spiders. The false and even defamatory accusations made by
the STJV in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's
employees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully
mobilized to produce quality games and enthusiastically ensure the Early Access
release of GreedFall 2.

Spiders' management is committed to open and constructive social dialogue. After
unsuccessful attempts over the last few days to meet with a delegation of employees,
they have proposed a meeting again by the end of the week.

Spiders' employees are the heart of the studio, and we are determined to maintain an
inclusive and stimulating working environment in which every talent can flourish and of
which we can all be proud.

The email was signed by Consulting Director Caroline Richard and Associate Director Laurence Tovi.

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.
Chatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.
Whether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate. Here’s it:

Still, I'll admit to a twinge of disappointment after reading that a Crash Bandicoot 5 was once in development at Crash 4: It's About Time developers Toys For Bob, and might have featured an interdimensional team-up with one of Crash's old rivals. No, not Mario.

It’s the good kind of lie. One with purpose, like Lucas smearing vaseline over the camera lens to cover up the landspeeder’s wheels. Star Wars Outlaws, then, is a strange case. Because while its planets and cities do feel ersatz as living places, they’re kind of incredible as film sets. That’s your job here. This is where the game is. You don’t play it so much as you perform your role in a series of loving, enthusiastic callbacks. That’s a star war. This is a star war. Oh, hey, I know that! That’s one of my favourite star warses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The slugcat of Rain World is a distinct little character. He flops around, squeezing through narrow tunnels with a movement that's both cute and mildly gross. When he is eaten by a passing disco lizard or ravenous skull-faced vulture, it is because he is basically a delicious Squirmle existing in a horrifying cryptozoological ecosystem. He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals. Yet that basically seems to be the elevator pitch for Uruc, a sci-fi metroidvania set in a distant future where strange life battles mechanical monstrosities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a while since I last played World Of Warcraft, but that doesn't stop me from listening to the Elwynn Forest theme whenever I need to decompress. And as I understand it, WoW's latest expansion The War Within adds to a game that's largely unrecognisable from those vanilla days. That's not necessarily a bad thing, and with TWW out this very second it does make me think, "Hmmm, what if I do make a return". This happens every time. I'd quite like to see the new continent, the new class features, and the expanded Skyriding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This morning I left my torpid flat in search of coffee, sniffed the restive wind, noted with approval the gloom gathering beneath the trees, and thought: at last, summer is over. At last, we quit the disgusting sunlit months. At last we leave all that is green and good behind, and return to the time of monsters.
Supermassive Games and Behaviour Interactive must have gotten the memo too. They've just released a demo for their next horror game The Casting Of Frank Stone, in which you are a policeman, Sam Green, who is investigating the disappearance of a child. The search leads you to Cedar Hills Steel Mill, "where chilling secrets await, revealing a far more sinister truth than anyone could have anticipated". I am anticipating: QTEs during escape sequences, branching choices that get people killed, and General Mature Content appropriate to the coming of Halloween.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you live in the UK, you may have noticed that this week is shy a working day. Credulous fools attribute this to the existence of a "bank holiday" on Monday 26th, but true initiates like ourselves know the sobering truth: the Maw has eaten one of our weekdays. We have dispatched our finest gastronauts equipped with extremely long pairs of tweezers to retrieve the missing Monday from the Maw's bowels. We can only hope it hasn't been digested yet - imagine living in a world with a four-day working week? The horror. Anyway, here are this week's PC game releases of note.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. 


I say "remake" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.
