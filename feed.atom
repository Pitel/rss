PlayStation Plus recently branched out into three subscription tiers — Essential, Extra, and Premium — and after the first month, the middle option feels like the best value. As someone who treasures retro games, especially the ability to easily play them on modern hardware, I thought I'd be drawn to Premium above all. But the initial wave of PS Plus Premium classics was sparse, and so far, the rollout is as incremental as folks had feared.
For July, Sony announced two new classic catalog additions — No Heroes Allowed! and LocoRoco Midnight Carnival — and that's it for the month. Just two PSP games. Never mind the dozens upon dozens of great potential PS1 games that should still be within r…]]></summary>

Sci-fi narrative adventure Citizen Sleeper is getting more content, starting this month. FLUX, the first of three free DLC episodes for Citizen Sleeper, launches on July 28, 2022.
FLUX is one of three upcoming updates, and centers on tensions around a refugee ship bound for Erlin's Eye, the station on which Citizen Sleeper takes place. All three of Citizen Sleeper's new episodes expand on the wider narrative of the Helion System, where the Eye is located.
The FLUX storyline will introduce new characters at the heart of its story. Eshe is the stubborn captain of the Climbing Briar, tangled up with the flotilla. Peake, their second-in-command, will also play a role in a story about getting relief through quarantine.

Poring over 1.5 billion gaming tweets (a 36 percent year-over-year increase), Twitter has confirmed that Genshin Impact — and viral newcomer Wordle — have locked down the #1 and #2 spots, respectively. Curiously, though, Zelda is back on the list — which makes me wonder if anyone has guessed the sequel's name by now. Scream into the void!

As the old saying goes "If you want war, prepare to war with the war," and warfaring games should certainly start preparing, as publisher Sega and developer Relic Entertainment have announced that the new sequel Company of Heroes 3 will be sounding the order to battle on PC on November 17, 2022.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeiqt_E0KjU
This third mainline entry in the Company of Heroes series will offer up four playable factions and two single-player experiences, set against the backdrop of World War battles waged in Italy and North Africa. The Italian Dynamic Campaign will feature dynamic, choice-based, open-ended gameplay, while the North African Operation — spotlit in the new trailer above — will feature a more traditional, narratively driven experience, featuring new mechanics and a wide variety of additional units.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQLmf4HSoKQ
If you fancy diving into the action before the fall, then head on over to the official Company of Heroes website and register for the "CoH-Development" community feedback program. Once signed up, then you will be afforded access to an Alpha build of Company of Heroes 3, complete with a mission from the new North African campaign. Be sure to move fast, as the new North African trial will only be made available until July 19. Further community projects are planned between now and launch day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeiqt_E0KjU
Company of Heroes 3 will launch November 17 on PC (via Steam).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[End of an era
The expectations for the recent Heroes of the Storm update were low, especially after the recent announcement, but this is something else.
Here is what Blizzard hit us with this week for the Heroes of the Storm July 12, 2022 update:
General
Hero Rotation will update every 1st, 8th, 15th, and 22nd of every month.
Each new Season will now have 4 New Seasonal Quests for new Ranked Season.
Collection
Epic Chaos Lizard Mount has been added for Login reward.
Spectral Butcher Skin is now available for purchase.
To be clear, this is the content push that's being done right after announcing that the game is going into maintenance mode beyond the state it was already in following the "Brack Letter." Players get a mount and the opportunity to buy a skin. Oh, and free heroes will continue to rotate. That's...pretty much it. No balances, no reworks (which were said to be in the works last time we spoke with the team), and definitely no new heroes this week.
For many Heroes of the Storm community members (and former developers!), this past week has been a punch in the gut. Most notably, the Into the Nexus podcast — which has been the marquee Heroes podcast since the game launched seven years ago (and with pre-launch episodes, before that) — is saying goodbye to the game this month, and will shift the podcast to a new focus.
It's been a heck of a run. Heroes remained one of my favorite games since it arrived in June of 2015, year after year. I know a handful of people that still play it regularly, and the community is among one of the most passionate pockets of gaming I've witnessed in my entire life. I mean, with the servers still online maybe there's potential down the road for some miracle to happen (especially under the Microsoft banner); but for now, the game is decidedly in a state of cryostasis.

You'd be forgiven for never having heard of the Touch Detective games before (although some of you will no doubt know it, since you clicked on the title and all). The original game was released in Japan on DS in 2006, and made it to Europe and America shortly after.
It's a point-and-click detective adventure — and there were certainly a fair few of those on the DS — with an art style reminiscent of others in the genre, like Tangle Tower, Professor Layton, and pretty much anything else in the Level-5 catalogue.

When Sonic Team set out to create Sonic Frontiers, it wanted to give players more freedom with which to operate.

Thanks to another Genshin Impact trailer, we're getting more insight into the mysterious Fatui Harbingers, who have been machinating many of the events of the game behind the scenes. We know Childe intimately (as he's a playable character), and we've defeated Signora via a boss fight, but the majority are still a mystery.
We're given a taste of the English voices employed for the previously unseen Fatui cast, as well as some insight into how they interact with the world and each other. There are major story implications for this "interlude," which ends with a quick look at Collei, and an off-screen callout from Tighnari, (who will both be playable).
Here are the core members of the Fatui, provided by the Genshin Impact trailer description:

The hack-and-slash zombie game, Lollipop Chainsaw, might have received lukewarm reviews, but a remake is still on the way. Dragami Games president Yoshimi Yasuda took to Twitter today to let avid fans know it'll "be as close as possible to a remaster." You can check out his post below.
ロリポップチェーンソーリメイクに対し沢山のファンよりご質問を頂戴しましたのでお答えします…!!!

July 12, 2022
In his statement, Yasuda spoke about the primary goal of the remake and the incoming changes:
The original Lollipop Chainsaw was released in 2012 and was about high school cheerleader Juliet and her journey to survival amid a zombie apocalypse in California. For those of you that never played the game, you're right to assume that Juliet donned a flesh-shredding chainsaw. Suda51 and James Gunn (The Suicide Squad and Guardians of the Galaxy) collaborated on the gory, blood-pumping adventure. Joe Juba reviewed Lollipop Chainsaw and concluded his review by saying:

Sega's next mini retro console is also making its way to North America. The Sega Genesis Mini 2 will launch in North America on October 27, Sega confirms.
The Genesis Mini 2 is the follow-up to Sega's Genesis Mini, from 2019. Following in the footsteps of other mini classic consoles, like the NES and SNES Classic or PlayStation Classic, it packed a bunch of Genesis games into a single little console box.
The Genesis Mini 2 will have more power, according to Sega, and a library of 50 classic games previously unreleased on the Genesis Mini. This will also include some Sega CD titles, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPGTxSHKDFI
The console will come with the six-button Control Pad as well. Controllers that released alongside the Sega Genesis Mini will still be compatible, too.
Sega's site has a current list of games for the console, which you can find below.
Sega Genesis Mini 2 games (as of July 13, 2022):
Sonic CD
Shining Force CD
Silpheed
Mansion of Hidden Souls
Night Striker
Ninja Warriors
After Burner II
OutRun
OutRunners
Virtua Racing
Super Hang-On
Sonic 3D Blast
Shining in the Darkness
VectorMan 2
The Ooze
Bonanza Bros.
Alien Soldier
Rainbow Islands -Extra-
Splatterhouse 2
Rolling Thunder 2
Lightening Force
Fantasy Zone
Star Mobile

Full-motion classics
There are a few more games to make their way in to get that count over 50. But with Genesis and Sega CD games on the docket, just about anything's possible. Here's hoping we somehow get some Lunar games or wild FMV titles on this classic console too.
The retro console is up for pre-order on Amazon right now, with a $103.80 price tag and a $21.99 shipping fee. It seems like the new Mini is an Amazon exclusive, so that looks to be the cost of the console.
The Sega Genesis Mini 2 arrives in North America on October 27, 2022.

In case you missed it, PlayStation Plus stratified out into three different tiers last month.

Stray is a third-person adventure starring a stray cat navigating a cybercity to get home. As a cat, you can interact with the environment in amusing ways while unearthing an ancient mystery. Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, one of my favorite games on PlayStation 5, retells the classic steampunk JRPG with a new-gen sheen. You even get to play as world-class ninja Yuffie in her own standalone Intermission Episode. 
The following games are also available on July 19:
Marvel’s Avengers | PS5, PS4
Assassin's Creed Unity | PS4
Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag | PS4
Assassin's Creed Rogue Remastered | PS4
Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry | PS4

Bayonetta 3 in-game purchases are going to be a thing, according to the updated Nintendo Store listing this past week.
As spotted on Reddit by user XDitto, the page was quietly updated recently, showcasing a full M rating. Now this was expected! Previously it was "pending," and I don't think anyone at Platinum would have settled for less than an "M for mature" for Bayonetta 3, and Nintendo has published the two prior games with the same rating. When it comes to the reasons why: "violence, blood and gore, partial nudity, and strong language" are obvious "just Bayonetta things."
Interestingly, folks caught another addendum to the rating: in-game purchases. If you recall, this was a bone the ESRB threw people roughly four years ago during the height of the loot box craze/controversy, though it applies in a general sense beyond that sole parameter.
At present, I fully expect "in-game purchases" to mean some form of costume DLC, or even a potential season pass, which Nintendo has been all about in a number of their first-party games. Platinum is generally in the habit of providing full action experiences out of the box, so there's probably no cause for alarm.
In fact, the idea of a potential Bayonetta expansion could be a great way to keep the party going without having to wait years for a new entry.

YouTube modder kgsws uploaded a video titled "You can run Doom inside (DOS) Doom, for real." earlier this week. (Thanks, PCGamesN.) In it, they show the process of using code injection inside the DOS version of Doom.
Now, game and code injection is something they've toyed with before now. But the ultimate execution that leads to Doom running inside Doom is impressive to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6hnQ1RKhbo
After a lengthy process, kgsws is able to make a wall as a designated Doom-space. Here, they can watch the attract mode play out, or take over the controls and play themselves.
Eventually, kgsws builds even more. There's a theater for the Doom-ception, but also some additional switches to toggle in-game effects. The modder even puts Heretic, another classic retro shooter, inside Doom.

The ultimate Doom-ception
The quest to make Doom playable on just about anything and everything is, at times, awe-inspiring. It's one thing to get Doom running on a machine meant to play games, like a Game and Watch or something.
But then you have the wilder stuff. People putting Doom in their brand-new Porsche. Doom inside of Twitter, proving the site truly is a hellscape after all. Or Doom inside a pregnancy test, just because we can.
At this point, what's left to get Doom running on? I don't know, and in some ways I'm terrified to find out. But Doom truly is eternal, it seems. Anyways, if you want to play Doom more conventionally, the ports for modern consoles sound like they've got some nice quality-of-life improvements and features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Contrasaur.
WayForward Technologies has made a name for itself as one of the best developers out there when it comes to retro-flavoured projects, from their excellent beat-em-ups like Double Dragon Neon and River City Girls to Metroidvanias like The Mummy Demastered and its signature Shantae series. The studio excels at that throwback style and 2007’s Contra 4 was a particularly fine example, reviving a Konami series which had been stagnating since the original PlayStation era. While Contra 4 was well-received, WayForward never got another shot at a Contra game, so in 2019 the developer decided to go build its own Contra, with dinosaurs, and spiders.
Released originally as a launch title for Apple Arcade, Spidersaurs is a run-and-gun shooter in which you take part as a combat intern at INGEST Corp — a food manufacturer that has created dinosaur and insect hybrids in an attempt to solve world hunger. As with most fictional attempts to bring back dinosaurs like Jurassic Park or Billy and the Cloneasaurus, the titular creatures escape and it’s up to you to stop them (and eat them).

        <updated>2022-07-13T15:52:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During last September's Nintendo Direct, Bayonetta's reemergence shocked fans, with the titular witch dodging, transforming, and shooting her way through huge monstrosities. We knew that the action romp would come exclusively to Switch this year, but today Nintendo announced an October 28 release date with an appropriately over-the-top trailer. 


Platinum Games' enemy and hero designs for the franchise remain stunning. Bayonetta sports butterfly wings and tentacled horns in some action sequences, while enemies take the form of armored animals – homunculi, artificial bioweapons. You'll fire canons from a moving train in a ravaged cityscape, ride grotesque crabs up skyscrapers, and even play as the new katana-wielding witch-in-training, Viola. And let's not forget that you can summon an all-powerful kaiju too. It's all wild and nonsensical as you'd expect but in the best possible way. 

Bayonetta 3 ups the ante on Switch this October 28. A Trinity Masquerade Edition of the game will also be available, boasting a 200-page art book. More details for the special version of the game will be revealed later.]]></summary>

The latest spin-off from The Witcher trilogy (and technically the spin-off of the standalone Gwent spin-off), Gwent: Rogue Mage puts you in charge of two mages, Alzur and Lyliana, attempting to create the very first Witcher hundreds of years before Geralt’s adventures. They do this by apparently journeying over a board of randomised roguelike encounters, stopping at each one for either a Gwent battle or an event, before facing off against a final boss to bag a mutagen needed for their radical experiments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get your new year off to a miserable start
Fans eagerly awaiting any and all news as it pertains to the TV adaptation of The Last of Us have received a small morsel of hope this week, with HBO's own Casey Bloys suggesting that the live-action exploits of Joel and Ellie should be hitting small screens nationwide as soon as early 2023.
Bloys comments came during a long-form interview with The Hollywood Reporter, where the Chief Content Officer lived up to his reputation for dropping major news in small, off-the-cuff remarks. While it was already a given that The Last of Us would be arriving at some point next year, Bloys' comment brings its premiere date closer still, which will come as something of a relief for impatient fans, (see: all fans of everything).
Speaking of dates, Naughty Dog itself has noted that upcoming remake The Last of Us Part I has now officially gone gold, with code ready to be pressed to discs and sent whizzing out over the airways — affording the community yet another opportunity to experience the critically acclaimed stealth adventure all over again. It's been quite a speedy turnaround from official reveal to shelf date and, despite being the third rerelease in less than a decade, it's sure to be a guaranteed smash seller.
The Last of Us is scheduled to premiere on HBO in 2023. The Last of Us Part I will launch on PS5 September 2. A PC edition is also in the works for a later date.

Nonetheless, there are still a fair few offers still running on the WD Blue SN570, a seasoned member of the best SSDs club owing to its high PCIe 3.0 speeds and relatively affordable pricing.


It’s even more affordable now, of course, especially if you’ve got an Amazon Prime account and are in the UK. The 1TB and 2TB models – both capacious enough to act as your PC’s sole storage drive – have Prime-exclusive savings on Amazon UK, with the 1TB SN570 a few quid cheaper than it was during last year’s Black Friday sales.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's trailer confirms it
We finally have a Bayonetta 3 release date, after years of waiting for it! Nintendo has confirmed October 28, 2022 with a new trailer. If you're curious, the date is at the very end! It feels like it would have been a classic Nintendo Direct info drop, but here it is on a random Wednesday morning.
We also have brand new info from Nintendo beyond the Bayonetta 3 release date, with a few key story implications. There will be a "coven of Bayonetta," with "each [member] more fabulous than the last," with settings that include Tokyo (as we've seen in the past), as well as the mountainsides of China (and "beyond"). We'll also get to play a "witch-in-training" named Viola, a sword-wielder, and she's accompanied by Chesire, a cat companion. Major Devil May Cry 3 vibes with the Nero and Viola parallels!
https://twitter.com/NintendoEurope/status/1547205510843301888
Nintendo has additionally shown off the "Trinity Masquerade Edition," which will be at "select retailers," and will provide a 200-page color art book, on top of three reversible game cases for each entry of the series on Switch. "More details will be revealed in the future," and hopefully that process isn't as rough as the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 special edition.
Oh, and the original Bayonetta is out as a standalone physical release on September 30, with a "limited number" run. It's priced at $30.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6a5-8_kt3E
[Update: Platinum has separately revealed a new filter called "Naïve Angel Mode," which will change some outfits in Bayonetta 3to be less revealing as an optional filter. It's a super interesting way to tackle these types of things, which platform holders are often in contention with.]

A brand new trailer for Bayonetta 3 has been release, confirming that the game will launch on October 28th, 2022.
The trailer itself features familiar characters along with a brand new playable character called Viola. It also looks like Bayonetta will be able to dress up in various absurd costumes as she battles a new human-made threat known as the "Homunculi".

So far, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is putting its best foot forward. We'll see how it fares come July, but for now, I'm pretty happy with what Nintendo is showing off. And that includes this new beautiful Xenoblade Chronicles 3 song called "A Life Sent On."
Shared by way of the Nintendo UK Twitter account, the track is described as a "somber flute-based melody," which is played by "off-seers" in the universe (specifically Noah and Mio) to mourn people who have fallen in battle. Based on the small amount of lore we have, off-seers are tasked with some sort of guidance for a facet of the afterlife, and could potentially play a larger role in the narrative.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dream a little dream of me.
The fifth console generation represented arguably the greatest shift in game design the industry has ever seen, as developers all over the world wrestled with how to transition 2D tenets into the 3D realm. There was lots of experimentation, and while platformers like Super Mario 64 and Spyro dived head-first into the new dimension, others like Crash Bandicoot tethered the camera and still kept a lot of 2D design at the forefront. Launching on PS1 in 1997, Klonoa: Door to Phantomile — which was remade in 2008 on Wii — fell more in this latter camp, and though it seemed that Namco had largely abandoned the loveable Dream Traveler, he’s been given another shot with Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series. This remake of the first game and its sequel, 2001's Lunatea's Veil for PS2, is little more than a fresh coat of HD paint, but the two classics here still hold up as excellent platformers that no fan of the genre will want to miss.
The story of Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series places you in the role of the titular cat-rabbit Klonoa, a “Dream Traveler” whose role is venturing to worlds within people’s dreams to help bring about balance and peace. Along the way, you’re aided in this journey by local residents of the dream worlds and take on a small handful of silly antagonists who wish to fill the world with nightmares.

With only a little more than two weeks to go until the launch of Xenoblade Chronicles 3, you'd perhaps be forgiven for wondering just what else Nintendo could possibly share without spoiling anything. Well, it turns out that music is a pretty safe bet, as the publisher has showcased another track from the game's original score, titled 'Millick Meadows'.
It's unclear exactly where in the game such a track will commence, but since there's an area in the game known as Millick Meadows, we're willing to bet that this music will be the accompanying track - duh, right? It's a sweeping piece that's certainly reminiscent of the likes of 'Gaur Plain' from the original Xenoblade Chronicles.

To save you the bother of sifting through a mighty mountain of bargain bin junk, I've been collecting agreeable Amazon deals on actually good PC hardware right here.
Unlike the kinds of offers you’d find during, say, Black Friday, all the best Prime Day offers are only available to Amazon Prime subscribers. If you don't have a membership, you could always sign up for Prime's 30-day free trial - more on that in our guide to everything you need to know about Prime Day, which you can also find further down. Here's some tips on how to find the best Prime Day deals for yourself, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SNAAAAAAAAAKE!
Today is the 35th anniversary of one of the most influential, genre-defining, and beloved franchises in video game history, Metal Gear. That's 35 years of crawling around in military bases, dodging spotlights, hiding in the backs of trucks and under boxes, and sitting through seemingly endless codec conversations about what date it is. And it's been one hell of a journey, I'm sure you'll agree.
While Konami has not seen fit to do anything interesting with the license since series creator Hideo Kojima left the company, the publisher has announced that it is preparing to re-launch some of the series' M.I.A. titles, that were discontinued from sale back in November 2021. At the time, Konami noted that there were licensing issues due to the use of real-life documentary footage in certain games, that the publisher was hoping to renew.
In a tweet posted earlier today, Konami noted that the delisted titles would be returning very soon, though it chose not to mention any of the specific games themselves by name. Is this all we will be seeing in regards to the iconic franchise's anniversary year? Quite possibly, while Konami is wont to hang on to the brand for obvious financial gain, the studio seems increasingly uncomfortable with the idea of producing new titles with Kojima being a key player in the title's development. Happy anniversary, please buy these games again. Kind of an anticlimatic anniversary.
Regardless, here's to the 35th birthday of an undeniable, indelible, 100% genuine game-changer.

The NFT market is finding itself in a bit of a pickle recently. After its meteoric rise in 2021, sales of NFTs have since levelled off and may in fact be in a bit of a decline, though that hasn't stopped the likes of GameStop entering the space with its own NFT marketplace. In even more bizarre news, a Web 3 company known as Polium introduced the "world's first" NFT console, making us question the direction of human evolution.
Despite the ongoing popularity of NFTs within certain communities, it's clear that more and more people are coming out of the woodwork to denounce the concept altogether. At the recent International Games Festival in Brazil, one dev actually managed to give an entire talk on why NFTs are "a nightmare", despite the fact that the event was being sponsored by a number of NFT and blockchain companies.

We're used to hearing about the games Xbox's Phil Spencer is playing, but what's Nintendo of America's president Doug Bowser been enjoying recently? It seems he actually completed OlliOlli World not long ago - congratulating British developer Roll7 on creating a "super fun skateboarding x side scrolling platformer". If you've played this game, you'll know it's no easy feat.
Roll7 responded to Doug, acknowledging how "rad" he was for playing the game through. It seems Doug has a bit of a soft spot for the skateboarding genre, as he was a bit of a skateboarding legend back in his younger years. Even the Birdman Tony Hawk would be impressed.

The New York Times scooped up Wordle, and now Spotify has come for Heardle, another popular daily pastime. Did you catch the logo at the top of the game's site?
The music trivia game will retain its same "look and feel," and "it'll remain free to play for everyone," according to Heardle's new owner, Spotify. The rollout will hit users in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand first. With any sort of changing hands, I'd expect hiccups; our own CJ had temporarily missing stats.
There is one change already: at the end of your guessing, you'll now see a listing for the day's full song — with the idea being that you'll stick around and listen to it on Spotify. The company s…]]></summary>

Over the last few days, an early build of the upcoming Skate game managed to leak onto the internet. Electronic Arts and the Skate team issued a statement today, asking players to respect the ToS and be careful with what they're downloading.
The skate. team recently re-emerged with a new trailer, titled "Still Working On It," showing off some pre-pre-alpha gameplay. But over the last week, reports of a leaked version have been cropping up across various forums.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As well as an exclusive edition from iam8bit
One of the most intriguing games of the summer is an adventure starring a cat — being, well, a cat — in a human-less city. Stray releases digitally for PS4, PS5, and PC on July 19, but if you're looking to pick up a physical copy, that's coming later. You've got two options.
The most basic physical edition of Stray on PS4/PS5 is due on September 20, for $40, and there's also an iam8bit exclusive edition for $45 that's shipping in Q4 2022.
According to iam8bit, pre-orders for the standard retail edition of Stray will "start to open up this week," so keep an eye on your preferred retailer. The exclusive edition, however, is up for grabs today with no deadline to worry about yet — it's an "open pre-order."
Here's what comes in the (slightly pricier) box:
[caption id="attachment_334617" align="alignnone" width="1365"] The physical Exclusive Edition of Stray for PS4/PS5.[/caption]
Stray's exclusive edition has a matte black sleeve, a 14.4" x 24" poster featuring our inquisitive hero, a "fuzzy, pettable" chenille patch, and six art cards.
Something else to keep in mind: digital copies will normally cost $30 (though there's currently a 10 percent off discount on Steam), and Stray will also be playable at no extra cost on PS4/PS5 if you're subscribed to PlayStation Plus Extra or Premium.
I'm glad the wait isn't too long for the physical version, as that can be a frequent concern. Best case, maybe you can check out the game with PS Plus Extra to see if it's worth adding to your shelf, without needing to fully double-dip (or wait until September).
Annapurna Interactive and BlueTwelve Studio recently posted a "spoiler-free introduction to Stray," if you're curious to see a bit more about the game and its world. This knocking-stuff-over tweet is also another biggie — I feel like it sums up the game's whole vibe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PAFF!!
Microids and its strange love affair with niche, old-school licenses continues with the news that the publisher has yet another Asterix the Gaul video game in the works — Asterix & Obelix XXXL: The Ram from Hibernia is currently in production at Osome Studios, with a PC and console release scheduled for the fall.
Following on from 2021 side-scrolling brawler Asterix and Obelix: Slap Them All, the new title The Ram from Hibernia is a top-down action-adventure, and sees the two rebellious friends on a mission to recover a sacred golden ram, stolen by the nefarious Roman Empire. Explore the land of Hibernia, (which we know as Ireland today), lay waste to armies of Roman soldiers, and save the day for the land's oppressed people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvLYsEpw_PQ
As you can see from the trailer above, The Ram of Hibernia is packed out with the franchise's trademark, fist-flying chaos. Studio Osome also promises to mix some exploration and puzzle-solving elements into the adventure, along with some magic and alchemy from Asterix & Obelix's druid pal, Getafix. The adventure will also support four-player co-op action, though this trailer only features two selectable characters, which seems a bit of a missed opportunity.
It has to be said that Asterix the Gaul is something of a specific franchise for a specific audience — ala Microids' other current point of interest, The Smurfs. Still, at least those faithful Asterix fans are eating well for the time being. Asterix & Obelix XXXL: The Ram from Hibernia launches this fall on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

"This marks an even quicker timeline than it took for the original game to achieve this momentous feat, and we are just beside ourselves with joy and appreciation," studio director and executive producer Maja Moldenhauer said of the sales milestone.

While lightning-fast, short-time-only deals are going on as well, there are some pretty decent cuts on microSD cards.

Publisher tinyBuild has announced that the Xbox Series X edition of grim fantasy adventure Hellpoint has been hit with an unfortunate delay, and will now launch "one to two weeks" later than its advertised street date of July 12 (which is today, obviously). The PS5 edition will launch today as scheduled.
"The Xbox Series version of Hellpoint was planned to be shipped on July 12," wrote developer Cradle Games on Twitter. "This version of the base game will be slightly delayed due to technical specificities of the platform. Currently, we expect to launch it within one to two weeks."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvERPDFOvzE
"It was obviously a tough call for us here at Cradle Games and for our publishing partners, tinyBuild. We apologize for the delay and hope for your understanding. As always, allow us to express our unending gratitude for your support and love. We have the best community we could have ever asked for."
Cradle Games notes that Xbox owners will still be able to access the "Blue Sun" DLC, (which also arrives on all platforms today), via backward compatibility with the Xbox One release. Any and all Xbox One save games will be compatible with the Xbox Series X edition of Hellpoint once it finally graces us all with its ungodly presence.
Hellpoint is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Stadia platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Prime Day deals are in effect
If you recently got a PlayStation 5, you're *probably* not looking to spend another cent on hardware anytime soon. But if you've had enough breathing room, today's a good day to pick up a DualSense controller or a PS5-compatible SSD with Amazon Prime Day deals.
On the controller front, Amazon has marked DualSense gamepads down to $59 for Prime Day, including newer variations like Cosmic Red, Galactic Purple, Nova Pink, and Starlight Blue. Or if you'd rather stick with a more "classic" look, the white and black controllers are also on sale — but you aren't saving quite as much, comparatively speaking. Those models usually cost $70, while the fancier DualSense colorways go for $75.
A few months ago, I sprung for the Starlight Blue DualSense — it looks nice in person! Spending a lot of money on secondary controllers is never fun, especially when we've got longevity concerns, so I always try to wait for deals to pop up. This is as good as it gets.
[caption id="attachment_334579" align="alignnone" width="1280"] The 1TB WD_BLACK SN850 is a popular choice for PS5 owners.[/caption]
Storage is another look-for-deals concern for PS5 owners in that there's just not enough to go around unless you upgrade. Amazon has discounts on numerous PS5-compatible M.2 SSDs for Prime Day, and one impulse-buy-worthy deal I've seen is this 1TB SSD from Nextorage for $110. Another one: the WD_Black SN850, which is $114 for 1TB.
Of course, if you want to go big, there are 2TB SSDs for PlayStation 5 as well — but expect to pay over $200. When shopping around, don't forget the heatsink!
I haven't made the SSD expansion jump yet, so I can't personally vouch for either of these, but I am getting dangerously close with PlayStation Plus Premium's game catalog crowding my PS5. If you're feeling stuck or could just use a refresher, Sony has the PS5 SSD requirements and installation process over here.

Amazon's Prime Day is coming up, where it offers a bunch of deals specifically for its subscribing members. On the games side of things, that includes a few freebies. And this year the lineup is pretty good, as Prime members can get a copy of Mass Effect Legendary Edition and some Star Wars games for the low, low price of free.
In an Amazon blog, the company reveals some of the games arriving as freebies for Prime Day. Mass Effect Legendary Edition is a big one, as that's all three Mass Effect games and their single-player DLC, packing the whole trilogy into one launcher. If that gets you eager for space action, there's also a few Star Wars games on offer too: Star Wars Jedi Knight - Jedi Academy, Jedi Outcast, and Republic Commando. Or, for gearheads, there's Need for Speed Heat and GRID Legends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter" - say no more
A new Fallout New Vegas mod is in town, and it's going to be tough to see this one dethroned anytime soon.
Spotted by Twitter user eternalfloette, the mod (found here, and created by Testudini, off of a suggestion by Fallout Mods Redditor Coffeechipmunk) is appropriately titled "wishes come true - nuclear winter," and the goal is very simple: to nuke NPCs that wish for a nuclear winter. You know how most open-world games have that one line of repeated dialogue? I'm not even going to say the Skyrim one. But for New Vegas, it's:
"Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter."

I can just hear it in my head! NCR soldiers have uttered this phrase countless times in my playthroughs, and now you can do something about it. The mod "immediately targets the NPC with a nuclear strike," and amazingly enough, it triggers both via dialogue initiated by the player or the NPC. Testudini makes it clear that the mod is compatible with pretty much anything that doesn't modify that particular line of dialogue, so it's super easy to install and try out.
As if I needed an excuse to go back to Fallout New Vegas, one of the most fun modern open-world games in the past few decades.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prime Day 2022 comes just as the global graphics card market slowly emerges from a devastating crypto-coma. That means some prices are back to normal, some aren’t, and the entire concept of a deal becomes kind of nebulous and squishy. And yet, there will undoubtedly be people out there desperate for a new graphics card – any new graphics card – so let’s take a look at what’s out there.


The bad news is that the vast majority of Prime Day GPU “deals” still reach above the respective card’s original retail price. The good news is that I’ve found a small handful of offers that are, if nothing else, good value by the incredibly whacked-out standards of the past two years. First up, there are a couple of Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 series cards worth considering in the UK, including an MSI-made RTX 3070 (that Ebuyer have price matched). Sticking with RTX cards, which can run both DLSS and DLAA, GameStop have a reasonable RTX 3060 deal for US buyers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With temperatures rising in certain parts of the world and summer heat still going strong in North America, Nintendo issued a heatwave warning to Switch players, suggesting the console can only be used in temperatures up to 35 degrees Celsius or 95 degrees Fahrenheit. While that heat cap is pretty impressive, we'd recommend not testing it. 
By way of Nintendo Life, Eurogamer referenced Nintendo Japan's Customer Service Twitter account, which advised Switch owners to avoid staggeringly high temperatures and keep the intake and exhaust ports unblocked.  The good news is that if the console gets too hot, it’ll automatically sleep. And for those who like to play using the Switch port, keep the setup in a cool spot. You can see the tweet below with a translation:
気温が高い場所でNintendo Switchを使用すると、本体の温度が高くなる場合があります。5～35℃の場所で使用してください。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If the word "simulator" in PowerWash Simulator puts you off, please don't let it. Where other simulators double down on the minutiae surrounding the thing you're meant to be doing, that they put you off the thing you're meant to be doing, PowerWash Sim understands that you just want to rid surfaces of grime in the most satisfying way possible. You do not need to prize open your powerwasher with a tri-wing screwdriver or manage your finances via a convoluted banking app or determine whether a kitchen sink delivers enough pressure. Instead, you wash things with power: you power wash. You wash, powerfully.
After a year in early access, the game's launching in full with a variety of modes and I cannot stress enough how stress-less the experience is. This is a first-person soother you'll either think is an absolute bore or the best kind of meditative chore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Supermassive Games is known for its interactive horror narratives, including 2015's Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, and, more recently, The Quarry. Today, Eurogamer reported that Danish company Nordisk Games acquired the studio.
Nordisk Games, which already owns Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios and MercurySteam, the team behind Metroid Dread, acquired a 30% stake in Supermassive in March 2021. At the time, Supermassive CEO Pete Samuels said:
Today, Samuels released another statement about the studios' full acquisition that matched his excitement from a year ago:
We enjoyed The Quarry, awarding the summer camp slasher an 8.5 out of 10 and concluding the review by saying, "Once the frantic running through the woods begins, the dark mysteries and thrill of keeping people alive are powerful hooks that will keep you glued in suspense until the credits roll." However, the finale to Season One of The Dark Pictures Anthology, The Devil in Me, is Supermassive's next big project. Starring Jessie Buckley, you can watch the trailer here.

However, while the game features many tenants of the open-world genre, Sonic Team is adamant about calling Frontiers an "open-zone" game instead. While on the surface that sounds like little more than a marketing ploy, after chatting with the developers, it makes more sense as you dig deeper into its meaning.
Coming off 2017's Sonic Forces, a game that didn't fare well with critics or fans, the development team wanted to shake things up. Forces received criticism for its generic 3D level design, unfulfilling story, short length, and poor 2D gameplay compared to the then-newly released Sonic Mania. According to Sonic Frontiers director Morio Kishimoto (who a…]]></summary>

For context, Ubisoft recently announced it will cease online services for several of its titles on September 1, of which Liberation HD is among them. In particular, the PC versions of these titles will not only lose their online features but their DLC will be rendered inaccessible, even if you purchased it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had expected to dislike Riders Republic because Ubisoft's marketing made the open-world xtreme sports game look like it was about gnarly middle-aged dudes with sikk lingo and twatty hats. And it is, and they are awful. But behind the rude 'tude and Fortnite-grade fashion, Riders Republic makes riding a virtual bike feel like riding a real one in a way few video games manage. Switch to the first-person camera, turn off the music and HUD, and just cycle through American national parks with your bike humming beneath you. Bliss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have long been on the "eh, seems okay" side of the fence regarding Valve's newest lil child. To me, the Steam Deck did not do anything not already covered by the four different video game boxes I already own. The largest advantage afforded by the Steam Deck, the ability to play cool games on a handheld device, was surely the domain of the Nintendo Switch - a console that I personally use about once a year. Usually the process is that I go "Oh yeah!", pick up the Switch, and contemplate buying Breath Of The Wild before I see that it has not depreciated in value whatsoever since it came out five years ago. Then I turn off the Switch. 
Last week, though, I picked up the Switch, saw that Tangle Tower was on sale, and played it through in one go. "This is great!", I thought, marvelling at how I could play a game while sitting on the sofa, but leaving the TV free for my partner to watch whatever stupid TV show he wanted. I went to look for other cool indie games that might be on sale on the Switch, and that's when I discovered that the Switch eshop is hot garbage unless you know specifically what you're looking for. So now I want a Switch.

Released only a month after the studio casually announced it would be disbanding, Last Call BBS will be the last game the studio releases. It's a bittersweet feeling for fans, but this final game is not just a goodbye, it's a retrospective dive into the studio’s ten-year-plus run making games. It also acts as a reminder of how flipping good Zachtronics is at making puzzle games, even if they do melt my brain into a puddle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to some recent job postings on Respawn Entertainment's career webpage, a new single-player FPS set in the Apex Legends universe is in early development. Eurogamer asks if this could be the long-awaited Titanfall 3 in disguise, but that remains to be seen since the posts don't mention anything about the wall-running, mech warfare FPS.
Referred to as "Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title," a Senior Environment Artist post states:
A single-player FPS is not often announced, especially since the genre is synonymous with competitive play. A story-centric Apex Legends experience could focus on any number of the frontiers' eccentric personalities. It could even delve into Blisk's notorious Apex Predator squadron. In any case, the upcoming shooter would be in good company, seeing as its predecessor is still the best battle royale out right now.
What do you make of this Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title? Where would the story take returning and new players, and what would you like to see? Let us know in the comments below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Protect the innocent and uphold the law. That's what Robocop is programmed to do, and you'll soon get the chance to see the world through his visor in Robocop: Rogue City, a new game from developer Teyon and publisher Nacon. Peter Weller, the actor who became Robocop in the feature film, is reprising his role, bringing both his likeness and voice to this iconic '80s character.
The trailer above shows off roughly one minute of gameplay. Robocop's precision targeting is on display, as is his brute strength, which he uses to effortlessly push dumpsters and hurl enemies through the air. Rogue City tells a new story set around the same time as Paul Verhoeven's movie and somehow brings the powerful reboot ED-209 back into the mix.
Teyon is the development house that released Terminator: Resistance. which recently was enhanced for new-gen machines. Robocop: Rogue City is slated to release in June 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

On July 15, the Panel de Pon-style, tile-matching puzzle game joins the (gradually) growing roster of classic N64 games. Pokémon Puzzle League launched in 2000 and tells an original story based on the anime, with Ash and Pikachu competing in a special puzzle tournament. The pair takes on familiar faces, including Team Rocket and Gary, in 2D and 3D puzzle contests, with plenty of Pokémon cheering from the sidelines. 


Pokémon Snap joined Switch Online last month, making today’s news a nice double-whammy for Pokémon fans. You can keep up with every game available across the various Switch Online libraries by checking out our evolving database.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, I had a real blast from the past moment. Apparently, my ancient LiveJournal turned 18 on Tuesday, a thing I haven't posted in or given a single thought to for at least ten years. Naturally, curiosity got the better of me, so I dipped my toe back in to see what teenage Katharine had been blogging about in the mid to late 00s. Aside from all my custom images having been eaten, probably with the closure of whatever photo upload service I used back in the day, everything else was pretty much in tact. 
But man alive. Those OPINIONS. Just terrible. Bad, awful, narrow-minded. In some ways it's quite funny looking back at how angry I was about Nintendo putting trains in a Zelda game, for example (joke's on me, Spirit Tracks would go on to become one of my fav Zelda games of all time), but in many ways I'm just quite glad I've (hopefully) moved on as a person, if only because recent weeks have reminded me there are still plenty of people out there like late 00s Katharine who are in all likelihood the same age I am now. Yes, I'm talking about the backlash to Return Of Monkey Island.

The few I tried were fussy, though, and too much like the kind of cold scientific procedure that turns growing things into industry. With Lost Nova on my back burner I shrugged, and gave that a go, having frankly forgotten what it was.
It's a gathering game, so almost the reverse of gardening, or perhaps the end point of it. But its relaxed pace, warm tone, and fun dialogue were, it turns out, exactly what I needed. There's no pressure, and not too much to worry about. You can just wander about enjoying the vibe and digging things up with your gentle laser as you go.

So, with Monster Hunter Rise netting itself a bestest best badge and its Sunbreak expansion getting some serious praise in our review, I thought it was time to pull up my regular socks in the hopes that I could replace them with a pair woven from a big lizard's gooch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Madison is a fun game to write about. It's a puzzle horror game set in your traditional haunted house, aiming at a P.T. or Layers Of Fear vibe down the viewfinder of a Polaroid camera. Said camera was a second-hand gift for Luca's (that's you!) 16th birthday. It is also possessed by a demon, which is where the fun comes in, "fun" here meaning jump scares and hallucinatory clocks. Let that be a lesson to anyone thinking of getting their son something that was evidence in a murder as a present. This is one of many bad choices characters in Madison made. They are mostly now dead.
The game itself sometimes makes very good choices, though it's about 50/50 that it goes a bit too weird and ends up being silly. This makes for an intriguing mixture, especially with a complicated story of murder and neglect spanning decades, and by the end I was extremely fond of the way the sublime and the ridiculous sat side by side. The main let down isn't that Madison sometimes makes you giggle by accident, but that its multi-stage puzzles become so drawn out that you stop jumping at creepy angels and terrifying violin squeals. You've got numbers to write down and candles to move, and you don't have time for any demonic antics right now, godammit.

The game looks noticeably rough considering it’s launching in two months which is worrisome, but hopefully, it plays better than it appears at the moment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new The Lord Of The Rings: Gollum trailer has dropped at today's Nacon Connect, which shows Mr Precious scamper about in some suitably fantastical locations. He hops between some bushes, dodges a dragon, and chucks something at an orc - all the staples of a Hobbit who's gone goblin mode. I'm still a bit on the fence about it, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Nacon Connect event had a bunch of licensed games starring pop culture figures both old and older, but one standout among them was Nacon Studio Milan’s upcoming Terminator survival game. Will you be able to play as Terminators? It's not yet clear. Heck, it's so early on the game doesn't even have a proper name yet. Feel free to recoil in fear from the announcement teaser trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Robocop: Rogue City aims to be authentic to the first three films in the series, which means it'll either be a thoughtful exploration of what it means to be human and a cutting satire of American culture, or it'll be about fighting robot ninjas and having a jetpack. Or both! The first proper trailer of the game confirms only that it'll definitely be a mid-budget first-person shooter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's fair to say that Skull And Bones has had a somewhat troubled development. Ubisoft's pirate-themed live service MMO has been knocking around for almost a decade, having been overhauled a couple of times since it started life as a DLC for Asassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. But at a stream tonight it was revealed that Skull And Bones still exists, and not only that, but it has a release date of November 8th, 2022. Still a few months left to delay it again if necessary, but fingers crossed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the mists of time, I actually had a hands on with Ubisoft's pirate 'em up Skull And Bones once. In my memory of it, I was an adolescent, which was categorically not the case and probably more a product of the booths at Gamescom being very tall, not to mention the hands on taking place so very long ago. At that time, the game was essentially the naval combat bit from AC: Black Flag, carved out and extended to be its own thing. Now, years later and with many delays and reworks bobbing about in its wake, Skull And Bones is back, and looking a bit different.
The current state of play for Skull And Bones was revealed with a livestream tonight, featuring an explainer video walking you through some of the game features, a chonk of the game in piratical action, and a surprisingly close release date confirmation for the 8th of November 2022 (there's still time for it to be delayed again!). All those extra months in the oven have produced a decidedly Sea Of Thieves-shaped bun. But this one is all realistic and gritty, more complicated, and is taking itself seriously. You won't catch Skull And Bones announcing its new season features with a comedy song, that's for sure.

The world of Aionios is in a perpetual state of war, endlessly engulfed in flame and littered with corpses. Countries Keves and Agnus love to hate each other, and both factions' armies pay the price. To make matters worse, these seemingly mass-produced soldiers are cursed with short, 10-year lifespans. The goal, then, is to endure front-line service and be forever immortalized in the Homecoming ceremony, an honorable send-off for Aionios' most tenacious survivors. 
I meet Noah, Eunie, and Lanz, during the latter stage of their lifespans (or terms). The leading trio has slain their fair share of Agnusians and watched many beloved…]]></summary>

While Cult of the Lamb's impending August 11 release was already confirmed, a few noteworthy reveals and updates should have indie fans on PlayStation excited for the near future and beyond. Here's a quick rundown of the games making their way to PS5 and PS4. 


Inscryption
One of the best and most surprising games of 2021 makes its way to consoles for the first time. The PS5/PS4 version of the horror deck builder features exclusive features, such as the talking Stoat card's audio coming through the controller speaker, haptic feedback support, and atmospheric lighting that, accordion to creator Daniel Mullens, "spills out from your controller."

The Devil In Me was revealed last October, and it will be the finale to Season One of The Dark Pictures Anthology. It stars Jessie Buckley, who you can see in today's new trailer, and seems to feature many horror elements that lean on the Saw franchise. There are fatal booby traps, maze-like halls, shifting walls, and more. Whatever this house in The Devil In Me is, one thing is for sure: it's a house of horrors inspired by the infamous hotel of serial killer H.H. Holmes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lego and Nintendo have collaborated for years, from sets for the famous plumber’s brother Luigi to this excellent Super Mario 64 set. Now, the two have teamed up once more to give Lego fans the largest Super Mario build yet, and it’s the most infamous villain in the entire Mushroom Kingdom: Bowser. 
Revealed today, this is the biggest Lego Bowser to date, according to Lego, clocking in at 2807 pieces. Dubbed Lego Super Mario: The Mighty Bowser, this build is a “highly detailed recreation of the King of the Koopas, complete with controllable movements and the ability to launch a fireball, reflective of Bowser’s huge and powerful features.” 

This set is notable for Lego, too, because it utilizes newly-created Lego elements to recreate the look of Bowser’s iconic back spikes. Plus, it featur…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-07-07T12:17:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japanese artist Kazuki Takahashi, the creator behind the mega-popular Yu-Gi-Oh! manga, has died at 60. 
This news comes from reports from Japanese public broadcaster NHK, as reported by IGN. According to information coming from Japan, Takahashi was found floating in shallow waters on the coast of Nago City on the Island of Okinawa by the country’s Coast Guard yesterday, July 6. He was wearing snorkeling gear when found by the Coast Guard. Both the Coast Guard and local police are investigating his death. 
Takahashi’s manga career began in 1982, but it didn’t truly take off until the release of Yu-Gi-Oh! in 1996. In between his start and Yu-Gi-Oh!, though, Takahashi published titles like Fighting Hawk and Tennenshoku Danji Buray, according to Kotaku. After Yu-Gi-Oh! hit shelves in 1996, the series only continued to grow in popularity, spawning a real-life card game in 1999 (that’s still extremely popular today) as well as multiple anime series. Today, the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise spans not just manga, card games, and anime, but video games as well, like this year’s Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel.

Foam Sword's 2019 game evokes childhood joys of zooming around with your pal and tricking out your bicycle with reflectors and Spokey Dokeys. That might seem far from the Tour De France but grown-up cyclists are just as keen on customising their bikes for coolness, and even some Tour bikes are rocking garish decoration this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a scant seven months of availability, The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience will be leaving digital console storefronts on July 9. 
According to the Matrix Awakens website, those who add the tech demo to their library on PlayStation 5 and/or Xbox Series X will still be able to launch and mess around with the experience after the delisting date. Here’s what the official site has to say on the matter: 
The Matrix Awakens was first announced and made available on the same night during the 2021 Game Awards. The Unreal Engine 5-powered demonstration from Epic Games stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who introduces the impressive graphics engine and how close to real-life its visuals can look. Awakens includes an on-rails car shootout throughout a city that often looks like it was ripped from the silver screen despite being rendered on the spot. The demo then lets you roam the massive pre-populated city and change things like time of day or traffic congestion to flex what UE5 is capable of. It’s a terrific showcase for the future of games, so if you haven’t given it a download yet, you’ll want to check it out before the delisting on Saturday.
You can watch us tour The Matrix Awakens in this episode of New Gameplay Today.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most popular open-world fantasy RPGs ever made for several reasons, including its in-universe card game, Gwent. 
CD Projekt Red, the studio behind Wild Hunt and 2020’s Cyberpunk 2077, has already created a game based on Gwent, aptly called Gwent: The Witcher Card Game, but it seems the developer is not ready to leave that in-universe game behind just yet. That’s because the studio is launching Gwent: Rogue Mage, a new single-player roguelike deckbuilder, tomorrow. 
Announced by IGN, Gwent: Rogue Mage launches tomorrow, July 7, on PC, iOS, and Android. IGN reports that this game is what Project Golden Nekker, which the team revealed earlier this year, has turned into, and CD Projekt Red is marketing it as a single-player expansion to Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. However, you won’t need to own that because Rogue Mage is standalone. You can purchase the standalone version for $9.99 or the premium edition, which includes in-game skins and cosmetics, and card packs for the multiplayer portion of Gwent, for $19.99. 
“Rogue Mage came out of us noticing that years after The Witcher 3’s release, there are a significant number of players who want a more PvE experience from Gwent,” game director Vladimir Tortsov told IGN. “While Gwent multiplayer is a fantastic game for those who are looking for a great PvP multiplayer experience, we perfectly understand that many Witcher players loved the original mini-game of Gwent for totally different reasons. With Rogue Mage, we aim to give this audience a reason to play modern-day Gwent in the format they prefer.” 
IGN has an exclusive preview of Gwent: Rogue Mage after going hands-on with it ahead of tomorrow’s release, and if you’re looking for even more details about it, including what this single-player deckbuilder roguelike’s gameplay is like, be sure to check it out.

If so, CD Projekt Red have just made your day by revealing the existence of a single-player standalone expansion for their Gwent game, dubbed Rogue Mage. Not only that, but the fantasy roguelike deckbuilder will be out tomorrow, July 7th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valkyrie Elysium, the next entry in the previously dormant Valkyrie Profile series, has a new gameplay trailer and a pair of release dates.
The new video provides a lengthier look at the game’s action-oriented combat and story compared to its more enigmatic debut trailer back in March. 


Square Enix also announced special editions and pre-order bonuses containing extra goodies based on the platform. Pre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on PlayStation gets you the Alscir: Sword of the God of Light in-game item and a special themed avatar. The $74.99 Digital Deluxe Edition includes 72-hour early access, the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld in-game weapon, and a digital copy of Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth, the 2006 PSP port of the first Valkyrie Profile game. 
Don't worry, fans. Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth will also be sold separately on PS5/PS4 on September 29, so you don’t need to buy the Digital Deluxe Edition to play it. Additionally, after buying Elysium on PS4, you’ll also get access to the PS5 version. 
Pre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on Steam grants the 72-hour early access window and unique wallpapers. Its Digital Deluxe version also tosses in the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld. 
Valkyrie Elysium will launch first on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 29. It then arrives on Steam on November 11.]]></summary>

Pre-heating the oven and a rigorous badminton schedule didn't mingle too well with an open world that demanded every ounce of my concentration. I went MIA from the Lands Between for three months, spending my time watching cushy reality TV like Below Deck Mediterranean and lying in my bed, hoping its springs would somehow channel electricity into my bones and recharge my weary mind.
Over the past few days I've returned to the Lands Between with renewed vigor. I've taken a dustpan and brush to the map, sweeping up optional bosses and forts and quests with the wild energy of a cleaner who mustn't stop for even a second. In doing everything it takes to finish this game before I burn out again, I've learned the importance of investment and why spending is good, actually.

It was due out on 11th October later this year, but has now been pushed back to the 24th January 2023. They say it just needs a bit more polishing up before it arrives, which is fine by me. I mean, no point rushing something out before it's ready is there?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forspoken, Square Enix’s upcoming action RPG, will no longer launch in October and has been pushed to January 24.
In a post on the game’s Twitter page, developer Luminous Productions, a team made up of Final Fantasy XV developers, states that Forspoken is largely complete and is in the final polishing phase. It describes the delay as a “strategic decision” and that we’ll learn more about the game in the near future. 
Forspoken is no stranger to delays, as it was originally slated to arrive on May 24 before getting pushed to October 11. Though this second delay isn’t as long, it’s disappointing that we won’t get to experience Frey Holland’s adventure this year, but we trust that the delay will only help get the game up to snuff. The adventure drops Frey, a modern-day New Yorker, in the fantasy world of Athia where she acquires magical powers and a sentient talking bracelet. She’ll use her newfound abilities to free Athia from tyranny while also searching for a way back to her world. 
Forspoken graced Game Informer’s cover in March, and you can catch up on a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age is one of my favourite game series. I replayed Dragon Age: Origins recently not for this column, but for fun. That's the kind of wild gal I am. Origins was one of the reasons I got into PC gaming, because my dinky laptop wasn't good enough to run it and I was desperate to play it after seeing the trailers. I spaffed some of my student loan on a new desktop and spent four months eating nothing but cheese sandwiches. At the time it felt worth it. Watching those trailers now is like opening a time capsule full of fantasy tropes and, for some reason, an incongruous chugging guitar song by someone we don't need to mention ever again.
Replaying it now is a different experience. It's still a really cool RPG, notable for very good world-building and a cast of interesting characters (that you can have sex with in a cold tent), and it continues to hold a dear place in my heart. On the other hand, there's a whole section that's such a mind-numbing slog to get through that everyone hates it and there's a mod specifically to remove it from the entire game. Origins is a game I very much like, yet sometimes struggle to explain why it is good. But I'm not alone in thinking so, 'cos in 2009 this was RPS's Game Of The Year. Can't blame me for that. I didn't even work here then.

More specifically, Ragnarok will hit PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on November 9, meaning we're less than five months away from playing the game. The new trailer released today is short and sweet but still packs a godly punch. Clocking in at just 30 seconds, we see Kratos and Atreus fending off some standard mob enemies before coming face to face with a gigantic black wolf. 
Check out the cinematic "Father and Son" trailer for yourself below: 


Fans of Norse mythology might recognize this beast as Fenrir, the son of Loki. Fenrir plays a significant part in the Norse story of Ragnarok, but we won't spoil that here. Plus, Ragnarok's take on Fenrir could be completely different anyway. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait long because God of War: Ragnarok hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on November 9, 2022.]]></summary>

Specifically, the strain they must be under carrying those preposterously high columns of metal cased packages up and down the slopes of post-apocalyptic America. If I were in his hiking boots, I'm not sure all the reinforced skeletons in the world would help me reach the same kind of porter-ing skills as he does gambolling about the place, at least not based on how sore and tired my dinky little wrists are after a couple of hours of playing Strange Scaffold's new Strand-type game, Witch Strandings. Yes, that's right. Someone other than Hideo Kojima has made a so-called Strand-like, and it's quite possibly the strangest game you'll play all year.

More specifically, Patch 1.17 brings three new things to the game: variable refresh rate (VRR) support, high refresh rate (HFR) support, and a new “Balanced” graphics mode that introduces a 40Hz refresh rate for displays that support it. 


The game only supports VRR on monitors or TVs that feature VRR and if yours does, you can expect improved “dynamic resolution scaling on 60Hz.” Both VRR and HFR target a refresh rate between 60Hz and 120Hz, so if…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearly 30 years after its initial release, Live a Live is finally coming west. This 1994 Super Famicom RPG is from creator Takashi Tokita, one of the key developers behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV. While it would be fascinating to play through Tokita's original vision of Live a Live, we're getting an enhanced remake using the same HD-2D graphical style from the Octopath Traveler games.
I recently spent roughly five hours in this ambitiously designed title, and can confidently say I enjoyed almost every second of its unique approach to storytelling and how it's brought to life through beautiful retro visuals. Square Enix is releasing Live a Live on Switch on July 22. Here are a handful reasons why you should put it on your radar:
Seven Distinct Stories
A Fun Assortment of Characters
Adult Language and Humor?
Excellent Writing
Combat Has Depth...But Will We See It Enough?


It's Beautiful
The 2D-HD look is every bit as stunning as it is in Octopath Traveler. The backdrops in each story are a feast for the eyes. The sprite characters don't offer much animation but do move appropriately to convey an emotion or to highlight a dramatic sequence. The visuals scream of the 16-bit age, but also have modern touches everywhere, like realistic lighting of saloon doors swinging when the stranger strolls in to grab a drink.]]></summary>

Honestly, look at it. For days I’ve been absorbing these images of a baby CPU air cooler, yoked to the dinkiest of PC storage, and I still can’t decide if it’s brilliant or just sheer crawling madness.


Except, in the not-so-distant future, there’s a chance that active SSD cooling won’t seem so excessive at all. That’s because PCIe 5.0 drives are coming and, while they’re set to outpace even the best SSDs that use the current-gen PCIe 4.0 interface, it sounds like such speed will come at the cost of higher temperatures. And, in turn, a higher risk of throttling.

This six-core twelve-thread chip is a solid upgrade over the likes of the Ryzen 5 3600 from the previous generation, but mostly makes sense in a new budget gaming build or as an upgrade for an older Ryzen 1000 or Ryzen 2000 system.

That's nearly a $100 less than the same CPU cost last year, when we trumpeted that the processor had reached $369 in a one-off sale and $175 below the chip's US MSRP.

I’m excited by the news because I was worried these excellent spin-offs would never receive a revival like the platforming Mega Man series did a few years back. Many Battle Network games are currently only available on the Game Boy Advance or the now-dying Wii U virtual console, while others remain locked away on the Nintendo DS. However, a large chunk of the series will now be available to anyone who owns a PlayStation 4, Switch, or a PC running Steam. It’s great to see these classic games on modern platforms, and I hope other companies take note of the preservation strategy Capcom has taken …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skull and Bones, Ubisoft's long-delayed pirate multiplayer game, rises from the depths of the sea on Thursday during a livestream presentation. Announced by Ubisoft today, this show kicks off at 11 a.m. PT and will hopefully provide a substantial look at the open-world multiplayer ship battles and progress made since the delay. Skull and Bones showed promise when it was first announced during an E3 press conference in 2017. Slated to release in the following year, it was indefinitely delayed, even thought to be canceled given the lack of updates from Ubisoft. With fresh wind behind its sails, we will now see what it looks like on current-gen platforms. Come Thursday, you can view the Ubisoft Forward livestream right here.
Ubisoft also revealed a second livestream slated to air on September 10. We don't know what games are in this presentation, but Ubisoft's blog says it will be for multiple projects. Here's hoping Star Wars, Avatar, Assassin's Creed, and Splinter Cell are mentioned in some capacity, if not outright shown.
Until then, are you excited for Skull & Bones? Were you a fan of Ubisoft's pirate-focused Assassins' Creed: Black Flag? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

During an Indie World Showcase last December, Nintendo highlighted Endling: Extinction is Forever, and I was immediately intrigued by the premise. It's attempting to tackle the issue of deforestation and climate change sorrowfully. 
Endling begins with a terrifying look at the destruction of nature at the hands of humans. You control one of the last foxes on Earth, and you must escape a forest – presumably your home – being ravaged by a fire. Shortly after finding a new lair, it turns out you have a pack of cubs to care for. Doing so requires you to feed and nurture the…]]></summary>

Despite the lack of specifics, I was thrilled to hear the indie creator’s next project was in the works.
Then he surprised everyone. Barone publicly shared early Haunted Chocolatier gameplay footage, and it looked incredible. The art style immediately evoked Barone’s first title, though the developer made it clear fans shouldn’t expect the same experience.

Black Forest Games' remake of Destroy All Humans 2: Reprobed is getting couch co-op. That's right, the world will now suffer from the might and insensitive jokes of two Cryptos invading at once. The latest trailer for Reprobed shows off the co-op carnage, and also provides a great look at the rearranged maps, which feature more buildings, plant life, and things to blow to kingdom come.
Reprobed is slated to release on PC and PlayStation and Xbox consoles on August 30. A $399 collector's edition is on the way and comes with a 27.6-inch Crypto figurine, an Arkvoodle statue, a CD of the orchestral score, and an artbook.
The remake of the original Destroy All Humans felt a bit dated. In our review, Joe Juba said "The brightest moments are when the action gives way to pure chaos. I watched electricity arc between humans, made brains pop out of heads, and turned a secret base into smoldering ruins with my spaceship’s death ray. But like a person floating above the ground in the glow of an abducto beam, those moments aren’t connected to anything substantial; they just make some noise and get flung aside." The remake of the sequel modernizes more of the content. Let's hope that helps Crypto find new life again. I'd love to see an entirely new adventure with this foul-mouthed alien leading the charge.

The surprise, however, comes from the studio’s approach to narrative. According to Markuszewski, Starward looked for stories that weren’t already “exploited” by media when figuring out its first project. It wanted to tell a story that hadn’t been told.
Admittedly, where Starward landed was a story told before – almost 60 years ago, in the novel The Invincible, written by Stanisław Lem. In it, the crew of the Invincible spacecraft investigates the planet Regis III for its mis…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've seen sequels rise above and plummet below their precursors. Months ago, I said Overwatch 2 was a redemption arc. And now that the Beta is out on my preferred platform (Xbox), I've gotten the chance to sleep-dart and pulse-bomb my way through multiple game types, arenas, and heroes without the difficulties of mouse and keyboard controls. In other words, I'm confident that Overwatch 2 might not look like a completely different experience from its forebear, but it definitely plays like one.  


It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over-reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You wouldn’t guess it from his child-like appearance, but gaming’s much-loved spherical hero turned 30 this year. Kicking off his first adventure in 1992, Kirby has grown into a juggernaut in the game industry, starring in dozens of titles and making appearances in countless others. The long-running franchise is among video games’ best-selling. One of its most successful titles, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, released in March 2022. It’s not only breaking series records but also sucked in a whole new generation of fans. To celebrate the formidable gumball’s third decade in the industry, we’re looking back at the franchise, from how it started to where it’s floating now.

        <id>118727</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/07/01/new-cult-of-the-lamb-trailer-highlights-best-practices-for-keeping-your-cult-happy"/>
        <updated>2022-07-01T18:59:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting a cult isn’t easy work, but somebody’s got to do it in Massive Monster’s Cult of the Lamb, which hits consoles and PC next month. Fortunately, the team behind the devilishly cute game has released a new trailer with tips and tricks to start, and maintain, the best cult.
The first step is simple: grow your flock. All you need to do is fight through hordes of demon monsters to save innocent woodland creatures that will make for perfect initiates. Of course, you rename each addition and select other facets of their new life to dictate what kind of cult member (and worker) they’ll be for you.
Check it out in action: 


As you can see in the trailer above, growing your flock is just the first step. You also need to satisfy the faithful. To do this, you must tend to your congregation by leading and feeding them and ultimately keeping them happy. You can give them gifts, invite them to feasts, and much more. The final step is to cleanse the non-believers, naturally. 
Unhappy cult members might lose faith in you, but this is fixable. You can opt to re-educate them in the ways of your cult, which will hopefully stop them from persuading other members to rise against you, or, if you just can’t see a solution, you can always sacrifice them to the gods. 
And there you have it – you’re ready to start a cult. For more, watch Game Informer’s exclusive Cult of the Lamb New Gameplay Today, which features never-before-seen gameplay, and then watch this new gameplay trailer that recently debuted during Summer Game Fest, which is where we learned Cult of the Lamb will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Aug. 11. 
Are you excited for Cult of the Lamb? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Join editors Marcus Stewart and Andrew Reiner as they try the upcoming sequel on for size and weigh in on the game’s big changes. We’ll also be playing duos in Fortnite because, well, why not?
Overwatch 2 arrives as a free-to-play multiplayer game on October 4, and Blizzard continues working out the kinks in this new beta. We’ll try out the new hero, Junker Queen, tour the new maps, and see how we adapt to the new 5v5 format. 
We’ll play an hour of Overwatch 2 before switching over to Fortnite. Reiner, a seasoned veteran, will carry me, someone who rarely touches the game but bought a Spider-Man skin just because, to a victory royale. Maybe. You’ll have to tune in and see what happens!

Hot on the heels of the premier of Thor: Love and Thunder on July 8, the company is giving away a custom Series X modeled after Thor’s trusty hammer, Mjölnir. That means the console looks like a big, cracked slab of dwarven-crafted uru that still channels electricity and may or may not be liftable depending on if you’re worthy. It's hard to tell if that handle is real or simply edited into the photo for full effect, but you should probably assume the worst (best?) when considering making space for this thing. 
The contest begins today and concludes on July 21. To enter, you just need to follow the Xbox Twitter account and retweet #ThorLoveandThunderXboxSweepstakes. You can read the full contest rules here.]]></summary>
