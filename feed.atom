        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These late stage amiibo are great looking
Thanks to a live showing at the Zurich Pop-Con & Game Show this past weekend, we have a look at the real Sephiroth and Kazuya amiibo models for the first time.
Obtained by way of images from Twitter user OctoBoxie (through a conversation with the great amiibo resource Amiibo News), Sepiroth is sporting his signature "winged form" (the term that Smash uses internally), and Kazuya is ready to fight in a battle pose. As you can see from the header image, these look just like the mockups we got months ago from one of the last Super Smash Bros. Ultimate streams. All we have to see now is Pyra/Mythra (which have poses too) and a potential Sora figure.
The photos confirm that these detailed figures line up with the great quality of the new Splatoon 3 amiibo. As a reminder, those were shown at the Comic Con/Made in Asia convention in Brussels, Belgium. Nintendo is really bringing out the big amiibo guns to trade shows this year.
As always, you can check out when those were released here in our master amiibo list, which has been updated since 2014. The following amiibo are confirmed but not yet released:
Splatoon 3 wave (Holiday 2022):
Octoling (Blue)
Inkling (Yellow)
Smallfry
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Wave 11 (2022-2023):
Sephiroth
Pyra/Mythra
Kazuya
Sora

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloober Team has announced that its 2021 psychological horror game, The Medium, is getting a TV adaptation. 
The studio announced this in a new blog post today, as translated by Bloody Disgusting, which reveals Tomasz Bagiński, an executive producer for Netflix's Witcher series, and Bloober Team's own Piotr Babieno will oversee the show. 
"Both the film industry and the video game industry are close to my heart, and I am very happy that there is finally an opportunity to bring them both together," Babieno writes in the blog post, according to Bloody Disgusting. "The story we told in the game was appreciated by players, and now more people will be able to hear about it. The latest hits of streaming platforms based on games such as Cyberpunk: Edgerunners or Arcane have shown that this is the perfect time for such productions." 
As noted in Babieno's writing above, The Medium will join a slew of recent video game adaptations that have found great success, like Cyberpunk: Edgerunners (Cyberpunk 2077) and Arcane (League of Legends), and others still in development, like Sony's God of War, Horizon, and Gran Turismo productions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In need of a re-remaster.
When a studio looks to remaster an older title from its repertoire, the absolute minimum expectation is that the new version looks and perhaps plays better than the original, making the most of modern hardware and, where appropriate, integrating new features to align with modern gameplay sensibilities. Granted, the results have often been quite fluctuating; on one side, you’ve got astounding works of art like the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, which arguably improves on the original games in every conceivable way, but on the other there are examples like Silent Hill HD Collection that undoubtedly serve as reminders of why some games should just be left well alone.
Life is Strange: Arcadia Bay Collection sits somewhere in the middle. It showcases two strong entries from the burgeoning franchise — Life is Strange and Life is Strange: Before the Storm — in their entirety, but its release on Switch does little more than highlight both games’ shortcomings, primarily in terms of presentation and visuals. It’s a collection that’s honestly difficult to recommend if you’ve already experienced Don’t Nod’s creation. If you’re completely new to the franchise, then this is an adequate way to experience two solid narrative-driven games.

Following on from its Kickstarter campaign last year, Pixel Games UK has released the previously-cancelled Dune GBA game — called Frank Herbert’s Dune: Ornithopter Assault — on Steam under a brand new name.
Spotted by @TheSpaceShipper on Twitter (via Time Extension), the newly-titled Elland: The Crystal Wars launched yesterday on Valve's distribution service. The game has been retooled slightly to remove references to Frank Herbert's novel, but otherwise remains largely intact. Despite covering the Kickstarter last year, it's a pretty pleasant surprise to see this once-cancelled game hit digital storefronts.

The game has gotten countless updates to both improve quality of life and hugely expand on the game's world and content, and there's still more coming. To get the scoop on the future of No Man's Sky, Eurogamer sat down with public-facing Hello Games developer Sean Murray, who explained the upcoming 4.0 update, as well as the future of where the company is heading next.
The star of the show here is that 4.0 update, which has some big changes headed our way. Going live on Friday, October 7, one of the biggest features of the release with the 4.0 update is that No Man's Sky is finally coming to Nintendo Switch. This is pretty exciting stuff f…]]></summary>

As we hit October and the nights grow colder, we already begin the countdown to this year's GOTY season, as video game fans the world over pick over their favorite titles, to ascertain which games represented the crowning achievements of good tech and good times in 2022. And, of course, it wouldn't be the GOTY season without the coming of Geoff Keighley's big-ass extreme bash: The Game Awards.
This year, ticket-buying members of the public will be able to purchase entry to the live event. This marks the first time the public is allowed entry to the event, having been understandably being barred from attending since the onset of COVID-19. For the 2022 event, however, we mere peasants will be allowed to rub shoulders with the game industry's great and good, (there are some, honestly), to enjoy a few hours of live performances, trophy handouts, and trailer, after trailer, after trailer — no doubt rounded out with a 20-second video from Hideo Kojima.
So, if you fancy heading to Los Angeles for this year's event to see Elden Ring win everything, then keep your eyes glued to both Geoff Keighley's Twitter, and the Microsoft Theater website. Tickets will go on sale on November 1, though the price for entry is yet to be been announced. Be sure to iron your T-shirt with a tuxedo drawn on it, and don't forget to bring your wheelie shoes and invisible dog leash. We'll make them sorry that they ever re-opened the doors to the little people.
The Game Awards 2022 will take place December 8 at Microsoft Theater, Los Angeles.

Much like my Liverpool fandom over the past 20 years, I vacillate between happily obsessive and begrudgingly bewildered with FIFA. Like Liverpool, when FIFA works like a well-oiled machine, play on the field is beautiful, slick, and drives my football-loving brain to elation with dopamine hits. However, FIFA 23 feels like FIFA 22, which was similar to FIFA 21, with additions ranging from mildly impactful to invigorating.
FIFA has focused on one facet of soccer for years: the attack. It’s almost arc…]]></summary>

That's an awesome deal for what is already one of the best value PCIe 3.0 SSDs, offering sequential read speeds up to 2600MB/s and sequential write speeds up to 1800MB/s. That's about five times faster than even the fastest SATA drive in terms of peak read speeds, making this an excellent choice for handling large files such as 4K videos, disc images and so on. 
To get this reduced price, you'll need to use the code SPEND15 at Ebay. This knocks £21 off the price, moving it from £140 to £119.

A child can believe that a dollar store knock-off Transformer is anywhere near as sexy as the real thing. They can also convince themselves that Mega Man on DOS is equatable to the NES version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Get your first look at Dead Space gameplay"
A Dead Space remake trailer is coming on Tuesday October 4 at 11AM ET, and it'll be our first actual look at what the re-release has in store for us.
The news comes by way of the game's official Twitter account, which simply notes the date and time, as well as a brief text teaser. Here's all the info we have at the moment, as well as a reiterated release date confirmation:
"Get your first look at Dead Space gameplay and prepare to uncover the mystery aboard the USG Ishimura when the game launches on January 27, 2023."

As you may recall, we got an "early look" at the Dead Space remake roughly a year ago, but this one promises the "first official look at gameplay." This will likely include some nuanced nods to the "Dead Space 2 inspired zero-G movement," as well as the updated dismemberment system.
Since more and more publishers have gotten into the remaster/remake game, the space is decidedly crowded, but the reaction to Dead Space 2023 has been mostly positive so far. They even confirmed a lack of microtransactions a year ago! Smart move. It also helps that this particular game was widely liked at launch, and is from 2008: which feels like legitimate remake territory.
Remaking a popular series like this also lends itself to continued side projects of re-releases; in this case, leading into Dead Space 2 and Dead Space 3. If they can improve some things with the third entry the second time around (ha, video games in 2022 in a nutshell), they could have a big winner with re-selling this trilogy.

Publisher Nacon has announced that WRC Generations has been hit with a last-minute delay, and will no longer meet its October 13 release date — the Kylotonn-developed racer will now launch November 3 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. A Nintendo Switch port is still in development for later release.
Speaking on Twitter, Nacon notes that it has decided to bring the console release in line with the PC launch date in order to allow for some further polish time for the PlayStation and Xbox editions by the development team at Kylotonn. Console players can pre-order WRC Generations now to receive a bonus vehicle — the Peugeot 206 WRC model. While PC players cannot pre-order the game, this bonus DLC will be offered to everybody who purchases WRC Generations on PC within its first two weeks of release.

WRC Generations promises to deliver the most content ever featured in a rally game. In addition to hosting over 750km of racetrack from no less than 22 countries, the new sequel will include 49 teams from the official WRC 2022 season, as well as 37 legendary cars and 165 timed special stages. WRC Generations will also feature hybrid cars for the very first time, bringing with them their own unique racing strategies — based on the battery management of the somewhat greener mud-rippers.

River City Girls 2 director Bannon Rudis sent me a cryptic message on Friday. "There is a play in Japan. I have no info on this."
That's the kind of mystery I live for, so I got to researching, and eventually found out that a theater company called Solid Star (Heaven Eleven, Yu x You) is putting on a River City Girls play based on the original game. It's set to be performed live from December 7th to 11th, 2022. That's quite the limited run! And the cast is massive, maybe larger than that of the original game. Is that even possible? Bannon tells me that neither he nor River City Girls 2 writer Adam Tierney have anything to do with this production, so like Willie Scott once sang, "Anything Goes."
I'd love to see Bannon and Adam go to Japan to review this official(?) River City Girls play, but I'm not sure who'll pay to make that happen. Maybe Solid Star will? Even better would be if they shelled out some extra dough to cast my old Road Rules Northern Trail friend Bob Sapp as Abobo. Bob also hit me up just last Friday, for the first time in 25 years, to see how I was doing. Having Bannon and Bob come at me on the same day feels like more than a coincidence.
Solid Star, if you're reading this, I will personally pay for Bob's airfare and lodging if that's what it takes to see him hit the stage in your show. Abobo was the role he was born to play.

If you're a Paper Mario fan, then there's one key thing that you probably share with all other Paper Mario fans: Disappointment.
Unfortunately for all of us who love the antics of Intelligent Systems' two-dimensional plumber, the Paper Mario series has been slowly declining in quality, taking the things we loved about the early games (turn-based combat! Witty writing! Incredible characters!) and turning them into things that... just aren't as good. Endless parades of faceless Toads, combat that relies too heavily on a gimmick that doesn't quite work, and writing that never quite reaches the heights of Paper Marios of old... this is what we've had to endure for a while (although, admittedly, Origami King was pretty good).

The deal includes GameSpot, Giant Bomb, GameFAQs, and Metacritic from Red Ventures, the previous owners, who had themselves acquired the portfolio from ViacomCBS.

For those of you currently grinding it out in Shin Megami Tensei spin-off Soul Hackers 2, Atlus is currently preparing a new update that hopes to make your hour-chomping journey through the demon-filled dungeons a more streamlined and faster-paced experience.
The new update, which will drop on all platforms in November, will feature a variety of gameplay and U.I. tweaks, all seemingly designed to remove the hurdles between you, the monsters, and endless nights of level-grinding action. The November update will add a "Dash" function to our dungeon-running heroes, and will also offer a "high-speed" option to the game's many, many, many demonic encounters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiHU6riu1UQ
In regards to Soul Hackers 2's U.I. and menu system, several small tweaks have been made to expedite the process and get you back to soul 'ackin in double quick time. Players will now teleport to the shop interior when selecting the shop from the in-game map, while the tip transitions on loading screens have been stripped down to increase load times. Some menu elements will also be rearranged to prevent you over-eager button mashers from accidentally clicking the wrong option.
In addition to the above changes, four more demons will be added to the big book of baddies. These are the fiery Aitvaras, the priestess Isis, comical warrior Neko Shotgun, and finally, the iconic cutie-pie, Pixie (Devil Summoner variant). While a specific launch date is yet to be announced, fans can expect this update to hit next month.
Soul Hackers 2 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

As pointed out by redoubtable pointer-outer-of-things Wario64, the game has appeared listed with an (inaccurate) 1st October 2022 release date, sitting just under the PS4 and PS5 versions which launched back in August.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[He needs no introduction
It's hard to believe that Fire Emblem Engage is already coming in January, but Nintendo seems dead set on that soonish release date: and is steadily showing off more of the game (albeit on the official Fire Emblem Japanese Twitter account). Amid the sprinkling of gameplay (more so than the trailer) we've gotten so far, the latest set of clips includes gameplay of a series star. New Fire Emblem Engage Marth footage is out thanks to the series' Twitter account, and gives us a better look at the hero in action.
Here is the full introduction/mini character bio from the inaugural tweet (translated/cleaned up), which also reveals his Japanese voice actor:
"Marth (CV: Hikaru Midorikawa) is commonly known as 'The Beginning Heraldry', and is a noble and charismatic hero among heroes. He is the prince of the Altea Kingdom, located in the alien continent of Archanea,"

We get to see how guest characters seem to appear in Engage, and Marth is reconfirmed as a sword user in this entry. There will also be some story elements involved with the summoned heroes, including the below conversation with the main character.
If Engage pulls this off, and manages to bring in some of the most celebrated characters in this series' lengthy history, it could lead to some explosive moments. Ideally the team actually manages to make these portions sing: and elevates them over a fanservice-like inclusion.

Trailer tomorrow. Tune in at 8am PT for the first official look at #DeadSpace gameplay.

October 3, 2022
This premiere is being dubbed as the "first official” look at gameplay. That distinction likely means that the footage will be of a near-complete build of the game since developer Motive Studios has spent the last year releasing several behind-the-scenes videos showcasing gameplay in more unfinished forms. This transparent approach to Dead Space’s development has given fans raw looks at how the 2008 classic is being updated. Player feedback from these videos has even allowed Motive to make subtle but important changes earlier in the pipeline. With the game only a few months away, we're curious to see how all of that work has coalesced. 
Dead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It also asks you to choose between Kain or Raziel
A new Crystal Dynamics-helmed Legacy of Kain survey has popped up, and could inform the future of the franchise based on its results.
Although it was a fairly short run looking back on it, the series tore onto the gaming scene in 1996, exploded in 1999 with Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, and then effectively ended unceremoniously in 2003 with Defiance. Since then the powers that be attempted to resurrect the series in multiplayer form, but it also died off in its own way. But with Crystal Dynamics bought and paid for and part of the Embracer Group now, it's likely time to start tapping into nostalgia.
As a reminder, here are the five major Legacy of Kain games that the survey centers on:
Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain (1996)
Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver (1999)
Soul Reaver 2 (2001)
Blood Omen 2 (2002)
Legacy of Kain: Defiance (2003)
Question topics for the Legacy of Kain survey include:
Have you ever seen someone stream a Legacy of Kain game?
How would you rate each game you've played in the series?
What are your favorite parts about the series (mechanically and thematically)?
Who is your favorite protagonist (Kain or Raziel)?
What would your reaction to a new "vampire game" be?
Do you want to see a sequel, remake, reboot, or remaster?
Do you want a theoretical game to be single or multiplayer (co-op is also an option)?
Beyond that, one of the most important questions drills down whether or not you'd rather see a remaster/remake of any of the five core games first. For what it's worth, my top pick is probably a Soul Reaver remake. There are so many different directions you can go, but if I had to choose one possible outcome, that would likely yield one of the best-received/commercially successful single titles.
[Thanks Jeff!]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steps of Glory
The mighty Malenia, Blade of Miquella has fallen to a dedicated Elden Ring player once again — And while this is a meaty enough task and something of an achievement in itself, extra glory belongs to streamer and cosplay model MissMikkaa for striding into battle armed with... a dance mat.
Yes, you read that correctly, MissMikka, with a level one player character no less, toppled the iconic guardian of The Lands Between with the aid of a flimsy plastic mat and some jet-black volleyball socks. This incredible feat is the latest hurdle MissMikka has surmounted in her endeavor to battle their way through the FromSoft RPG with all manner of control-based disadvantages. (Previously, MissMikkaa had won plaudits for completing Elden Ring while playing with just one hand).
https://twitter.com/MissMikkaa/status/1576608756187549701?s=20&t=56BFRDUEJbyE1QwIRuBRDQ
Of course, this was hardly a spontaneous, lazy afternoon affair, with MissMikkaa racking up a total of 553 attempts, which totals somewhere in the region of 15 hours of playtime, all spent just battling this one single boss character. Like so many of these unbelievable self-set streamer challenges, it has taken dedication, patience, practice, and knees that won't fall off at a moment's notice, (like mine), in order for MissMikkaa to step up to the plate. Literally. When you add into the mix that they were also hosting a stream and speaking to the viewers while the battle raged on — That's some multitasking.
Kudos to The Lands Between Dance Mat Champion... Now maybe go and give your ankles a rest.
Elden Ring is available now on PlayStation and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NieR-ly perfect.
NieR:Automata is perhaps a story of the power of word of mouth. A sequel in an IP with a devoted but modest following by Square Enix standards, it became a notable sales success over time as initial fans convinced neutrals that something special had arrived. Director Yoko Taro was also clever in his approach to storytelling - playing its predecessor(s) or the recently released remaster, NieR Replicant, gives you extra context and lore, but this entry is also self-contained and gives players all of the information they need. What we have, then, is a wonderful slice of sci-fi storytelling wrapped in an accomplished action adventure RPG. It's quite unlike anything else, and now we get to enjoy it on Switch with the content- complete The End of YoRHa Edition.
A topic that often comes up in gaming, particularly in the retail / triple-A space, is the challenge of blending creative vision with slick, attractive experiences. Publisher Square Enix made a savvy decision, as it partnered the incredibly creative Taro-san with PlatinumGames, the latter being fans of the original NieR and very much on board to apply a flair for action and combat gaming. The blend is intoxicating, and also helped to establish the reputation of Platinum's Takahisa Taura, who worked on design here before making his directing debut with Astral Chain; it's fascinating playing Automata now, as there are whispers of ideas here that are played out more fully in 2019's Switch exclusive.

Well, Crystal Dynamics are running a survey seeking opinions about where a hypothetical next instalment in the series might go. They’re also checking whether anyone would be up for remasters or remakes of earlier games, such as Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver. If you don’t enjoy the sound of a satirical co-op beat ‘em up set in the vampiric realm of Nosgoth then you might want to chime in with your thoughts.

If you've spent a good amount of time with the N64 classic The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and its sequel The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, you may have become quite familiar with the visuals of each games and which assets were brought over from one title to the other.
The keen-eyed among you may even notice some small differences, too. One of these happens to be the texture of the deku stick, a key item in both games that can be used to give enemies a good whack while also acting as a pretty handy makeshift torch. Apparently, the slight difference in the stick's appearance between both games wasn't by design, but rather a bug that was left during development. This comes via Twitter user 'darkeye' who discusses the curiosity in a thread (click through to view all posts):

Then a gameplay reveal arrived later at Summer Geoff Fest and it immediately slid into the "Cor, this game looks a bit good doesn't it?" category of my brain. Finally, another game befitting A44, the studio behind minimalistic Ashen which Brendy quite enjoyed.
Colour me excited when I had the chance to see a half-hour presentation of the game in action at this year's Gamescom, and chat to A44's CEO Derek Holding at the same time. It was even better than I'd expected, honestly, and I've come away with the belief that it may just be one of the best Soulslikes to arrive in quite some time.

Splatoon 3 items themed like Back to the Future? Right on!
As some folks are pointing out: the cheeky team at Nintendo managed to put in a few clear references via Salmon Run items. The first includes Doc Brown's futuristic metal sunglasses from Back to the Future 2, titled the "Lo-Vis Visor." Next up we have Marty McFly's future hat (also from Back to the Future 2), called the "Bream-Brim Cap." Another spotted reference includes the "Brain Strainer" in-game item, which is likely a reference to Ghostbuster's 2 Keymaster Helmet.
Funnily enough, Back to the Future 2 takes place in the glorious year of 2015: when everything was supposed to be future-ized. While the full Splatoon timeline isn't clear, it does play around with the idea of the fate of the future.

Following a huge update to the game as we currently find it out in the wild, it seemed unlikely that the Switch would be able to handle the large amount of interstellar content required to keep No Man's Sky the experience that people have come to love since it launched back in August 2016. When we discovered that it would be coming to Switch, our curiosity about the project's scope and the inevitable compromises to get it running on Nintendo's hardware grew further.

Sharpen your scythes, brighten your blades, and paint your toenails, as Arc System Works has announced a date for its crossplay open beta for stylish slapfest Guilty Gear Strive — The beta will take place on PlayStation and PC platforms, worldwide, on the weekend of October 14 to October 17.
During this time, players on PS4, PS5, and PC will be able to duke it out amongst themselves, will ArcSys gathers data, stress-tests servers, and attempts to identify and eradicate issues that arise from putting all GG Strive players into a single pool. This beta will give the developer all of the information it needs to progress its plans to roll out crossplay to Guilty Gear Strive proper at some point in the foreseeable future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egDKVZ8QBOQ
The beta will run within its own client, separate from the main GG Strive build, which will be available to download from October 13, ahead of the server's opening times. The beta will be open to all, regardless as to whether you own Guilty Gear Strive or have a PlayStation Plus account. A full roster of 21 characters will be available, as will a wide variety of modes including Tutorial, Practice, Survival, various Online and CPU Vs. options, and even the very fun diorama builder, Figure Mode. No player data from the beta will be carried over into your main GG Strive account, so you wanna get nuts? Let's get nuts!
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms. It will launch on Xbox platforms in spring 2023. In related news, rollback netcode is coming to series' predecessor Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tipping the scales in your favour.
It is truly a testament to the genius of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild that we are still discovering new mechanics in the game five years on. One such detail that has passed us by unnoticed for all this time has been recently brought to our attention by Gaming Reinvented, and it concerns the order in which the game's three dragons drop their valuable items.
Anyone who has poured enough hours into Breath of the Wild (and we assume that is most of you) will know of the art of farming items from dragons. Soaring into the sky via an updraft while that twinkling piano takes over the score - it is one of the game's most magical moments. Of course shooting arrows at the flying dragons gains you a number of rewards depending on where you strike - scale, claw, horn or fang.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't waste your Sterling on this.
If you’ve been keeping tabs on EA’s hugely popular football franchise, you’ll have heard that FIFA 23 marks the end of an era. As the final game to carry the FIFA licence before EA parts ways with its partner of 30 years, most multiformat sites have been discussing FIFA 23’s importance as the finale of a long-running series, at least in terms of branding.
For Switch owners, however, this is old news. People can harp on about the end of an era all they like, but as far as Nintendo players are concerned the FIFA series died half a decade ago. What we’ve been getting since then is the video game equivalent of ‘80s comedy Weekend at Bernie’s, with EA propping up the corpse of FIFA 18 on a stick and jiggling it around in the hope that people will believe it’s still a living, breathing entity.

Retired game developer Kevin Edwards has recently been taking to Twitter to share his experience of the industry in the 1990s. While these posts certainly provide a deep dive into the intricacies of building a video game, so too do they demonstrate the trials involved when the development team is placed under high pressure and restrictive deadlines.
One such post has been unpacked by the good folks over at Time Extension, in which Edwards shares a less than forgiving fax concerning the 1992 SNES title, Spider-Man and the X-Men in Arcade's Revenge. Sent from Arcade's Revenge publisher, Acclaim (via its LJN label), the note details what changes needed to be made to the superhero platformer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guerrilla Tactics
A strange, yet unsurprising, sprang forth to the information superhighway this weekend, with several sources reporting that Sony Interactive Entertainment is in the process of creating a PS5 remaster of Guerrilla Games' epic 2017 release, Horizon Zero Dawn.
First reported by MP1ST, with various industry pundits and websites supposedly corroborating the news, the remaster will be an updated and upgraded take on the anachronistic sci-fi adventure, which saw hunter and tribeswoman Aloy venture out into a lush land of dangerous machinery on a quest of reflection and self-growth. Originally launching on PS4, the smash seller would eventually make the leap to PC in 2020.
While details are understandably slim — even unproven — on the supposed remaster, one can likely expect improved load times, upgraded textures, improved accessibility options, and slicker visual effects, perhaps bringing the title more in line with its utterly stunning sequel, Horizon Forbidden West. We can likely look to similar PS5 remasters, such as The Last of Us and Marvel's Spider-Man, for examples of some of the improvements SIE will be striving for in this new release.
In addition to the remaster, the MP1ST report also claims that Guerrilla Games is currently working on a multiplayer side-title set within the Horizon universe. The alleged project is currently in the early stages of development for PS5 and PC, and will see a conflict between the world's various tribes, with gameplay defined by some form of PvP or co-op multiplayer element. Given the success of the Horizon titles to date, it figures that SIE would be looking to capitalize on the series' growth via numerous projects.
The gaming industry will not rest until we are all playing the exact same four games ad infinitum.

I hope that you have a warm drink to hand this cold fall morning, and I thank you for taking time out from your weekend to check in with us. It's getting colder out there for sure. Wish I was there to warm you up.
For now, however, it is the weekend, and I hope that yours is filled with happiness, joy, good food, good friends, and video games. And if you are working, then I hope you have a smooth shift, and are able to make the most of the time which you do have to yourself — perhaps later this evening, or tomorrow. Either way, treat yourself this weekend, whenever you are able to, and be kind to yourself, always.

Retro publisher Hamster just can't get off of its Namco kick at the moment. This week's entry to its classic-filled Arcade Archives is one of the developer's lesser-known arcade releases. Now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, it's Namco's futuristic tank battler, Assault.
Released to the Japanese arcade scene in 1988 under the title "Akeaka Assault," before trundling west under its simpler, localized title, Assault is a future-set top-down shooter that puts the player in the driving seat of an intergalactic tank, and tasks them with bringing down their planet's colonizers in a uniquely dark narrative — and one that is surprisingly prescient to modern eyes... 
In Assault, you play a native warrior of a far-off planet, who starts out upon a one-man rebellion again…]]></summary>

After two years in Early Access, it's time to check back in with Grounded now that it's been fleshed out with more bugs to battle and harvest, more impossibly large backyard sights to seek out, and a fully realized story — complete with an eventual ending — to uncover.
Having only dabbled in the early build, back when there were hardly any threads to follow, I'm surprised how far Grounded has come thanks to ongoing updates and a big final push for the 1.0 launch on PC and Xbox. Originally, the familiar yet creative-up-close shrunken world was its biggest asset — and it still is to this day. But now, the whole survival loop feels cohesive, with plenty of thoughtful touches you'd expect from a passion p…]]></summary>

Anyone who's been into games for more than like a day knows how long the wait can be for our favorite titles to release. Game delays are a dime a dozen these days, but for some fans, the wait is so long, you start to wonder if you'll ever get to see the Promised Land. While the development cycle can be anywhere from a year or two to six or seven years at most, there are some games out there that we've been waiting much, much longer for. One of those games is Beyond Good & Evil 2, a long-awaited sequel to Ubisoft's beloved classic. It's been so long since the game was initially teased at Ubidays 2008, in fact, that the title is considered the longest-awaited AAA game of all time.
The previous record-holder in this regard was Duke Nukem Forever — players had to wait over 14 years from its announcement in 1997 to its release in 2011 (or 5,156 days, to be exact). We've now been waiting 5,236 days for Beyond Good & Evil 2 as of the writing of this post, and it doesn't look like we'll be getting any updates any time soon.
Ubisoft did release a full trailer for the game at E3 back in 2017 that looked pretty good, but I guess it would have been a pretty bad omen if it didn't considering they had supposedly been working on it for nine years at that point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsoIUHDrPcg
Some Reddit users have pointed out that we wait so long for some games that they become something of an urban legend. Beyond Good & Evil 2 certainly fits the bill there, along with Half-Life 3 and whatever project Ken Levine is supposedly working on.
Part of me wants to respect whatever difficulties are likely going on behind the scenes to draw development out this much, but another part of me is so beyond curious to hear about any development drama. Oh well, if it's anything interesting, Jason Schreier will probably write a book about it eventually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rowing Blazers, a New York-based clothing brand, has announced a new line of Sonic the Hedgehog apparel. The collection draws inspiration from Sonic's aesthetic from the 1990s, with graphics inspired by art from the time. 
Those who are interested in the collection can look forward to clothing items like a cotton sweater with Sonic's image, a zip-up polar fleece, heavyweight rugby jerseys, a French terry loopback hoodie, cotton tees, and mesh shorts. The line also includes baseball caps, canvas tote bags, a necktie, and a hand-embroidered Sonic patch for blazers and other clothing items.
You can see a gallery of some of the items in the collection below.

According to Jack Carlson, founder and creative director of Rowing Blazers, which has done collaborations with FILA, Umbro, the NBA, and more, the company's creations all hold important links to his personal life.
"A lot of it has to do with the things I loved growing up: the sports, the brands, the culture," he said in a press release. "I grew up in the '90s playing Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis. Sonic has always been such an interesting character to me. In the original games, he was a little bit brash, a little bit punk. He was different from other cartoon and video game protagonists. He was very '90s. Of course, there have been a lot of Sonic clothing capsules created over the years. I wanted to do something elevated, really beautifully made, and kind of timeless in its aesthetic. Of course, there's a kind of irony to it because Sonic himself isn't really very preppy, but that's the fun of it."
The collection retails as low as $38 to $325, though nothing is currently listed at the higher end of that spectrum just yet. The collection is live now, having launched yesterday. If you'd like to check out the collection for yourself, you can head here.]]></summary>

The team behind Dragon Age: Dreadwolf is giving fans a taste of the lore awaiting them in the new RPG. The writing team has shared a handful of codex entries from Dreadwolf, as part of a community update on the next Dragon Age.
In a BioWare blog post, the team behind Dreadwolf runs down the basics. As it says, stories and characters are at the core of BioWare games. Each person has their own motivations, and each entry has its own hero, molded by player decisions.
Creating a world that's interesting to role-play in, then, is pretty important. And that's what today's codex entries tease out. Dreadwolf will set out for the Tevinter Imperium, an old and powerful region ruled by a host of mages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's fun 2B fashionably late
NieR: Automata was first released in 2017, just close enough to the Switch launch date that it could have helped define the console's larger identity. It's definitely a "Style over Horsepower" game, and did little to tax the hardware of the now last-gen PS4. It's also developed by PlatinumGames, who've done a lot to build their audience on Nintendo consoles in recent years. Between The Wonderful 101, the full Bayonetta franchise, and Astral Chain, the Switch is where the bulk of their character action games live now. That's another reason why it's felt a little weird to see NieR: Automata on every major platform but Switch for all these years, but then again, weird has always been Nier's thing.
Now the game is finally headed to Switch on October 4, 2022, and I'…]]></summary>

Boutique retailer Limited Run Games, not content with merely offering up physical games, toys, clothes, and soundtracks, has decided to get into the world of the printed word, with the announcement of a new book publishing arm, Limited Press Run.
The new endeavor, which is led by Limited Run writer Jared Petty and media researcher Jeremy Parish, will see Limited Press Run publish a range of books based on video games and game-adjacent topics. Hitting the ground running, the new outlet has already released its first three tomes, which focus on various aspects of retro gaming — a topic that is obviously close to Limited Run's heart.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To be this bad take AGES
Following up on its previous interest in the controversial and highly unstable blockchain market, Sega has announced that it is partnering with a Japanese developer to publish its first blockchain video game.
As reported by 4Gamer and VGC, the untitled release will be a new entry in Sega's strategy series Sangokushi Taisen — a hybrid coin-op/card game franchise — based upon the legendary Romance of the Three Kingdoms folklore — is popular with Japanese arcade goers but is something of an anomaly on western soil. Sega is allowing studio Double Jump Games to license the Sangokushi Taisen IP for its new blockchain project, utilizing the company's "Oasys" technology. Details are sketchy at this juncture as to what form the blockchain element will take, but characters and artwork from the series are likely to be part of the collectible process.
As you have likely read about, here and else, the blockchain and NFT market, allows for the creation of artwork, icons, items, and other tokens to be stored in an online capacity, with ownership rights to be bought, traded, and sold. While the past year has seen all manner of franchises and companies swiftly declare their love for the new tech, the market itself has proven incredibly unstable, leading to huge losses in revenue, stolen "ownership" of items, and artists' work stolen and "resold" in NFT format.
In addition, video game companies trying to implement blockchain/NFT technology into their titles have often backpedaled in the face of criticism and derision from their respective communities. For more information on how NFTs and blockchain technology is attempting to become part of the mainstream gaming market, you can check out our previous feature by Jonathan Holmes.

As well as a convenient place to relieve yourself and top up on snacks, these futuristic service stations also house cosmetic surgery bots, operation tables, teleportation booths and more - and they're all overseen by a powerful AI trying to find the best possible future for the human race. As the station's head clerk, you'll debate the ethics of eternal youth and end of life care, while also making sure your station has enough power, stocked shelves and a happy customer base. It's certainly an intriguing combo compared to other management games out there right now, so I sat down with director Laurent Victorino and writer Antony Jauneaud to find out more.

Beatrix LeBeau has packed up her slime-wrangling gear and has crossed the Slime Sear to Rainbow Island, a new land packed with new mysteries and new slimes.
As a seasoned slime wrangler myself, I was excited to dive head-first into this new, colourful world. Review code didn't arrive until launch day unfortunately, but all week I've been vibrating with anticipation. After spending a handful of hours frolicking with slimes and skipping around Rainbow Island, though, that early dazzle is starting to wear off. Monomi Park’s sequel feels a little too familiar to its predecessor in its early game, and it's put a major downer on my goo-hoovering adventures.

Slitherine are referring to their take on Master Of Magic as a re-imagining rather than a remake or reboot, saying they’ve tried to be “faithful to the original in spirit and mood”. You’ll be able to Gandalf it up from December 13th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out Of Hands is a fairly "does what it says on the tin" title for this, a game where you play a dude who dreams he is made entirely out of hands every night. It also operates as a decent joke, because rather than being out of hands, he, if anything, has too many. So full marks for the name. The game itself is kind of a deckbuilder but not really, and though it also describes itself as a thriller, I can't say my heart rate was raised. In fact, behind the (admittedly very cool) visual style there seems to be a pretty run-of-the-mill "a girl I liked is no longer in my life and I'm pretty cut up about that" story. I guess in the full game it might turn out she was murdered, or she mudered the main character, or the main character murdered her - just, some kind of murder, maybe?
But in the four demo levels I played recently, it seemed like a pretty normal breakup. I was really excited to give it a go, but in the preview I didn't find the contrast between a face made of squirming hands and the well trodden women-be-leavin' plot to be particularly affective or evocative. The squirming hands are cool, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At this year's Gamescom I got hands-on with Bytten Studio's Cassette Beasts, an upcoming monster-taming open world RPG in the vein of Pokémon, which is far more interesting to me than the basic concept of Pokémon. That's because you're able to fuse together any monsters you 'catch', but moreso because it's a monster collectathon where you become the monster, essentially fusing yourself with bomb dogs and hermit crabs with traffic cone-homes.
I like the way the game does away with the overdone shonen story of wanting to become the very best there ever was, and instead puts the spotlight on its cast of characters and the relationships you form with your buds. It's looking mighty promising.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've ever wondered what the 1987 film Running Man might look like as a turn-based tactics game (see also last year's Netflix sensation Squid Game, if the Running Man reference doesn't quite do it for you), then Homicidal All-Stars probably comes pretty close. It's the debut game from Artificer, a new studio formed by a bunch of ex-CreativeForge devs who worked on the first Hard West and Phantom Doctrine, and it centres on a woman called Scarlett who finds herself competing in the deadly TV show that gives the game its name. Like Running Man, Squid Game and all those other 'deadly games' you know and love, Homicidal All-Stars is about folks who down on their luck fighting for their lives, where their only consolation prize in these dystopian bloodbaths is not getting pulped at the end of it. 
For Scarlett, this means mowing down scumbags in classic turn-based fashion with a bunch of other friendly competitors she's teamed up with, but this is far from a straightforward XCOM-like. Between fights, you'll also be navigating its trap-filled arenas in third-person, dodging sniper turrets, disabling tripwires, and dashing over spiky/fiery/horrible pits to get to the end of each 'episode'. It's a refreshing mix based on an early preview build I've been playing recently, especially when its gameshow hook allows for its malicious host, Orion Ford, to start meddling with your success. "He’s the person behind the worst of the twists," creative director and Artificer CEO Kacper Szymczak tells me. "He’ll start filling the level with poisonous gas, he’ll turn off the lights, drop explosive barrels everywhere, to name just a few."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Massively multiplayer games rapidly calcified around a specific set of design ideas (eg. World Of Warcraft) and so many other attempts to jam a load of players onto a single server quickly disappeared (eg. most games by Improbable or Amazon). 

Foxhole is one of the few to do it successfully: a single, massive World War 2 battlefield in which players don't just fight at the frontlines, but form supply routes, build defenses, and otherwise take the reigns of the logistics of war. After five years in early access, Foxhole released version 1.0 today.

The second I began Shovel Knight Dig, it felt like returning home. As someone who hadn’t played most of Shovel Knight’s post-launch DLC, the last time I touched this series was nearly a decade ago. Gaining control of the titular character immediately felt familiar, and my old Shovel Knight habits returned to greet this new take on the series, led by developer Nitrome this time. The moment-to-moment experience plays excellently, in part because it’s more Shovel Knight with some well-designed gameplay twists. However, the game’s venture into roguelite territory feels i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google has revealed that its cloud-streaming games service, Stadia, will shut down early next year. 
More specifically, Stadia will close down its platform and end its online servers on January 18, 2023. After that, you won't be able to access the Stadia service in any way. As for your games and hardware, Google is offering refunds "for all Stadia hardware purchases (Stadia controllers, Founders Edition, Premiere Edition, and Play and Watch with Google TV packages) through the Stadia store," according to an FAQ posted by Google today. It seems like the only aspect of Stadia that won't be refunded are Stadia Pro subscriptions. However, you "will be able to continue playing your games in Pro without further charges until the final wind down date." 
If you are hoping to get a refund for your hardware, Google says "most hardware purchases...made directly from Google" will not require you to return your hardware. The company intends to have the majority of refunds processed by Stadia's January 18 shutdown date. 
The Stadia Store and all its functions have been turned off so you will not be able to make any more Stadia-related purchases or in-game transactions. 
Stadia shutting down isn't the most surprising news. Despite cloud gaming's continuing rise in popularity as of late thanks to the likes of Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming initiative and others, Stadia never seemed to really take off. The first big sign that Stadia might not be long for this world came back in February of last year, when Google revealed it was ending its first-party game development and closing two studios. Then, this February, word got out that Google Stadia had reportedly been deprioritized by the company. Now, Stadia has just a few months left in it before it becomes a part of history. So long, Stadia.

As one's mind does in momentous occasions, it turned to Nintendo Switch Sports football and how its small roster of players may be one of the best representations of talent in a sports game that I've come across. Come on, humour me here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Kepler Interactive and developer Ebb Software have revealed that Scorn's release date has changed, moving up one week earlier in October. The game will now release on October 14 instead of the previously announced October 21. 
As for why, the team doesn't say. However, a new teaser trailer released today is titled, "You've waited long enough," so perhaps the studio simply wants to get this game into players' hands sooner. Check it out for yourself below: 


Here are some screenshots from the game: 

For more Scorn, check out this trailer from the June Xbox and Bethesda Showcase and then watch these 14 minutes of gameplay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An exciting new fan-made Quake singleplayer map pack explores the Internet's favourite architectural style, Brutalism. 35 maps offer all sorts of concrete hells, ranging from housing estates and Control-esque facilities to otherworldly ritual spaces and straight-up murderholes. Having spent much of my early thirties skulking around the Barbican, I really enjoyed this variety of Brutalist experiences. And the monstermurder. The monstermurder's fun, too. Here, come admire how pretty the hub level is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skull and Bones has been delayed again, this time to March of next year. 
It was originally due out in 2018 but then delayed to 2019. It was delayed to at least March 2020 after that, but things went quiet and the game missed that window. Then, in May of last year, Ubisoft announced that Skull and Bones would release sometime between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. And now, it's slipping out of its November 8 release date, which was only just announced back in July, into a new March 9, 2023 date. As for why, the team cites a need for more polish and balancing.
Kotaku's Ethan Gach says sources say the teams working on Skull and Bones are burnt out. According to Gach in his Kotaku story, the latest technical test for the game ended on September 19. One source involved with the test told Kotaku that gameplay was more refined than in previous tests but that progression needed work as it still felt too shallow. Gach writes that this is a concern shared by multiple sources close to the game's development. 
Here's what Ubisoft has to say about the delay: 
The last the public saw of Skull and Bones in a big way was during a July showcase, which is where we saw extensive gameplay and received the now-delayed November 8 release date. I learned a lot more about the game around the same time when Skull and Bones was Game Informer's cover story. At the time, the team seemed confident in its November release date but given the history of this title, I'm not surprised it's been delayed again. 
Are you excited to play Skull and Bones next March? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

More specifically, this EA Originals title will be released on February 17, 2023. This news comes by way of the game's reveal trailer released today. In it, we see a lot of monster hunting action. The game seems to take place in a mythological land filled with large and dangerous beasts. You'll need to craft better gear to take on tougher monsters, eventually taming the otherwise wild area. 
Check out the reveal trailer below:

Twitter user Laisul shared a recording of what they claimed are lines from an unreleased Joker pack, and they do sound like Hamill’s classic rendition of the Batman villain. Why so serious? Well, announcer packs replace the default MultiVersus announcer with the voice of one of the game’s fighters, so Joker’s addition to the roster seems legit.

In hindsight, it's a bit of an interesting year for Time Capsuling purposes, as we're now getting to the point where games from this era are getting their own remakes and remasters, or fancier, super duper director's cut special editions. We've included the original 2011 release of one of these games in this month's Time Capsule, but there's another notable exception we've decided to save for further down the line. I mean, seriously, would you really recommend vanilla Skyrim from 2011 over 2016's Special Edition?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a definition of "pure" that's proscriptive; a dogmatic adherence to surface details and strict rituals. I'm genuinely not thinking of any specific game, but many 'retro' inspired games fall into this way of thinking, and many more fans cut a good one down because of it.
Itorah, however, feels pure in the sense of capturing the essence, the heart of a good retro platformer, not just going through the motions to technically qualify for an arbitrary category. Aeons ago, it would have ported comfortably to your GameBoys and gramophones, and probably look just as pretty and feel just as good in motion, judging by the talented art direction on show here.

Between the moment Guybrush uttered this iconic line in Return to Monkey Island and our reintroduction to familiar characters like used ship salesman Stan S. Stanman and Cobb, with his "Ask me about Loom" badge, I was already shrouded in a haze of nostalgia. And you would be eating all these up, too, if you're a Monkey Island fan. The thing about Monkey Island enthusiasts is that we can talk your ears off about what makes the series so unique.

The new FTUE addresses that feedback directly. In phase one, players will need to unlock the game's modes and chat functions – this happens "rapidly," Blizzard writes in the blog post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are Pokémon designs like Charizard that make me go, "ooo yes, very nice" and there are others like Voltorb that make me go, "oh, why do you exist?" There's also a rare third class of Pokémon I call "weird lil things" when I see them and Wiglett, a new Pokémon joining the Pokédex in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, is that class' newest member. 
Today, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company released a 3 and a half minute video highlighting Wiglett, its similarities to Diglett, and how it's just different enough that it is an entirely new species, rather than a regional variant. As such, this new Diglett-like Pokémon is called Wiglett. It looks like a worm, lives in the sea and on the beach, and seems to stick together with other Wigletts. Check it out in Serebii's video below: 


I'm most excited to see Wiglett's evolution, if it evolves at all. But hopefully, I'll see that in another trainer's party because I'm not sure Wiglett is a sure bet for mine. 
For more about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, watch the latest trailer that shows off new school rivalries, gym leaders, and more, and then watch this trailer all about competitive play in the 9th generation of Pokémon. After that, read our preview of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet to find out everything you need to know about the Paldea region.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yakuza spin-offs Judgment and Lost Judgment have arrived on Steam! This means you can mete out justice with your fists and do some important detective work... and do some drone racing... and participate in some robot wars. It's Yakuza with a murder-mystery twist that's well worth your while even if you're not actually that big on Kiryu or Ichiban's antics. I'd even go so far as to say it might be the perfect side entrance into the Yakuza series as a whole.

        <id>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-excavation-of-hobs-barrow-review</id>
        <link href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-excavation-of-hobs-barrow-review"/>
        <updated>2022-09-28T04:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's tough making a story where you establish early on that your main character will still be alive at the end. In The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow, a point and click, small town, folk horror adventure game, the events are narrated by the main character Thomasina, writing in the future, and the game walks a slightly different line. Rather than successfully making you believe a character you know survives is in peril, all the way through The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow you are aware that Thomasina in the future is alive but, somehow, definitely not okay. And you believe you can save her anyway.
This looming dread, growing increasingly loom as the game goes on, is one of the most effective weapons in Hob's Barrows' arsenal of horror. Thomasina, a barrow-digger and proto-feminist trouser-wearer in a time when trousers were worn by men, is a practical and mostly cheerful woman. She approaches all the puzzles she has to solve in the robust, roll-your-sleeves up manner of an old-timey governess who doesn't care if you hate learning French verbs. The Thomasina of the future voiceover, however, sounds blank, drained and sad. It's a contrast that weighs more and more heavy as you slice into the horrible heart of Hob's Barrow, and it underscores how great it is to play the game in its fully voiced form.
As well as the voice acting, Hob's Barrow has an appropriately creepsome soundtrack, making fabulous use of the juddering bass tones that put all humans and related monkeys automatically on edge, and isn't a stranger to unsettling lighting. Evil in this game is a sick purple. Most of all, some praise should be especially given to the several horrible close-ups that pop up: Thomasina's eyes, wide in shock, a malevolent cat as he crawls onto your bed; round eyes over a slack, downturned mouth with little peg teeth in it. Devs Cloak And Dagger Games can coax extraordinary depth and motion from their pixel-art and then use that to repulse you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had hoped to bring you a proper review of Moonscars today, the new 2D Soulslike from indie studio Black Mermaid. But alas, both time and its ferociously difficult combat have got the better of me, so you'll have to settle for some impressions instead. This isn’t simply a case of drinking the 'git gud' kool-aid either. While I'll hold my hands up now and say that Soulslikes have always been a bit of a challenge for me, I feel like I've been making some pretty good in-roads into the genre lately, and after falling in love with Moonscars' reveal trailer earlier in the year during the Humble Games Showcase, I really, really, really wanted to like this one. Sadly, it's become increasingly clear that Moonscars does not like me very much, and maybe even hates my guts a bit - which is ironic, considering how many organs I've chucked at its feet over the last week and a bit to appease its hungry dread moon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s nothing inherently wrong with the AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT's concept – faster clock speeds than the RX 6600 XT, to better compete with Nvidia’s RTX cards? Yeah why not – but surely its timing is questionable. Any GPU launching several months into 2022 would only ever do so under the looming shadows of Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 40 series and the AMD Radeon RX 7000 series, the latter being officially revealed in just a few days’ time. Not to mention Intel Arc Alchemist, delayed as it has been.


Still. AMD’s next-gen, RDNA 3-based GPUs are an unknown quantity, and the RTX 40 series will at first focus on high-end models like the RTX 4090. Even if its RDNA 2 architecture is on the way out, could the RX 6650 XT not find room in the pack as one of the best graphics cards for 1080p and 1440p?

Now imagine that surface is constantly under threat from waves of alien attacks and that's pretty much Dome Keeper in a nutshell, a moreish, meditative mining game that sees you balance digging for resources and hunting for all-important relics while defending your eponymous dome from being smashed to smithereens.

The first was the Steam Deck Zone filled with thirty of Valve’s handhelds full of games for anyone to pull up a chair and play. The second was a showcase of weird and wonderful controllers including an incredibly inconvenient pool table, a digital plant that would grow by controlling light, and a game where you use a keyboard as a tie. 
Alongside those, the RPS gang were exploring the show floor and here you’ll find highlights of what we saw, who we chatted to, what we played, and just general show shenanigans. Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During our recent interview with Overwatch's Vice President, Jon Spector, we asked the executive a few additional questions about developing sustainable revenue streams for free-to-play games. Titles like Fortnite and Warzone have popularized collaborations with major brands like Dragon Ball Super, Attack On Titan, and Snoop Dogg, so I was curious if the Overwatch team would consider it. 
"We've seen some really fun examples out there of games working with other brands or other games," Spector says. "I'm a big anime nerd myself. I think it's super cool when I see Naruto appear in Fortnite. I don't even play Fortnite, but that's awesome.

The story wasn't complete and the garden was rather basic, but one encounter with the wolf spider proved that this was far more than a pile of mulch. With two years of updates layering new enemies, items, biomes, dungeons, and quests onto that healthy foundation, Grounded has blossomed into a perennial survival game that sits comfortably among the very best of the genre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back, I was wondering where all the Steam Deck accessories were. Valve themselves have the case covered, including a decent hard case with even the cheapest 64GB models, and it’s not difficult to pick up one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck. Otherwise, and especially with delays to Valve’s official dock, there’s not much out there from the usual PC hardware suppliers.
I therefore turned to the makers and sellers of Etsy, where a kind of indie Steam Deck accessory market has emerged. Soon, I’d bought (with my own money, you’re welcome ReedPop) a selection of unique, handcrafted, sometimes questionable gadgets and appendages, and promptly packed them onto a train for independent appraisal by a newly minted Steam Deck owner. Specifically, RPS vid bud Liam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At long last, HBO has released the first trailer for The Last of Us. Though officially classified as a “teaser,” it offers nearly two minutes of clips that provide pretty good looks at the upcoming adaptation. 
The teaser doesn’t reveal a premiere date, but we get to see how Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) survive the post-apocalyptic world, scenes of humanity's collapse a la the game's prologue, and a quick glimpse of a Clicker. 


The Last of Us is led by Craig Mazin of Chernobyl fame and Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann. We learned during Summer Game Fest that Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who portray Joel and Ellie in the games, will have unspecified roles in the series. The Last of Us will be available to stream exclusively on HBO Max in 2023.
To help prepare fans for what's to come, Naughty Dog recently released a remake of the first game dubbed The Last of Us Part 1. You can read editor Blake Hester's impressions of that title here.]]></summary>

E3 2023 takes place at the Los Angeles Convention Center from Tuesday, June 13 through Friday, June 16. Digital presentations, such as the annual press conferences held by first and third-party publishers, take place a couple of days before, beginning June 11. 
The ESA also states that the show will feature separate admission days for industry professionals and the general public. E3 Business Days, designated for developers, publishers, and press/media, take place on June 13-15. Media registration opens in December. 
June 15-16 will host E3 Gamer Days, where fans will be admitted to the show floor. There is no date for public registration at this time. Since E3 first opened its doors to fans in 2017, professionals and the public have largely intermingled for the entirety of the show, which has caused issues in terms of crowd traffic. E3 adopting the same dividing format as events such as Tokyo Game Show should alleviate that problem.   
As previously announced, PAX/New York Comic-Con organizer ReedPop will helm E3 2023. The company has promised to make E3 into a "world class event to serve the global gaming industry." The last E3 to take place in-person at the LA Convention Center was in 2019. The 2020 show was canceled due to the pandemic, and the 2021 version was a digital-only show.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill: The Short Message has been rated by South Korea's Game Rating committee, and it's possible this is a new unannounced Silent Hill game. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reported that the rating committee rated Silent Hill: The Short Message today. However, the rating did not include any platforms, so it's unclear where this game might land if it actually ends up being a real title. In fact, the rating features little else other than listing Uniana as its publisher. As VGC notes, this company regularly publishes Konami games in South Korea. 
The publication also notes that Silent Hill: The Short Message might be related to one of various Silent Hill projects reportedly in the works at multiple different studios. VGC reported in February that Konami is planning a revival of the Silent Hill series amidst other reports stating that a Silent Hill 2 remake is in development. 
While waiting to hopefully learn more about Silent Hill: The Short Message, read about Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama's new game, Slitterhead.

Taki-san's performance as character Kyohei Hamura was removed from the Japanese version of Judgment after he was arrested for possession and use of cocaine in 2019, never making it to the West. Now, the Judgment Pierre Taki Restoration Patch finally brings the scrubbed actor back for the very first time, over here at least.

Following the success of Marvel's Spider-Man in 2018 by Insomniac Games, the team later announced Marvel's Spider-Man 2, due out sometime next year. Insomniac is also working on a Wolverine game. Elsewhere, Motive Studio just announced last week that it's working on a single-player Iron Man game and before that, Marvel pulled back the curtains on Amy Hennig's new game that features Black Panther and Captain America. There's also Crystal Dynamic's Marvel's Avengers, which is still getting content today, and last year's excellent Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy.

Originally set to release this year, Oxenfree II will now debut sometime in 2023. The team didn't mention a specific window, however, so as for when in 2023, that remains unknown. It could be just a month or two into the new year or six months into the new year – only time will tell. As for why, Night School Studio says it needs more time to make this sequel "truly special" and to add more localizations. 
Here's the studio's full statement on the delay:

Not since Untitled Goose Game have I heard this much excited chat about a game from pals who don't usually talk about games. This is because: 1) it's a fun silly idea; 2) it's very funny to miss a trombone note and squeal out a farty toot in the middle of Also Sprach Zarathustra. As I play Trombone Champ myself, I come to really appreciate that. It's a rare rhythm game where playing badly doesn't frustrate or berate me, because the worst-case scenario is making fart noises, and fart noises are funny.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

Journalist Matthew Keys tweeted that a source has told him that the teenager’s detainment was related to the Rockstar hack and another involving Uber.

The animated film, starring Chris Pratt as the titular plumber, will hit theaters on April 7, 2023. The biggest question regarding the film has been what Pratt’s Mario performance will sound like, and we may finally get to hear it in just a few weeks. The movie’s first teaser trailer premieres on October 6 at 4 p.m. ET during the New York Comic Con.

The Super Mario Bros. cast includes Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, and Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong. The film was delayed to ensure quality, though Nintendo was reportedly pleased last year with how the film was shaping up at that point. Pratt recently described his performance as “unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world,” and it apparently won't have an Italian accent.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RPS-beloved turn-based strategy game Solium Infernum is back from the dead. Announced earlier today on stage at EGX London 2022, Armello creators League Of Geeks will be resurrecting and reimagining the game in 2023. Originally released in 2009 by solo dev Vic Davis and his studio Cryptic Comet, Solium Infernum cast you as an Archfiend hoping to stake a claim for Satan's empty throne. With a strong emphasis on political intrigue and Machiavellian backstabbing over taking things by force, this strategy game from hell was a firm RPS favourite back in the day, spawning an eight-part diary series of the team's play-by-email multiplayer adventures. Alas, it never quite found the audience it deserved back in the early 2010s, eventually causing Davis to shut up shop completely in 2015 and pursue a career in tabletop.
League Of Geeks are here to change that, though, and after speaking with studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters (both at EGX earlier today and during a hands-off presentation of their pre-alpha demo late last week), it's clear the team have taken great care in bringing Solium Infernum up to date for modern audiences. It leans into all the same kinds of mind games as Cryptic Comet's original, and its simultaneous turn structure is still very much intact – just with lusher 3D visuals, and all-new, revamped menu screens. And it looks devilishly good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing Wayward Strand feels like navigating a detailed clockwork mechanism. It reminds me of those cuckoo clocks where on the hour every hour a tiny door opens revealing two mechanical dolls that come together and have a 'lil smooch. That’s essentially how Wayward Strand works but on a bigger scale. Characters are set on strict routines, following predetermined paths and schedules that are often invisible to you. They welcome an interruption - a friendly natter or helpful hand - but whether you’re there or not, they’ll go about their business regardless. The world keeps on spinning and all that.
It’s an interesting way of capturing the passage of time, and in Wayward Strand how you choose to spend that time is pretty important in a game that makes a point of not waiting for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Apple TV show Ted Lasso has proven to be one of the most popular and well-liked series of the last few years, introducing viewers to a lovable cast of characters whose lives and storylines largely revolve around the fictional English Premier League football club, AFC Richmond. Through its first two seasons, the series has taken home numerous awards, including the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2021 and 2022, with several of its actors – including Jason Sudeikis, Brett Goldstein, and Hannah Waddingham – taking home awards for original performances. Now, Ted Lasso reaches into a new realm: video games. 
EA Sports today announced that Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond are joining the FIFA 23 roster of teams. Lasso is joined on the sidelines by Coach Beard, with the pitch being populated by some of the team's biggest stars like Jamie Tartt, Roy Kent, Dani Rojas, Sam Obisanya, and Isaac McAdoo. While the actors' likenesses are included in the product, EA Sports hasn't indicated if we'll be hearing Jamie Tartt and Roy Kent's signature crowd chants (though it seems doubtful, seeing as how Roy Kent's chant would probably bump the ESRB rating up to M for Mature).
Regardless of that fact, you can play matches at AFC Richmond's home ground, Nelson Road, and even take control of Coach Lasso or AFC Richmond through Career Mode. AFC Richmond is also playable in Kick-Off, Online Friendlies, and Online Seasons. FIFA 23 Ultimate Team is also adding several AFC Richmond customization items, including kits, TIFOs, and the option to select Ted Lasso or Coach Beard as your FUT club's manager. All the AFC Richmond content in FUT will be obtainable through objectives and challenges.
You can see Ted Lasso and the AFC Richmond squad in action through the trailer below.


FIFA 23 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4. Xbox One, PC, and Stadia on September 30.]]></summary>

When Gun Interactive revealed The Texas Chain Saw Massacre last year, I was underwhelmed by its short teaser but excited about its potential. It’s one of my favorite horror movie franchises, partly because of how much it still scares me – every good haunted house has a Leatherface at the end that chases you out to the exit, right? – but also because of its backdrop: Texas. Horror, be it movies or games, typically draws attention to dreary atmospheres, spooky ambiance, perhaps some bad weather, and nighttime. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre bucked that trend in the 1970s.

Whether you're talking about the two well-received films, the fun Sonic Boom animated series, or the long-running and beloved comic series, people who enjoy the Sonic the Hedgehog video games have had plenty of other avenues to expand their fandom. The next project to land on that list is Sonic Prime, the upcoming Netflix series that gives us all-new adventures with Sonic and his friends/enemies.
Today, Netflix and Sega released a teaser trailer giving us a taste of the action. It doesn't show much, but if the 40 seconds of action are any indication, it's bringing plenty of style and fun (as well as several classic characters). You can check out the trailer in the header above.
Sonic Prime is set to release exclusively on Netflix this winter. For more on what else Sonic is getting up to this winter, check out our exclusive coverage hub of Sonic Frontiers here. For our thoughts on the latest Sonic video game release, Sonic Origins, head here.]]></summary>

Through the video, the publisher reveals the full fighter roster at launch, featuring a good mix of fresh faces and familiar foes.
The launch lineup of fighters includes 18 characters to choose from. You can see the full list below.
Blanka
Cammy
Chun-Li
Dee Jay
Dhalsim
E. Honda
Guile
Jamie
JP
Juri
Ken
Kimberly
Lily
Luke
Manon
Marisa
Ryu
Zangief


Many of these fighters made their first appearances in Street Fighter (Ken and Ryu) or Street Fighter II (Blanka, Cammy, Chun-Li, Dee Jay, Dhalsim, E. Honda, Guile, Zangief). However, some fresher faces include Juri (debuted in Street Fighter IV) and Luke (debuted in Street Fighter V), and six all-new characters: Jamie, JP, Kimberly, Lily, Manon, and Marisa.

Although Capcom just pulled the curtain back on the next batch of fighters to join the roster, my demo included the first playable sessions for the last trio of reveals: Guile, Juri, and newcomer Kimberly. Since Kimberly was the wildcard of that bunch, I opted to spend most of my hands-on time discovering what she brings to the table.

The Pokémon franchise has been more prolific than usual as of late, with multiple releases over the past year and another big entry coming soon. However, those without a Switch or looking for a suitable monster-battling alternative should focus on Temtem, which has emerged from years of early-access development. While borrowing heavily from the formula of Nintendo’s massive franchise, its world is fun to explore, and collecting and learning all about the titular Temtems is satisfying.

Given the latter game’s events and the tantalizing trailer for its second part, Rebirth, it had me thinking that it may be a good time to dust off my copy of 2008’s Crisis Core. Square Enix read my mind by announcing a remaster of Zack Fair’s PSP adventure, christening it with the subtitle “Reunion,” giving newcomers the answer to the question of “who the heck was that black-haired fella in Remake?” As for me, I thought I had a good reason to return to the game. After playing a decent chunk of Reunion at Tokyo Game Show, I’m all good. 
My expectations were always reasonable. Reunion is a remaster, not a remake the scale of, well, Remake. That means that feature-wise, the best way to sum it up is “That PSP game? You can pl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me fill you in on a little secret most people won't tell you: the real way to enjoy a video game show is at home, comfortably on your couch, watching the event on YouTube. 
Over the years, the game press has done a remarkable job tricking you into thinking otherwise. The shows look extravagant, energetic, and almost like we're getting glimpses into the future, which we then curate into bite-sized news stories and on-demand trailers for our faithful readers back home. 
The reality is much more depressing.
Whether it's E3, PAX, Gamescom, or in this case, Tokyo Game Show, going to a video game trade event means dealing with the near-lethal combination of jetlag and overwork. The brutal FOMO of being in some of the coolest cities in the world but spending all your time in convention halls. The unbelievable cacophony of thousands of people talking at once. The unbelievable smells of thousands of people all standing too close to each other. The never-ending lines of thousands of people all needing to use the toilet at the same time. This doesn't even touch on the unavoidable safety concerns of having a video game conference in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. But I digress.
All that said, there's some fun stuff to look at, like big, gaudy statues and giant booths that likely cost tens of thousands of dollars for games you've never heard of and likely will never play. Stuff that really makes it all worth it. 
While we'd love to fly each and every one of you out to Tokyo, sadly, we only had the budget to fly out two of our full-time employees. So in lieu of attending yourself, please enjoy my curated batch of pictures of what I saw on the show floor. 
Well, there you have it, folks. All the fun of TGS without actually being there. See you next year!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Konami has revealed Suikoden I & II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, a remaster of the first two classic Suikoden JRPGs, and the two will be released as a single package sometime next year on consoles and PC. 
More specifically, these two remasters will be packaged into the same collection and this remastered duo is due out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) in 2023. The first Suikoden was released in 1995, and its sequel, Suikoden II, was released in 1998. Check out what the remastered versions of these classic games look like in the announcement trailer below: 


As you can see, these remasters are looking excellent, especially in the way that the original look and feel of the sprite imagery remains intact. Here's hoping they feel as great to play as they did back in the day. 
Here are some highlights of this remastered collection from the game's Steam page:

During today's Call of Duty: Next livestream, Activision revealed a ton of new information surrounding the next phase of Call of Duty, which kicks off this fall. It begins on October 28 with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, the next mainline entry in the franchise, but perhaps culminates on November 16, when Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 lanches free for everyone. Today brought us a look at what to expect when those experiences arrive later this year, as well as a glimpse at a mobile version of Warzone coming next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has revealed four more fighters joining the Street Fighter 6 roster alongside new details about the upcoming fighting game’s World Tour, Battle Hub, and more. 
All of this Street Fighter 6 news came during Tokyo Games Show, which officially began today, and if you’re a fan of Capcom’s long-running fighting game series, strap in because there’s a lot.


Let’s start with the fighters. 
Joining the Street Fighter 6 roster of fighters is Ken Masters, the former US National Fighting Champion and ex-VP of the Masters Foundation, Blanka, a kindhearted defender of nature and adventure tour guide, Dhalsim, a monk and yoga master, and E. Honda, a global sumo wrestler phenomenon.

        <id>119216</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/09/15/saturnalia-an-indie-horror-with-an-art-style-you-have-to-see-captures-october-release"/>
        <updated>2022-09-15T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia is an upcoming survival horror game with an extremely unique art style announced last month. Now, we know when we can play it because Saturnalia has captured an October 27 release date. 
That's when it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, the team behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia, Saturnalia is shaping up to be a great time. You can find out why in the New Gameplay Today segment we recorded that's all about Saturnalia, featuring more than 15 minutes of gameplay, below: 


"[Saturnalia] is a kaleidoscopic adventure inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian folklore and classic Italian Giallo horror films," a press release reads. "The story involves a mysterious, centuries-old ritual that occurs every year on the night of the winter solstice in the Italian village of Gravoi. Each of the game's four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom."
Here are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: 
Seek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.
Explore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.
Flight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.
Immerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.
Control your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.


Saturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27.
