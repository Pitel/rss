Because some VPN providers use residential IP addresses to circumvent such restrictions, GeoComply is now blocking these as well. The company bills it as a revolutionary technology, but there might be a major downside too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Merrie Melodies
Yesterday, Warner Bros Games launched the open beta for its incoming platform fighter MultiVersus, allowing players on both PC and console platforms to step into the ring with its crossover cast of pop culture characters — Already, the beta has seen incredible success, becoming the fourth most popular title on just the Steam platform alone.
The PC dashboard logged an incredible 144,000 players at its peak yesterday, surpassing launch day numbers for any other fighting game on the platform — including Street Fighter, Tekken, and Mortal Kombat. It should be noted, of course, that MultiVersus is a free-to-play title, but that's still a staggering amount of players. When you add in players on Xbox and PlayStation, we could easily be looking at the most popular fighting game beta of all time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAydKj4j0IA
Of course, these numbers lead to some particularly sweaty servers, and some players found themselves struggling to log in during Tuesday's peak activity period. A fighting game lives and dies on the longevity of its community, so while these numbers are unlikely to be retained, MultiVersus will be looking to hook in enough regulars to keep the fists and fur flying over the coming weeks, months, and perhaps years — though Player First Games' implementation of crossplay will certainly aid this goal.
If you want to check out the slapstick silliness for yourself, then the MultiVersus beta is available on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms right now. All you need do is download the game client on your platform of choice, sign in with a WB Games account, and you're ready to rock. The "full" version of MultiVersus will launch later in 2022.

There's been quite a commotion in the Nier fandom the last few days. Following several video posts from one player, other Nier: Automata players are now on the hunt for a secret church area.
The discovery lit up this week, but actually started a while ago. Reddit user u/sadfutago posted to the Nier subreddit two months ago, asking how to "open the church" in Nier: Automata. And in follow-up posts, sadfutago asked more, providing more details and images. And then, what really blew up, was the video of it.
This might seem banal, but the thing is, this church is not a known area. No one playing Nier: Automata knew what sadfutago was talking about. This door just seemed to appear for this player, during the A2 section of the game, and led to quite a st…]]></summary>

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is out this Friday, and already it's quite a swell behind it. Monolith Soft's latest is obviously of high interest to RPG fans, but we're curious to see who else might finally try the series.
This third Xenoblade Chronicles game is the latest Switch game for Monolith, a company that both crafts Xeno- games and supports other projects at Nintendo. The first Xenoblade Chronicles was a big hit for the studio, bringing a massive open-world RPG to the Nintendo Wii. Its follow-up, though, proved a little more divisive. And spin-off entry Xenoblade Chronicles X is still landlocked on the Wii U.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake, teased initially with a brief trailer back in 2021, is reportedly on indefinite development hold. That’s the news as reported by Bloomberg earlier today, which cited unnamed sources close to its development, relaying that the project has been paused.
The problems reportedly stem from major staff departures at developer, Aspyr Media. Specifically, both the art director and the design director were unexpectedly let go from the company. A recent vertical slice demo of the game was well received by license holders. However, later messaging to the rest of the development team suggested that the project wasn’t where studio leadership wanted it to be.
Developers at Aspyr are reportedly now stating that 2025 would be a realistic time frame to expect the project to release. 
Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic holds a special place in video game history. The original 2003 game was a significant milestone in successful and original video game storytelling in the Star Wars franchise and featured a memorable twist regarding a main character’s identity. The game also helped popularize some of the choice-driven and moral decision-making that became so popular in later games like Mass Effect.
The remake is highly anticipated by longtime fans, but its future now appears murky.

Now that Xenoblade Chronicles 3 reviews are out in the wild, I've seen all sorts of playthrough lengths flying around. So exactly how long is Xenoblade Chronicles 3? Let's dig in!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwG04ZdXCOo
The Xenoblade Chronicles 3 core story (and nothing else) is roughly 60 hours
Note: that's a rough estimate, and read the below provisos!
JRPG game length is a hot-button issue, and I came prepared. So for this review, I actually used a timer to keep track of when I deviated from the main storyline. My first clear took around 85 hours or so, and taking away side content and some exploration, I ended up with a 60-hour estimate if you just go for the main story (this is when the credits rolled for me).

The twist is that there's no money fuelling your construction. Instead, your city flourishes or not based on your ability to fulfil each building's resource requirements, which quickly turns progress into more of a puzzle than a management game.

Porn has been illegal in China since 1997, but the gray regulatory status of Steam has allowed Wallpaper Engine users to share uncensored content.

The Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic could be on an indefinite delay, according to a new investigation. Bloomberg reports that Aspyr Media's KOTOR remake is on hold, after hitting some development troubles.
The remake was announced last year, during the PlayStation Showcase 2021. It's in development at Aspyr Media, an Austin-based studio that has built up a portfolio of ports, especially in the Star Wars franchise.
Bloomberg reports that Aspyr has fired the KOTOR remake's art director and design director this month. Following a series of meetings, sources tell Bloomberg that the project is on pause. Aspyr is reportedly looking for new contracts and development opportunities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL-RfE-ioJ8
This comes after a demo was reportedly finalized at the end of June, showing off a slice of the Knights of the Old Republic remake. Studio heads told staff the slice wasn't where they wanted it to be.
Bloomberg's sources point to two issues, via sources familiar with the matter. One is that the project may not have been sustainable on its current course, given the amount of time and money invested in the demo. The other is the timeline. While Aspyr may have been targeting the end of 2022, according to Bloomberg's sources, a more realistic target would be 2025.
A galaxy far, far away
This news is disheartening for those hoping to see some KOTOR sooner rather than later. Saber Interactive, another studio under the Embracer umbrella, joined on the project earlier this year to assist development. Aspyr announced its intent to acquire Beamdog, which has some RPG talent in tow, in April. The Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake is still officially planned as a timed exclusive for PlayStation 5 and PC.
Neither Aspyr Media nor Embracer Group immediately responded to Bloomberg.

Whether you're up to no good in Red Dead Redemption 2 or stealing from the rich to (sort of) give to the poor in the original Desperados, these temples of cash have long been the scenes of messy shootouts, upturned tables, and big, golden pay-outs. At least when your heist strategy's going according to plan, that is. In an exclusive demo for one of the later levels in Hard West 2, the upcoming sequel to the 2015 turn-based tactics original, Ice Code Games' chief technology officer Mateusz Pilski is starting to feel the heat a bit. The bank is well guarded, with at least half a dozen gunslingers staking out the doors at the front, and untold numbers waiting in hidden nooks and crannies further back. He takes a moment to consider his approach, but he begins his assault with confidence.  
"In any XCOM-like, when you see that many enemies and that much firepower, in that good a position, you think, okay, I'm fucked up," he tells me. "In just a second, I will show you how you can use Bravado to totally overturn the situation."

Everyone's favorite yellow friend from under the sea is back on the gaming scene yet again, and this time he's collaborating with Minecraft. He's a square, everything in Minecraft is a square — it just makes sense. Starting today, players can download the SpongeBob SquarePants DLC (as long as they have the latest version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition installed), and then they're off on their adventures to explore Bikini Bottom like they never have before. The DLC was created in conjunction with Minecraft creators Spark Universe, and this has to be one of the biggest DLC packs I've seen for the game.
It comes with over forty skins, a huge map with locations all over Bikini Bottom, minigames, collectibles, and more. Of course, you'll get to visit classic locations like SpongeBob's house, the Krusty Krab, and the Chum Bucket, but the DLC even includes more obscure locations from the show like the Barg'N-Mart, Glove World, and Goo Lagoon. Whether you're frolicking through Jellyfish Fields, defending the Krusty Krab from hungry anchovies, or racing at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, you're likely to have the best day ever. Players can also get a free Character Creator item from now until September 16.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9914FnO95J8
Based on the sheer amount of content we saw in the trailer alone, this looks like one of the most substantial DLCs for Minecraft I've ever seen. The level of detail in portraying the show's famous episodes is something to behold, and you just know that the creators are really big fans themselves.
Honestly, it looks like this DLC pack is basically a whole new game in its own right, and could keep you busy for a few dozen hours at least if you do everything. I haven't played Minecraft in a good while, but as someone who grew up with SpongeBob, this release has me thinking I might want to crack open the old account again, for nostalgia's sake.

[Update: Fangamer added Hades merch to its online store today, including pins, posters, and prints. The adorable Cerberus and Dusa plushes are $32 each, while the three-print Tartarus, Asphodel, and Elysium set is a whopping $179.]
Supergiant's fantastic action-RPG Hades is custom designed for merchandise, thanks to its attractive visuals, cool aesthetic style, strong colors, and varied cast of memorable characters. Bafflingly, however, Hades gear has been incredibly hard to come by, with nary an art book or pair of Zubaz pants in sight.
Enter merch-makers Fangamer, who has finally decided, two years after release, to bless fans of Zagreus and his Hades brethren with a fun line of items styled after the game's underworld denizens. While the full line is yet to be revealed, a teaser image appears to include long and short-sleeved shirts, art prints, and a badge set featuring Nyx, Thanatos, Megaera, and, of course, Zagreus himself. No Artemis or Tis, but it's fine.
https://twitter.com/Fangamer/status/1549439138587222016?s=20&t=GrFE6W8m9nXAia2XjKzXrg
Perhaps best of all, the image features plush dolls of two of The House of Hades' most important employees: three-headed, bone-munching Good Boy Cerberus, and the lovely, hardworking, and ever-fangirling housemaid, Dusa. Better still, the Dusa plush talks! Yes, I will be purchasing both of them.
Hopefully, the full range will include further shirt designs and/or other cool gubbins, but I'm still stunned by the possibility that Hades is yet to receive a lavish, hardcover art book — which seems an absolute given for such a striking-looking release. Regardless, the fun-looking Hades range is set to launch on the Fangamer site on Tuesday, July 26.
For my wallet, There is No Escape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Meta gets a little more expensive
The price of the Meta Quest 2 is going up next month. Today, the VR company announced the Meta Quest 2 virtual reality headset will get a price bump in August, tacking another $100 onto the price tag.
This will bring the Meta Quest 2 up to $399.99 for the 128 GB version, and the 256 GB version up to $499.99. Refurbished units and Meta Quest 2 accessories will also see a price increase.
Meta, a.k.a. Facebook, bought Oculus in 2014 and shifted the naming convention away from Oculus and under Meta in 2021. In today's statement on the pricing change, the company acknowledges VR's momentum, but also cites the cost of production as a concern.
"At the same time, the costs to make and ship our products have been on the rise. By adjusting the price of Quest 2, we can continue to grow our investment in groundbreaking research and new product development that pushes the VR industry to new heights."

Those who pick up a Meta Quest 2 headset between August 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022 will get a freebie. A copy of Beat Saber will be free to download for 14 days, after they've activated the headset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTIizcuSdHg
The cost of virtual reality
This is surprising on a few levels. First, the Quest 2 has been available since 2020. A price hike without a hardware refresh is strange, to say the least.
But the Oculus Quest 2, or Meta Quest 2, has been the affordable entry point to virtual reality. Its ability to run wireless or hooked up to a computer is a huge boon. And the price point made it a no-brainer for those looking to get into the technology.
It certainly ratchets up the potential appeal of other headsets. For those who already managed to grab a PlayStation 5, the PS VR2 is slowly but surely leading up to its eventual launch.

Just yesterday, we reported on Storm Collectibles' upcoming premium figure of Guilty Gear badguy... erm... Sol Badguy. But what if you aren't all about Sol, what if you're all about the mischievous but thoroughly loveable Jack-O Valentine? Well, fret not, as Apex Toys has also announced that the Halloween lovin' gal is getting her own figure at some point in the near future.
As revealed during WonFest 2022, (and reported by Siliconera), the new Jack-O figure is scaled at 1/9, which translates to roughly eight-to-nine inches in height... or at least she would, if she were standing upright. Y'see, Apex Toys has teased the new figure with a suspiciously familiar silhouette, suggesting that our girl will be sporting her back-breaking, censor-worrying, meme-creating, crouch pose — the very same pose that took the internet by storm last year in the form of the "Jack-O Challenge."

Apex Toys did not release any other info in regards to the new Jack-O pose figure, so we don't know the release window, price, or pre-order dates. But given that we don't even get to see an unpainted prototype, or even any new concept art, we are probably still a long way out from having to explain to our friends and relatives why the centerpiece of our lounge is a young woman in a bodysuit and a Halloween mask is essentially... well... "presenting."
It's a crouch pose, mom. You wouldn't understand.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC. Jack-O Valentine is available as DLC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTX 2060 is the most affordable RTX graphics card, making it your best shout for gaining the hardware to do real-time ray tracing and frame-rate-boosting DLSS without overpaying. This model debuted at £330, got more expensive over time as the worst of the GPU supply shortage hit, and was impossible to find below RRP even after its next-generation successor, the RTX 3060 launched two years later. 
Now the RTX 2060 has finally dipped in price, making it an ideal time to pick up what is still a powerful and feature-complete graphics card for 1080p or even 1440p gaming. You can pick up a compact EVGA RTX 2060 SC model for just £212 on Amazon right now, a 52% drop from its peak price and a fair deal for the level of performance on offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new update is free for Hitman 3 owners
Hitman 3 just got some new content today, in the form of a new map and more. Ambrose Island is a new locale that's free for any owner of Hitman 3.
The update rolls out for anyone today, so long as they own a copy of Hitman 3 on their platform of choice. That does include Game Pass subscription owners, according to IO Interactive's announcement. The only exception is the Hitman 3 Free Starter Pack, which does not get access to Ambrose Island.
The patch rolled out at 9 a.m. ET this morning, on July 26, and is included in the patch. No need to download anything extra from the store.
As for what Agent 47 is getting up to in these tropical islands? Well, the opening cinematic released today can give you a clue. A former associate of Mr. Grey's needs taking care of, and that will have to include dealing with a local pirate syndicate and disrupting a satellite connection along the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LWgJNXIOuw
With the update, there are also some new tools and challenges. A special wetsuit and massive machete are among the rewards. There's also a gas grenade with a poisonous frog trapped inside. And heck, even a fishing hook. Plus, new starting locations, stashes, and more await.
The future of Hitman
While this brings a new locale and likely plenty of mayhem to Hitman 3, there's also more in store. IO Interactive has also been refreshing old content as well, adding new challenges and unlockable items.
Plus, the evolving Freelancer mode is planned for somewhere further off in the future. It seems like the World of Assassination is not quite done with Hitman and Agent 47 yet. There will always be targets in need of taking down, bodies in need of a hiding place, and a runway to walk as notorious fashion icon Helmut Kruger.
The Ambrose Island location is live now for Hitman 3 owners.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spread the Bad Word
As part of the continued fight against the tidal wave of online toxicity, Twitch has implemented a new tool that it hopes will help streamers to collaborate against regular and/or returning toxic viewers, offensive commenters, and stream-ruining raiders.
As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, the new "Shared Ban Info" feature will allow Twitch streamers with Partner and Affiliate status, as well as those who share a mutual follow status, to share with one another their ban information, allowing other streamers to make a note of the names of previously blocked Twitch users — lest they come crawling into your own stream. This system hopes to give the wider community a "heads up" of sorts on some of the usernames that frequently find themselves blocked from channels.
The Shared Ban Info feature is the latest release in Twitch's increasing efforts to clamp down on toxic behavior, derogatory language, hate raids, and personal attacks logged against its huge streamer base. The service recently improved its notification system to signify to banned users exactly why they were banned, while its new Twitch Ban Evasion Tool was instilled in an effort to prevent banned users from returning under new guises.
Online toxicity remains one of gaming's biggest and most enduring problems. From headset chatter during online play, to the comment sections of websites, Twitch streams, YouTube videos, and social media accounts, the spreading of hateful, racist, and homophobic language have been emboldened by the general anonymity of the internet, as well as an overall lack of real consequence from the platforms that host the abuse.
It is a concern that is likely to continue as long as humans are able to interact with humans in a non-face-to-face capacity. Hopefully, technology will continue to adopt new methods to mitigate the problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D is Team Red's fastest gaming processor in many titles, yet it costs far less than the slightly older 5950X and only a bit more than the 5900X. Reason being? You get fewer cores than those processors, and slower clock speeds, but dramatically increased cache - a trade-off that often provides a massive performance improvement for gaming. 
The 5800X3D was extremely hard to find at launch, with AMD's limited inventory being claimed as soon as the first reviews rolled in, but now we're starting to see better availability - and today, the first proper discounts. You can pick up the 5800X3D for £384 from CCL, thanks to a £15 off discount code: AFF15.

Another Fallout 76 update is out today, and it intends to "address bugs, including issues that have been reported by the community."
Some of the big parts of the July 26, 2022 update include:
Reduced energy weapon durability
Meat Week reward fixes
Fixing the Grahm NPC (making it so he doesn't wander off and bug a quest)
This game has slowly become an anomaly. So many other studios would have completely given up on it: and a lot of the changes are fantastic. But it always comes with the baggage of "what if the game had more time in the oven to begin with?" It's something that I hope Bethesda is reflecting on in the years to come, as it continues to salvage the reputation of Fallout 76, and its legacy as a whole.
The team also reminds us that currently, you can partake in Pitt expeditions in the public test server (PTS), which is still hosting an early version of the upcoming major Fallout 76 update. As a reminder, the PTS has fully moved to Steam now, and the prior Bethesda Launcher access program is now completely dead. Two missions are available for Pitt expeditions, and the Pitt-themed pennant is still available as a bonus for PTS participants. As usual, all of the current PTS patch notes are kept separately on this page here.
Update Version 1.6.4.78
PC (Steam): 3.0 GB
PC (Microsoft Store): 8.1 GB
PlayStation: 7.6 GB
Xbox: 10.7 GB

Nintendo has a new Xenoblade Chronicles 3 prize pack up for grabs, and you just need to head to this page and click a few buttons. After that Nintendo will pick some winners on September 15 at 2AM ET, and send them out.
Here's what the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 prize pack from Nintendo includes:
An HD metal sublimation print (wall art of the core cast members)
A sidekick sling bag (a bag that can hold a tablet and includes the game logo)
Two water bottles (vacuum insulated with art featuring Riku and Manana)
Postcards (six cards with one from each main character)
To enter it's technically part of the My Nintendo system, so you'll need 10 Platinum Points per entry, up to a max of three entries. I just...want to buy all this stuff on its own!
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skull and Bones was first revealed in 2017. As a major fan of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, I was thrilled to see Ubisoft dive back into piracy, this time with a new IP. At that point, Skull and Bones was a 5v5 multiplayer arena battler where you played solely as the ship. It wasn't exactly the Black Flag follow-up many, including myself, had anticipated, but with Ubisoft Singapore, the studio behind the Assassin's Creed franchise's excellent naval combat, at the helm, I wanted to see more. 
After another look at it in 2018, Skull and Bones went dark, and Ubisoft remained mostly silent on the title for years. Then, this month, the publisher announced that it would be re-revealing Skull and Bones on July 7. That return brought with it a brand new look at gameplay and new details about ho…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Noclip does it again
Here at Destructoid, we've covered the Bloodborne PSX demake fan project pretty comprehensively — mostly because it rules. The scope of the demake is insane, and now we have a full 40-minute documentary on how it was made thanks to the YouTube Channel Noclip.
The Noclip team actually had the chance to meet and speak with Lilith Walther, the creator of the Bloodborne demake. Walther was inspired by Photoshop mockups/renders of God of War 3, Uncharted 2, and BioShock demakes, and created a prototype of Bloodborne PSX in three weeks in 2017.
It goes through Walther's entire history of game development (and how they were spurred on by the complicated circuitry systems of LittleBigPlanet 2), through the origins of the demake itself. They talk about how a large part of the demake is meant to infuse old-school PSX-era systems into the game beyond just the raw aesthetic, including clunky UI elements (referred to as "rolling back quality of life systems").
They also wax poetic about how fun old-school game design could be, and how quality-of-life features can potentially muddy the waters and put a damper on exploration. As someone who has grown up with games since the Atari, I've seen both the good and the bad of this philosophy, and while streamlining/quality of life has had a positive impact overall, in the subsector of action-adventure titles, I see exactly what Walther is saying here. Definitely check out the doc if you're remotely interested in game design or Bloodborne!
As a reminder, you can get the project and check it out for yourself right here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WWE’s SummerSlam event takes place this Saturday, and Epic is getting in the mood by announcing that 16-time world champion John Cena will five-knuckle shuffle his way into Fortnite.
Cena arrives on July 28 and comes outfitted in his full-on entrance gear as well as his shirtless in-ring gear. You can pick up a set that includes a “you can’t see me” emote, WWE Championship Title Back Bling, and Five Digit Slapper pickaxe. Personally, I’m chuckling at the idea of the PG-friendly Cena adjusting attitudes with guns instead of bodyslams. 
While Cena isn’t the first wrestler to appear in Fornite – Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has him beat there – it’s cool to see regardless, and, as a wrestling fan, I hope this trend continues. Fortnite already acts as the ultimate “forbidden door” for various media properties, so let's throw more sports entertainment into the mix by adding stars from WWE, AEW, Impact, New Japan, and other promotions. That would certainly entice me to dive back into action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony released a PlayStation Blog post fleshing out some of the new features for its upcoming PlayStation VR2 headset. 
PS VR2 now sports a see-through view. By hitting a button or using the Card in the Control Center, you can disable game footage and see your surroundings without removing the headset. This is thanks to the device’s embedded front cameras, making it less of a hassle when you need to check on something in the real world. Sony also notes that this mode is for viewing only; you can’t use it to record. You can, however, broadcast yourself while playing PS VR2 games by connecting a PS5 HD camera to the consoles. 
The play area, as in the virtual boundaries allotted for VR play, can now be customized. You can use the headset cameras and Sense controllers to scan the room and dynamically map out the play space to your liking. These settings are then saved until you move to a different play area. 
Lastly, PS VR2 sports two viewing modes: VR and Cinematic. VR mode displays VR content in a 360 degree view in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) and 90Hz/120Hz frame rate. Cinematic Mode lets players view non-VR media and the PS5 interface in 1920×1080 HDR video format with 24/60Hz and 120Hz frame rate.
PlayStation VR2 still doesn’t have a release window, but Sony promises to share more information “soon.” That includes its launch line-up, which is said to consist of at least 20 games. Titles being developed for the headset include Horizon: Call of the Mountain, ports of Resident Evil Village and No Man’s Sky, and The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners Ch. 2.
What do you think of these features for PlayStation VR2? Share your thoughts in the comments!]]></summary>

Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann has put paid to recent rumors that the stars of his critically acclaimed adventure series The Last of Us are getting set to make an appearance in Epic Games' battle royale juggernaut, Fortnite.
While Fortnite is already chockful of crossover stars, skins, and other items pulled from comics, TV shows, movies, and other media, Druckmann stated that recent whisperings that Joel, Ellie, and other TLoU-related assets were headed to the drop zone are simply false, despite being noted by some very prominent and typically accurate leakers within Fortnite's massive and dedicated community.
"Love me some Fortnite… but there are no plans for this," stated Druckmann on Twitter. "False rumor."
https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1551301460805033984?s=20&t=wk4tKjo5HZAYSkxDOYWcMQ
Despite the clear tonal difference between the two franchises, the crossover seemed more than plausible, given that Fortnite has already played host to other Sony PlayStation stars such as Nathan Drake and Chloe Frazer from the Uncharted games/movie, God of War's axe-wielding monster Kratos, and the intrepid Aloy from Guerrilla Games' Horizon series.
For now, however, our mushroom-mashing survivalists will be remaining in Boston, preparing to relive their original nightmare in the upcoming remake The Last of Us Part I which launches on PS5 September 2. You can check out a very impressive-looking gameplay trailer in our previous article.
Fortnite is available right now on PlayStation PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile platforms.

Years after seeing the action JRPG’s numerous endings and earning the platinum trophy, I never expected to miss out on so many well-kept mysteries. However, an Automata player recently discovered a secret room leaving hardcore dataminers baffled and excited. 
Someone randomly posted a video on the Nier Automata subreddit showing they found a secret room in the Copied City. So far no one else has worked out how they managed to make this secret door appear. Literally 1 person on earth has accessed this room and we are uttered mind blown pic.twitter.com/g7W4JxiNDg
July 25, 2022
Randomly uploaded to Reddit by user sadfutago (thanks, Eurogamer!), the video in the tweet above shows them sprinting past droids in the Copied City and interacting with an inconspicuous section of the back wall. After sliding down a ladder and whooshing through distorted corridors, sadfutago enters a "holy" site. I'll let you see what that is for yourself.  There are unimportant items along the way, and there's not much to do other than look around. Still, the community is shocked that something of this nature remained hidden for so long. 
Famed dataminer Lance McDonald – you might remember them as the player who unearthed Automata's best-kept secret – spoke for everyone when they said, "So far no one else has worked out how [sadfutago] managed to make this secret door appear. Literally 1 person on earth has accessed this room and we are utterly mind blown." McDonald also said that it's impossible to mod the game this way, refuting the claims of swaths of naysayers. 
Is this an area Platinum Games intended, or is it a ruse designed and implemented by players? What do you think? Let us know in the comments below!

After getting a glimpse of the first image for the original Xenoblade Chronicles so many years ago, I never in my wildest dreams assumed we'd be welcoming multiple sequels. Xenoblade Chronicles 3, arguably the most accessible entry so far, is yet another example of why I'm glad that Monolith Soft is sticking with it.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 (Nintendo Switch)

With a relatable and easy-to-understand premise, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 has a much faster startup time than a lot of other JRPGs. Time and what you choose to do with it is a huge theme, and it's the emotional crux of the narrative. Our core six party members have a limited life span (with units called…]]></summary>

Missiles rain down. Snipers bead in on me. Land mines are flying out across the park, lying in wait. And I am doing the sickest flip I can to refill my ammo. Rollerdrome is filled with a lot of moments like these: doing a nose grind in the face of death, and letting loose with a hail of bullets in response.
Rollerdrome is the new game from Roll7, a studio well-known for its OlliOlli franchise. While the team is sticking with extreme sports, it's roller-skates rather than skateboards this time around, and the skateparks are a bit more dangerous than they used to be.

Monolith Soft has struggled to recreate and magnify the novelties of the first Xenoblade Chronicles adventure since its 2012 release. The third chapter in the science-fantasy JRPG series suffers the same frustrating fate as XC X and XC 2. Despite its first-rate combat and character progression features, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is a bloated trek across vast but lifeless environments further diminished by an unaffecting narrative with one of the worst ensemble casts in the franchise.

Team Fortress 2 and Hotline Miami are an unlikely match, but in the realm of just-go-for-it-and-see-what-sticks fan games, this funky fusion works well enough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Play the hit indie game Papers, Please on your mobile devices
Originally released all the way back in 2013, Papers, Please is a legendary indie game that helped reimagine what a video game can be. In the game, players take on the role of a government border control agent in a fictional country called Arstotzka, and must decide who gets to come into the country while on the lookout for fake passports. Of course, it's never as easy as it appears, because players' morality is tested when asylum seekers and other people in need ask to be let through. It's a fairly simply game, mechanically speaking, but its story is one that has stuck with players for nearly a decade now.
Papers, Please is set to release on mobile platforms on August 5, 2022, as was announced by a tweet from the game's creator, Lucas Pope. Based on the picture he included, the game also looks like it's been optimized for a vertical format, so you won't even have to turn your phone sideways to play. Pope also said that some of the in-game timers have been adjusted, and the interface is "completely different," so there's only one booth upgrade. Papers, Please will be getting a standalone mobile release, as opposed to some subscription-based releases that have become more common recently.
Pope was all jokes in the Twitter replies, saying that the console release was coming in 2031 and, when another game dev sarcastically asked about a VR release, replied simply with "unlike." I do love game developers with a sense of humor.
https://twitter.com/dukope/status/1550895020861181952
If you've still yet to play this indie classic, this mobile release could be the perfect way to do it. Sure, it might be a little intense to play on the go at times, but the game makes for a really compelling pocket-sized experience. You can play through the story campaign, or give the endless mode a try, but either way you can't really go wrong.

        <updated>2022-07-25T21:30:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Appearances can be deceiving
You are on a quest to a cabin. And inside the cabin, there is a princess. But as the name implies, Slay the Princess is not necessarily about a valiant rescue.
Rather, you're going to have to do some slaying.
Developer Black Tabby Games announced its next project, Slay the Princess, today. And it is a good pitch. You're on your way to a cabin in the woods to kill a princess. Do this, and you'll save the world. Fail, and you doom it. But she's a princess, right? How bad could she really be?
Well, watch the trailer below and draw your own conclusions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RByDoYQpFa8
The story plays on trust, choice, and of course, lots of horror. Because despite any immediate takes on the matter, this princess is a lot more than just that. As the Steam page notes, you will probably die a lot on your quest. Also, don't try to romance her, or talk to her, or hear her out. But also, who's to say this narrator is trustworthy either?

Not quite a knight in shining armor
Slay the Princess is a really cool concept, and from a pretty interesting team too. Black Tabby Games had some word-of-mouth going about a previous horror adventure, Scarlet Hollow. It's clear the team has some chops when it comes to writing interesting horror narratives.
Plus, from the trailer alone, the art style looks fantastic. And the voice work from Jonathan Sims and Nichole Goodnight adds a ton, too. It reminds me a bit of fellow pencil-sketch horror game Mundaun, mixed with a visual novel-style presentation. With some branching paths, possible loops, and probably some secrets to uncover, Black Tabby Games has my attention.
Slay the Princess is aiming for a 2023 launch. Those who can't wait can get early access to a two-hour demo through Black Tabby's Patreon here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Swords & Solcery
The weekend's San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) brought with it a wide variety of plastic fantastics, as various merch-makers showed off tabletops full of figurines, statues, and other paraphernalia related to some of the biggest and most popular global gaming brands. Storm Collectibles was in attendance, shining a spotlight on various upcoming Street Fighter and Darkstalkers figures for its partner, Capcom.
But Guilty Gear fans did not go away empty-handed, as Storm also brought with them the completed prototype of GG's hard-edged and hard-edgy poster boy Sol Badguy. The new premium figure sees the badass bounty hunter ready to lay the smack down on his next opponent, armed with his faithful and ferocious blade, Outrage MkII. The Sol Badguy figure features a finely sculpted, fully poseable body and comes complete with five pairs of interchangeable hands, three head sculpts, and an optional flame effect to punctuate his more dynamic poses.
https://twitter.com/stormcohk/status/1551498418056339456?s=20&t=ADr7XpjkQWw16PCSzXQ9fQ
Storm, curiously, has not listed the height of the new figure, but Sol Badguy is listed in their 1/12 scale category, so we can probably expect him to stand between 10-to-12 inches. Retailing for a very princely $95 (not including shipping), pre-orders for Sol are live over on the official Storm Collectibles website, ahead of his expected release window of early 2023 — which is quite a fast turnaround for a modern collectible.
Sadly, there was no sign of any Testament figures, statues, or models at SDCC this year. Oh well, maybe next time. If you want to take a look at Storm's Street Fighter reveals from the weekend's event, then be sure to check out our Street Fighter SDCC 2022 roundup article right here.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The newest development involves collectible magazines and cars
The Fallout London mod, a fan creation that's built off of the Fallout 4 foundation, looks better and better every time I see something new pop up for it. That includes this most recent post from the game's Twitter account.
Fallout London will be bringing back the "magazine pickups that boost your stats" conceit from the core series, but with a UK-based twist. Now some of the mags will be centered around London upgrades, including owner and repair manuals for in-game cars. The aesthetic is based on the Haynes Manual line: a UK publisher that's produced a long-running (since the '60s) series of manuals mostly focused around the automotive industry. Cars that will be featured in the game include the Routemaster, Tater T, P90, and Cutlass varieties.
All this lines up with what the development team has said in the past regarding how they want Fallout London to feel different: "As a divergence from previous official titles in the series, Fallout London is not set in America. Visiting a totally new setting allows for us to explore totally new cultures which have not homogenized with their American counterparts. It also allows us to explore pre-war European history, and the effects the Resource Wars had on the class structured society of pre-war Britain."
https://twitter.com/FalloutLondon/status/1550580481363935232
Fallout London release date
The mod is still slated for a 2023 release, as of this past month. Given how active the team has been on Twitter, it's safe to say that we'll be getting a lot more updates until then!

Publisher Team17 has announced that its upcoming action-RPG Thymesia has been pushed back by a little over a week, just missing its initially scheduled August 9 launch date. The grin 'n' gloomy-looking adventure will now launch August 18 on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.
Developer OverBoard Studio chose the push the release back a few days after considering recent demo feedback.
"After listening to the community feedback from the recent Steam demo, we’ve made the difficult decision to push the launch date for Thymesia back by a few days to August 18," wrote the developer on Steam. "We are 100 percent committed to making Thymesia the best experience possible, and those few extra days allow us to do this by implementing changes and fixes that were asked for across all platforms.

Today at 2:30 PM Central Time (3:30 PM Eastern/12:30 PM Pacific), I'll be playing Ben Esposito and Angel Matrix's fantastic Neon White on our Twitch channel. I reviewed the game a while back – and gave it my highest score ever, if you're wondering – but I'm starting a fresh save today, so spoilers should be minimal. 
After that, I'll be picking up where I left off on our ongoing Gunpla build from last week. We're building the Real Grade Wing Gundam, and there's still lots to work on. Come watch these little hands cut, sand, and assemble.
Hope to see you there!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's one of several free updates planned for Sunbreak
The Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak August title update is coming up really cool, and Capcom has given us a quick preview of what to expect on Twitter. Here's the rundown:
"For the first Title Update, we're adding new content regarding Anomaly Research. In relation to that, here's a sneak peek at Qurious Crafting, which allows for armor upgrades. The upgrades utilize new materials that will be added with the update. Please look forward to more news!"

In short, you'll be using reagents from the update to augment your armor. The details are still coming, but some of the community surmises that different materials will provide different stats. Either way, more armor customization is generally a good thing, and will likely lead to crazier builds and faster clear times for speedrunners. Anomaly quest grinding is already popular for a lot of players, so this could add even more replay value: on top of the new monsters and extra content coming.
As a reminder, Capcom has provided a glimpse into what's next for the game via an official roadmap. You can find a recap of what's coming in the August update below.
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak Title Update 1 (August)
Seething Bazelgeuse
Lucent Nargacuga (and “several other monsters”)
New locale: Forlorn area
Rare species monsters
Special species monsters

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has been delayed. The upcoming adaptation was scheduled to launch on September 1 (with a Switch port coming sometime later). However, developer Daedalic Entertainment is taking a few more months to polish up Gollum's solo adventure. 
Fans have been critical of Gollum's perceived lack of quality, especially after a recent gameplay trailer where the game looked rough around the edges. Daedalic seems to have taken those concerns to heart. The studio didn't reveal a new release date, only saying it's delaying the game "by a few months." 
Here is the complete delay statement: 
 

First of all, we would like to thank all of you for your patience and support so far. Over the last few years, our team has been working hard to bring you a remarkable story in a breathtaking world, fill with magic and wonder.

We are dedicated to meeting our community's expectations and uncovering the untold story of Gollum in a way that honors the vision of J.R.R. Tolkien.

That being said, in order to deliver the best possible experience, we have decided to push the release of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum by a few months. We will update you with an exact timing in the near future.

We are grateful for our passionate community and we cannot wait to share this unique adventure with you soon!

Daedalic Entertainment

The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was announced in 2019 and chronicles Gollum's life after he loses the One Ring during the early chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring. The game emphasizes platforming and stealth as players climb and sneak across environments. Players can attack enemies depending on if they side with the character's Gollum or Smeagol personalities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox Insider testers noticed a faster boot-up time for their consoles, revealing Microsoft’s recent initiatives to get players into their games quicker. According to The Verge, the cold boot-up time is now estimated to be around 5 seconds. The trick to the faster time lies in a shorter animation. 
Can confirm - worked with @harrisonhoffman and @jakerose27 to create a shorter boot up animation (~4s) from the original boot up animation (~9s), helping to reduce the overall startup time.
July 23, 2022
The director of Integrated Marketing at Xbox stated (see above) worked alongside the principal product manager for connected TV apps, Harrison Hoffman, and senior product manager lead Jake Rosenberg to “create a shorter boot up animation (~4s) from the original boot up animation (~9s), helping to reduce the overall startup time.” However, there is a catch. You’ll have to set your Series X/S to Energy Saver mode to benefit from the faster boot-up. This means the console will completely power off when you decide to put the controller down and do something else. Nevertheless, this benefits the environment and helps drop the monetary load of electricity bills. 
Ultimately, the boot-up is down from 20 seconds to 15 seconds. That might seem negligible at first glance, but perhaps we’ll reach a period when wait times are nonexistent.

A message shared by the publisher's Twitter account yesterday states that the presentation begins at 12 p.m. Pacific/3 p.m. Eastern. Other than that, it offers no hints as to what games will appear. Annapurna's last showcase took place just over a year ago, where it highlighted a variety of new titles and game updates, such as Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye, The Artful Escape, and more.

Annapurna has been riding a nice wave of momentum lately due to the well-received launches of Stray, the cat-focused post-apocalyptic adventure game developed by BlueTwelve, and Neon White, the anime-inspired platforming action game developed by Ben Esposito and Angel Matrix. The publisher has several noteworthy titles in its portfolio that could get a spotlight on Thursday, some of which haven't been heard from in a good while. There's a good chance we'll see more games such as Cocoon, Open Roads, Thirsty Suitors, Storyteller, and Skin Deep. And those are just the games that we know about.

Capcom released a minute-long trailer that shows a battle against the Lucent Nargacuga within the Forlorn Arena, backed by beautiful moonlight. The wyvern can cloak to evade its attackers and spin within the blink of an eye to knock them back.
In our review for Sunbreak, John Carson said the game needs more threats. "The lack of new monsters plagues the early hours, but there’s plenty to love if you keep at it," he wrote. "The added flexibility of the Switch Skill Swap system is a freeing and fun expansion to combat for hardcore hunters and the new creatures in the Master Rank quests – when you get to them – breathe life into the experience. For someone already invested in Monster Hunter, there’s plenty to love in Sunbreak."
This title update brings at least one new beast to hunt. Here's hoping players stumble upon more as the world opens up and the new content is unearthed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funko, the collectibles manufacturer behind the wildly popular Pop line of toys, is partnering with 10:10 games to create a "AAA action platformer" for console and PC. The game is slated to release in 2023 and is spearheaded by video game developer veterans  Jon Burton and Arthur Parsons, who worked together on several Lego games at Traveller's Tales and are now at 10:10 Games.
“Creating iconic products that emotionally connect fans to their favorite fandoms is critical to each product portfolio decision,” said Andrew Perlmutter, CEO of Funko. “By partnering with 10:10 Games and utilizing the best creators in the business, we will have the talent to deliver games that reflect Funko’s unique look and feel across its lines and varied products.”
This quote implies Funko's stylistic characters with large heads and black eyes could be used for the game. Given the developers' track record of making games that feature hundreds of playable characters, it's not unreasonable to think this title may unite many popular brands that have gotten the Funko treatment. For now, all we have is a teaser trailer, which you can view above.]]></summary>

The game doesn't have a release date yet and was only shown once in a trailer, but will soon get its first action figure. Hasbro just revealed a six-inch Black Series action figure for the KX Security Droid, which will make its debut in the sequel game.

The Security Droids were a big threat in Fallen Order and look even more imposing now with a weapon that appears to be fuel-based. The tank on the droid's back has to be a weak spot. This figure falls into Hasbro's long-running Gaming Greats line and will be sold exclusively at GameStop and can be preordered starting July 28 at 1 p.m. ET.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray has been out in the wild for a couple of days now, which means players have had plenty of time to answer one burning question: what did you name the cat?
The game’s furry protagonist lacks an official name. As you explore the post-apocalyptic world, have you given it one yourself? If so, what name have you settled on? 
Admittedly, I’m still figuring that out myself. I still have a good ways to go in Stray, and I’ve batted around a few options as I hopped across rooftops and meowed at robots. Some are more elaborate, like "Chester A. Tabby II" (the successor to my Palico’s name in Monster Hunter: World); others are more simple, like “Creamsicle," which has been growing on me. I’m hoping your responses inspire me to concoct the purr-fect moniker. I'm sorry. 
So let’s hear it: what do you call the cat in Stray? There are no wrong answers. Well, unless you named it “Dog.” Then we’ll have to snitch on you to the Cat Police. The Cats-apo? I'm going to stop now. Share your responses below!]]></summary>

King James joins the roster on July 26, the launch of the open beta, as the version of himself that appeared in Space Jam: A New Legacy. That means he’s rocking his Toon Squad jersey and unleashing all manner of over-the-top basketball moves. You can check him out in action in the gameplay trailer above. 
Mad scientist Rick Sanchez joins the roster when Season 1 begins on August 1. He’ll be rocking his portal gun and can summon Meeseeks, among other zany abilities. Morty joins him during the season, but his arrival date has not yet been confirmed. The young sidekick focuses on using projectiles such as grenade weapons, and he can whip himself at targets. 
The MultiVersus open beta begins July 26 and will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. Though if you played the closed alpha, you’re already playing the game right now. 
What do you think of LeBron, Rick, and Morty joining the roster? Who else would you like to see join in? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. 
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and, making his Replay debut, GI web designer/programmer Jon Woodey on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s so many dodgy things I could say about Resident Evil Village’s upcoming DLC’s The Mercenaries Additional Orders mode and its inclusion of a playable Lady Dimitrescu, along with magnetic Nic Cage wannabe Karl Heisenberg and perennial favourite Chris Redfield. Instead, I’ll be a nice lad and keep shtum. Aside from the extra characters, Additional Orders brings more stages and some other improvements to Mercenaries that Capcom haven’t elaborated on. Watch the trailer for it below and imagine being inside Lady D. Oh crap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cycling in video games leans towards the extreme and the exciting: bombing downhill at murderous speeds, professional racing, treasure hunt, and such. I'd like to see more of the mundane too. For many adults, a bicycle is simply a way to get to work, to the shops, or to see your pals. So after battle royale shooter PUBG: Battlegrounds added bicycles, I decided to commute around the stag & hen weekend warzones by bike as much as possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like a building game that doesn't need constant babysitting. I also like one where you get to be a bit creative and build according to your whims as much as to necessity. The Final Earth 2 is an ant farm kind of game that places very few limits on what you can build where, and lets you cheaply restructure as needed even if you mess it up.
The idea is you build vertically, with each building taking up a block, and your people freely travelling through all of them to get to work or home or the pub. Everyone else who plays it seems to build enormous, elaborate, impressively well organised structures that are even kind of beautiful. I build a random pile of crap. I am absolutely rubbish at it.

        <updated>2022-07-22T15:19:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil Village Gold Edition arrives in October and introduces the Winters’ story expansion. This content update includes an expanded version of the game’s Mercenaries mode, introducing Chris Redfield, Karl Heisenberg, and Lady Dimitrescu as playable characters. A new trailer shows off each of their abilities and how players can tear through hordes of monstrosities as this powerful trio. 


The update, called The Mercenaries Additional Orders, adds two new stages, Bloody Village and Bloody River, and lets players mow down adversaries such as the weapon-strapped Chris Redfield. When his arsenal of guns isn’t enough, the former BSAA agent packs a powerful punch that can have foes reeling, and activating his Onslaught gauge grants him an absurd speed boost, letting him move and reload in the blink of an eye. When all else fails, Chris can call in support strikes by pinpointing targets with his locator. 
If you want to get your Magneto on, Heisenberg can use his electromagnetic powers to toss buzzsaws and other objects, channel lightning, and smash foes with his massive hammer. He can also call in his Soldat Jets to lend a hand. 
The towering Lady D handles threats by slicing them to bits with her intimidating claws, which builds up a Thrill meter. Spending this meter allows her to use special moves such as summoning her psychotic daughters. Hilariously, the trailer even shows Dimitrescu tossing her bedroom dresser at a mob, a goofy callback to when she destroyed the same piece of furniture during the main campaign. 
If you already own Resident Evil Village, you can purchase the Winter’s Expansion standalone to access the new Mercenaries content. Resident Evil Village Gold Edition is an all-in-one package that includes the base game and the expansion. Both will launch on October 28.]]></summary>

Creatively styled Refund Me If You Can, the game puts you in the unenviable shoes of Sarah as she tries to evade monsters in her nightmare and escape a darkened maze. If you did take up the challenge like RPS vid-bud Liam did then you’d have two hours to beat the game, and two weeks from purchase to claim your refund. It didn't go well for Liam, as you can see in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s kind of remarkable how little we really know about Nvidia’s next gaming graphics cards, the RTX 40 series. AMD are openly working on next-gen, RDNA 3-based Radeon GPUs, and Intel are gearing up for the full launch of their Arc Alchemist cards before the end of summer – yet there’s not been so much as a single presentation slide on Nvidia’s wares. Not the kind of hype-building you’d expect, given how many of the current generation’s best graphics cards have GeForce badges.


Arriving to fill that info void are, inevitably, leaks. If you don’t regularly hang out in PC hardware circles, know that there’s a veritable cottage industry of in-the-know insiders: anonymous but widely known tipsters like Greymon55 and kopite7kimi, who’ve shared enough accurate details on previous GPU and CPU launches that at least some of their sources are solid. Recently, unannounced Nvidia cards like the RTX 4070, RTX 4080 and especially the RTX 4090 have become this industry’s hottest commodities, meaning leakers are also the primary source of GeForce details for the gaming tech world at large.

Indie app dev and documentary editor Alex Hay has created some great examples, which he’s shared on Twitter with Baldur’s Gate: Enhanced Edition devs Beamdog and their CEO Trent Oster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Montreal's character spotlights have given us detailed looks at Nightwing and Robin, and now we get a good look at Batgirl's combat prowess in Gotham Knights. In the trailer above, we see her acrobatic maneuvers make short work of a gang. The footage also shows what appears to be a boss fight and a couple of alternate skins that players can unlock for Barbara Gordon.
Slated to release on October 25 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, Gotham Knights tells the story of a Batman-less superhero world and shows how his wards rise to take his place. The playable characters are Robin, Nightwing, Red Hood, and Batgirl. You can play whoever you want, and it won't disrupt the game's cooperative play. Warner Bros. allows two Batgirls to run together, should players wish to attain an Elseworlds vibe.
The skins shown in the video will likely need to be unlocked by finding blueprints and acquiring the proper crafting materials to build them.
Following the success of Rocksteady's Arkham series and Warner Bros. Montreal's contribution, Gotham Knights has enormous shoes to fill. Here's hoping it's every bit as good as the titles mentioned. We need another great Arkham-like game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a lengthy behind-the-scenes video, Naughty Dog's development team walks through the changes players can expect from The Last of Us Part I, a high-end PlayStation 5 remake that should look just as good as its sequel. While the story beats will be mostly the same, Naughty Dog has reworked most of the gameplay and visuals.
Along with increased realism in the character models, players can expect seamless transitions between sequences, enhanced enemy and buddy A.I., more breakable objects in combat, accessibility features galore, and even a few new ways to play the game.
If you want to see how far you make it before dying, you can play a new permadeath mode. Naughty Dog has also added a speed run mode to see how quickly players get through the story.
Your time revisiting this amazing game is rewarded with new unlockables, like outfits for Ellie and Joel and a model viewer. The Last of Us Part 1 is slated to release on PlayStation 5 and PC on September 2.
Are you excited to revisit this classic? If so, will you play The Last of Us Part II right after you finish it?]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-07-21T20:56:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has reportedly canceled several in-development titles, including the previously announced Ghost Recon Frontline and Splinter Cell VR.
The publisher announced the cancellations in an investor call, part of the same earnings report that revealed the delay of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Ghost Recon Frontline was a battle royale take on the franchise unveiled last October. It boasted 100+ player matches and was positioned as Ubisoft's next big live-service title. Outside of a planned closed beta that never came to pass, Frontline never had a release window, and the game was heavily criticized by fans who wanted a more traditional Ghost Recon experience. You can watch the reveal trailer below. 


Splinter Cell VR was revealed in September 2020, and it was to be a brand-new Splinter Cell title made from the ground up for virtual reality. The game hadn’t made much of a peep since then. Assassin’s Creed VR, which was revealed alongside it, still seems to be happening, though. 
Ubisoft CFO Frederick Duguet told investors that canceling these titles and the two announced projects was a cost-cutting measure to emphasize “even more focus on our biggest development opportunities."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Ubisoft’s open-world title set in James Cameron’s sci-fi fantasy universe, will now launch sometime in either 2023 or 2024. The news comes from Ubisoft’s quarterly sales report. 
Unfortunately, the report, which you can view here, doesn’t narrow down Avatar’s release window more than that. According to The Verge, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot explained in the earnings call that the company plans to make the Avatar franchise a larger gaming brand and that, in regards to Frontiers of Pandora, “It is important for us that we come with something that is perfect.”
Ubisoft had been quiet on Frontiers of Pandora since its big reveal during E3 2021, but it was assumed the game would launch sometime this holiday to coincide with the December 16 theatrical premiere of Avatar: The Way of Water. The first-person action game is built in the Snowdrop Engine, and players control a Na’vi in a new area of Pandora called the Western Frontier. Frontiers of Pandora is being developed by Massive Entertainment, the team behind The Divison. You can watch the E3 reveal trailer below.]]></summary>

But what do dogs (the superior pet, if we're being honest with ourselves) think about this feline adventure? 
We've enlisted Regan, my real-life chihuahua, to help us play Stray. Watch as she almost certainly immediately falls asleep in my lap while I play the first hour or so. If you have any questions, feel free to jump in chat and ask! 
But that's not all. I recently convinced Editor-in-Chief Andrew Reiner to let me use my corporate credit card to buy a Gundam model. So, legally, I now have to do something work-related with it. Let's build it on stream. That's right, it's a double feature tonight, folks! Cats and Mecha. What a time to be alive.

There are stretches of nothingness, and your numb mind tries to pass the time until you reach the destination. Sometimes the open road instills a sense of freedom; other times, you feel trapped. However, the memories that help us power through the tedium often stick – singing along to a classic, having a heart-to-heart conversation, or observing a surprising sight.
In creating a game about a road trip, you could say Gone Home developer Fullbright experienced these highs and lows at every turn. Two years ago, the debut trailer for its third game, Open Roads, was met with excitement.

Bungie tweeted a cryptic video, posted below, and sent an equally vague press release that simply says to expect “exciting details about what’s next for Destiny 2.” The most likely announcement is an update on the Lightfall expansion, which is technically still scheduled to arrive this year despite The Witch Queen launching only a few months ago (due to a delay). Perhaps Bungie will narrow down that release window, but beyond Lightfall, your guess is as good as ours.

That guy who believes Gears Of War and badminton have more in common than you might think, and reckon Gears is the closest thing we'll get to a proper badminton game.
Badminton aside, running is another pastime that's become dearer to me over the last few years. And that's a universally understood form of exercise, right? Especially when compared to the likes of badminton. So, why are there no proper games about running? I'd like one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball: The Breakers offers a unique spin on the franchise by letting a team of players work together to evade a player-controlled villain in asymmetrical fashion. A new trailer puts on a spotlight on one of those baddies, Lord Frieza, while also confirming an October launch date. 
For those unaware, The Breakers tasks a team of non-superhuman civilians (including Bulma and Oolong) with escaping the clutches of a powerful mastermind who has imprisoned them in a pocket dimension of sorts. This overseer, known as the Raider, ups the ante by pitting these ordinary captives against powerful antagonists such as Cell, Majin Buu, and, of course, Frieza. The townsfolk can work together or separately to escape to a time machine by using various tools and can apparently harness and utilize the abilities of heroes such as Goku. 
The new trailer highlights Frieza, showing how players can rain destruction as the emperor of the universe. This player can assume all of Frieza’s traditional transformations (his Golden form is unconfirmed) and unleash attacks such as his planet-destroying Death Ball. He even “Krillins” a victim by pulling them into the air and blowing them up. 


Dragon Ball: The Breakers continues to look as wild as it does humorous, which certainly falls in line with the franchise. It’s launching on October 14 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Curious fans will get to try the game beforehand, thanks to a series of closed network tests taking place on the weekend of August 6-7. You can register for that here.]]></summary>

I say all this because Saints Row - not to be confused with Saints Row yet also to be confused with Saints Row - whisked me back to the early 2000s, when I was but a naïve teenager whose life largely pivoted around their Xbox 360. A time when Saints Row and Saints Row 2 were lighthearted Grand Theft Auto alternatives, then Saints Row: The Third came along and cranked up the silliness, and then Saints Row 4 grabbed the lever and cranked it so hard it snapped. So, yes, this year's Saints Row reboot is technically Saints Row 5, except it’s more of a careful reboot. Where does it really sit on the timeline? At both ends, I reckon.

Boisterous business discussions and the clanking of silverware ring out from the crowded patio of a corner restaurant in the heart of Champaign, Illinois, a small college town two hours south of Chicago. Lording over these hungry patrons is the stoic face of Deep Silver Volition. The studio’s logo hangs a few stories above the lunch spot on the side of a brownstone building. Many eating here today are likely Volition employees, and they have reason to celebrate with a feast, as their studio’s next game, Saints Row, is nearing completion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we learned in June, Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered swings to PC this August. If you've been wondering how the game will take advantage of your gaming rig, a new trailer runs down the list of features that will make Peter Parker’s adventure even more spectacular. 


Spider-Man will be treated to a host of graphical and performance upgrades, such as: 
Unlocked framerates
Nvidia DLSS AI performance boost
Nvidia DLAA AI enhanced image quality
Ultra-wide monitor support
Ray-traced reflections (for compatible PCs)
Improved shadows
DualSense controller support
As a reminder, this Remastered version of the 2018 title launched on PlayStation 5 as a pack-in with Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales Ultimate Edition. As such, the PC version is the first time it's been available as a standalone product. In addition to introducing Peter Parker's redesigned face, the remaster also includes the Black Cat-focused story expansion, The City That Never Sleeps, and exclusive suits such as Spidey's outfits from Spider-Man: No Way Home. 
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered launches on Steam and The Epic Games Store on August 12. You can read our review of the original PS4 version here. Miles Morales is also slated to come to PC later this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 1990s, few characters reached the heights of Sonic the Hedgehog. Shortly after the 1991 launch of the Blue Blur’s debut game on Sega Genesis, his popularity rivaled Nintendo’s behemoth Super Mario franchise. However, much like the roller coasters that inspired Sonic’s original gameplay and level design, the subsequent decades included plenty of highs and lows. Even after a quick jump off the starting line, many feared the series was doomed to fall short of its potential forever.
However, the brand has experienced something of a renaissance in recent years. The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise is perhaps nearly as popular now as when it burst onto the scene just over three decades ago, bolstered by blockbuster movies, beloved comics, and promising streaming shows. Sonic Mania proved a successful retro reinvention, but the core development staff at Sonic Team has yet to deliver the final piece of the puzzle: a mainline game restoring the series’ legacy as one of the premier platformers.
Sega and Sonic Team think they have that final component with Sonic Frontiers. I traveled to Burbank, California, the American headquarters of Sonic Team, to sink hours into the upcoming open-world game to see if it truly is the fresh direction the franchise needs.

I've enjoyed revisiting this meta first-person puzzler, but sometimes I can only manage small chunks before its endlessly repeating corridors start to feel like they're bearing down on me a bit. Thankfully, its latest quality of life update might just be the thing I need. As well as introducing a swathe of new accessibility features, its auto-walk function now has a toggle option - and as developers Crows Crows Crows have noted on Twitter, this means that "so long as you're in a straight corridor it allows the game to play itself!"

Players can oversee their brigade from a new bridge on their ship deck and now have instant access to teleportation rooms. Players can spacewalk on exterior walkways on their ship, which will provide views of the denser, more varied asteroid fields. Constructing manufacturing facilities lets players produce food and other resources, and you can construct other massive structures upon your capital ship. Perhaps the coolest of all is the ability to collect dreadnaught-sized aliens known as living frigates. Check out the trailer below for a glimpse of these features and others. 


Endurance goes live today in all versions of No Man’s Sky. Hopefully, that will include the upcoming Switch version, which launches on October 7.]]></summary>

Apex Legends is hoping you are though, because the Gaiden event has kicked off to bring some cosmetics influenced by One Piece, My Hero Academia and, possibly, Attack On Titan into the sci-fi battle royale for a limited time. Watch the surprisingly authentic anime-style trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 5’s Hot Wheels expansion is out and reader, I am in love. Firmly leaning – shoving, really – into the base game’s arcadey side, it’s a gleefully silly collection of physics-mocking race events across an eye-catching tangle of twisting, looping tracks. In between challenges, and flashbacks to covering the floor of my grandparents’ house with ribbons of orange plastic, I’ve also been testing how the DLC’s new skybound setting performs on PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jonat is wandering around in the pitch black while everyone sleeps, even though he is: a) afraid of the dark, and b) a baby. This here is Clanfolk, a settlement sim about a family of Scottish tamagotchis. The first thing you'll be screaming at me, as if I have not noticed, is how recognisably Rimworldy it looks. You're right. Considering RimWorld cribbed plenty of its own notes from Dwarf Fortress and Prison Architect, it might feel incongruous to criticise Clanfolk for clinging too tightly to the hem of its inspiration. Sadly, it's true. It is a drier, slower and more bucolic take on the exact same game.

I’ve spent the last couple of days battling the darkness as the titular Victoria Bloom, a precocious young girl searching her ancestral home for her missing uncle after it’s been overtaken by shadow monsters. Armed with a powerful flashlight, you’ll battle a living darkness in an ever-changing mansion steeped in mystery and secrets. 
I’m enjoying the game, but it took longer than I would’ve liked to get used to its strange control scheme. Eyes in the Dark plays like a twin-stick shooter, with players using the left stick for movement and the right stick to aim their auto-damagi…]]></summary>

The studio’s latest feels at once unique and distinct – and yet clearly carries that Arkane DNA, which has been fine-tuned with each successive release. It's an ethos encapsulated by the game’s own time loop, in which protagonist Colt Vahn relives the same day again and again as he searches for a way to break free of it - an idea that was, among other things, designed to encourage something hardcore Arkane fans had been doing already – replaying the game over and over again.
While Dishonored had gently suggested repeat playthroughs with its kill/non-lethal runs, plenty of players still called it a day at the end of their first playthrough. Deathloop needed a more direct approach, its developers tell us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We learned in April that the Switch-exclusive No More Heroes 3 was expanding its horizons to other platforms, but now we know Travis Touchdown’s latest adventure makes the move in October.
A flashy new trailer reveals that on October 11, No More Heroes 3 migrates to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. These versions take advantage of their more powerful homes by boasting sharper HD visuals, improved framerates, and faster loading. 


No More Heroes 3 first arrived on Switch in August 2021. Former GI editor John Carson scored the game a 7.75 out of 10, writing in his review: 
“My time with No More Heroes 3 jumped between the short highs from entertaining bosses and cutscenes to long, ugly stretches in the world. Much of the design is dated, and I wanted to drop it after a few bosses to avoid the mundanity, but I’m happy I saw it to completion. There are many fun moments, and I love how unafraid it is to be strange or referential. Those who are already invested in the tale of Travis Touchdown should be right at home in this new No More Heroes. Still, I’d insist newcomers try out previous entries before diving into this Garden of Insanity.”]]></summary>

Despite the sad news, the studio announced its commitment to the space opera franchise commending other leaders on the design team, from narrative director Ashley Ruhl to lead producer Eric Musco, and stating that the remaining developers will "carry forward our vision for the game."
The blog post ended with a few heartfelt words from Boyd: 
Last December marked the Old Republic's 10th anniversary. The game's seventh expansion, Legacy of the Sith, was released around that time. Moreover, an upcoming content update promising new daily mission arcs for Republic and Imperial players on Manaan, a challenging operation for 8-player teams, improvements to weapons, and juicy story deets surrounding Darth Malgus is in development. The classic adventure in a galaxy far, far away is still going strong even as BioWare pivots to the next highly-anticipated chapters in the Mass Effect and Dragon Age franchises.]]></summary>

Well then, you’ll be chuffed to hear that Romero Games is hiring for a new first-person shooter project that has the involvement of legendary FPS maestro John Romero. The company says they’re now “100% focused” on the genre, and they’re making a game with a major publisher using Unreal Engine 5. That’ll make the shotgun blasts look extra kerblammerific.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a hot minute since a cute animal adventure scarred me for life. Ever since the first Shelter game where my sweet baby badger got snatched up by the claws of a giant eagle, I’ve learned that these adorable animal games can be pretty ruthless. It’s the maternal connection that gets me, the pang of loss for something you were supposed to protect. It shoots right between the ribs and straight into the heart. Ow.
Endling - Extinction Is Forever is one such game. You play as a fox mother trying to keep her four cubs alive in a post-apocalyptic world, and from that premise alone it definitely feels like developers Herobeat Studios are deadset on making me cry. After playing through the game in two evenings, Endling didn’t end up being the emotional gut punch I had braced myself for, but its story of scrappy survival did have me reaching for the tissues by the closing credits. What can I say, I see an animal in distress and I’m a weepy mess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the years, Lego has dished out its fair share of nostalgia-inducing sets, from massive Star Wars tributes to a faithful, brick-by-brick replica of the NES. Gamers can once again relive their childhood with the announcement of an incredible Lego Atari 2600 set. 

The Verge reports that the buildable model is reminiscent of the 1980 revision rather than the debuted console from 1977. At 2,532 pieces, the set includes the console itself, which, when opened, reveals a miniature 1980s living room, a controller with a movable joystick, and three game cartridges: Asteroids, Adventure, and Centipede. In a press release, designer Chris McVeigh emphatically said, “We hope that building this classic console takes you back to those halcyon days when a handful of pixels meant a world of adventure.”
The Lego Atari 2600 releases on August 1 (this year marks Atari’s 50th anniversary!) and is priced at $239.99. Will you be securing a set for yourself?

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/07/19/yakuza-8-screenshots-possibly-revealed-in-studio-tour"/>
        <updated>2022-07-19T13:27:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MMA fighter Mikuru Asakura enjoyed his tour of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, capturing footage of the various workspaces, Sega president Haruki Satomi (he conducted the tour), and even some new Yakuza screenshots. Asakura might've inadvertently captured images from Yakuza 8 or the Like a Dragon sequel, but without any further context, the truth remains a mystery. You can watch the video below. 


Like a Dragon's protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, and his friends appear in multiple screenshots. The charming hero's afro days are behind him as he now sports slicked-back hair and a ponytail. Based on a Famitsu report that Nibel translated (see below), Yakuza 8 takes place in a new location, and Mikuru Asakura makes an appearance.  
The off-screen screenshots are the first peak at Yakuza 8 (part of a behind-the-scenes YouTube video)
July 19, 2022
In any case, Ichiban bore his way into our hearts in 2020. Jeff Cork reviewed Like a Dragon and said:
"Like a Dragon is a departure from the games that came before it, but I found those changes to be revitalizing. As much as I enjoyed the Yakuza formula, it was definitely a formula. Like a Dragon has enough familiar elements to make it feel like, at its heart, it's a Yakuza game. All the while, I fully appreciated how much of a new identity this entry is establishing. Here's hoping this is the first step in yet another great journey for the series."

I'm excited to see Ichiban's next adventure, whether it's a numbered entry in the franchise or not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2016, nothing was bigger than Pokémon Go. Mobs of people roamed cities and parks, disrupting traffic in the name of finding the next Pokémon needed to inch closer towards a completed Poké Dex. While the mainstream fervor surrounding Niantic's smash hit has settled significantly, it's still one of the most popular mobile titles in the app stores, surpassing $6 billion in revenue last month. 
The Pokémon Trading Card Game has recently released special collections commemorating the 25th anniversary of the franchise, the Detective Pikachu movie, and plenty more, but it feels long overdue for Pokémon Go to finally get an expansion devoted to it. That changed this month, as the Pokémon Trading Card Game finally released a special collaboration with the popular mobile title. The expansion is not available through standard booster packs, instead offering boosters exclusively through Elite Trainer Boxes, Battle Decks, Collections, and Tins.
We were sent several boxes of this special expansion. As I opened the cards, I noticed the cards tend to feature more Pokémon from Gen I than other generations, which makes sense given the game's peak popularity. That said, various cards I pulled featured Pokémon like Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Blissey, who have, at one point, stood atop the in-game meta of Pokémon Go. It's nice to see those homages, alongside the most iconic Pokémon, the human characters from Pokémon Go, and items like Egg Incubators, Lure Modules, and PokéStops, which are essential parts of the mobile game. This pack also features peel-away Ditto cards, Pokémon exploring photorealistic settings, and Radiant Pokémon. And of course, there's Meltan and Melmetal, who both debuted through Pokémon Go.
You can see the large collection of my favorite pulls from this expansion in the gallery below.

The Pokémon Trading Card Game: Pokémon Go expansion launched on July 1. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obsidian Entertainment's Honey, I Shrunk The Kids-inspired survival game Grounded has been tapped for a new animated series, Deadline reports.
Grounded, currently playable in Xbox Game Preview/Steam Early Access and slated to launch in full this September, will be adapted by writer Brent Friedman whose credits include Star Trek: Enterprise and Star Wars: Rebels/The Clone Wars. Waterproof Studios/SC Productions, Kinetic Media, and Bardel Entertainment are also attached to help produce in association with Obsidian and Xbox.
Deadline reports that the series, like the game, stars four friends who discover shrinking technology that zaps them to mere inches tall. The teenagers must now survive in a backyard laden with dangerous insects, spiders, and other threats while unraveling a corporate conspiracy threatening the town.
"The team at Obsidian have created an incredible world that has already grabbed the attention of the gaming community," says Carl Whiteside of MD, WP/SC Productions. "We are excited to work with our incredible partners to bring the story to life in an animated series."
The Grounded series has no announced cast, release window, or streaming platform. Meanwhile, the video game is only a couple of months from its full launch after spending two years in early access. It will be available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.

Decisions have unforeseen consequences. If one were to look for the thematic idea that links the story of As Dusk Falls with its gameplay structure, it’s hard to avoid that statement as a driving message. Life is filled with decisions big and small that shape the future, and we don’t always know how an errant word or turn down a different road might eventually conclude. Interior/Night’s emotionally rich and risky debut game isn’t interested in giving you the choice of how the character’s lives turn out; like in real life, that’…]]></summary>

When I'm visiting Grand Theft Auto Online for funsies, just to watch mayhem unfold, I like to do it atop a BMX. Sure, everyone in Los Santos wants to murder me, but players are a little friendlier when you're pulling sikk tricks. A little.

The final product (as reviewed by Katharine) isn’t quite as glossy as the 2016 test footage, but it’s still an impeccably detailed, gorgeously lit slice of cyberpunk – and even so, the PC version can run silkier than a Maine Coon’s coat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cats are masters of their domain. As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, they've unlocked routes in our house I never knew existed, using the tiny lip of our fridge as a gateway to the top of our kitchen cupboards, bed frames as launch pads to the middle bar of our sash windows (not even the actual window sill, those daft beasts), and don't even get me started on how they managed to get onto the top of our 2cm wide shower rail that one time.
Stray, BlueTwelve Studio's cat 'em up explorathon, puts you in the paws of a similarly savvy feline protagonist. The cat itself is a marvel of digital observation, fully inhabiting all of the best cat-isms I know and love. You can scratch the backs of sofas and knead and shred carpets with alternate squeezes of the trigger buttons, meow at will, lap from dripping water bowls, topple piles of carefully stacked books and push paint cans off the edge of ledges - and, if you leave them idle long enough, they'll stretch and catch flies too tiny to be caught by the human eye. You can also play a mean game of billiards, much to the annoyance of the local robots. I wouldn't go as far as saying it loosened my jaw quite as much as when I first set eyes on Trico from The Last Guardian, all told, but I reckon if BlueTwelve had the same kind of budget and scale as GenDesign and Sony's Japan Studio did back then, then Stray's cat would be every bit the equal of that famous cat-bird-chimera.

Stray is a game about being a cat. You see, explore, and mess with the world in the ways only they can. Because you're doing so in one of the more densely-packed video game worlds in recent memory, there's plenty of room for kitty antics. Luckily, Stray wastes no moment letting you fulfill any feline aspirations you may have. 
After being separated from their furry friends, the unnamed cat (we'll call "Stray") finds itself deep in an underground city walled off from the outside by a giant dome. Befriending a small drone named B12, Stray sets out to open the city, t…]]></summary>

Far from being just another PC hardware thing to check off, they look like they might be alright?


Both hit the 2560x1440 resolution with a 165Hz refresh rate, with the Canvas 27QHD being a flat 27in screen and the Canvas 32QHD Curved being 32in and… well, curved. They support AMD FreeSync Premium, meaning they should work with Nvidia G-Sync as well, and come with anti-glare coatings to see off reflections.

When I first sampled the tower defence deckbuilding delights of ORX a couple of months ago, I'd assumed that we'd be playing as the demo's medieval castle builders throughout. Today, however, devs Johnbell have announced a brand-new faction for the game, the sand-loving Dune Reavers. Even more intriguing, though, is that the Dune Reavers aren't actually big fans of building, you know, towers, favouring instead the brute force approach of their large armies. Can you still call it tower defence if there aren't any towers involved? Decide for yourself by watching the new gameplay trailer below.

Xbox’s parental restrictions on loot box purchases for under-18s were singled out for praise, and the government now say they will legislate if the rest of the industry doesn’t follow suit.

This episode, along with the upcoming DmC episode, was filmed in advance and will serve as his final appearances on Video Gameography. I want to personally thank John for all of his help, and I will miss the knowledge, passion, and personality he brought to every episode.

        <updated>2022-07-15T21:15:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether it's because of its gorgeous visuals, deeply disturbing sci-fi monstrosities, or the return of Glen Schofield, The Callisto Protocol has become one of the most anticipated games of 2022. But where did this new twisted tale come from? Join us as we sit down with the horror master himself to discuss the origins of developer Striking Distance Studios' first game and show off some brand new gameplay as well!


Marcus Stewart and Alex Stadnik are here to grill Glen on the title's origins. A few years after his departure from Activision, the CEO, and founder of Striking Distance Studios found himself in the desert, painting and trying to figure out what the next step in his career would be. That led him to Callisto and his brand new studio. But how long did it take him to form the story structure? Did he always know how the game would end? You'll just have to watch the video to find out.
On top of the Callisto origin story, we're also showing off some brand new gameplay. Protagonist Jacob Lee traverses the harrowing hallways of Jupiter's dead moon, fending off the terrifying Biophage at every step. We also get a fresh look at the satisfying and devastating shotgun and how it tears through those who would do you harm.
If you want to learn more about The Callisto Protocol ahead of its December 2 release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, be sure to head over to our exclusive cover hub below, where you'll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game. If that's not enough, you can head over to our Rapid-Fire interview with Glen where he quickly details more about the game, his horror influences, and comments on a particular fan theory. Thanks, as always, for watching.]]></summary>
