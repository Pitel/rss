Chiropractic survival city builder The Wandering Village is coming to Xbox One and Series X|S on July 20, 2023. This comes at the same time as its Oceans update, which drops a new biome into the game.
The Wandering Village is a post-apocalyptic city builder where you construct your settlement on the back of a giant creature that carries your people above the toxic surface of the doomed world. It’s pretty neat! You have to appease both your villagers and the creature that they live on in a pretty inventive interpretation of symbiosis. It’s been in Early Access since September 2022, receiving steady updates since then.
The Ocean update adds a new saltwater biome and mechanics based around it. There are new resources and buildings to take advantage of the maritime industry. You can discover islands and shipwrecks, and the Onbu you live on paddles through the water. It’s good stuff.
[caption id="attachment_391248" align="alignnone" width="600"] Image via Stray Fawn Studio[/caption]
I’ve only dabbled with the Early Access at release enough to be able to confidently say that The Wandering Village is a quality game. I also was able to speak to Philomena Schwab not too long ago about the team’s influences.
You’ll be able to check out The Wandering Village on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S on July 20, 2023. The Ocean Update hits PC Early Access on that same day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a spiral in your ear
Fangamer has announced that Junji Ito-inspired indie horror game World of Horror will get a physical release for Switch.
You may remember World of Horror as a game that has been sitting in my dubious backlog for quite a while now. It launched in early access back in 2020. It bills itself as a love letter to H.P. Lovecraft and Uzumaki mangaka Junji Ito. It is very “legally distinct” from Junji Ito’s style. Like, this game was developed because no one else was making a Junji Ito game and the developer got tired of waiting, so they made their own. It’s sort of a visual horror RPG.
[caption id="attachment_391230" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Fangamer[/caption]
The physical version being offered by Fangamer is mercifully subdued. I don’t need more giant boxes full of merchandise I don’t use. World of Horror just comes with an instruction manual with an art card. It’s set to ship out October 19, 2023, the same day that it comes out of early access and releases on Switch.
I used to buy a lot from Fangamer back in the day, back when they sold “legally distinct” video game merchandise. I still wear T-shirts I bought from them more than ten years ago. Then the Canadian loonie lost parity with the greenback, so I only buy sporadically now. They’ve gone all legitimate with real licensing, though. I’m so proud of them.
You can currently get World of Horror in its Early Access state on PC. It will be releasing fully on PC and Switch on October 19, 2023. That’s the same day that the physical version will release, but you can preorder now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix, Disney, Columbia, Paramount, Universal, Warner Bros., and Village Roadshow have obtained a new pirate site-blocking injunction in Australia. The Federal Court order currently targets 22 sites and 36 domains but is intentionally flexible to deal with any pirate countermeasures. The notable aspect is how quickly the injunction was obtained; just 35 days from start to finish.

But beyond its potential for use in gaming handhelds, it's quite fascinating to see how powerful the Z1 Extreme actually is when removing power restrictions on this SoC. In this article is a wide range of CPU benchmarks putting the Z1 Extreme up against the new Ryzen 7 7840U laptop SoC as well as prior generation Ryzen 7 PRO 6850U for reference. When adjusting the ACPI Platform Profile configuration, the Ryzen Z1 Extreme proves to be very robust from a low-power SoC delivering good battery performance up through pulling 50+ Watts while outperforming the 7840U.]]></summary>

Capcom hosted a showcase all about their highly anticipated upcoming sci-fi team-based shooter. During the event, Capcom revealed its roadmap for the first three seasons of Exoprimal that includes upcoming content over the next few months. Perhaps the most exciting reveal is two separate crossover events with popular Capcom titles: Street Fighter 6 and Monster Hunter.
[caption id="attachment_391178" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Capcom/YouTube[/caption]
Months of content is already in the pipeline for Exoprimal
Season 1 will kick off two weeks after release, and Exoprimal will receive its first update with an all new PvE mode: Savage Gauntlet. This mode will rotate tough weekly missions giving players a chance to test out their best loadouts in end-game missions. Rounding out Season 1 is ten new Alpha variant exosuits wielding unique weapons. This update will release on August 16.
In mid-October, Season 2 will add new missions, the Ocean Platform map, and even more exosuits. Street Fighter fans should look forward to Season 2 as it will feature a SF6 crossover collaboration. As part of the crossover, we will get new exosuits based on Ryu and Guile.
Finally, Season 3 will drop early next year featuring even more exosuits, a new Neo Triceratops boss fight, and a Monster Hunter crossover event.  No precise details were provided for this crossover, but we can assume there will be some new giant monsters from the Monster Hunter universe for us to beat up on.
Those looking to save the world from dinosaurs can do so soon. Exoprimal releases on July 14 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. PC and Xbox players can check out the game for free as part of Xbox Game Pass. The dinosaur-themed game will launch with cross-platform functionality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, a California judge denied the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's request for a preliminary injunction in its case to block Microsoft and Xbox from acquiring Activision Blizzard. Now, shortly after the ruling, Microsoft has announced it will pause its appeal efforts against the Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K. so that it and the CMA can negotiate. 
Back in April, the UK regulatory body blocked Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard over cloud gaming concerns. With a July 18 deadline for the acquisition, Microsoft theoretically needs to either mark the U.K. out of its market as it relates to this purchase or negotiate a deal with the CMA to quell the regulator's concerns. Microsoft was previously set to appear in court to appeal the CMA's block on July 28. According to Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith, that won't be happening now as the two parties will instead attempt to negotiate a deal that satisfies both. 
Our statement on the mutual request with the CMA for a pause of our appeal in the UK: pic.twitter.com/8Aky2IJjxS
July 11, 2023
It's important to note that the Competition Appeal Tribunal still needs to either approve or deny this request, as noted by The Verge, but the former seems incredibly likely. In a statement received by The Verge, the CMA said it is "ready to consider any proposals from Microsoft to restructure the transaction in a way that would address the concerns set our in our Final Report," likely alluding to its concerns over cloud gaming (concerns that Microsoft disagrees with). 
Game Informer has reached out to the CMA for a statement regarding Smith's announcement and will update the story if a comment or statement is received.

After five days of providing evidence, a California judge has today denied the Federal Trade Commission's request for a preliminary injunction against Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard. In short, the deal can now go ahead in the US.
We're not across the finish line just yet — the deal is still blocked in the UK, remember — but today's result means that Microsoft can get the ball rolling on the takeover in the US and start to make good on the legally-binding commitment to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo consoles.

What happens when you combine the world's most popular toy brand with one of the most influential first-person shooters of all time? That's right, you get LEGO Half-Life 2. If you ever wondered what it'd be like to take on the Combine or seek the Vortigaunt's help as one of the Danish company's little plastic figures, wonder no more.
The mod is available on the Steam workshop (thanks, PCGamesN) and comes from user Not Dave or Daniel. It's described as a "full conversion" project that basically swaps out major Half-Life 2 characters for LEGO figurines. It seems the modder is aiming to eventually replace all the characters in the game, but the images so far show that a few have already been done.
[caption id="attachment_391138" align="aligncenter" width="640"] Image via Not Dave or Daniel/Steam.[/caption]
Fans of HL2 will recognize the LEGO facsimiles of Dr. Kleiner, Alyx Vance, Father Grigori, and even the mute protagonist himself, Gordon Freeman. The mod is available to download for free now, and it sounds like there are going to be some updates in the future.
So are we gonna talk about..?
Look, it's nearly impossible to talk about Half-Life without mentioning the whereabouts of the long-awaited third entry. It's been 16 years since Episode Two, and it's safe to assume that a new game in the series is not happening. In fact, back in 2017, ex-Valve writer Marc Laidlaw basically gave away what was likely to be the plot of Half-Life 3, perhaps in an attempt to appease fans who were still waiting.
It's just not coming. We have to accept that. But at least the games that are out are still getting a lot of love. Between the ray tracing version of Half-Life and this LEGO mod, Black Mesa and its inhabitants remain in the gaming consciousness.

Today, in a huge victory for Microsoft, a California judge has ruled in favor of the tech giant’s pursuit to acquire Activision Blizzard by denying a preliminary injunction from the FTC to block the deal.
In less legal terms, this means Microsoft can close this deal ahead of its July 18th deadline. However, it still has to contend with the Competition and Market’s Authority (CMA) in the UK, which blocked the acquisition back in Apr…]]></summary>

Mortal Kombat 1's DLC roster has been the talk of much speculation since the game's reveal earlier this year. Back in May, the complete Season 1 roster seemed to have leaked via an Amazon Italy listing. Now it looks like one of those characters has been confirmed, lending credibility to the original slip-up.
Spotted by Idle Sloth on TikTok, a short clip promoting a cross-media promotion for Call of Duty included some comments from the Vought International Studios, a fictional superhero entertainment conglomerate from the hit comic books series and TV show, The Boys.

It can be quite exhausting keeping up with all the different sales. In an effort to compete with Prime Day, Best Buy has launched a "Black Friday in July" sale. A lot of the discounts pertaining to video games are paltry to say the least, but there are a few decent sales to be found.
The sale ends on Wednesday. Some of the sales are exclusive to My Best Buy Plus and My Best Buy Total members, which are apparently memberships. Thankfully, most of the good discounts I found did not require either of them.

The Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega (AEGIS) has announced the results of their unionization vote. The result is a resounding ‘yes’ with 91 voting to form a union and 26 voting against it. The vote now just needs to be certified by the National Labor Relations Board.
This vote creates the largest union in the video game industry. It will cover Sega of America’s Irvine, California branch and more than 200 roles. This comes as part of a continued and long-overdue push by workers in the industry to unionize for better treatment. Just this past January, Zenimax QA workers voted to unite.
https://twitter.com/takesAEGIS/status/1678481056520101889?s=20
Sega is largely a Japanese corporation, but like many publishers, they have offices all over the world. This past February, Sega of Japan actually gave its employees a 30% salary increase, but Sega of America didn’t follow suit. AEGIS has stated that its goals are for pay to meet inflation and for better staffing to prevent overworking.
I’m somewhat surprised that the idea of unionizing has taken this long to catch on in the industry. We’re nearly two decades on from the “EA Spouse” blog that exposed some of the horrible practices of the industry. This mostly involved unpaid overtime, but even after successful lawsuits, crunch remains a commonly used practice across the industry. However, because this is an industry that often attracts individuals and takes advantage of their passion, many workers are afraid to put their job on the line in an attempt to unionize.
Here’s hoping that this trend continues and we see more stories like this over the next few years.

Street Fighter is having its time in the light once again. Street Fighter 6 is pummeling down the competition on PS5, Xbox, and PC, and it feels like another jewel in the crown of Capcom's resurgence over the past five years.
But while we Switch owners can't join the likes of Luke and other Street Fighter newcomers and veterans, we can bask in the franchise's rich history. And now is a good time for that too, as Street Fighter II' Turbo: Hyper Fighting on the Super NES is now 30 years old. 30 years? How!?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Give it a quick watch before you play the new entry
While the late summer/early fall of 2023 has some pretty killer releases lined up; when it comes to near-future releases, I'm arguably most excited for Pikmin 4. It looks like Nintendo is shaking up the formula quite a bit, and a new brief video tutorial showcases just how that's going to play out in the main fourth entry.
Said video tutorial covers the following game mechanics:
Gathering up your Pikmin (which is still done through an area-of-effect whistle)
Ordering Pikmin to build (chucking them at stuff)
Fighting enemies with Pikmin (chucking them at enemies)
What different types of Pikmin do, as well as the Oatchi
The latter bit is arguably the most important! It reminds everyone that the red Pikmin type is "strong and resistant to fire," blue Pikmin can breathe underwater, yellow Pikmin can conduct electricity [and can be thrown farther], and so on. Rock, ice, and winged Pikmin are also briefly shown off at the tail-end, with no details. But we know that rock-type Pikmin can deal crucial damage in combat (and can break certain walls), ice Pikmin can freeze enemies and bodies of water, and winged Pikmin can fly/carry objects places some Pikmin can't reach.
Of course, the Nintendo would be remiss to not mention the new Oatchi (dog) mechanic, which is briefly shown at the end. This is arguably the biggest mixup the series has offered to date, and the demo alone offers a ton of strategic possibilities for the concept. You can put this video training to good use when Pikmin 4 launches on July 21, 2023 on Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tuatara Games has revealed its next project, and it’s a sci-fi survival shoot ‘em up called Let Them Come: Onslaught. 
Tuatara Games has released games before – it released Bare Butt Boxing this May – but it’s perhaps best known for its work as a AAA VFX support studio working on games like Valorant, Fortnite, Godfall, and more. It’s set to release Let Them Come: Onslaught on PC via Steam Early Access in the first quarter of 2024. Let Them Come: Onslaught puts players behind the gun of a lone survivor on an alien planet who must survive hordes of creatures by activating nukes to blow up the planet. 
Check out the teaser trailer for Let Them Come: Onslaught for yourself below:


Tuatara Games says the game features dynamic weather, and a wide range of weapons, including a flamethrower, laser beam, electric grenade, orbital strikes, and more. As you mow down hordes of aliens, you can upgrade your soldier with increased health, defense, reduced weapon cooldowns, and shields you can activate on the battlefield. To obtain these upgrades, you spend XP you earn on each run.
“We are huge fans of this emerging gameplay experience, and are thrilled to reveal our love letter to the games that inspired us,” Tuatara Games founder Klemen Lozar writes in a press release. “Using our team’s VFX expertise, survivors can expect to fight for their lives through adrenaline-inducing experiences that have the best visuals of the genre.” 

Let Them Come: Onslaught also features roguelite elements, meaning a lot will be lost in between each run. However, credits collected on the battlefield stay with you, and you can spend them on permanent upgrades in the Armory. 
Tuatara Games says Let Them Come: Onslaught hits Steam Early Access sometime in Q1 of 2024. It will cost $4.99. The team says, “The decision to launch first on Early Access comes from [the] continued knowledge in incorporating improvements to ensure the final 1.0 launch is as optimized as possible.”]]></summary>

The Switch Joy-Con is a clever bit of kit. You can clip it into your console and play on the go, take it out and wave it around to mimic bowling, sword swinging or fishing, or slot it into a grip and get an experience closer to a standard controller. Though there is one small issue that has constantly brought them down in our estimation: the dreaded Joy-Con drift.
Fortunately, there are solutions to this problem. We have previously covered ways that you can tackle drift yourself with some simple DIY methods, and there are even special controllers out there now which remove the problem altogether. Then there are the 'Hall Joysticks' from Gulikit — a stick replacement that we were lucky enough to recently try out.

However, in a recent interview with Ars Technica, the Chief Operating Officer of Irdeto, the company that brought Denuvo in 2018, has said they're aware of the reputation the anti-piracy tool has.  COO Steve Huin admitted that "we're seen as evil," in this modern era of gaming, particularly as they are "helping DRM exist," and "ensuring people make money out of games."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Denkiworks is already working on its first project.
Former developers from Q-Games and Chuhai Labs have teamed up to open a brand new indie game studio in Kyoto, Japan.
Denkiworks was founded by Liam Edwards, Jan de Graaf, and Taku Arioka. All three devs met while working on the mobile version of PixelJunk Scrappers at Q-Games in 2018. Edwards then later left to work on a brand new IP, 2022's critically-acclaimed Cursed to Golf. The studio was formed after the release of the golfing roguelike with the aim to create "innovative indie titles with a unique feel and ''East meets West'' perspective."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dino shoot ‘em up Exoprimal comes out this week, July 14th, so publisher Capcom have pulled the curtain on the game’s post-launch plans. The roadmap seems standard for a live-service shooter as it details plans for future modes, maps, and exo-suits variants used to murder formerly-extinct animals in increasingly creative ways. Thankfully, the post-launch plans do get slightly weirder with two crossovers: one with Street Fighter and another with Monster Hunter.

The official Call Of Duty Twitter account has just announced Homelander, Starlight, and Black Noir — some of the stars from the hit Amazon tv series The Boys — will come to Call Of Duty in Season 4 (of the game, not the show).
https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1678449486916354048?s=20
To the cheaters out there mad at COD for rolling out the red carpet to three actual superhumans a week after applying new and hilarious anti-cheating measures, this isn't that big of a deal. Homelander, Starlight, and Black Noir have some neat cosmetics, but they join the season as regular operators. Don't expect anything like the ultra-powerful Thanos mode or Goku's Kamehameha from Fortnite.

Perhaps embarrassed by the relatively small amount of egg on their face compared to some of their more ridiculous contemporaries, Konami have decided to come crawling back to try and buy our collective forgiveness by way of their second-only-to-Squeenix PS1 back catalogue. Well it won’t work, you swines! What’s that? Suikoden remasters? Well, it still won’t work! Metal Gear Solid on Steam, you say? Balls. Balls and zounds. 
MGS1 has, of course, been available via GOG for quite a while now. It’s a noble, if barebones port, but it does mean I have Snake-related options besides dusting off my PS1 classic, which is currently doing a bang-up job keeping a dodgy table bang-upright. Either way, I’ve found myself on a bit of Metal Gear kick recently. Phantom Pain, for all its narrative faults, holds up still as a cracking stealth sandbox rivalled only by Hitman. And MGS1 is still dramatic, still goofy, still alternately comedically overwrought and genuinely touching. But most of all, it's still haunted by the same ghosts that dwelled inside it all those years ago.

The new multi-department union represents over 200 employees at the company’s Irvine and Burbank offices, working across divisions including QA, marketing, localisation, product development, live service, and more. Yesterday’s vote had 91 workers voting “yes” and 26 voting “no.” 


AEGIS announced plans to unionise earlier this year, with goals that included higher base pay, better benefits, balanced schedules, and proper staffing to “end patterns of overwork.” At the time, AEGIS claimed that “nearly a third of Sega’s long-time workers still lack full-time status, paid time off, proper training, or even bereavement leave.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If - like me - you quickly ran out of storage space on your Steam Deck by downloading 30 games released around 2007 that you'll never play, you'll be on the lookout for a compatible microSD card so you can comfortably download another 70 without breaking a sweat. Thankfully, Amazon Prime Day has your back, offering some pretty tasty discounts on the Samsung Pro Plus in its 256GB and 512GB varieties.

Our James reckons these specific cards are the best fit for Valve's chunky handheld, and I agree. As usual I took his advice and ended up with the 512GB card that has served me well over the last 12 months. Although the 256GB model might be enough if you're planning to stuff it full of games with a smaller footprint (such as the excellent Pizza Tower, Vampire Survivors or many other of the Steam Deck's best games), I'd recommend the 512GB card if you're leaning towards beefier titles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios are nothing if not enablers of wild, unspoken desires. In Divinity: Original Sin II, they provided the impossible - making each companion character a playable protagonist, and weaving their unique plotlines into the tapestry of the main story. It was one of the RPG’s great innovations - handing you a killer backstory, a tangible motivation, and a set of prompts for how you might go about roleplaying your exiled lizard prince or demon-possessed musician. For those of us who struggle with the blank page of character creation, it was a godsend (quite literally, since the adventure concerned your ascension).
Choosing a set character came with an obvious drawback, however. It robbed you of the chance to make the most of Larian’s character creation tools, fiddling with freckles and tattoos and biceps until you had an alter ego entirely your own. With Baldur's Gate 3, Larian have threaded the needle, conceiving an origin character who looks, sounds and fights however you like, yet enters the game with a frankly frightening amount of personal history and suspiciously lumpy baggage - and as they announced during the final Panel from Hell last week, some of that baggage will be soaked in blood. Optionally available as one of seven starting personalities, the Dark Urge is a mass murderer. Their species, gender, class and eyebrow thickness are up to you, but what you can’t change is their deep and insatiable need to kill for pleasure.

It's got a hefty 50% discount for Amazon Prime Day, the biggest discount since last year's Black Friday. Can I vouch for it? Yes, I have one! It's light and accurate and does a very good job of skating across my mat like a perfectly tuned puck.
The HyperX Pulsefire Haste is a cracking option if you're after a no-nonsense gaming mouse that'll stand you in good stead for anything, really. MOBAs, ARPGs, the likes of CS:GO, all handled brilliantly by the Pixart 3335 sensor. Its honeycomb shell also means it's really light, with an ambidextrous body suited to lefties or righties alike. I wouldn't say the included grip tape is all that useful, mind. Mine sort of peeled off, but I've had no qualms popping my thumbs and fingers on its plastic body.

There is, however, a lick of sense behind it. Sifting through the hundreds, if not thousands of discounted gaming wares is a time-hungry process – just ask Ed and Liam, who I’ve shandhaied into helping this year – and the main Prime Day PC gaming deals hub, the Prime Day graphics card deals hub, and the Prime Day Steam Deck accessories deals hub all tend to get larger but less frequent updates. To say nothing of the Anti-Prime Day deals guide, which also highlights savings on quality hardware from non-Amazon sellers. Keep an eye on this liveblog, though, and we’ll point out the really great stuff more or less as soon as we find it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Přestože je právě léto, Virtuální Bastlírna je tu opět jako každý měsíc. Technici a vědci nic jako prázdniny nebo okurkovou sezónu zřejmě neznají! Důkazem budiž, že témat, která strahovské bastlíře tento měsíc zaujala, je více než za květen a červen dohromady. Ze žhavých novinek můžou zmínit nový DAQ nástroj Analog Discovery 3. Ohledně RP 2040 se dělo více věcí - podpora Bluetooth pro RPi Pico W, bootloader startující program z SD karty, BASIC nebo třeba bezdrátovou páječku od MiniWare. Rozhodně ale nelpí na jednom procesoru - Arduino Uno R4 bude v sobě mít ESP32-S3 a vyšlo i nové ESP32-P4.

Ze softwarového světa můžou bastlíři ukázat LoraWAN senzor na odečet vodoměrů s kamerou, jak se hackuje chytrý zubní kartáček, novinky v PrusaSliceru nebo KVM pro desktopy založené na Rpi CM4, opensource kalkulačku s reverzní polskou notací a výpočty nejistot nebo novo verzi KiCADu.

Za hardware pak strahováci shrnou novinky, které jim přistály v poště - NanoVNA-H4, TinyPFA, TinySA Ultra, generátor pulzů a GPSDO od Leo Bodnara (a opravený SW pro něj). Pak ukázky bastlení - sondy magnetického pole, dokonce několik iterací a jak s nimi hledat problematické zdroje vyzařování a jak se dá postavit Rogowského cívka včetně zesilovače. Možná i ukáží jak minimalizovat rušení z izolovaných měničů, jak minimalizovat šum na napájení nebo jak se krásně měří s DMM6500 od Keithley.

Ať už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat nebo chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve čtvrtek 13. července od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

This is a 40% savings versus the launch price of £599, a huge discount that surpasses the last deal we've seen on AMD's fastest 12-core, 24-thread CPU by more than £100. 
I hope you can understand the excitement, as this is a great price for a high-end CPU that perfectly balances gaming and content creation performance, making it ideal for gamers that also indulge in video work, 3D rendering or coding.

You needed both of the system’s expensive attachments to play this super-deluxe version. Otherwise, you had to just buy the Sega CD version. Don’t get them confused! If you’re unsure, just ask the sleep-deprived clerk at K-Mart for the Sega 32X version of Corpse Killer. I’m sure they wouldn’t make that mistake.

AEGIS-CWA (Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega in partnership with the Communication Workers of America), the Sega of America union filed back in April, has won its union election, with 91 votes in favor of the union and 26 votes against it.
With this election won, AEGIS-CWA is now the largest multi-department union of organized workers in the entire games industry, it says.

There were several moments in my playthrough of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom where I would put the controller down, bring my hands to my head, and sit beaming at the screen. The opening dive to the Great Sky Island as the title appears; the music during the Wind Temple boss fight; the first time I bypassed a puzzle by strapping two rockets to a plank of wood and sent Link rag-dolling towards his goal.

In a humorous trailer featuring Black Noir, he silently confirms to a gaggle of press that he and his cohorts will grace the shooters beginning on July 12. Each hero receives their own Operator Bundle, with Starlight hitting July 12, Homelander on July 16, and Black Noir on July 20. Each is priced at 2,400 COD points and includes the character along with items such as weapon charms, stickers, emblems, and weapon blueprints. Each character also comes with a unique finishing move. 
The update includes The Boys-themed map elements and an additional 6v6 map, a Temp V field upgrade, Diabolical Camo challenges, Battle Royale hitting Vondel, and The Raid finale. You can see what’s coming in the graphic below (click to enlarge).

Sony has dropped a new trailer for their upcoming Twisted Metal show coming to Peacock on July 27th. It’s, uh, certainly a direction they’ve decided to go with it, but at the very least, it’s an improvement on their last trailer, if only in the fact that it includes cars.
The trailer establishes that the world has been apocalypse’d somehow, and the major cities have erected walls to protect themselves from everything else. John Doe is a courier who braves the outlaw-infested wasteland between cities to deliver things. He’s hired by a lady, who I’m guessing is Calypso, to deliver a package with the promise of his biggest wish coming true.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA Sports UFC 5 has been officially announced by Electronic Arts. The fifth iteration was long-presumed to be in-development, but during the UFC's tentpole International Fight Week event over the weekend, EA Sports and the UFC made it official. While no additional details were revealed outside of the logo, we know that a full reveal is coming in September of this year.
EA Sports UFC 5 marks the longest gap between entries since the series' introduction. Since the first EA Sports UFC game arrived in 2014, the games have arrived every two years, with UFC 2 arriving in 2016, UFC 3 in 2018, and UFC 4 in 2020. The series has traditionally been developed by EA Vancouver, so that's the expectation with this entry as well, but no official confirmation has been provided by EA one way or the other on that front. EA Sports UFC 5 will also mark the first game in the series to launch since the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S hit the market, so we might be able to expect a leap forward in terms of graphical fidelity and/or performance.
EA Sports UFC 4 launched on August 14, 2020, and introduced various customization options, as well as new grappling and takedown physics, plus a more fleshed-out single-player career mode. EA Sports has also continually updated the game's roster, adding tens of new fighters to the game in the time since its launch, with the most recent free update featuring Jack Della Maddalena, Erin Blanchfield, and Brandon Royval arriving just last week. For more on our thoughts on EA Sports UFC 4, check out our review here.
We'll learn more about EA Sports UFC 5 in September, but in the meantime, what do you hope is fixed, improved upon, or included in the next game? Let your thoughts be known in the comments below!]]></summary>

You might recall that back in April, EA Sports officially revealed its not-FIFA replacement, FC 24, promising that more details were to come in July. Well, July has now come around and today EA has released the game's 'Official Announce Trailer' and stated that the full gameplay reveal will be heading our way on 13th July.
From the above footage, we still don't know all that much about what the game will offer. It looks like FIFA only, uhh, actually, there's not a lot of differences to our eye. Of course, all of this may change in this week's gameplay reveal, though the promotional material so far seems to have a very clear message: "it's the same game".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Even if we had the time to play games, we wouldn’t reuse ideas from them".
When The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom dropped nearly two months ago (it really has been two months), a few comparisons were drawn between this highly-anticipated sequel and FromSoftware's 2022 title, Elden Ring, mainly because of one new — huge — area in Hyrule. But it turns out this might actually be a coincidence.
In an interview with Dutch news site RTL Nieuws (translated by TheBrasem for Nintendo Everything), Tears of the Kingdom director Hidemaro Fujibayashi and legendary Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma revealed that the team haven't even had a chance to play 2022's multi award-winning game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wakanda forever!
It looks like the heavily rumored Black Panther game is real. Electronic Arts revealed an all new Seattle-based AAA development studio, Cliffhanger Games, as the developer.
Cliffhanger is led by industry veteran Kevin Stephens, former Studio Head of Monolith Productions. Monolith is best known for Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor and its sequel Shadow of War.
“We’re dedicated to delivering fans a definitive and authentic Black Panther experience, giving them more agency and control over their narrative than they have ever experienced in a story-driven video game. Wakanda is a rich SuperHero sandbox, and our mission is to develop an epic world for players who love Black Panther and want to explore the world of Wakanda as much as we do,” Kevin said.
Black Panther will feature an original story as a third-person single-player game. Cliffhanger will work directly with Marvel Games to ensure Wakanda feels authentic.
At this point it seems like every big publisher has a piece of the Marvel pie. Sony has Spider Man while Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal recently released Marvel's Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy.
This project marks Electronic Arts' first foray into the Marvel universe since Marvel Nesmesis: Rise of the Imperfects released back in 2005. Between Sony's Marvel's Spider Man 2 coming October 20 and this newly revealed Black Panther game, Marvel fans have a lot to look forward to.

The Arma series usually prides itself on realistic military simulations - apart from that one kooky expansion that added aliens - so WWII is almost the perfect battlefield for the long-running shooter. 


Developer Bohemia Interactive say we’ll “be a part of the US First Army’s advance as they attempt to break through the German lines,” while using US equipment to “traverse the fields and bocage an all-new Normandy terrain.” Take a look at the impending battle below.

The newest generation of graphics cards has not been terribly good for Nvidia. The RTX 4000 series has largely been criticized for being pricey and bulky, giving AMD an opportunity to win favor. However, Team Green is soldiering on, and there's a chance that the 16GB version of the 4060 Ti could be coming very soon.
According to a screenshot uploaded by Twitter user MEGAsizeGPU (as reported by PCGamer), an embargo timeline shows that the latest in the Ada Lovelace range could be hitting the shelf by July 18. However, do note that this has not yet been officially confirmed at the time of writing.

Square Enix's mammoth RPG franchise and its defining IP, Final Fantasy, has topped 180 million unit sales. In March 2022, the company reported that the franchise sat at a very cool 173 million, meaning 7 million more games have been shifted in the past year or so.
Spotted by our sister site Push Square, this milestone announcement came earlier today from a bit of an unusual source — Kageki Hankyu — alongside the announcement of an all-female Musical Theatre production of Final Fantasy XVI, the newest mainline instalment in the storied series (which is currently a PS5 exclusive).

Is anyone bored with Skyrim yet? Probably a few of you, but those who are familiar with the modding community have probably been making the most out of the nearly 12-year-old RPG with custom content a-plenty. It may have its problems, but TES5 fans know how to extend the life of Bethesda's epic 2011 release, which includes bumping up the immersion.
Skyrim mods come in all shapes and sizes, and this one by Nexus Mods user ArranzCNL (via PCGamesN) gives us yet another reason to jump back into the game. Essentially, what this custom download does is improve the camera, hence the name of the mod — "Improved Camera."

Things are still in the air with regard to a new Deus Ex being on the horizon. However, even if there is one in the pipeline, it's possible that the voice actor behind Human Revolution and Mankind Divided's Adam Jensen may not be in it.
In a recent post on Twitter, Elias Toufexis, who provides the gravelly voice for the previous two entries' augmented protagonist, said that he's busy at the moment and is excited to "show you the amazing games I’m working on." He then adds that one of the projects he's involved with is under an NDA, otherwise known as a non-disclosure agreement.

        <updated>2023-07-10T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has announced that a Black Panther game is in the works. The title is being made by Cliffhanger Games, a new triple-A studio based in Seattle, in collaboration with Marvel Games.
The upcoming title is billed as a single-player story-driven third-person action-adventure game. In a press release, Cliffhanger states that “Our mission is to build an expansive and reactive world that empowers players to experience what it is like to take on the mantle of Wakanda’s protector, the Black Panther.”
Cliffhanger is led by Kevin Stephens, formerly of Monolith Productions (a studio currently making a Wonder Woman game), and consists of veteran talent who have worked on titles such as Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, God of War, Halo Infinite, and Call of Duty, among others. The team is still being assembled and is actively hiring. As such, this untitled Black Panther project is very early in development, so it will be a few years before it’s in our hands. 
“We’re dedicated to delivering fans a definitive and authentic Black Panther experience, giving them more agency and control over their narrative than they have ever experienced in a story-driven video game. Wakanda is a rich SuperHero sandbox, and our mission is to develop an epic world for players who love Black Panther and want to explore the world of Wakanda as much as we do,” said Kevin.
Black Panther made his comic debut in July 1966, and today’s news coincides with the character’s 57th anniversary. Although he’s been a playable character in numerous Marvel titles, he’s never starred in his own solo game until now. However, it's not the only upcoming game to let players assume the Black Panther mantle. Last year, Amy Hennig's Skydance New Media announced it’s making a Marvel game set during World War II starring Captain America, Black Panther Azzuri (the grandfather of T’Challa), alongside another Wakandan spy and Howling Commando member Gabriel Jones.

Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator Yuji Naka has been found guilty of insider trading following a trial in Japan on July 7, 2023. As IGN Japan reports, it was found that through insider trading associated with the development of a Square Enix game, he had violated Japan’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.
Naka was handed a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence, suspended for four years. Judge Madoka Hiruta also served him with two million yen and 107 million yen fines, amounting to approximately $14, 000 and $1.1 million respectively.

It’s fine, it’s still easy to look at, it’s easy to play, that’s why they’re still selling trillions of copies of Mario Kart games to this day.

Nintendo released its fourth update for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom earlier this week and as usual, a number of issues were addressed to "improve the gameplay experience".
While Nintendo didn't go into detail about these extra improvements, it was quickly discovered Version 1.2.0 no longer supported certain item duplication glitches. Yes, to cut to the chase here, Nintendo is still waging war against dupe glitches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post is part of a two-part series, of which this is the second. In the first post, we went into a bit into the infrastructure that runs OpenTTD, from BaNaNaS to our main website. In this post, we will explain a bit about the migration we just did to get to this infrastructure. After over 2 months of work, I am happy to announce we finished (another) infrastructure migration. Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care. But in short summary: (Much) smaller monthly bill as AWS charges insane amounts for bandwidth. Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi. This will be a bit nerdy, so if you like these kind of things, continue the read!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is he related to the Berenstein Bears?
Uh oh. It looks like CERN may have fired again. We're now in a timeline graced by the existence of Fiddlebert. Of course, you remember Fiddlebert from Pikmin, right? For those that don't; Fiddlebert was supposedly Pikmin 1's second captain. He was "rushed" since he was just a smaller and green version of Olimar. He would sometimes randomly speak another language and was removed from the Wii and Switch ports of the game...at least, that's what folks on the Pikmin subreddit would have you believe.
https://www.reddit.com/r/Pikmin/comments/14pn5qe/who_the_fuck_is_fiddlebert/
Pikmin fans are currently debating the existence of the green character. Some claim they certainly remember him from the original Pikmin. But let's be honest here. Fiddlebert is as real as Curious George's tail, Oscar Meyer, and the Monopoly Man's monocle. You know, as real as the cornucopia in the Fruit of the Loom logo.

Do you "remember" Fiddlebert?
The creation of Fiddlebert is what happens when a dedicated fan base gets together and wants to pass the time before a highly anticipated game release. We saw a similar situation in the Diablo 4 community. It's honestly great! You have a large group of people all excited for Pikmin 4 and willing to take something silly and run with it. Why you might ask? Because it's fun, it's entertaining, and most importantly it's more Pikmin.
Look, I know the Mandela effect is a real thing. I mean at this point who can argue it? But I have to admit, I don't remember Fiddlebert ever existing. Maybe I just didn't play Pikmin as much as I remember, but surely I'd recognize this green Olimar, right?
Pikmin 4 releases on Nintendo Switch on July 21. I'm willing to bet Fiddlebert will not make an appearance.

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

The highlight of the recent Diablo Developer Update was certainly the reveal of Diablo 4 Season of the Malignant.

The Blood Knight is the first new class in the entire Diablo franchise since the release of Diablo III's Crusader in 2014.
Diablo Immortal certainly isn't for everyone. But despite launching with an extremely predatory monetization system, the mobile-focused action-RPG still went on to make over $500 million in just one year. Surprisingly, the Blood Knight will be free and accessible to everyone when it releases on July 13.

If you looked at it and went "ooh", your coo lobe was right. "Design a vehicle" games are often too fiddly and/or competition-oriented for me, and trucking games too businesslike and grounded. This threads the needle beautifully. It's challenging, but gently, prioritising an approachable design and smooth controls without sacrificing the satisfaction of solving a decent engineering puzzle. It's even pretty, so that even plain driving back and forth is pleasant and rewarding.

Pikmin 4 is gearing up for a July 21 launch, but Nintendo started the marketing campaign in earnest in the last Nintendo Direct, which dedicated a decent chunk of time toward the new series entry. Of course, the next stage of that campaign: My Nintendo swag!
As you may recall, Nintendo celebrated the re-release Pikmin 3 in 2020 with a sticker and coaster set. Well, in a recent news post on the My Nintendo site, the publisher confirmed that there will be a sticker set coming in the future for Pikmin 4. Here's the full rundown from Nintendo:
"Add some cuteness to your smooth surfaces with these lovely 3” x 3” stickers! One features a Blue Pikmin, a Yellow Pikmin, and a Red Pikmin ready for whatever’s next. The other shows an explorer and a squad of Pikmin riding on the back of space dog Oatchi."

Given the timeframe of prior announcements, it could be anywhere between 1-2 weeks until we see the set go up on the My Nintendo storefront. Expect the price to be in line with prior sticker sets on the service, ranging from 300-500 Platinum Points.
There's also a Pikmin 4 demo promo for free Platinum
In other My Nintendo news, there's a Pikmin 4 retailer demo promo going on soon, which can net you 200 Platinum Points.
All you need to do is play the demo of the game at select retailers, then scan a QR code at the end. That's it! This particular gimmick will be running from July 7 through October 19, so you have plenty of time. Nintendo mentions Best Buy, GameStop, Target, and Walmart by name.
Update (July 7, 2023) - The Pikmin 4 stickers are now available
Good news! The stickers became available in record time. You can find them right here for 200 Platinum Points.
Remember that you can bundle multiple items together so you aren't paying standard shipping for a few stickers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega shouldn't have done what Nintendidn't
Bloomberg has reported that Sega is pulling back its plans to compete in the Web3 Thunderdome. The company was previously shoveling coal into the crypto furnace; licensing blockchain games, and creating NFTs based on its properties.
Sega hasn’t canceled all of its crypto plans, but we’re watching in real time as the corporation realizes its mistake. Bloomberg reports that Sega “will withhold its biggest franchises from third-party blockchain gaming projects to avoid devaluing its content.” “We’re looking into whether this technology is really going to take off in this industry, after all,” co-Chief Operating Officer Shuji Utsumi told Bloomberg News. Sega will apparently be pulling back from play-to-earn games and is reassessing its Web3 approach to the company's big-budget online multiplayer-focused so-called “super games” that are planned to start releasing in 2026.
This, of course, is all in response to the ongoing decline in the crypto market that some have dubbed the "Crypto Winter." The unfortunate part of this is that it’s largely a case of big executives and billionaires buying into an obvious scam, and many of them won’t really see any consequences for the poor decision-making. Instead, it's the people below them that will get the brunt of it. Meta laid off 10,000 employees when it became apparent that the Metaverse was a Web3 black hole that it was dropping money into. What a world.
Thankfully, no layoffs have been announced for Sega, but considering the blockchain plans were announced in 2021 following a low sales forecast… I don’t want to think about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the mind that brought us Silent Hill
For all you horror fans out there, Bokeh Game Studio has uploaded a video diary for the upcoming Slitterhead. This is a brand-new psychological horror game from Keiichirō Toyama, better known as the creator of the first Silent Hill.
In this latest video, the developer gives a brief behind-the-scenes look at the tests that have been done on an early build of Slitterhead. In the footage, we are treated to a few details about the work done so far, which includes some brief glimpses from the game (keep in mind that it's still very much in early development).
https://youtu.be/XYrOO0SLUAI
As well as this sneak peek of the project, we're also told that the game will feature "unique mechanics," which have apparently gone down quite well with testers so far. What these mechanics actually are is a mystery. In fact, there's still not a huge amount known about Slitterhead, including when it's likely to release. Given that it's still in the early stages, it's probably going to be a while.
A new horror awaits
Bokeh Game Studio was founded in 2020 by Toyama after his departure from Sony. He also brought onboard Junya Okura and Kazunobu Sato, both of whom he worked with on the cult horror series Siren. Slitterhead will be the new team's maiden release.
Right now is an exciting time to be a horror fan. Whether it's remakes of classics or...well, okay, there are a lot of remakes at the moment. But the ones that have come about over the last few years have been pretty good.
There are also some great games on the indie scene, such as Iron Lung, not to mention the new Amnesia game has been scaring the pants off people. So the genre is very much alive, and a lot of you will be looking forward to what Bokeh has to offer, especially given it has the director of the OG Silent Hill at the helm.

We've all been playing a few games here and there, and most of them are current, with Nate still very enthusiastic about being a dinosaur. James comes with more beans to the hardware altar, and we all have some slightly weird suggestions for your recommendations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator Yuji Naka has been given a suspended prison sentence for insider trading.
News of this sentencing comes from IGN (via IGN Japan), which reports that the 57-year-old was "found guilty of violating Japan's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act" for insider trading after a July 7 court appearance at the Tokyo District Court. The judge in the case gave Naka a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence but suspended for four years, and two fines of 2 million yen and 170 million yen (approximately $14,000 and $1.1 million respectively). 
This sentencing comes roughly a month after Abema Times reported in June that prosecutors on the case were asking that Naka go to prison for two years and six months and fines totaling roughly $1.2 million. However, Naka's defense asked that this fine and prison sentence be reduced. The final verdict arrived on July 7 in Japan. 
Naka, who also directed Balan Wonderworld, was arrested in November in connection to an insider trading investigation centered around a new Dragon Quest game. Naka was accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming, the company behind that new mobile Dragon Quest game. 
Less than a month later, Naka was arrested once more on a second charge of insider trading; this time involving the now-defunct mobile battle royale, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. Naka was accused of purchasing 120,000 shares in Ateam, the developer behind the game, for approximately 144.7 million yen (more than $1 million). 
Naka has now been formally charged and sentenced for insider trading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emile Morel, the creative director of Ubisoft's in-development Beyond Good and Evil 2, died yesterday at 40, it's been confirmed. 
IGN first reported the announcement yesterday after spotting tributes to Morel on LinkedIn. Ubisoft Montpellier, the primary Ubisoft studio leading development on Beyond Good and Evil 2, then released a statement about Morel's passing on LinkedIn as well: 
Morel joined Ubisoft in 2009, according to his LinkedIn, and his credits in games include Rayman Legends and The Adventures of Tintin. He was an associate creative director on Beyond Good and Evil 2 before being promoted to creative director earlier this year (via Kotaku). Before Ubisoft, Morel worked at Eden Games on Test Drive Unlimited and the Alone in the Dark series. 
The staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Stolar's family.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since played the Gunbrella demo at the Devolver Digital booth at PAX West last year, I couldn’t wait to get my hands on it again. I don’t usually go for nails Metriodvanias, but there’s something about Gunbrella’s slick, parkour platforming and scrappy world that made me wanna give it a chance. Oh, and the deadly brolly, of course. I mean, it’s a gunbrella. What else is there to say?
The demo I played at PAX is now available to download and play on Steam, and I highly recommend it. Even if you’re a bit like me and Metriodvanias aren’t really your thing, the hour-long demo is entirely linear, and messing around with the gunbrella's many, many abilities is more than a good enough reason to have a play, even if you're just mucking around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two years ago, a team made up of former Silent Hill developers announced a horror game of their own called Slitterhead. The debut trailer was full of creepy shape-shifting monsters and evocative cityscapes, but relatively light on concrete details. We now have a clearer picture thanks to a recent dev diary that shows a few pre-alpha clips. Slitterhead seems to have a heavier focus on combat and a cute playable dog. Genuine shocker there.


In-game footage is scattered throughout the video, but the good stuff starts to show up at the 3-minute mark. Take a quick peek:

        <updated>2023-07-06T18:11:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2020, we learned that Keiichiro Toyama, the creator of Silent Hill, had opened Bokeh Game Studio to develop a new horror game. The following year, at The Game Awards 2021, Bokeh revealed Slitterhead. Thanks to a new development diary released today, we can peek at more early-development gameplay in action. 
Most of the video focuses on the developers working on Slitterhead, with a particular look at user tests and gameplay feedback. However, sprinkled throughout the diary are new clips of Slitterhead, ranging from training room-esque encounters, some clips of a neon-lit Chinese city, and even a dog that appears to be playable. 
Check it out for yourself: 


As you can see in the small and often blurred snippets of Slitterhead gameplay, the studio's debut game continues to look grotesque. We see a character attack enemies using Wolverine-like claws, guns, and more. Oh, and below is that playable dog: 
In 2020, the studio said its debut horror game would be released in 2023. But there's no word on whether the team still anticipates releasing it this year. And given how early in development today's gameplay looks, it's looking more like a 2024 or beyond game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetherRealm has revealed two more playable fighters joining the Mortal Kombat 1 roster: Smoke and Rain. 
These two returning characters were revealed as actual fighters on the roster – they still could be part of the Kameo roster, however – in a new gameplay trailer released today focused on the Lin Kuei faction. In it, we witness Scorpion and Sub-Zero's further attempts to establish this faction in Liu Kang's newly rebooted Mortal Kombat universe (hence the Mortal Kombat 1 title), where Smoke and Rain come into play. 
Check these two fighters out in the Lin Kuei gameplay trailer below: 


"With deep ties to Scorpion and Sub-Zero, Smoke has made the clan's mission his own and joins his Lin Kuei brethren in defense of Earthrealm," a press release reads. "The trailer also provides a first look at Rain, the High Mage of Outworld who has honed his craft of water magic into a fierce weapon and now hopes to learn the realm's darkest and most powerful sorcery." 
Elsewhere in the trailer, you might have spotted Sektor, Cyrax, Frost, and Scorpion as Kameo fighters. 

Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store on September 19, 2023.

        <updated>2023-07-06T15:58:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite having pretty enjoyable gameplay, AEW: Fight Forever is woefully light on features and modes. That gets remedied a bit with the announcement that Stadium Stampede is hitting the game in an upcoming free update. 
Stadium Stampede sees up to 30 wrestlers compete in a free-for-all inside a giant empty stadium. Like the real-life version, insanity is the name of the game, as players can assault each other using whatever is around them, whether it's chairs, tee shirt guns, Molotovs, golf carts, or even ride atop a horse. The last competitor standing wins, and the reveal trailer sells how much of a goofy mess it’s going to be (in a good way, hopefully). 


Unfortunately, there's no release date for this update other than that it's coming soon. AEW: Fight Forever has other DLC heading its way in the form of downloadable wrestler packs. FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler) were added last month, and a pack containing Keith Lee and The Bunny becomes available on July 25. The final announced pack arrives on August 22 and adds Hook and Danhausen. Each of these packs also includes two new minigames. Each pack costs $11.99 and is included with the season pass.

A mod that lets you slay hollowed enemies as Tony Hawk is a good guess, but Dark Souls Pro Skater is almost the reverse. A clip went viral over the weekend showing praise-the-sun-guy Solaire shredding around the game’s opening Firelink Shrine. And yes, it looks as cool as it sounds. 


You can watch the clip on Twitter, but if that cursed site’s not working, you can find it on YouTube. There’s also a version that has Shrek shredding but badly, for some reason. Firelink’s ancient, mysterious ruins are transformed into a fun skatepark. Who cares where the skaters came from? Just grind, Gwyndammnit.

This month's game has been chosen by yours truly and I'm very much in the mood to revisit a comfy, cosy puzzle game so I've chosen Unpacking. Cue the confetti!
Unpacking is a puzzle game that's all about pulling your homewares and personal items out of cardboard moving boxes and placing them in a new home. It's best described as a relaxing house moving sim but it's also a sort of block-fitting puzzle game. Finding the perfect spot for each item is largely down to your own personal taste, but there are some loose 'room rules' (no, you cannot put your toaster in the bedroom for some midnight cheese toastie action). If you like organising games - A Little To The Left, Sticky Business, Wilmot's Warehouse and the like - then Unpacking is the game for you.

Rashid hits the game on July 24, so there are still a few weeks to go until he's playable. All owners of the game's Deluxe Edition, Ultimate Edition, and Year 1 Character Pass can play as him. You can also play Rashid for up to one hour for free using a Rental Fighter ticket, which is obtainable in the in-game Fighting Pass. 
Check out the Street Fighter 6 Rashid gameplay trailer below for a look at what to expect: 


Rashid will be playable in all three of Street Fighter 6's modes: World Tour, where he'll be added to the story mode with unique moves for your custom avatar, the Fighting Ground as the 19th playable character; and the Battle Hub, where you can earn Rashid-related gear, emotes, and more. Moves to look out for include Arabian Cyclone, Arabian Skyhigh, Super Rashid Kick, Ysaar, and Altair.
Rashid hits Street Fighter 6 on July 24. He'll be joined by upcoming fighters like A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the day of our interview, Exo Rally Championship programmer and composer Rhys Lindsay was preparing for a race on a hostile alien planet, and feeling pretty good about his chances. He spent a full three minutes surveying the pockmarked, potentially lethal landscape from above with a drone, marking the most dangerous terrain in advance and picking out a relatively safe route between the checkpoints. “Alright,” he thought. “I’m going to smash this stage.”


Of course, it’s just as they say: no plan survives contact with unroaded planets wracked by extreme temperatures, meteor showers and atmospheric pressure unlike anything ever experienced on Earth. On the corner of the first checkpoint, Lindsay flipped his rover, snagging the vehicle on a rock that immediately broke his scanning systems and left him driving blind. By the time of our chat, though, he’s laughing. Exo Rally Championship is a racer for those who like to roll with the punches, quite literally - an anecdote generator for players who adore the challenge of preparing for the worst, and then adapting to changing circumstances on the fly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This Friday on July 7th, Frontier Development's Warhammer RTS Age Of Sigmar: Realms Of Ruin is holding its first open beta test for its 1v1 multiplayer mode. Players will be able to go head to head with two of the game's four factions - the golden fantasy knights of the Stormcast Eternals and the sneaky green stink lads of the Orruk Kruleboyz - giving us our first taste of how they'll handle in battle, and the kinds of powerplays we'll be making with their respective (and rather handsome) tabletop miniature recreations. 
And having played four rounds of its 1v1 matches already at a press event last week, it's quite the thrill - and I say that as someone with no real attachment to Warhammer or Age Of Sigmar's specific lore legacy. The Stormcast Eternals and their flying hammer brutes are just as devastating as you'd imagine, while the lads lads lads and their Killaboss Kruleboyz are challenging late-game bloomers that will give even hardened strategy game veterans plenty to sink their teeth into. Both factions are great fun, and I'm very much looking forward to jumping back in this weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thrilling as it may be to swing a lightsaber or shoot a headcrab in stereoscopic 3D, the VR experiences I crave most are those which use the tech to fold my brain into entirely new shapes. 2019's A Fisherman's Tale was one of those. An unassuming first-person puzzler about a puppet fisherman living in a lighthouse, it dazzled with its incredible deployment of VR's unique sense of perspective and scale. It's the kind of game that, if it featured a psychotic AI and some cake memes instead of a beard in a yellow anorak, would have been heralded as a revolution in play.


It would have been easy to follow-up A Fisherman's Tale in the same way, make a bigger game with a few new gimmicks and a comedy lobster voiced by Stephen Merchant. But that isn't what developer InnerspaceVR has done. Instead, Another Fisherman's Tale bends your neural pathways in entirely new forms, offering a completely different kind of puzzling. The results are equally innovative and almost as interactively satisfying - although a lack of refinement in the latter category is a deflating puncture in the game's dinghy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flock is the next game from the makers of Wilmot's Warehouse, Hohokum and I Am Dead, but ever since it was announced last year, I've been wondering about exactly what kind of game it is. The first trailer revealed lots of strange, whimsical environments, equally whimsical-looking beasties and a little person flying around on the back of a giant bird herding them around in delightful swoops and swirls. We also saw some sheep grazing in a meadow before they, too, started to fly alongside your wilder, more abstract animal pals. But the question of what you do in Flock remained unanswered - until last week, when developers Hollow Ponds showed us a little bit more of their creature collecting game during the Annapurna Interactive Showcase stream.
There, they revealed that we'll need to collect and charm these creatures to get them to join our respective flocks, and that we'll be able to do so in co-op with a pal. It looks intensely charming, but it still left me with lots of unanswered questions. So I spoke to devs Ricky Haggett and Richard Hogg to find out more. Naturally, there are some things they're not ready to reveal about Flock just yet, but they did tell me that you'll start on top of a mountain and will be wending your way down it with your flock of sheep.

The main thing marking it out, apart from its style, is that instead of stabbing monsters, you attack by hovering the cursor (actually the shimmery face of the sword's spirit) over them and clicking, which launches your little globby shadow man directly at them. You can probably already imagine that this is also a means of getting around the world.

“The head was vacuum-formed, but Yoshi’s whole body was solid foam,” adds Kathy Lawrence, the costume designer responsible for creating the mascots for dozens of Nintendo’s TV spots in the ʼ90s and 2000s.
“It went from a costume that weighed about 35 pounds to over 200 pounds,” Fireball says. “The foam, like a sponge, just absorbed the water, and I just started to sink.” Mistaking his outreached hand for a thumbs up, Kathy and the crew were excited as they watched her husband fight for his life underwater.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If Ubisoft's summer showcase was any indication, it's going all-in on Assassin's Creed. But a recent report from Kotaku suggests that the company's commitment to the franchise might be going even deeper than we thought; Ubisoft has recently begun the process of remaking Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. 
The remake is currently in "its earliest stages," Kotaku reports, so details are scarce, and we won't be seeing it officially for a few years. A team at Ubisoft Singapore, a branch that has contributed to almost every mainline Assassin's Creed game, is said to be heavily involved. Most notably, Ubisoft Singapore worked on the creation of naval combat for Assassin's Creed III and IV, a success that would place it at the head of development for Ubisoft's naval-focused game, Skull and Bones. Of course, Skull and Bones is now notorious for its years of repeated delays – fans of Black Flag will just have to hope the seas will be calmer for the studio's next project.


Black Flag was released in 2013 on the eve of a new console generation, coming to PS3 and 360, but also to PS4, Xbox One, and Wii U. The game follows Edward Kenway – the pirate grandfather of the protagonist Connor from Assassin's Creed III – as he plunders the Caribbean and stumbles into the Assassin Brotherhood. Combining the series' classic stealth gameplay with naval exploration and combat, it's widely regarded as one of the franchise's best entries. Check out our review here.

Instead, the acronym is confusingly shorthand for Reach for the Moon. In Japan, the Resident Evil series is called Biohazard, which is why Exoprimal technical director Kazuki Abe is surprised that anyone ever thought the engine was named after the survivor horror series . “It’s really just a matter of coincidence that Resident Evil games are also developed using this engine.”

Valve have now cleared up their thought process on the subject, saying they don’t want to discourage developers from experimenting with AI tech, though they need to make sure developers have “sufficient rights” before publishing anything on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm locked in here with you for the next RPS Game Club liveblog! From 4pm BST today, July 3rd, we'll be chatting about The Tartarus Key. Come prepared to talk about your favourite puzzles, the ones that stumped you, and the weird horror themes you liked best. I've thoroughly enjoyed making the team play a tough puzzle game, especially one that's intentionally retro and a bit spooky without being scary. So why not come and join in the discussion? Haha, that's a joke: you don't have a choice. As I said, you're locked in here unless you can find the Resident Evil-ass key I have hidden in here somewhere. See you at 4pm, when we'll be back to see how you're getting on.

I had mentally labelled coming sequel Homeworld 3 as "more of the same, but better looking", without thinking much more about it.

A new development update from developers Blackbird Interactive doesn't so much prove me wrong as go into great detail about what "better looking" really means - while also making me excited about the new "flavor layer" of ship-to-ship communication.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scorn was one of the most enigmatic and polarizing games when it crept to Xbox and PC last fall. Some love it, some despise it, and PlayStation fans will get to see which side of the fence they fall on when it hits PlayStation 5 this fall.
Despite appearing like a shooter on its surface, Scorn is an atmospheric puzzle-focused experience. As a strange humanoid creature, you’ll explore a labyrinthian H.R. Giger-inspired alien world to unravel its mysteries. While combat is present, it’s very much secondary to deciphering the abstract story and riddles, and even those revelations will primarily be up to your interpretation. 
The PlayStation 5 version features DualSense haptic feedback support and 4K/60 fps gameplay. Check out the game’s new trailer below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go developer Niantic has announced a massive restructuring, where it will be closing its Los Angeles office, terminating over 200 employees, and scaling back development on a few titles as it narrows its focus towards supporting current titles while increasing its commitment to mixed and augmented reality development.
In an email sent to staff by CEO John Hanke (which you can read here), he explains that the pandemic-era surge of recruitment and expanding pipeline of projects ballooned to the point that, once the pandemic ended, the resulting expenses outpaced its revenue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive has revealed Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, a new game set in the same world as the Blade Runner film series, and it's the first game developed in-house. 
Annapurna has published plenty of great games, but it announced last year that it had created a new internal studio to actually develop one. And now we know that game is Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth. As the name suggests, it takes place in 2033, which puts it between the original film and its sequel, Blade Runner 2049. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles like its cinematic predecessors, and the game's events occur after the Blackout hits. 
Not much else was revealed about the game, but you can check out its moody cinematic trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, this game looks very Blade Runner, and we can't wait to learn more about it. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth's development is led by game director Chelsea Hash, who previously served as the director of Solar Ash and technical art lead on What Remains of Edith Finch. 
Annapurna Interactive says Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth is the first new Blade Runner game for consoles and PC in development in 25 years. It's due out sometime in the future on consoles and PC, but there's no word on when to expect it. However, Annapurna Interactive says it will share more details about the game soon.

This news comes by way of today's Annapurna Interactive Showcase, where developer Outerloop Games released a new trailer showing off more of what to expect in this RPG that's one part a skateboarding game, another part a cooking game, and always a game about confronting your exes and parents. It looks great – we quite enjoyed playing it recently during Summer Game Fest 2023 – and you can check it out for yourself below in the newest Thirsty Suitors trailer: 


As you can see, players take on the role of protagonist Jala, who, after a bad breakup, returns to her hometown. There, she must confront her exes and try to reconcile with them, please her tough-to-please parents, and mend broken friendships in time for her sister's wedding. To do all that, Jala will skateboard, take part in turn-based combat seemingly inspired by Persona and Pokémon, cook meals with her parents, and more. 
Thirsty Suitors hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam on November 2.

In the game, you control a small beetle-like creature as you traverse through a mysterious alien world using strange orbs that they themselves are worlds you can dive into.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 21st century, fans of the NFL have had minimal choices when it comes to their officially licensed football games. Ever since 2004, EA Sports' annualized Madden NFL series has been the exclusive franchise for the NFL, its teams, stadiums, and players. The result was the closure of other franchises, such as the competitive NFL 2K series, as well as the arcade-focused NFL Blitz franchise (which was later acquired by EA in 2011). The recently announced Wild Card Football from Saber Interactive, part of the Playgrounds franchise, hopes to smash through the established line to give players a fresh 7-on-7 arcade-facing take on the sport starring their favorite players.

        <updated>2023-06-29T15:55:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While game delays have become commonplace, the opposite is extremely rare. Today, we learned Baldur's Gate 3 is somehow doing both at the same time. Initially planned for August 31, developer Larian Studios is advancing the PC release date to August 3 while delaying the PS5 version to September 6. According to the most recent community update, the change was done to prioritize release in order of platform readiness. More specifically, the team needed a little more time to get the PS5 version up to 60 frames per second.
"The PlayStation 5 version will be released roughly a week later than its originally scheduled date of August 31st," the community update reads. "Baldur’s Gate 3 is targeting 60 frames-per-second and we’re close to achieving that on the platform but need a bit more extra time. We don’t want to compromise on quality, and feel it would be a shame to downscale to 30fps or make other compromises to hit an arbitrary date."
Meanwhile, the PC version has moved up a whopping four weeks. Larian says, "This means the PC version of Baldur’s Gate 3 will be released at a time where you’ll have more time to play it," likely in reference to the release of Starfield, Bethesda's massive upcoming open-world RPG. By releasing their game over a month earlier, it's a little less likely that gamers would have to choose one or the other to devote their time to.
The community update also casts a light cantrip on some of the features coming to the full game, including new spells, the addition of feats, the Half-Orc and Dragonborn races, the monk class, and a huge line-up of new subclasses, which you can see listed below.

Dlala Studios and Disney have released a new story trailer to prepare potential players for what’s in store on the island. 
Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy mysteriously arrive on the island of Monoth and soon after find that its people need their help. This kickstarts their journey as players must platform through the various obstacles, challenges, and biomes of Monoth. Each character has the same abilities (although animated quite differently), so players can select whichever hero they want to save the day.

It’s a somewhat odd metric to parse out because copies shipped and sold aren’t the same. For example, a shipped copy might still be sitting on a game store shelf, while a digital copy sold is money made. Nonetheless, between physical shipped copies of FFXVI and digital versions purchased by players, Square Enix says it has reached 3 million copies sold.

Remakes and remasters are more common than ever in 2023. What's most interesting is seeing how these new versions handle the issue of completely rebuilding versus simply making modern visual improvements. Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life is a remake of Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life that straddles the line between these two philosophies fairly evenly but still delivers an outdated experience in various aspects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been excited to play Final Fantasy XVI for ages, but after hearing about Game of Thrones' influence on the game, I was afraid I'd be overwhelmed by dense fantasy lore. While worldbuilding can be as simple as creating fictional characters and cities, some creators dive in deeply, crafting pantheons of gods, hundreds of years of wars and conflict, and even entire languages. While it makes the world more believable, it can be incredibly disorienting for an audience to be thrust headfirst into a sea of unfamiliar proper nouns, especially before they have a chance to get to know the world's characters. Lucky for me, the developers behind Final Fantasy XVI completely anticipated this and introduced a solution: the Active Time Lore mechanic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the ambitious follow-up to 2017’s Breath of the Wild, finally hit Switch last month. We’ve now learned, thanks to video game analyst group Circana, that it was, unsurprisingly, the best selling game of the month. However, it’s also already the second best selling game of 2023, behind Hogwarts Legacy. 
What’s even more impressive is that Circana’s Tears of the Kingdom numbers do not include digital sales for the game – only physical, according to Circana executive director Mat Piscatella. That it’s the second best selling game of 2023 on just its physical numbers alone means this game sold exceptionally well. And there’s a good chance it might be the year’s best selling game if digital numbers are one day added.

That’s according to new internal emails revealed as part of Microsoft’s ongoing court trial against the Federal Trade Commission to acquire Activision Blizzard, as reported by The Verge. In a 2020 email, Xbox head Phil Spencer writes to Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood and CEO Satya Nadella to request a “Strategy Approval to approach Sega Sammy regarding a potential acquisition of their Sega gaming studios.”
