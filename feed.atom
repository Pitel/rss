Summed up, Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising is a simple and straightforward action/RPG. It’s easy to get lost in its tranquil cycle of collecting stamps via fetch quests and combat. However, Rising doesn’t have much substance. The whole experience is bland and commits various RPG transgressions, which is disappointing. Especially as it’s a prequel introducing the Eiyuden world ahead of Eiyuden Chronicle: A Hundred Heroes – a spiritual successor to the Suikoden series. If this is a sign of what’s to come, I’m concerned.
Rising’s protagonist, CJ, is…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-05-16T22:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kerbal Space Program 2 will remain grounded a while longer. Developer Star Theory has delayed the game’s launch to early 2023.
Creative director Nate Simpson explained on the project's forums and in a video message that designing the space flight simulator has “tremendous technological complexity” and the team needs more time to ensure its polish. In the video posted below, Simpson elaborates by saying: 
“We’ve also set ourselves a very high bar of quality. The game has to [perform] across a wide range of machines. The graphics have to be peerless. The universe has to be rich and interesting to explore. We’ve set ourselves the goal, internally, of creating an experience that is both original and breathtaking.” 


Like its well-received predecessor, Kerbal Space Program 2 tasks players with commanding a space program helmed by adorable green astronauts to construct rockets and other crafts to explore space. The game utilizes realistic physics to allow players to execute real-life orbital maneuvers used to locate and land upon celestial bodies. The sequel was first announced at Gamescom 2019 with a 2020 release window. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed development and forced the team to aim for Fall 2021 instead. Of course, the game missed that window, too, and was most recently slated to arrive later this year. 
Kerbal Space Program 2 is targeting PC at launch, with the console versions arriving later that year.
Unfortunately, Kerbal isn't the only big game to get pushed to 2023. We recently compiled a list of every major 2022 title to slip out of the year that you can read here.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/05/16/taz-the-iron-giant-and-velma-revealed-in-multiversus-cinematic-trailer-open-beta-begins"/>
        <updated>2022-05-16T21:10:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a big couple of weeks for MultiVersus, with the announcement of a big Evo tournament a few days ago, the first gameplay demonstration along with that announcement, and the game goes into a new round of closed alpha testing this week. But the news for Warner Bros.' brawler doesn't stop there. Three more characters were announced in a new cinematic trailer, and a timeframe for an upcoming open beta was revealed.
Looney Toons' Taz, the Tazmanian Devil, spins onto the roster along with Scooby Doo's Velma and The Iron Giant from, well, The Iron Giant. All three characters appear for the first time in the trailer you can watch above, which has a host of unlikely WB characters like Batman and Shaggy teaming up to do battle with other surprising duos. Warner Bros. Games announced in a press release that Velma and Taz are playable in this week's alpha test as two members of a roster of 15 characters. It looks as if The Iron Giant won't make it into the current testing phase and is being saved for a later date.
A later date like an open beta, perhaps? Along with the new trailer and characters comes the announcement of an open testing phase in July. So, if you're not able to get into the closed alpha, you'll only have to wait a handful of weeks to jump into the wacky fray. 
If you are interested in trying out MultiVersus during the closed alpha that runs from May 19 through May 27, sign up for the chance to play on the game's website. MultiVersus is developed for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC with full cross-play and cross-progression systems built-in from the start.]]></summary>

The Robocop outfit will include the LEG-209 Back Bling, which can also be used separately as a pickaxe. You'll also be able to purchase the Lil'ED-209 emote from the shop, which allows players to ride a mini ED-209 (which apparently also works going up stairs).

Each episode leaves me increasingly perplexed as I’ve watched from week to week. I’m a longtime Halo player, a fervent sci-fi fan, and a dedicated gamer; I should be the target audience for this long-awaited adaptation. And all the pieces feel like they are in place for a good time. The meticulously reproduced versions of Covenant and UNSC weapons and ships, the overwhelming power of a Spartan on the battlefield, and the semi-mystical nature of ancient artifacts related to the Halo – these are all the sorts of things fans should want, right?

What do cats, frogs, birds, witches, and snow-white Finnish teddy-bear-things all have in common? That's right! They're all wholesome, a sort-of game genre that has blossomed over the past few years. Wholesome games are all about prioritising fun, friendship, and relaxation — and they'll all be in the next Wholesome Direct.
The Wholesome Direct is a showcase much like a Nintendo Direct, but with a focus on these wholesome games — past Wholesome Directs have included games like Garden Story, Bear & Breakfast, and Hoa, so there's a wide range of what genre the games can be.

Nopon's are the adorable (or annoying, depending on who you ask) mascot characters for the Xenoblade series — and they're back again for the third entry. And just like heropon Riki from Xenoblade Chronicles and maid mechanic Tora from Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Riku and Manana will be able to join you in combat, but instead of fighting separately, the pair team up to take down enemies.

The second cosmetic will drop in the second month, and the third in the third month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This morning, PlayStation revealed a new look at the PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and classic games lineup and it has me quite excited. The first-party PS5 and PS4 lineup looks great, even if we likely will never get first-party games day-and-date on PS Plus a la Xbox Game Pass. I’m especially excited to see newer titles like Death Stranding Director’s Cut, Demon's Souls, and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales on the list because it means that yes, while we won’t be getting big releases immediately on PS Plus, we might not have to wait too long for them to hit the subscription service. 
The third-party lineup isn’t nearly as exciting but it does include some bangers like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Control: Ultimate Edition, and Red Dead Redemption 2. I’m less worried about …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Be our guest.
Gameloft has given us a sneak peek at its latest track for the upcoming free-to-play racer, Disney Speedstorm. In a teaser video shared on Twitter and YouTube, it looks like we're going to Beast's Castle, as the racers swerve past the Enchanted Rose and between teacups in this Beauty and the Beast-inspired course.
The track looks like it's set partially on a grand dinner table, adorned with treats, plates, cutlery, glasses, and more. Then, later on, there are library walls full of books, and ticking clock pendulums that get in your way. Sounds like Beast took some inspiration from Mario Kart DS' Tick Tock Clock, there! These little references to Chip and Cogsworth from the 1991 film are charming, and we hope Lumière, Mrs. Potts, Wardrobe, and others, will get their own highlights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The hits keep coming.

When Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp was postponed earlier this year in response to current events in Ukraine, there was an interesting perspective that did the rounds. It meant a longer than normal gap between Nintendo retail titles, and we'd have to wait — gasp — for a few weeks to play Kirby and the Forgotten Land. Likewise with the delay of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 to 'Spring 2023'; as it stands we'll only have a new Pokémon generation to enjoy this Holiday season. Gosh, tough times, though of course Nintendo will have a Direct or two to come that'll likely fill even more gaps. We were disappointed to see Zelda pushed back to next year, but there's no shortage of other Switch games to occupy our twiddling thumbs.

I cannot remember any of the rules of poker, but I do really like the feel of cards, the shick schick shick of shuffling them and all the business of moving them around in your hand as if that'll change things very much. Card Shark, the latest game from the Reigns devs Nerial, is an ideal card game for me, as it does all the noises of shuffling and dealing and collecting cards extremely well, without requiring any knowledge or memory of the games its punters are actually playing. 
Instead, Card Shark is all about the palming and stacking and counting of cards, rather than an actual card game like your classic deckbuilders and such like. It will be out in full on June 2nd, but last week I got to play a larger version of the current Steam demo - about four hours worth of it, in fact - and I discovered that while I'm very bad at card games, I am pretty good at (pretend) cheating at them.

“The Robocop Outfit includes the LEG-209 Back Bling, the leg of ED-209 that’s separately available as a Pickaxe,” an Epic Games blog post reads. “Get them both in the Robocop Bundle and use LEG-209 as a Pickaxe that can be a Back Bling and vice versa. Going on patrol? The traversal Lil’ ED-209 Emote is also in the Shop. Use it to ride on a mini ED-209 (yes, it works on stairs)."

Splatoon 3 can't seem to keep a lid on the pot at the moment in terms of updates and weapons, and today, Nintendo has revealed a brand new sub-weapon for the upcoming ink shooter.
Called the Angle Shooter, the best way we can describe this gun is that it seems to set up tripwires. Aiming the gun at the wall, the ink bounces off of it on a few different surfaces, setting up a few lines of paint in the middle of the air. And if an opponent walks through one of these lines, they're marked and then they take damage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is Elden Ring's merciless combat giving you trouble? That's alright, we've all been there. If you're a PC player, good thing the modding community is particularly generous with its wacky experiments. PC Gamer reports that a new mod allows Tarnished to group up with some of their favorite NPCs and bosses so that The Lands Between is a little easier and less lonely to navigate. 
SPOILERS FOR NPC & BOSS NAMES/PHASES BELOW
Satoshi98 is the modder behind this cool pseudo-party system. The new feature is kind of like spirit summoning. As PC Gamer aptly points out, it's akin to Skyrim's follower mechanic, meaning that your party members will likely stay with you even after defeating the big bads of a specific point of interest. Moreover, the various characters were rebalanced to fit Elden Ring's exploratory loop and include, Melina, Sellen, Millicent, Ranni, Blaidd, Malenia (and her Rot form!), Radagon, Morgott, Godfrey, and Maliketh among many others. You can purchase these followers from Miriel at the Church of Vows. 
Head here to see what else Satoshi98's mod entails and be sure to read about why I think From Software's Next Game Should Prioritize Coop.

Monster Hunter Rise is a marvellous videogame, but on 30th June it'll (hopefully) get even better with the arrival of its 'massive expansion' - Sunbreak. The DLC will add a new location, cast, additional and overhauled monsters, along with some interesting gameplay tweaks and mechanics.
In the latter category, we're going to have new Silkbind moves and Switch Skills, techniques that will help you take your hunting to the next level. New weapon moves are always a big deal for the more accomplished players in the game, and some of them are looking rather tasty when executed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel’s Midnight Suns is a new superhero title, initially slated for a March 2022 release until it was delayed until the second half of the year. Firaxis, the team behind the classic strategy franchise, XCOM, is helming the project. Midnight Suns was our cover game last summer and looks to tell a darker story within the Marvel universe while also mixing Firaxis' turn-based strategy mechanics with deck building. According to Push Square, a Korean games listing revealed the Midnight Suns' rating, meaning a release date might be on the horizon.
Push Square posits that we might get more Midnight Suns news during this year's Summer Games Fest. And since we're coming up to the second half of 2022, this might not be misguided speculation. You can click here to see the game's rating for yourself. Hopefully, this means we won't be seeing another delay.
Marvel’s Midnight Suns chronicles the exploits of a powerful sorceress named Lilith, who unleashes an army of demons upon the world.  The Midnight Suns, a group of several fan-favorite heroes, including Wolverine, Blade, Iron Man, Captain America, Doctor Strange, and Ghost Rider, led by you, The Hunter, must join forces and thwart Lilith's plans.
Marvel's Midnight Suns is slated for a 2022 release and will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.
Do you think the game is coming soon? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sounds good.
When playing an instrument, it can be thrilling to finally nail that song that you’ve been trying to master for some time. Rhythm games are built on this concept, challenging you to replay levels as many times as needed until you get it perfect. Sometimes rhythm mechanics even work well in other genres — just look at how Runner3 manages to pull off a rhythmic platformer. But what if we tried making a twin-stick shooter with rhythm elements? You’d probably get something a lot like Soundfall, the inaugural release from Drastic Games, a studio formed from Epic Games alumni. Though Soundfall doesn’t quite have the pipes to hit the high notes, it nonetheless provides an enjoyable action experience that’s quite unlike anything else on Switch eShop right now.
Soundfall places you in the role of Melody, a down-on-her-luck barista with incredible musical ability that largely goes unrealized. Before leaving for work one day, Melody sits down to listen to some music and finds herself transported away to a magical musical world called Symphonia. This is the place from which all music comes, but Melody’s arrival is not necessarily a good sign. There’s a rising power of evil monsters called Discordians that threaten the creation of music, and it’s up to Melody and friends to rise to their role as Guardians of Harmony and thwart the discordant threat.

Speaking to YouTuber KIMI TALKZ, Anderson stated that the team was initially brought in to help Nintendo get over the finish line, but ended up creating entire tracks, which some members were apparently not "super-duper excited" about:

Hands up — who had a Pokémon Mini back in the day? The microconsole launched in 2001 in Japan and North America — right before the GameCube came out — and the following year in Europe. it came in three colours, had ten games released for it (only 4 made it to America, with an additional game coming to Europe), and is still the smallest cartridge-based system Nintendo has ever made.
Despite its short run and tiny library, fans figured out a way to reverse engineer the tiny little system years ago, and many have been making homebrew games for the system for a while. But one indie developer is taking it a step further and wants to create a brand new entry in its horror series for the miniature system.

When Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl launched on the Switch in October 2021, the comparisons to a certain Nintendo platform fighter were natural and inevitable. Heck, we spent our review trying — and admittedly failing — to avoid the obvious similarity to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Indeed, when a game comes out that brings characters from multiple franchises together to fight on a platform-based arena and knock opponents out of the boundaries, it's almost begging for certain comparisons to be made. After all, Super Smash Bros. essentially birthed the sub-genre.
It seems one dev isn't too pleased with a particular comparison, and we can understand why. Since the beginning both enthusiastic fans and detractors have been cavalier with their hyperbole, and in a short Twitter thread, All-Star Brawl character designer and programmer Thaddeus Crews stated that he'd rather people not use the term "Smash-killer" anymore, saying that the comparison has a proven track record of instigating conflict.

It's a very similar story in this week's UK charts. The top two spots remain unchanged for the third week in a row — Nintendo Switch Sports and LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga's universal appeal means they are the top two selling boxed games this week.
Third and fourth are also exactly the same as last week, as Sony exclusive Horizon Forbidden West and chart favourite Mario Kart 8 Deluxe keep a grip on their places. Pokémon Legends: Arceus and Animal Crossing: New Horizons are both comfy in the top ten this week, and FIFA 22 — after slipping out two weeks in a row — just sneaks back in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Activision Blizzard published a post on their website about their "Diversity Space Tool". Developed by subsidiary King, it's a tool for rating video game characters along certain axes in order to rate their relative diversity. Several people then pointed out that sounded mildly dystopian.

Yesterday, Activison Blizzard responded, saying that the "prototype is not being used in active game development", and was designed as an optional supplement to other work.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/podcast/2022/05/14/exploring-the-full-history-of-supergiant-games-pyre-video-gameography"/>
        <updated>2022-05-14T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've emerged from the depths of the BioShock series to begin a fresh season of Video Gameography! We're doing things differently this time as we're discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, the acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. This week, we continue our season by analyzing 2017's Pyre. 
Pyre was released on June 25, 2017. After Supergiant struggled to create Transistor, the team adopted a looser "anything goes" approach for Pyre. The game blends together disparate elements reflecting the team's interests such as a high-fantasy setting, a large cast of engaging characters, a ritual in the form of a basketball/soccer-like competition, and Oregon Trail-inspired exploration. Tune in to find out how Supergiant concocted the game's centerpiece "sports" game, its approach to crafting a larger branching narrative (including an ever-changing end credit song), and which members of the Nightwings we chose to liberate and the ones we abandoned in the Downside.
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with video game consultant and former Game Informer editor Suriel Vazquez (@SurielVazquez) for a verbal stroll through the history and narrative of Pyre!
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

Today, musicians from across Europe and beyond come together to give it their all, with varying degrees of catchiness, camp, and drama. Honestly, this year's contest better be amazing, considering some great songs have already been knocked out before the finals. I was particularly surprised by the loss of Austria's pop goths and Latvia's song with the most surprising obscene opening line in pop history. If that's the quality of song being rejected, they BETTER NOT have any boring junk in the finals. But we have hours to fill until Eurovision starts, so what are you playing this weekend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To unlock every character in Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, you'll need to play through all nine movies and perform specific tasks, but you can get a few by simply entering a code. TT Games and Warner Bros. Interactive provided Game Informer with several codes at launch. When you boot up the game, enter the pause screen, then access the option "Enter Code."
The codes will add a variety of characters like Dengar and Emperor Palpatine. Getting these characters early is a big win, as they are a part of classes you'll need to perform certain feats and don't normally unlock until later in the game. Here are the codes:
Aayla Secura: KH7P320
Admiral Holdo: XV4WND9
C-3PO (Holiday): C3PHOHO
Chewbacca (Holiday): WOOKIEE
DARTH VADER (Holiday): WROSHYR
Dengar: OKV7TLR
D-O (Holiday): TIPYIPS
Emperor Palpatine: SIDIOUS
Gonk Droid (Holiday): LIFEDAY
Grand Moff Tarkin: 3FCPPVX
Mister Bones: BAC1CKP
Nute Gunray: WBFE4GO
Poe Dameron (Holiday): KORDOKU
Poggle The Lesser: Z55T8CQ
Ratts Tyerell: GR2VBXF
Razor Crest (Ship): ARVALA7
Resistance I-TS Transport (Ship): SHUTTLE
Shaak Ti: VT1LFNH
Shmi Skywalker: T9LM1QF
Snap Wexley: SKYSAGA
We'll update this list as more character codes are discovered. Until then, have fun unlocking characters on your own, and may the Force be with you!]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-05-13T23:44:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was a kid, I had a Luke Skywalker action figure with a lightsaber that slid out of his wrist. It was one of my prized possessions, even though the details were lacking. This version of Luke looked more like an elf from the Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer claymation film than actor Mark Hamill. His lightsaber was also oddly yellow instead of blue – a detail I always thought was odd.
The point being, action figures have come a LONG way since then. Hot Toys' latest Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness action figure looks so realistic it could be in a wax museum. Benedict Cumberbatch's facial detailing is spot on, and the 30 points of articulation allow for many of his spell-casting poses to be recreated. To make sure these spell motions look just like in the movie, Hot Toys includes over a dozen interchangeable hands with fingers pointing every which way. You'll also find five mystic powers to go along with some of the hands to truly sell the effects of the spell.  
The figure is 31 centimeters in height and comes with a variety of accessories, like the Book of Vishanti, two sling rings, an amulet, handcuffs, mystic vipers, and so much more.
Hot Toys hasn't given us a price yet, but it's expected to ship in either the third or fourth quarter of 2023. You can find out more about this amazing figure at Hot Toys' official site. Check out images of this figure in action below:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stop me if you've heard this before, but the Halo series has continuously been a roller coaster ride of good and bad, and few episodes encapsulate that as well as this week's tale in "Allegiance." Join us on The Game Informer Show as we discuss the eighth episode of the series, break down the most significant moments, and discuss the scene everyone is talking about.


Your regular hosts of Alex Stadnik, Andrew Reiner, and Brian Shea are back again and definitely have thoughts on the return of Master Chief, Makee, and Dr. Halsey. After a week away on Madrigal with Kwan and Soren, the focus shifts back to Reach and what the UNSC is doing about finding The Covenant and Halo. While the militaristic arm of humanity panics over other planets getting glassed by their alien foes, John and Makee are spending time getting to know each other after their shared vision of the show's namesake.
While the universe's greatest Spartan and the Covenant spy fraternize in the park (and other places), Dr. Halsey continues to meddle in order to advance humanity in her image, threatening the people she's trying to save in the process. Will the good doctor's interference and the union between the main characters result in unity between the two warring factions or make the upcoming battle that much harder? You'll just have to listen to this week's show to find out.

Here are some of those most commonly used and misunderstood terms, and a shortform definition of what they mean and how they're most commonly discussed. In addition, we've paired up several words that are often used either in conjunction with one another, or are commonly misused in context.

        <updated>2022-05-13T17:46:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is getting three new characters over the next several months. Today, players can download X-J9 AKA Jenny from My Life as a Teenage Robot. Hugh Neutron, the duck-loving meme king and father of Jimmy Neutron, arrives this summer. Lastly, Rocko of Rocko’s Modern Life fame is slated for the fall. 
The announcement trailer below largely focuses on Jenny, who can pummel opponents with rocket-powered fists, zap them with lasers, slice them up with buzzsaws, and utilize other gadgets. Unfortunately, we don’t get any gameplay footage of Hugh or Rocko, but those videos will likely arrive as we approach each character’s launch dates.
Each fighter is labeled as premium DLC, meaning they come at a price. You can grab Jenny, her Tremorton Joyride stage, and her alternate costume for $4.99. A Universe Pack containing all three characters, along with the new stages and costumes tied to them, goes for $11.99. 


Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl didn’t blow us away (here’s our review), but it's a respectable platform fighter and it’s cool to see developer Ludosity continue to bolster the roster with fan-favorite characters. One has to wonder if these will be the only new faces to grace the game in 2022 given how spaced out they are, and what characters will be added in 2023, if any. 
Are you still playing Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl? What do you think of these new additions? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD’s FSR 2.0 upscaler is out now – in only one game, Deathloop, but still. This is a big moment for the heavily upgraded FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution), as it’s basically attempting to fight Nvidia’s rival DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) with some of its own tactics. There’s none of Nvidia’s machine learning enhancements, but whereas FSR 1.0 was a simple spatial upscaler – meaning data used for upscaling a frame could only come from within the frame itself – FSR 2.0 uses a temporal upscaling technique similar to that of DLSS. This allows it to draw data from previous frames as well, producing a sharper, higher-quality image. 


The lack of machine learning also has the upside of keeping FSR 2.0, like FSR 1.0, compatible with any reasonably recent gaming GPU. Nvidia may make most of this generation’s best graphics cards, but you won't need something brand new and super powerful to let FSR 2.0 boost your frame rates. To find out how well it works, compared to both DLSS and FSR 1.0, I reinstalled Deathloop and gave all three upscalers a whirl.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arma fans may want to clear Tuesday, May 17, from their calendars. Developer Bohemia Interactive announced a livestream on that day focused on the future of the series.  Bohemia’s press release teases next to nothing of what to expect, only saying the presentation will feature an "exciting reveal." Will it be Arma 4? You can find out by catching the stream on the Arma Twitch channel, which begins at 10 a.m. Pacific/1 p.m. Eastern.  
The last mainline entry was 2013’s Arma 3, a game Bohemia has consistently supported with numerous content updates over the past nine years. Its most recent expansion, Arma 3: Creator DLC: SOG - Prairie Fire, launched in 2021. The tactical shooter franchise has maintained a popular following, and its active mod scene helped spawn popular multiplayer offshoots such as DayZ and PUBG: Battlegrounds. 
What do you expect to see in the livestream? Do you think Arma 4 will be announced, or will it be another big Arma 3 expansion? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

For well over half of Eve Online’s existence, he has led CCP in an effort to create the perfect spin-off shooter - stubbornly chasing the dream of a playable Starship Troopers, even as those brave young prototypes have been cut down by unimpressed players, one after the other.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Party games can provide some of the best experiences in all of gaming. They force players to group up and work together toward a common goal, which can be very rewarding. Not all of them do that, though – some party games will test the bonds of friends greatly, be it on a Mario Party battlefield, an Overcooked kitchen, or somewhere else entirely. Regardless of the objective, playing games with friends is always fun and when developers specifically hone in on that camaraderie, the result can be a great game that makes an appearance at any and every social gathering. 
This list highlights some of our personal faves. Here are 10 great party games, listed in no particular order, that are sure to bring cheers, laughs, screams, and more to any event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Trading Card Game is back with its second expansion of 2022, and this time, despite the Sword & Shield nomenclature on the box, I was most excited for the Pokémon that appeared in games like Pokémon Legends: Arceus. This expansion adds more than 180 new cards, including 3 new Radiant Pokémon, 8 Pokémon VStar, 21 Pokémon V, and 2 Pokémon VMax cards. On top of that, Astral Radiance delivers 30 cards with special art in the Trainer Gallery subset, as well as more than 20 Trainer cards.
The Pokémon Company sent us a ton of booster packs so we could see what we pull from this newest addition to the TCG. I was pleasantly surprised not only with the Radiant Pokémon I pulled but also by the number of Hisuian Pokémon that appeared in Pokémon Legends: Arceus. I loved the Decidueye and Typhlosion cards I secured through these booster packs, as well as the various rideable and Noble Pokémon I recognized from my time in Hisui. If you are hoping to round out your personal collection with more Galar Pokémon, don't worry, as I still found several creatures from Gen VIII's main region.
However, my favorite card is probably one that features a Pokémon I did not anticipate being so excited about: Hoothoot. This serene full-art Battle Region card immediately caught my eye and became the showpiece addition to my collection from this expansion. You can see the full gallery of my favorite cards I pulled from booster packs of the Astral Radiance expansion below:

Releasing a football schedule might sound boring on paper, and perhaps if you’re not the Chargers it is, but the Los Angeles-based team decided to do something we think every NFL team should do: release its football schedule as an anime opening, complete with a great track and some well-done animation that harkens back to anime favorites like One Piece, Attack On Titan, and much more. Check it out for yourself below!
Should we REALLY make our schedule release video an anime?

May 13, 2022
As you can see, the video begins with a nice logo treatment before revealing that the Chargers will face the Las Vegas Raiders in both teams’ first game of the 2022 season. And if you’re at all familiar with One Piece, you can see how the Chargers turned the Raiders into the One Piece team. 

The rest of the video contains a bunch of other great anime references so be sure to check it out and let us know which one is your favorite below! After that, read Game Informer’s Madden NFL 22 review.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve played Elden Ring, then you’re familiar with the strange occurrence that happens when you reach the main menu of the game and you’re somehow forced to sit on the screen for at least 30 seconds while listening to what can only be described as an extremely hype start to the day’s Elden Ring session (or is that just me?). 
It’s a great song – orchestral, epic, and an awesome way to begin the game each time you boot it up. However, what if it was composed in a different style, perhaps as a symphonic metal song? Or maybe a lofi hip-hop track? Well, composer Alex Moukala has done just that and more. In fact, Moukala covered the main theme of Elden Ring in 15 different styles: Spanish Guitar, Nu-Disco, Symphonic Metal, Smooth Jazz, Lofi Hip-Hop, Darksynth, Movie Trailer, Piano Solo, Baroque (my personal favorite), Reggae, Big Room House, French House, Trap x Traditional Japanese (also possibly my favorite), and Orchestral. 


As you can see in the video above, there’s not a single style Moukala remixes Elden Ring’s theme into that doesn’t work – if I booted up From Software’s latest, which is great but even better when playing with friends, and any of these started playing, I’d be just as excited as I am when I hear the standard theme. If you like these remixes, you’re in luck because Moukala does this all the time. He has other “X Game In 15 Different Styles” videos, video game trailer music rewrites and re-arrangements, music analyses, and so much more. His entire channel is great!
For more Elden Ring, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring review to find out why we gave it a 10 out of 10 and then read about why one Game Informer editor believes From Software’s next game should prioritize co-op. Check out this story about how someone used a modded Fisher-Price baby controller to play Elden Ring on PC after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lego games I'm most familiar with are the licensed property games - yer Lego Indiana Joneses and yer Lego Star Warses where you run around a continuous level smashing things. Lego Bricktales is more akin to last year's extremely cute geometric puzzler Lego Builder's Journey, in that you're exploring detailed, colourful brick dioramas, and solving puzzles by bulding things out of titular hot-property block. In Bricktales, though, it's way more granular. You're whisked away into a separate building screen to construct and stress test things like bridges and beams to support a platform, for example. You have a set number of different shaped and sized bricks to work with.
From playing a preview build of the first level - a jungle, home to some lost explorers - the thing that impresses me most about Bricktales is just how much it's like building things with actual Lego. It sounds stupid to say, but them little bricks are really astonishingly realised. It all looks so much Lego it's sort of surprising that you can't reach through the screen and pick it up. It's amazing. It's the closest thing to Lego you can get outside of actual Lego - which is the problem. It just kind of makes you miss Lego.

Just last year, we got New Pokémon Snap, a sequel to one of Pokémon's most beloved spin-offs more than two decades after the fact. Now, 2022 brings us Mario Strikers: Battle League. Announced in February during this year's first Nintendo Direct, Mario Strikers: Battle League is the first entry in Nintendo's arcade-style soccer series since 2007's Mario Strikers Charged on Wii. While Nintendo gave us some tidbits of information on what to expect through Battle League's initial reveal, Nintendo really pulled back the curtain today through a new overview trailer, which you can see below.

In Evil Dead: The Game, don’t expect to find the human heroes cowering in corners or attempting to flee – this 4v1 fear festival takes the fight directly to the forces of evil, hacking enemies in half and blowing them to pieces.
In 1981, Sam Raimi’s The Evil Dead made a grisly splash onto the horror scene, featuring what’s become an almost formulaic setup: Five unfortunate friends head out to a cabin in the woods for a good time, and then, spoiler alert, good times are not had.

        <updated>2022-05-12T21:11:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MultiVersus, the upcoming platform fighting game bringing together the WB brands under one brawl-for-all, has finally had its first official look at gameplay with a Pros vs. Devs exhibition. In the 18-minute video, two professional fighting game players, NAKAT and VoiD, square off against developers from Player First Games, director Tony Huynh and principal developer Daniel Kraft, in a 2v2 competition.
Feast your eyes on the video above to see what actual matches of MultiVersus look like in the format the game was built around: two-on-two team battles. KATAT and VoiD are top competitors in MultiVersus' very early testing, coming in the top spot of a closed alpha team tournament, so the action on-hand is fast-pasted. Only four characters are shown in the video – Tom and Jerry, Superman, Shaggy, and Wonder Woman – but there's plenty to learn about how each character plays if you look closely. We also get a look at the U.I. used in fights, with the numbers representing damage taken on each player always showing directly below that character's model. It took me a little bit to get used to the change over the classic Smash Bros. U.I., but I get how this can be more readable at a glance.
Along with this first look at MultiVersus gameplay, Warner Bros. Games and Player First Games have announced a 32-team tournament that's set to take place at Evo in August. The prize pool for the event is set at $100,000, laying down the challenge for potentially big payouts for those who place high in the competition. 
MultiVersus has had a few smaller closed alpha tests but will be moving into another testing phase starting on May 19. If you're interested in a chance to throw hands with the iconic slate of Warner Bros. characters, you can sign up for a chance to play in the 9-day event on the game's website. MultiVersus does not have a release date yet but targets PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC as a free-to-play product with cross-play and cross-progression.]]></summary>

EA Motive seem to be taking advantage of that by releasing lots of behind-the-scenes, in-development videos and streams of their work on the Dead Space remake. Then, occasionally in those streams, they offer some news. Back in March, they let it be known during a deep dive into the remake's audio that the game would release in early 2023. Now, during a livestream about the game's art, they've announced the specific release date: January 27th, 2023.

As for why, Bethesda kept it simple: both teams need more time to make the games the best they can be. And while my initial reaction was sadness – like many, I was very excited to check out both this year – I feel a bit of relief.
No, I’m not going to mention that Shigeru Miyamoto quote here, as I’m sure you’ve heard it plenty of times (it’s true, though!), but I will say that this delay means a lot for Bethesda. In fact, I think Bethesda’s Starfield delay is key to its new-gen success.

There’s no denying that Naoki Yoshida is a massively popular and important figure to the Final Fantasy franchise. When the series hit a low point, Yoshida helped turn its tide, most notably helping transform Final Fantasy XIV after its disastrous launch into one of the most successful and revered MMORPGs of this generation. Nearly a decade later, he’s still finding ways to keep fans engaged with the content and returning for top-tier expansions like Endwalker. This consistency hasn’t gone unnoticed. Just this year, XIV received awards from SXSW, DICE, The Game Awards, and Metacritic in big categories, such as video game of the year (SXSW) and b…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motive and EA have revealed that the upcoming Dead Space Remake will be released at the start of next year.
More specifically, the from-the-ground-up remake of the 2008 sci-fi survival horror classic will be released on January 27, 2023. Some of the Motive team revealed this in a new livestream that aired today. Back in March, the team showcased some new gameplay in a livestream focused on the remake’s audio development and today’s stream was all about the visuals of Dead Space. Right at the end of this stream, the team shared the official January release date alongside new gameplay. 
You can check out the gameplay segment in the livestream below at the 1:18:23 mark: 


Here are some screenshots we captured from the stream if you can't yet watch the video: 

According to Motive, this gameplay is technically pre-alpha but the team said the game’s visual and environmental team worked hard to elevate this to a state they’d consider greater than pre-alpha. In fact, Motive said this is closer to the level of quality that the studio says players should expect for the entire game. 
“[It’s] not ready to ship, but it’s getting closer,” one of them remarked during the segment before another revealed the team recently completed its first full walkthrough of the remake. 
As for when we’ll see Dead Space again, Motive said it anticipates doing a gameplay-focused reveal or livestream in October, closer to Halloween. That’s perfect timing because it’s just a few months before its January 27, 2023 release date. While waiting for this gameplay reveal, be sure to check out the gameplay look shown back in March.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment has released an Alan Wake Anniversary video in honor of 12 years of Alan Wake, and in it, the studio showcases some new Alan Wake 2 concept art and more. 
More specifically, Remedy’s new update includes four new pieces of Alan Wake 2 concept art and news that Alan Wake Remastered is coming to Switch this fall. There's also an update on the Alan Wake TV show first announced in 2018 (we can’t believe it’s still happening, either). As far as the new concept art goes, it’s exactly what you’d expect: moody, dark, and subtle in terms of what it reveals about Alan Wake 2. The art looks great, though! You can check it out in the slideshow below:
Moving on to what the team has to say about Alan Wake 2, here’s what Remedy's creative director Sam Lake shared:
You can check out the development update for yourself below: 


Elsewhere in the video, Remedy reveals that Alan Wake Remastered, which hit PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC last year, is coming to Switch this fall. It will be a digital-only release on Switch, and it runs natively on the console – it’s not a cloud version like Remedy’s Control is on the platform. 
Remedy also revealed that its Alan Wake TV adaptation, which was announced four years ago, is still a real thing and very much happening. In fact, the studio has found a home for the series: AMC. You likely know of AMC as the home of The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, and Better Call Saul, and now, AMC Networks has purchased the rights to this Alan Wake adaptation. Remedy says there’s still a lot to go for the series to become a reality, though, so don’t expect to watch an episode of it anytime soon. 
While waiting to learn more about Remedy’s Alan Wake series, read Game Informer’s Alan Wake Remastered review and then check out the reveal of Alan Wake 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While 2022 started strong with a string of spectacular releases, the warmer months have begun to cool, with most AAA experiences waiting until fall or 2023 to finally release. Don't despair, as this is the perfect time to brush up on your backlog and catch up before some of the industry's biggest sequels come to your favorite home console. In that spirit, we're headed back to 2018's God of War on this edition of GI Live to get reacquainted with Kratos and Atreus ahead of Ragnarok's 2022 release date (fingers crossed).
Watch on Twitch!
Join your hosts, Marcus Stewart and Alex Stadnik, as they return to the Norse world of gods and monsters live on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT. We'll be playing the first two hours of the game, letting you know why it's one of our favorites of the last few years, and discussing where we think the next game is going (spoilers: Norse mythology is wild).
If you need a reminder of God of War's greatness, be sure to check out our review, where we said:
Years ago, Kratos killed the deities of Mount Olympus in a gory rampage. Now, in the Norse realm, he has remade himself into a different kind of god. He is quieter and more deliberate, affected by his history but not constrained by it. Kratos' reinvention serves as a narrative hook, but it also parallels the series' evolution as a whole; where God of War once relied on bombast and bloodlust, now it leaves space for strategy and nuance. It still has superb action and plenty of jaw-dropping moments, but it supports them with a new level of depth and maturity. God of War learns from its past while clearing an exciting path for the future, and emerges as one of the best games of this generation.

        <updated>2022-05-12T16:18:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix released the first official teaser for its upcoming Resident Evil series, which hits the subscription service on July 14, and in it, Umbrella is hiding something. Fortunately, we know exactly what it is: there’s a hidden Easter egg that leads to a second, more gruesome zombie-filled trailer within the initial one. 
The first teaser, released publicly by Netflix, is pretty by-the-books. It tees up the show’s premise and showcases the main protagonists beginning a new life in New Raccoon City in 2022. Then it quickly transitions to 2036, at which point, much of the world seems overrun with zombies. There are a few of the video game’s most famous zombies to be found in the first teaser, but the second teaser is sure to give fans more of what they’re looking for: terror, zombie dogs, lickers, and more. 
Check out the first teaser below, and then we’ll show you how to get to the second teaser: 


You might have caught it yourself, but just in case you didn’t, at the 24-second mark in the first teaser, a URL appears on-screen: umbrellaisjoy.com.
If you head there, it takes you to a mock-up of what an Umbrella pharmaceutical website might look like. However, after a few seconds, it transitions into a Netflix Resident Evil site, at which point you should see the second teaser embedded. 
This second teaser, in our opinion, is significantly better than the first, at least in terms of bringing the scares and horror we want out of anything related to Resident Evil. Check it out for yourself below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You could fairly think of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Ti as a big, stump-necked brute of a graphics card. What better characterisation for the latest tippity-top-of-the-line GPU from Nvidia, who’ve already produced the best graphics card for 4K in the RTX 3080? But rather than be overwhelmed by its power, I personally feel more like the RTX 3090 Ti is trying to trick, tempt and seduce me, Old Testament-style. “Recommend meeeee” it whispers, coasting through another maximum settings benchmark. “Tell evvvvvvveryone these frame rates are totally worth £1879.”


But I can’t. Sorry. While I am a sucker for go-faster gear, the RTX 3090 Ti is just too far of a stretch, with its sometimes imperceptible performance differences to the £1399 RTX 3090 and a tendency towards impractically gigantic partner card models.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Codemasters Cheshire has been absorbed by Criterion Games to develop new Need For Speed games. 
EA announced in March of 2021 that it was delaying its next Need For Speed game out of 2021 and into 2022 so that Criterion could instead focus on development of Battlefield 2042 alongside DICE. Then, earlier this week, EA confirmed in its financial results that it was expecting to release a new Need For Speed this year while also revealing that it has four unknown games set to release between January 2023 and March 2023. Now, we have an update regarding the future of the franchise. 
We can confirm Criterion Games and the development team at Codemasters Cheshire are officially coming together to create the future of @NeedforSpeed, forming one Criterion studio with two location hubs. [1/3]
May 12, 2022
Now, as you can see in the tweets above, Codemasters goes just short of saying it and Criterion are working on the Need For Speed expected to release this year. It wouldn’t be surprising if this new studio team-up were doing just that, but as it stands in these tweets, it seems the merged studio is looking ahead to the future of the Need For Speed franchise. 
Personally, I hope that future includes a return to the Underground series or maybe even just a remaster of the first Underground – whatever it takes to listen to Lil Jon’s "Get Low" again while driving around a neon-lit, nighttime city, to be honest.

Inspired by Optimus Prime's G1 cartoon roots, this set consists of 1,508 pieces and retails for $169.99. The level of detail in Optimus' robot form is spot on, but more impressive yet, the 19 points of articulation allow for this build to transform into vehicle form, without having to disassemble it.

Optimus' chest can open up to store the Matrix of Leadership. He also comes equipped with accessories that you build, like his blaster, an energon cube, and an energy axe that you can swap with his hand. The set will be on store shelves on June 1. No word was given if this will just be a one-off with the Transformers license, or if more robots in disguise will be on the way.

Please don't let this put you off, though, because we do talk about some bloody well good games.
The times being what they are, though, results in us having a long discussion of patter theft, because some dreadful American (we assume) stole the "It's me, Blorko!" tweet and then just did a much worse version of it. Hang your head in shame, whoever you are. I also went to a first communion party and ate a lot of cake, and had a run in with a very charismatic toddler who may or may not be evil.

Konami is not the company it used to be, depending on who you ask. It's always had a hand in pachinko machines and mobile releases. It also had a heavy hand in standard video game releases with franchises such as Metal Gear Solid, Castlevania, etc. Konami isn’t too concerned with the latter these days. However, it is releasing the highly-anticipated TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection this year, and its focus has continued to shift into pachinko and mobile releases. That move has paid off because mobile games like Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel, which is also available on consoles and PC, have helped Konami establish one of its most successful years of all time, as reported by Eurogamer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda have just announced they're delaying Starfield and Redfall until the first half of 2023. Bethesda's RPG space epic was originally due to arrive on November 11th 2022, with Arkane Austin's first-person vampire survival game Redfall arriving sometime this summer, but now both titles have been shifted back to an unknown time between Janauary and June next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda has delayed Starfield and Redfall to the first half of 2023. 
This news comes by way of an update posted today by the official Bethesda Twitter account which explains that both teams behind Starfield and Redfall, which are Bethesda Game Studios and Arkane Austin respectively, need more time to ensure the games are the best they can be.

May 12, 2022
Redfall was announced just last year with a planned release for sometime in the summer of this year while Starfield, which was revealed nearly four years ago, was expected to release on November 11, 2022. Now, players will have to wait roughly a year to play both.
Both will launch on Xbox Game Pass now that Bethesda is owned by Microsoft. It's unclear when we'll get our first deep-dive looks at both of these games but considering Bethesda said "soon" in its update today, there's a good chance they'll show up at the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase happening on June 12.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Leave the doormat outside long enough in Age Of Darkness: Final Stand and you might not live to see the morning. If the game’s grimdark aesthetic didn’t warn you, here’s another from me directly: this game is brutal. Be mentally prepared to start over, over and over again. The “one more round” syndrome is strong with this mashup of tower defense and strategy.


The game’s premise is simple: survive. While the standard survival mode is challenging enough to warrant hours of gameplay, Age Of Darkness’s modifiers let you amp up the carnage for a nightmarish good time. See those little creatures all over your screen like bees in an unstable hive? Now picture building a settlement over them.

The book isn't due to be published until early next year, but does this mean the Doom movie from 2005 starring Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson is technically Romero’s biopic? Did The Rock not want to wear a wig? I’m very confused.

Rogue Legacy 2 doesn’t make the biggest initial splash. In fact, at first glance, you’d be hard-pressed to see what’s changed from 2013’s Rogue Legacy to Cellar Door Games’ sequel. Despite switching from 2D sprites to a 3D rendered world, it veers close to the previous game’s aesthetic. While this lack of deviation from the original’s template proves to be a theme throughout Rogue Legacy 2, there are a lot of changes that add up to a bigger, better version of the original in almost every way.
Everything may be rendered in 3D this …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re a fan of classic Chucks, or someone who’s always wanted shoes emblazoned with your favorite pocket monster on them, then you’re in luck because Pokémon and Converse are teaming up again to do just that. 
Back in January, Converse released a line of shoes that featured Jigglypuff, Meowth, Squirtle, and more, and now, the company has announced its next line of Pokémon shoes, as reported by Kotaku. This time, the iconic Chucks highlight a single Pokémon on each pair. There are Pikachu shoes, Eevee shoes, Charizard shoes, and Mewtwo shoes, and all four pairs look amazing. 

As you can see in the images above, the shoes are designed to match the main color of each Pokémon they represent – the Pikachu shoes are bright yellow, the Eevee shoes a tan-ish brown, the Charizard pair are fire-type orange, and the Mewtwo chucks are a stylish and subdued pink-ish purple. Unfortunately, all signs point to this drop being exclusive to Japan. 
First off, they only seem to be available on Converse’s Japan website, with all four pairs expected to go live this week for roughly $75. There’s also the fact that the shoes feature the Japanese nomenclature of each Pokémon’s name, which is why the Charizard shoes say Lizardon. However, that might just be a styling decision so perhaps there’s a chance that these shoes make their way over to the West sometime in the future. For now, though, it seems you’ll need to navigate the Converse Japan site to secure a pair (or four pairs) of your own. 
In the meantime, check out the most recent Pokémon x Converse team-up and then read about the reveal of Pokémon Violet and Pokémon Scarlet after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday marks a year and a half from the start of this console generation. Many great games are available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, but there's a problem. It doesn't feel like we've seen the promised significant quality improvement with the new hardware. As an owner of both of those consoles, I'm pretty disappointed. Yesterday, we learned Gotham Knights would only release on the current generation, leaving PS4 and Xbox One behind, and you know what? I'm glad that's happening, and more studios should consider doing the same thing.
I'm very aware there are still many people out there with last-gen consoles who haven't been able to buy into the new machines due to various reasons – supply constraints and high price points being among the most common. However, as time goes on and t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The missions change. They always do. While that’s true, what’s at the heart of the Halo franchise does not change – it’s Master Chief, Cortana, some punchy guns that don’t get old, and a soundtrack that never lets up. Throughout the decades, Chief and Cortana (and buddies like Buck) have found themselves on Earth, Sanghelios, hurtling through space, aboard exploding rings, and more. But no matter the locale, we were finishing the fight – even when some of those battles were more grueling than others.
Sadly, Chief was absent from the fight the Game Informer editors partook in to rank all the Halo games from worst to best. It’s important to note that we opted to rank only the Xbox console FPS Halo games, which means you won’t find mobile, arcade, or RTS spinoffs like Halo Wars or Fireteam Ra…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Loot River, the pixely roguelike with a bit of Souls and a bit of Tetris, is all about making multiple attempts to navigate weird dungeons made of moving platforms, before dying and starting again. It's one of those games that's perfect for Game Pass, at least in its current form, but that's going to be changing in a small bit, according to a post devs Straka Studio made yesterday. Straka note they are a small team who playtested with a very small group, and didn't realise the game would be unwelcoming to newcomers. In fact, they've already made some smaller tweaks to the game that have made quite a difference, but the most notable problem players raised was the lack of any, umm, loot?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a few days ago, the expected release of Songs Of Conquest turned into the expected release of Songs Of Conquest into early access. There are times when such a pivot might dramatically change the angle you'd need to review a game from.


This isn't really one of those times, because I think I'd be recommending Songs Of Conquest overall as it is anyway. Giving it an estimated year for Lavapotion to "figure out, together with the community, what features we should prioritize" could well push me into a wholehearted endorsement, though.

It used to take up practically all of my time, and now it's sat there neglected on my PC for the better part of a year or so. Even with King Kong and Godzilla arriving in the game today, I'm still playing Fortnite over it, which says it all, really.
Why did I stop playing Warzone? Other games came along, I suppose. Maybe I'd become a bit burned out, which would only be natural considering the amount of hours I spent ducking and trucking. But I think the way it's changed has played a big part in my departure. More specifically, there's been too much change. The game looks bonkers now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Samsung 970 Evo Plus is a strong PCIe 3.0 NVMe SSD, offering excellent performance and reliability, but it costs $200 on Amazon for a new 2TB model. That's a fair bit, so we were excited to see a refurbished option for $140 at Best Buy. That's considerably cheaper than any other 2TB NVMe SSD on the market, and user reviews on Best Buy paint a rosy picture of barely-used drives whose condition can easily be checked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my biggest highlights from PAX East a couple of weeks ago was attending Shirley Curry, aka: Skyrim Grandma's panel about her roleplaying adventures in Bethesda's enormous RPG. Despite suffering a stroke just a couple of months beforehand, the 85-year-old YouTuber was on fine form during her PAX East panel, speaking to a packed out theatre of fans and viewers who have spent the better part of six years following her various playthroughs through Skyrim as a multitude of different characters. She talked briefly about her writing and character creation process for her Let's Play-style videos, before spending a whopping 45 minutes answering questions from the audience. These covered everything from her favourite things in Skyrim to her favourite, real-life candy, and also included a surprising number of horror game recommendations. In her own words, she loves stuff that's "weird and creepy", and has recently been looking for something new to play. "I’d really like to play a dark, scary game," she said, and the audience were only too happy to oblige. 
It was a truly wonderful way to spend a Saturday afternoon, and as soon as it was over, both Liam and I knew it was too good not to share. Here's a written transcript of the entire audience Q&A in full, plus a summary of her opening speech, for your reading pleasure.

These latest swings at Nvidia and their best graphics cards are ostensibly available from today, though third-party retail listings are currently hard to find, and AMD’s own store only lists the RX 6750 and RX 6950 XT... which are both sold out.

“They’re all talking over each other and nothing’s getting done and it’s spinning into chaos,” says Pusateri, a VP for Creative Technology who goes by Dunk Dinkle in-game. “Why can’t these people who are being paid so much money behave as well as these people who get paid nothing?”

Well, we found the lone warrior keeping Babylon's Fall alive, and sat down to have a chinwag with him about the appeal of the game, and exactly what they were up to when they found themselves the only living inhabitant in its Tower of Babel.

Originally conceived as a Kickstarter stretch goal for Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes, the next JRPG from Suikoden creator Yoshitaka Murayama, this smaller, more action-focused RPG has become both an official prequel to Hundred Heroes and a kind of intermediate stop-gap designed to tide players over until the main event next year. Focusing on the back stories of just a handful of the titular hundred you'll be meeting in Rabbit & Bear Studios' spiritual successor to Suikoden (the first of which memorably had a whopping 108 recruitable party members), Rising has the air of almost required reading for players eager to return to the lavish, retro worlds Murayama built his name on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTX 3080 12GB is a little-known variant of the RTX 3080 released late last year. As well as coming with the same memory subsystem as the RTX 3080 Ti - 12GB of GDDR6X attached to a 384-bit interface - it's also faster than the vanilla 3080, with more CUDA and RT cores. 
That performance normally comes at a steep premium, but today an MSI Ventus 3X RTX 3080 12GB model is going for a low price over at Newegg. They're asking $810 for the graphics card after a $30 rebate, some $450 below the GPU's ludicrously high MSRP. That makes this model actually cheaper than almost all RTX 3080 10GB cards on the market, and a worthy deal for our hallowed deal archives.

“Yes, because heat” is probably the answer, as when you’ve got as many processor cores as the RTX 3090 Ti, running at such high clock speeds as the RTX 3090 Ti, and with as much memory as the RTX 3090 Ti, it’s a bad idea to try building an RTX 3090 Ti that’s the size of a postage stamp. But the best graphics cards aren’t huge as a rule, and when it’s got to the point where new GPUs can’t easily fit into a standard mid-tower PC case, it might be time for some course correction.

You blast through procedurally generated woods and sewers, bursting enemies for cash and channeling your profits into a skill tree that's also your own psyche. It's rad, basically, but its roguelite dusting doesn't quite hit the mark when a literal nightmare is turning into a metaphorical one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The stylish, retro-futurist trappings of strategic roguelike RFM made it one of the most eye-catching demos of last autumn's Steam Next Fest. Since then, though, we haven't heard much about it - until now. Developers Bromio have finally broken cover again with RFM, giving it a new name and offering up a brand-new demo for everyone to play as it heads to Kickstarter to help push its development over the finishing line. Now known as Remnants Of The Rift, I've been putting this toe-tapping roguelike through its paces.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Salt And Sacrifice is a 2D metroidvania hunt-a-thon that casts you as a condemned prisoner in an imperiled kingdom. Magic is corrupting the land, giving rise to monstrous creatures and ravenous undead, and the source of all of this destruction, Mages, must be hunted and their hearts devoured if the Kingdom is to survive. Like Ska Studios’s previous outing, the game features difficult combat, extensive equipment options, and hulking bosses to slay. But while the scale has increased and the combat and visuals are as slick as ever, there are some growing pains that only just manage to hold the game back from its full potential.
Upon booting the game up, it’s immediately clear that you’re in for a visual treat.The design and detail are just ever so lovely: from the way firelight gives a soft glow to its surroundings in the twilight, to how fog wafts lazily over cobble stairways in a musty dungeon, it’s all just so utterly gorgeous to look at. Ska Studios have always had a recognizable art style – imposing architecture and grungy moppets – but it’s plain to see here that they’ve upped their game in the best possible way. According to the devs, every asset was created from scratch, and that care shows in every frame.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I spent much of my childhood hunkered around the family PC using an emulator to run Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game. Years have passed since I last played, causing the vague memories to distort into a recollection that’s nothing like reality. In my head, that first arcade game captured the frenetic energy of the TMNT cartoons I’d watch on a Saturday morning. The reality was quite different, with the turtles awkwardly bumbling through Manhattan while occasionally smacking an enemy.
That realisation has never been more apparent than after playing the first two levels of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, a successor to those early beat ‘em up TMNT arcade games being developed by Tribute Games and published by DotEmu. It captures the aesthetic of those childhood memories and makes them a reality, which is a testament to Tribute Games’ understanding of TMNT as a brand. But it also feels far too familiar, failing to substantially innovate on the original formula.

A screenshot of the game’s PlayStation store page was posted to the Gotham Knights subreddit over the weekend by keen-eyed user SuspiciousTension19, which shows that it will support “4 network players”. Eurogamer have confirmed that the listing is accurate, too. We don't know yet whether this will also apply to PC players, of course, but it’s highly likely to be the same across all platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eve Online, the space MMO that’s so laden with consequence it’s frightening, is introducing multi-year story arcs to pull its NPC factions into the heart of the game. The finale of developer CCP’s first planned arc will launch before the end of 2022. The idea is to let capsuleers build meaningful bonds with their home empires by fighting for them in New Eden’s living universe - which has always been shaped by players, not NPCs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In theory I'm rather partial to slash-em-up crowd fighting games, but I've never got on with the big names in the genre. Your Devil May Cries and your God Of Warses are the obvious reference points for describing Ultra Age, but it doesn't really feel like them, and I don't think it's trying to either.
The basic idea is that you're stranded on a jungle planet full of industrial ruins, and have to fight through robots and huge animals in small groups, switching between several (kinda samey) swords as needed. It's not really doing anything spectacular, but it's enough of its own thing to feel like more than just a budget God Of Cries.

In fact, I'm lagging several years behind and still trying to get cutlery out of the drawer in my flat share in London four years ago. Yesterday I walked straight into the sofa for no earthly reason.

Once, after years of unknowingly peeling back the skin of your mousepad's gel wrist rest, your forearm finally and suddenly cut deep, splitting the subcutaneous barrier and gouging into the innards, tearing out chunks and spraying you with viscera. Not so much anymore. The wound is still there, it still festers, your wrist still grates, but over time, you notice it less.

We have a bunch of videos in the pipeline that I can’t wait to share with you (including a fun piece exploring PAX staple collectible Pinny Arcade) but for now I think it’s about time we spoke about one of the best bits of in-person shows: the booths.


Now, we already highlighted most of the booths at PAX East in our show floor tour that we published during the event itself, but we wanted to focus on some of our favourites in a little more detail. Come and see them (and their carpets) in all their glory below. I'm not kidding about the carpets. They were astounding.

The video was originally captured for Noclip’s 2020 documentary about the history of Arkane, the studio behind the much beloved Deathloop and Dishonored series. Ravenholm did feature, albeit briefly, in Noclip's original documentary, but now Noclip producer Danny O’Dwyer has decided it's time to show off a bit more of it, interspersing his gameplay footage with some critical context for what’s going on and the ideas behind it.

Games that are best enjoyed with a notepad often involve some mystery, or require drawing strange symbols or shapes that can't be quickly or easily replicated on your PC. They might involve hurried arithmetic, amateurish maps, doodled floorplans, scatter-brained lists. In these cases it transpires that the giant machine whirring three inches from your nose just won't cut it. Sometimes you gotta use a pencil. Here are the 9 best games to play with a notepad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Razer Naga Trinity is a rather brilliant mouse for MMO gamers, or anyone really that likes or needs to have plenty of buttons right under their thumb. The Naga Trinity's key feature is that it comes with three interchangeable side panels, each with a different amount of layout of buttons - so you can have a regular two-button side layout for FPS titles, a seven-button layout for more complex games (MOBAs?) and a 12-button calculator-style layout when things get properly exciting (MMOs). Or you can just figure out which one is your favourite, and keep it on forever more. 
The Naga Trinity's UK RRP is £110, but it normally goes for about £70 or £80. Today, it's down to £55 - a nice discount!

For its street price of £110, you get a compact yet easy to build in design with a choice of mesh or glass side panels, plus a pair of low profile 120mm fans. Today however, you can pick up this brilliant little case for £76 in black or white, or £85 to £96 for colours like orange, purple, teal and pink. Either way you slice it, this is an incredible case for the money - and I should know, I've got two of them in my room right now.
