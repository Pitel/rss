Welcome to another edition of What Are You Playing? where we all get to chat about our gaming plans for the weekend!
Before we get into that good stuff though, let's take a look at what went down in Nintendo land this week. We were treated to the release of two new games in the NSO GBA library as Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age joined the service. We also got excited to see that Ace Combat 7 will be flying over to Switch, which cheered us up following the news that GAME will be ending its trade-in programme.

When weather warnings popped up this week, I tracked forecasts and cloud movements for hours before booking a day off work to chase potential snow. When I woke up, it looked bad. Forecasts had turned. Many areas expected to get dusted went untouched. But me, after six hours of walking over thin, old snow, the good stuff finally started to fall as I entered a wood and approached a waterfall. Pretty magic, really. It was so cold that snow settled on my shoulders and my hair froze. Perfect. That's what I craved. Anyway, what are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on!

Early last year, there was a rumour going around about LEGO working on a Legend of Zelda 'Deku Tree' set. Now, in an update, the well-known Lego leaker and Instagram user '1414falconfan' is claiming the set will arrive this September and will contain 2,500 pieces.
The rumour stems from a marketing survey about several future LEGO projects. The original story also suggested this same set could be a 2-in-1 build based on the tree's appearance in Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild.

The 'Pokémon-with-guns' game Palworld launched on Xbox, PC and Game Pass yesterday and while it's already surpassed one million sales, it's also making headlines for certain other reasons...
As highlighted by IGN, some Pokémon fans have taken to social media and other parts of the internet to share the "similarities" between Palworld monster designs and Nintendo's famous franchise, claiming it's "not a coincidence" and accusing certain 'Pals' of being blatant "rip-off" of Pokémon designs.

Sol-Deace has something of a confusing history. It was originally released in Japan in 1990 on the Sharp X68000 where it was called Sol-Feace. It would then be ported to the Sega CD in 1991, but when it arrived on a Genesis/Mega Drive cartridge in 1992, it was named Sol-Deace. I don't know why the name changed, but the story uses Feace and Deace as surnames, which maybe they are. Weird words to me, so I'm not sure why they chose them. If I had to guess, I’d say the words probably sound cool to the Japanese ear. However, my only basis for that is the theory that I have no other explanation.

Walmart are doing a good deal on a Hyper Tough 77-piece screwdriver set, which is $10 versus its regular $16 - a good deal for a set that includes everything you'd need for PC building and maintenance and has attracted a 4.5/5.0 star average after 245 reviews.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The very first Megami Tensei game, Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei, finally has a full translation, thanks to some intrepid fans. You might be saying, “but it already has one,” but this isn’t the one you’re thinking of. This is the game created in 1987 for Japanese home computers by Telenet.


The Megami Tensei series is best known as a series of games by Atlus, which would eventually expand to Shin Megami Tensei, which includes the Persona series. The series actually began being based on a series of novels by Aya Nishitani before going off in an entirely different direction.


But before Atlus stepped in, Telenet was the first developer to create a video game adaptation. This one was for the Japanese home computers, and it was released a scant few months before Atlus released the Famicom game that would start their long-running series. Confusingly, both are called Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei. While Atlus’ version was a first-person dungeon crawler, Telenet opted for more of a top-down action RPG. Though, it's still a dungeon crawler, make no mistake.


While Telenet’s take on the series was vastly overshadowed by Atlus, it’s still a pretty neat historical curiosity, if nothing else.


The English translation of the MSX version comes to us from Kaisaan and other collaborators. You can find the patch here at their GitHub.

GDC's annual State of the Game Industry report has been released in the past 24 hours, and it's not pretty reading. 2023 was a pretty awful year for game developers, with mass industry layoffs and studio closures — from Vanpool, Volition Studios, Brace Yourself Games, Crystal Dynamics, Free Radical, and more — GDC's latest report finds that a staggering one-third of video game developers have been impacted by layoffs in some way (via Push Square).
In fact, it's just over one-third. 35% of developers "aid they’ve been impacted by layoffs—either by having some layoffs take place within their team or company or by being laid off themselves." The biggest number of layoffs come from the ever-vital quality assurance teams — you know, the people who make sure the games we're playing work. GDC found that 22% of QA devs were laid off in 2023. Business and finance, on the other hand, only suffered 2% of layoffs.

With the power of time travel - and a flash-looking launch trailer - on its side, the indie hopeful certainly looks set to put up a decent fight when it exits Early Access in just over a month.

During our chat, we inquired about the original Final Fantasy 7's rumored N64 version, Zack's importance in the remake, whether mainline entries will ever return to Nintendo consoles, and 126 other burning questions. Oh, and we also try to guess the next game's subtitle. My money is on "Reloaded."

        <updated>2024-01-19T19:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a game that's been repeatedly described as "Pokémon with machineguns", the first thing that strikes me about Palworld is just how un-Pokémon-like it actually is. To its credit, it does do quite a good Pokémon Legends: Arceus impression when you first step out on its big, Breath Of The Wild-style hilltop and take in the open world vista of its monster-stuffed starting continent. But if the opening moments of washing up on the island in nothing but your very scantily clad undies hadn't already given it away (seriously, why do shipwrecks always destroy the clothes you had on, but not your smalls underneath?), then the ream of tutorial prompts about punching trees to get more wood, building bases, putting pals to work on said bases, and the endless parade of crafting technologies you'll need to unlock to actually do anything on this godforsaken rock will quickly pull the wool clear away from your hopeful little face. 
For underneath the cute round eyes of its cover stars, Palworld is really a survival game wearing the dead skin suits of Game Freak's catch 'em all monster friends. In a lot of cases, those skin suits are quite literal, such are the blatant palette swaps and so-close-to-copyright-infringement-I-can't-believe-Nintendo's-lawyers-haven't-shut-this-down-years-ago rip-off creatures on display here. For that reason alone, Palworld can feel about as soulless and cynical as it comes. But that's not the worst of it. Even aside from all the survival gubbins, base building and sweatshop automation practices shoved down your throat, Palworld is just an awful example of monster-catching games in general. If it's a Pokémon game on PC you're after, go and play Cassette Beasts. Go and play Coromon, TemTem, or Monster Sanctuary. Anything but this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I worked on my review for Another Code: Recollection, one concern I kept coming across for the then-upcoming title was whether or not anyone from the original developer, Cing, was involved in the project.


It’s understandable. Cing was a niche but celebrated developer, having been behind Hotel Dusk and Little King Story. If you were a fan of the Another Code series, you probably want the folks behind it to be working on it. What would the games mean to anyone else? However, Cing went bankrupt in 2010, and the staff were scattered to the wind. Nintendo, for their part, gave no indication that any of the original creators were working on the remakes of their games.


At the time of my review, I actually wasn’t allowed to talk about the credits. But now that restriction has passed, and I …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It turns out that the idea of "Pokémon with guns" appears to be pretty popular. Pocket Pair, the developers behind Palworld, have announced that their fledgling title is already selling incredibly well. 


How well, you ask? Well, the team revealed that sales for the newly released game have already crossed the million copies sold mark - and that was in just eight hours. 




Described by the development team as a "monster-catching, survival and crafting game", Palworld just launched yesterday on Steam Early Access and Xbox Game Preview. It's also available for Xbox Game Pass, though the subscription service isn't typically accounted for in sales figures. 


Momentum was strong for Palworld leading up to its release. The night before launch, the game was ranked third on Steam's Wishlist page. On top of that, the hodgepodge project is currently trending on X at the time of this article being published. 


I describe Palworld as a hodgepodge project because it seems to borrow lots of different ideas from other notable games. In his recent impressions of the Early Access build, Destructoid's Eric Van Allen noted that on top of there being similarities to the Pokémon series, there are also elements of Breath of the Wild, Rust, Valheim, and Monster Hunter incorporated throughout too.


Again, Palworld will remain in an Early Access/Game Preview build for at least a year according to its Steam page. There are plenty of additions and changes that Pocket Pair plans to implement in the coming months. Amongst them will be new monsters to catch, new areas and dungeons to explore, fresh buildings and items for survival, and more. The development team also noted that they "are also considering incorporating entirely new game systems based on player feedback and ideas."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It always breaks my heart a bit when a game I've been looking forward to for a while absolutely biffs it on arrival. Having quite enjoyed Golf Club Wasteland a few years ago (now called Golf Club Nostalgia for, I don't know, reasons), I was quite pumped when developers Demagog Studios announced not one, but two further games set in the same post-apocalyptic universe. The first to come out (albeit only on Netflix at the moment) was the turn-based strategy game Highwater (also a bit of a dud, based on the early Steam demo I played last year), but it's the second game, The Cub (out today on Steam) that has prompted this current moment of teeth-sucking sadness. 
I've been playing a bit of it over the last week, and oh man, it's trying so, so hard to be like Limbo and Inside, but just... doing quite a terrible job of it all. I was looking forward to any excuse I could get to have the soothing sounds of Golf Club's dystopian Radio Nostalgia From Mars show back in my ear drums, but alas. I simply cannot hear it over the sound of my own screams of frustration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much of the gaming world is holding its breath in anticipation of the Switch 2, or whatever Nintendo decides to call the follow-up to its hybrid console. For now, we know nothing about it, but it seems developers are already working on titles for the mystery machine (not to be confused with the van from Scooby-Doo).


According to the latest GDC State of the Game Industry survey (as spotted by VGC), about 8% of development teams are currently developing a project for the Switch successor. Considering around over 3,000 developers were asked, this equates to quite a few people saying they're working on something for the Switch successor.




On top of this, when asked which platforms people in the industry were most interested in as developers, 32% said the Nintendo Switch successor. This is above the Xbox Series X|S and the current-gen Switch, but just behind the PS5, which 41% are still interested in.


More are working on Switch 2 games than Amazon Luna


We've been getting hints here and there about the elusive system. Last year, it was rumored that the next Nintendo Switch had been demoed at Gamescom 2023, exclusively for developers.


Given what we've seen in the GDC report, it seems likely that the console must be in the works at this point. The Switch has been out since 2017 and even with the OLED edition launching in 2021, it feels like it's been coming to the end of its lifecycle for some time now.


Those who are said to be working on Switch 2 games are almost certainly being asked to keep mum about it. But with a decent number of dev teams saying they are involved in projects for the as-yet-to-be-announced Nintendo console, we may hopefully start to hear word about it soon. Hope springs eternal, and all that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I disliked turn-based RPG Kingsvein at first. Quite a bit, in fact. An earlier version of this review would have been a very negative on, filled mostly with complaints and annoyances about opaque and frustrating systems, most of which I've since got over as the intent behind its design has become more clear.
It could definitely explain some things better, and its inscrutably tiny graphics remain a minor nuisance. But it's grown on me a lot, and though it may not be quite the kind of turn-based RPG I get on with best, it's an enjoyable one with a refreshing lack of bloat and timewasting, and with a class and combat system that will be pure catnip to a particular kind of player.

Nintendo is in the habit of updating Splatoon 3's battle stages every now and then. Why wouldn't it be? However, Splatoon is a series drenched in lore, so whenever a stage is suddenly missing from the daily rotation, there has to be a reason for it. And so, once again, we are going to see a temporary closure next week.
Hearing the voices of many discontented inkers, Mincemeat Metalworks is the next stage getting some hotly-anticipated TLC. The map will be out of bounds from 4pm PT on 21st January to 6pm PT on 23rd January for "inventory and on-site inspection," according to the @SplatoonNA Twitter account (aka, there's an update coming).

That doesn't make him any less brutal, though, and you can watch him clear a subway car full of Mad Gear gang members in the cinematic trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Payday 3 was one of those games that was briefly hyped up, but then sank back down once it had been released. Much of that came from the issues that plagued the heist FPS threequel, but it seems developer Starbreeze is determined to make things right.


In a recent post on the Payday 3 website, the studio said it understands that "many of you aren’t satisfied with the game the way it is in its current state." Going forward, then, a "strike team of veteran developers" has been put together, formed from various in-house departments.




The idea, it seems, is to tackle some of the game's biggest problems head-on with a dedicated bunch of developers. Currently, the team is "creating a plan" and "deciding what will shape the game into the heisting experience you expect."


I can hear the A-Team music in my head


Payday 3's insistence that players must be always online even when playing solo resulted in a lot of negative feedback from the community. The developer also released DLC – Syntax Error – just a few weeks after the main game was released.


Given that what fans really want is for the main story they paid full price for to be in working condition, asking for additional money for new content could easily be seen as a bit of an insult.


As such, the new Payday installment is currently showing as "Mostly Negative" for recent Steam reviews, with "Mixed" overall. Starbreeze says it will be revealing further details about plans for updates and improvements sometime in February.

Yes, it's been nearly two years since that game came out, but 2023's Future Redeemed DLC helped keep it fresh in our minds. Well, the DLC and the aforementioned amiibo drop, of course. Those two amiibo come with special outfits, which can be unlocked instantly by scanning the figures in: we have a full guide here if you need help.


Can you get the Noah and Mio amiibo rewards without the amiibo figures?


Note that you can acquire the amiibo outfits through other means, but it's not going to be easy, unless you have an endgame save file handy. Requirements range from defeating a superboss (Seraphic Ceratinia) to spending several hundred Nopon Coins at the Nopon Coin X-change at the Sage's Domicile.


You can find the full patch notes below.


Latest update: Ver. 2.2.0 (Released January 18, 2024) [Full notes]


Additional Functionality



Now compatible with “Noah” and “Mio” amiibo. By scanning the amiibo in “System” > “amiibo” in the Menu Screen, you will be able to use the following special clothing items.

Noah amiiboYou can acquire the “N’s Consul Suit” outfit for Noah. You can also get variations without Noah, Lanz, or Euni’s jacket.


Mio amiiboYou can acquire the “M’s Consul Suit” outfit for Mio. You can also get variations without Mio, Sena, or Taion’s jacket.




Fulfill certain conditions and talk to the NPC Miibomii at Llyn Nyddwr Camp in the Fornis region to receive rewards identical to what would be received with the Noah or Mio amiibo.

Ahead of the DLC's postponed release, however, Bungie managed to eke out some victories, such as the Guardian re-customization feature.


Indeed, players will finally get the option to rebuild their Guardians in Destiny 2 sometime before the release of The Final Shape, and what's particularly impressive is that it won't cost a penny. Broadly infamous for its nickel-and-diming of players that's only gotten more aggressive over time, Destiny 2 isn't shy about monetizing a variety of things. Armor transmogrification, for example, comes with a built-in seasonal limit that can only be bypassed by paying, so the obvious expectation was that t…]]></summary>

Not that any of them could decide how to actually pronounce WASD when it came to talking about them on last night's Developer Update stream, though, as there were competing cries of "was-dee", "wased" and "double-you-ey-es-dee" all over the shop as they debated this clearly very "controversial topic" live on air. Read on for more details about what they're hoping to achieve with WASD controls in the game, but more importantly: how do you pronounce WASD? Let's get a poll up asap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I keep hitting refresh on the SteamDB page of Palworld. Each time I do, the numbers keep shooting up. Despite the fact that Pocketpick's new game has only come out today – in Early Access as well – the numbers suggest it's going to be a big hit.


When the third-party Steam tracking website posted on Twitter/X earlier, it said Palworld had already reached over 110,000 concurrent players. At the time of writing, that number has gone up to 329,563.




The Top Sellers list on Steam shows it's shot to the number two position (behind the Steam Deck, natch). While this isn't too unusual for a brand-new game that's got some hype behind it, it could well be a sign of things to come for the cute, Pokemon-inspired survival game.


What exactly is Palworld?


If you haven't heard of or are familiar with Palworld yet, don't worry. I wasn't until literally two days ago. If you want a nice breakdown of what the game's like and how it plays, a couple of our writers took a quick look at it.


The Steam page has this to say about it:



Fight, farm, build and work alongside mysterious creatures called "Pals" in this completely new multiplayer, open world survival and crafting game!




It has a little bit of everything, from what I can tell. Well, maybe not everything, but certainly enough for most gamers to get into. I must admit, I'm quietly curious myself. To such an extent that I'm currently downloading it through Xbox Game Pass. May as well, right?

For example, consider this year's Festival of the Lost, which once again allows players to vote on their favorite armor ahead of time.


Last year's Festival of the Lost featured some interesting novelties and one of the most coveted Mementos in the game, and while these features are currently expected to return this year, the spooky bug-themed armor voting will not. Instead, this year's vote is down to two different types of wizards, with each of the game's Classes getting their own spellcaster armor to splurge on.

Being the most complex game on Videoway, it had its fans, and they went to work remaking it by reverse engineering a recorded playthrough of it. I don’t have any firsthand insight on the Videoway, so I’ll again direct you to Hardcore Gaming 101’s write-up. Fans first recreated Temporel Inc. in Flash, and then Collectorvision created an NES port, which was released a few years ago on a cartridge by Limited Run Games under the name of Dead Tomb.

Originally due to come out on Wednesday, Bethesda released a major patch for Starfield to Steam Beta yesterday, which aims to fix a number of bugs. If you take a look at the official website, you'll see exactly what version 1.9.47.0 comes with.




A quick scroll down the list shows there's been a boatload of fixes to the game. There's some general stuff, such as patching out corruptions to save files on PC, improvements to things like reflections and shadows, and some much-needed tweaks to quests and "random encounters."


But is it enough?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the depths of 2023's February Steam Next Fest, Roots Of Yggdrasil was one of a handful of games that really caught my attention. Not because it was another beautiful-looking deckbuilder (though that does seem to be a steadily growing niche of mine these days), or because its colourful, inkwash visuals had the air of a Norse-flavoured Okami about them (though it did also help). Rather, it was the way its roguelike foundations meshed with its freeform, but still very goal-driven turn-based building systems, giving you drive and purpose in your construction choices, while also being light and chill, with just the right amount of existential threat nipping at your heels.
It struck me that if, say, my best puzzle strategy bud Dorfromantik was ever turned into a roguelike, this is probably a good approximation of what it would look and feel like, which is, frankly, yep, I'd like that game right now, please. Happily, with Roots Of Yggdrasil now approaching its early access launch on January 24th, I'm very happy to report that it's come on leaps and bounds since that Next Fest demo. This is already a very moreish and polished building game, and I've been struggling to tear myself away from it as I guide my longboat of magic Vikings away from their impending Ragnarok.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last summer, Sky TV obtained a somewhat mysterious pirate IPTV blocking injunction at the High Court in London. In the months up to November 2023, that led to UK ISPs blocking at least 400 IPTV domains/subdomains, potentially many more. Available data today suggests a perpetual war of attrition on an unprecedented scale. In the last four weeks alone, Sky blocked almost 4,200 IPTV service URLs; the pirates' response is simple: churn out more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The revival of this long-dormant franchise moves into the gear-and-power-gated family of games colloquially termed Metroidvanias, thanks to its similarity to early classics like Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. It’s a genre that has been gaining traction in recent years, but Ubisoft’s return to the Prince of Persia franchise is one of the best we’ve seen in a long time. It's even managed to make a spot for itself on our list of the Best Metroidvania Games you should make a point to play. 
The Lost Crown is also notable for the way it advances this game style with novel ideas and mechanics. While not everything on this list is brand new, these features combine to make Ubisoft’s new adventure one of the most rewarding, approachable, and satisfying releases in the genre, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether you call them Metroid-likes, exploration-based action platformers, big map adventures, or simply Metroidvanias, this sub-genre has exploded in popularity. What was once a criminally underused design template has become one of the most commonly used formats in games. That’s especially true for indie developers, who seem more than happy to make up for prolonged droughts between actual Metroid and Castlevania titles by concocting their own unique spins on the style. While some 3D games have adopted the formula to success (see: Batman: Arkham Asylum), this list will only highlight 2D-style titles for the sake of clarity. Here are 10 great modern Metroidvanias, in reverse chronological release order, that you’ll have a great time getting lost in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the ESO 2024 Global Reveal livestream, Zenimax Online gave us a look at the upcoming Elder Scrolls Online expansion, Gold Road.


The new expansion will take place just east of the Gold Coast in the Colovian Highland and West Weald regions of Cyrodiil, which was last depicted in The Elder Scrolls Oblivion. The region contains the city of Skingrad, a location that was teased in the Greymoor Expansion. The map shown off in the post-trailer discussion shows that it’s filling in a vast region just West of the PVP region of Cyrodiil.




Forgotten Prince Ithelia, the Daedric Prince of Paths, is the central antagonist of Gold Road. The deity is said to have the ability to mess with fate and destiny, so Hermaeus Mora deleted the Prince from existence. They were only really mentioned in ESO, supposedly teasing their appearance here. Normally, Zenimax just worked with the schemes of existing Daedric Princes, but this is the first time they really invented a new one.


The Chapter is also going to add Scribing, which is a take on spell crafting from the core series. Spellcrafting was initially planned as a feature for ESO’s release, but it was shelved, assumedly because of how difficult it would be to balance. I know a lot of players who are going to be excited to see it arrive in some form. Though, really, it seems more like it's just skill customization. You will need to own the Gold Road chapter to be able to use this system.


Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road will be released for PC on June 3, 2024, followed by a release for Xbox Series X|S and PS5 on June 18.

The adventure is called Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and stars Indy in his prime doing what he does best: solve puzzles, explore tombs, and pummel Nazis. Set in 1937 between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, Indy is chasing a stolen relic to solve an ancient, globe-trotting mystery.

Ryozo Tsujimoto, series producer of both Exoprimal and Monster Hunter, released a developer commentary video breaking down the collaboration of the two beast-battling titles. 




The highlight of the new content for most is likely the inclusion of Rathalos.  The wyvern is sort of the Monster Hunter mascot at this point. The monster has been in every game of the series and was even featured as a boss and assist trophy in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

Updated with the newly released Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. Enjoy!

The word 'Metroidvania' might rub some core gamers the wrong way, but it's a useful catch-all to describe a very specific type of game experience. Combining elements from both the Metroid series and Koji Igarashi-produced Castlevania titles, this broad platforming genre has you using an ever-growing skill set to open up new paths across an expansive, layered map. As you explore and find secrets throughout the environment, these games empower the player in a way that makes them extremely addictive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the Xbox Developer Direct Livestream, MachineGames showed off their upcoming Indiana Jones project, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle. Most importantly, it involves Harrison Ford('s likeness) and punching Nazis. Two awesome things.


Actually, there’s probably everything you’d expect from an Indiana Jones game. There’s a whip, torches, the Wilhelm scream, a travel montage, a female sidekick, and ancient (but still functional) puzzles. Interestingly, it’s mostly done in the first person, except when you’re doing more agile activities or looking at Harrison Ford in a cutscene.




Indiana Jones and The Great Circle takes place between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. In it, Indy witnesses the theft of an artifact from the College he works at. He follows its trail and discovers that it’s central to a deeper mystery.


MachineGames is trying to capture the look, feel, and sound of an Indiana Jones movie, and I’m convinced. I’m not sure if I mentioned this, but Harrison Ford is in it. They promise that you’ll be able to enjoy it, even if you haven’t seen the movies. That’s good because I skipped that last two.


Indiana Jones and The Great Circle is coming to Xbox Series X|S and PC later this year.

Oxide talked up its "living world," a procedurally generated map for players to create the society they want in Ara. As the developers say, it will change over time based on players' decisions. You can watch the presentation starting at the 25:00 minute mark. 


Ara's Prestige System pits players to build a nation better than opponents'. The game's score system awards points based on what kind of leader a specific player wants to be. An example, as detailed during today's live stream, is building "Triumphs," or famous buildings throughout history that give large Prestige bonuses.
Oxide is a Maryland-based studio founded in 2013 by former Firaxis developers. Its previous games include 2016's Ashes of the Singularity and Star Swarm. 
Ara: History Untold is expected to be released on PC and PC Game Pass in the fall of this year. However, Oxide plans to keep its "Insider Program" after release, implementing player feedback.]]></summary>

The action-adventure sequel will release on May 21, 2024 on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and as a Day One on Game Pass title.




That will put the sequel release just short of seven years after the release of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. Players will once again jump into the role of Senua as she attempts to overcome the barbaric and brutal raids of Vikings in a tyrannical Iceland. Like the original, Hellblade 2 will explore Senua's story in a cinematic way as she struggles to deal with psychosis which actually helps her traverse the brutal Icelandic landscape.


It's looking to be a great year for cinematic and story-driven games. Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 will add to that when it releases on May 21, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's Xbox Developer Direct had a surprise guest appearance from a third party. Square Enix cut into the stream to show off more of its upcoming Visions of Mana, and confirm a Summer 2024 release window.


The unannounced guest made its appearance directly after Obsidian and Ninja Theory's presentations, to share new details about the next entry in the Mana series. This will actually be the first entry in the series to hit Xbox consoles, so today's appearance on the stream was a bit of a surprise, to say the least.


Much of Visions of Mana looks like Square Enix building on the foundations of its Trials of Mana remake. Fully 3D action-RPG combat, with a bright, colorful look is fitting for the Mana series, after all. But the show-stealer for me was the pikul, a dog-like companion the player can ride around on.




The pikul apparently started out as something of a mix, incorporating both Yorkshire terrier and a pangolin. I love the pikul, and will protect the pikul, and prevent any harm from befalling the pikul.

New visions


Square also talked a bit about its musical score, which will have 100 songs total, and adapt as the player enters combat. It's a really cool effect to hear in practice, and I'm really intrigued to hear it play out in the overworld once the RPG is out.


It's really cool to see the Mana series get this kind of push. A decade ago, the idea of a new Mana game getting shown alongside the likes of an Indiana Jones title and Avowed would've been wild. It really does seem like Xbox is courting a wider range of third-party developers. And man, Visions of Mana is looking solid.


We'll see if the series still has that action-RPG magic when Visions of Mana arrives in Summer 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Xbox Developer Direct, Square Enix made a surprise appearance to pull back the curtains on Visions of Mana, the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Square Enix also revealed Visions of Mana will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this summer.
Executive producer Masaru Oyamada discussed the franchise's history, noting there have been 17 entries across its 30 years of existence. He also points out that what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991. 


Mana series creator Koichi Ishii also joined this segment of the show to discuss how he has supervised the team on its work and implementation of taking what were originally pixelated monsters and converting them into the 3D monsters players will fight in the game. 
Notably, Visions of Mana is the first Mana game coming to Xbox. Oyamada expressed Square Enix's excitement about this first for the series while diving deeper into its real-time action combat. This real-time action combat is what originally separated Final Fantasy Adventure from the Final Fantasy series, which was strictly turn-based at the time. 
Visions of Mana's combat continues to look great, as does its beautifully vibrant world. Unfortunately, there's still a few months to go until PlayStation, Xbox, and PC players can play it because it's due out sometime this summer. 

While waiting for its release, check out the Visions of Mana announcement trailer from The Game Awards 2023 last month.

Unlike the isometric styling of those titles, Avowed is a first-person adventure more in the vein of something like The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or The Outer Worlds.
Today’s Xbox Developer Direct offered a deeper dive into several important aspects of the game, but the standout feature was an explanation of combat, which aims to be action-oriented but still tactically complex. Players are allowed to use customizable loadouts, including selecting different weapons or other tools for each hand. We saw combinations of swords, shields, wands, and spell usage, and pistols.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox is laying out its road ahead with the Developer Direct 2024. Obsidian started the show today, sharing some new looks at Avowed as it heads for a Fall 2024 window.


Today, we got a deeper look at the first-person RPG from Obsidian Entertainment. Set in the same world as Pillars of Eternity, Eora, Avowed is a more action-oriented approach. And a decent chunk of the opening minutes of today's look covered the scrapping, from magic and swords to flintlock-style pistols. Heck, you can even wield a bunch of wands, if you want. More wands means more magic, after all.


We see some reptilian combatants wielding a breadth of equipment, including shields and ranged weapons. Obsidian says you'll be able to set loadouts for combat and swap between them, letting the player quickly swap around for whatever approach you need. It seems pretty customizable, though I'm not completely sold on it.

Part of Avowed also looks to involve some light mystery-solving. We see some segments of the player talking with various NPCs, trying to discern whether a private is telling the truth or lying, possibly even confronting him. Whatever the player chooses, consequences follow.


Fantasy lands await


We also got a look at the vistas and locales waiting in Avowed. There are lots of different biomes to explore, from forests to deserts, all falling under the general high fantasy umbrella.


As for news on a date, we just have the window of Fall 2024. It was good to see a little bit more of what Avowed has in store, though today's look didn't really hold surprises for those expecting a first-person fantasy RPG. I'm curious to see how Avowed will set itself apart when it arrives later on this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Ninja Theory appeared on Microsoft's Xbox Developer Direct stream to discuss its sequel, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II. The big news from the footage is the game finally has a release date: May 21. Microsoft also confirmed that the game will be a digital-only release.
The developer revealed it is in the final months of development and outlined some elements to expect from Hellblade II. Senua is not in as much fear of her voices as she was in the original game, but she is still a Celtic warrior who struggles with psychosis. Like the first game, Ninja Theory is working with professionals like Cambridge's Paul Fletcher to ensure Senua represents an accurate version of someone struggling with complex mental issues.


There are a number of new characters she will interact with. Some will appreciate her perspective and consider her an ally, but others will reject her and consider her an enemy. Like the original game, Hellblade II takes 10th century Iceland (which the developer visited for research), and she is fighting against Vikings who are enslaving her people. Ninja Theory is focused on making the game historically accurate but with an obvious layer of fantasy on top.
Combat has been overhauled for the sequel, with the game focusing on the fact that Senua is not a superhero. The goal of the combat is to make players feel like they barely survived each encounter, and the gameplay footage of the combat looks brutal.
Ninja Theory ended the stream saying it hopes to "craft life-changing art with game-changing tech." We will determine if the game lives up to that lofty goal on May 21.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Farmed robbery.
After getting a taste of the criminal life in Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion, the cheeky root vegetable returns in Turnip Boy Robs A Bank to, uh, rob a bank—multiple times. While the original game was a charming action-adventure title, the sequel takes inspiration from the likes of Enter the Gungeon and The Binding of Isaac to present an addictive roguelike experience with quick, simplistic gameplay loops and generous rewards to keep you coming back for more, despite some pretty severe performance issues on the Switch at launch.
For those who enjoyed Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion specifically for its jaunty spin on the classic Zelda formula, the shift over to a roguelike setup might feel a bit odd and offputting at first (and if you’re completely against the genre as a whole, then this isn’t for you). That said, its cute aesthetic and absurd cast of characters allows Turnip Boy Robs A Bank to make the transition relatively seamlessly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been hankering for a new tactical mech shooter, the first game from KEK Entertainment fits the bill. Armor Attack is in the works at a team comprised of former EA and Ubisoft devs, and it's due out sometime this year.


Armor Attack is billed as a crossplay game with PC, Mac, iOS, and Android listed as its starting platforms. A console release is planned for an as-yet-undetermined date, and you can see how it looks in action in the announcement trailer below. 




At a glance, customization is going to play a large role in the tactics at hand. Each vehicle has its own advantages and disadvantages, and you can tweak your loadout in different ways depending on the  desired playstyle. Abilities, weapons, talent systems, and other aspects will lend themselves well to certain objectives, and this combines with the different styles inherent to the three main factions. Naturally, everybody wants to rule the world, so these factions are all about trying their best to control the last remnants of a wartorn Earth. 


The key styles at play are defense, damage, and battlefield exploitation, the latter of which sounds like it might have something to do with the "game-changing mechanic" on each map. These range from changes to the overall layout to large boss enemies and the availability of vantage points that offer a competitive edge. KEK Entertainment CEO and co-founder Georgy Egorov says they want to offer the "ultimate mecha shooter experience for friends to enjoy across PC, mobile, and consoles without sacrificing caliber." We'll see how that pans out soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2022’s Front Mission 1st: Remake will be getting a free content update this year with some pretty swell new features. It’s coming sometime in 2024.


I think what will interest most people about this content update is the arrival of local multiplayer hot-seat skirmishes. I know, I know, it’s not online multiplayer, but the Front Mission series has rarely had multiplayer at all. Considering this is the remake of a 1995 SNES game, and it’s already been available for over a year, it’s sort of remarkable to see.


Beyond just multiplayer, there will be additional single-player scenarios. Surprisingly, “each carefully crafted to provide a diverse range of challenges and engaging narratives.” “Narratives,” you say? Again, that’s an interesting addition to a game that already has a sequel and has…]]></summary>

But in 2023 alone, more than 10,000 developers and people in games-adjacent industries were laid off. Plus, the unchecked rise of A.I. continued, and Unity burned developers with its controversial new game engine policies, not to name a few other not-so-great parts about 2023 – it was a great year for games but one of the worst for those who make them. 
Now, just as 2024 has begun, the Game Developers Conference has released its 12th annual State of the Game Industry report. Its data was collected from 3000 developers surveyed back in October of last year…]]></summary>

Where did the low-poly grape meme come from?


For a time after the initial release of Endwalker in December 2021, the grapes found in Labyrinthos became a source of player amusement because of their low-poly, blocky appearance. Although these grapes were soon updated, and their appearance brought more in line with the standard we know and love FFXIV for, the meme persevered.


With Patch 6.01, FFXIV developers explained that the low-poly appearance of the grapes was intended to alleviate system memory within the area, before going on to s…]]></summary>

As we head into 2024, however, a Q&A from Square Enix's financial briefing back in November 2023 revealed that it's now looking to slim down its lineup going forward to ensure higher quality (thanks, Genki).

Having tried the new RTX 4070 Super, though, it looks like Nvidia aren’t just redeeming the Super badge – they might just right the wrongs of the RTX 40 family as a whole.

Since then, it has failed to rise above 'Mixed' review rating on Steam, not helped by Starbreeze releasing a £15 DLC pack when many players were unhappy with the game they'd just bought for £35.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Your favourite beaver-based colony sim Timberborn's latest big update has arrived, and honestly, I'd say your poor beavers won't appreciate it one bit. The main reason being, it adds a new ecological hazard called Badwater, that doesn't only make your water bad, but your crops and beavers at risk of being bad. Still, there are plenty of new buildings to help you harness the power of the stanky water and errr, exercise halls for beavers to get their sweat on. I wouldn't recommend they rehydrate with the bad water, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a sizeable pile of role-playing games arriving in 2024, making for a pretty packed start to the year. But even with Infinite Wealth, Rebirth, and more on deck, one game has continued to spur our interest in the (virtual) Destructoid offices: Unicorn Overlord.


Today, Atlus and Vanillaware are sharing more details about the upcoming tactics RPG. Vanillaware is known for a few things, depending on who you ask: incredible art, maybe, or its side-scrolling action in Odin Sphere and Muramasa, sure. 2020's 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim saw the studio weave an incredible narrative thread through multiple perspectives, too.




So it's interesting that Unicorn Overlord feels like a fantasy tactics game, and targeted right at fans of the genre. It's a story about Alain, an exiled prince gatheri…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is now available, and if you’re a fan of games like Metroid, Castlevania, or Hollow Knight, and you don’t have it on your radar, that’s probably a mistake. The game is a thrilling adventure, with plenty of excellent combat, puzzle, and traversal challenges. Once you get far enough in the game, you’ll likely encounter one of the most challenging of them all; The Impossible Climb is a late-game platforming/traversal sidequest that demands careful timing, patience, and the use of nearly all the powers you’ve earned up to that point in the story. If you want to prove your mastery of The Lost Crown, it’s the sequence you’ll want to tackle.

It's currently unclear how many people 10 percent of the company translates, too, considering CI Games is a publisher that also owns studios like Lords of the Fallen developer Hexworks and Sniper Ghost Warrior developer Underdog Studio.

        <updated>2024-01-18T14:30:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just over a week ago, I mentioned how Nvidia was launching three GPUs in the new RTX 4000 SUPER range. Now, the first one of the bunch has been released, offering a bit of a performance boost compared to its predecessor.


The 4070 SUPER came out yesterday, and it already appears to be fairly popular. While sites like Newegg do have models from ZOTAC, GIGABYTE, ASUS, and more, there are quite a few that have sold out. Amazon UK appears to have limited stocks at the time of writing. A report from Videocardz points to a few brands that are already out of stock, so it seems like you might want to get in quick lest supplies run out.




Prices for the SUPER graphics card can be as low as $549 and as high as $759 (if not more), depending on where you get it from and which model you opt for.


Compare and contrast


Showing up to 14% improvement over the non-SUPER variant, the RTX 4070 SUPER is what you would expect from a somewhat souped-up version of a modern graphics card.


While it still retains 12GB of GDDR6X of memory – similar to the regular 4070 – it does boast more CUDA cores and a slight increase in its clock speed. It also has a higher TGP, now requiring an additional 20W of power.


It also appears as though the RTX 4070 has been given a price drop, so if you're not in the mood for a new-new graphics card from Nvidia, you could always go for the standard variant. The RTX 4070 Ti SUPER and RTX 4080 SUPER are due to release on January 24 and January 31, respectively.

The publication says those with knowledge of the situation at the studio said the layoffs only affected people at Behaviour's Montreal, Canada studio, with those 45 affected let go last week, between January 9 and 11. 
However, Kotaku notes it was also told layoffs at the company began in December. The layoffs reportedly included cuts in various departments at the studio. Last month, Behaviour Interactive announced it was working with Until Dawn developer Supermassive Games on The Casting of Frank Stone, a new single player game set in the Dead by Daylight universe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, in a totally fake kind of way.
Toward the end of 2023, it was revealed that a Donkey Kong expansion would be making its way to Super Nintendo World in Universal Studios Japan. Now, thanks to some keen investigation from CoasterTalk (thanks, Gizmodo), some more information has been discovered regarding the site's new rollercoaster ride.
The ride, which is based on the mine cart segments of classic Donkey Kong Country games, is designed to send passengers flying into the air, simulating moments in which Donkey Kong would leap over broken rails in-game. To achieve this, the ride is operated via a hidden track, which holds the cart in the air to make it look like it's running on a visible track.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers may remember how much I liked Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion, principally because of how funny it was. It was an intelligent and somewhat loving take on a Zelda-y RPG - a small town hero gets a sword and goes on a rampage fighting some bosses - except the main character is a turnip. And also he tears up any paperwork handed to him. Turnip Boy Robs A Bank follows directly on from his Tax Evasion, and it's not quite as funny or as focused, but it's also an entirely different genre of game, and I have a huge amount respect for that.

It's often as high as £94, but for a little while now it's been available for £70 - a great price that makes it well worth recommending to you, dear RPS reader.

Don't be put off by 'Core i3' either - this model is similar in speed to the last-gen Core i5 11600K and not too far behind the Core i7 10700K, such is the leap forward Intel made with its 12th-gen CPU architecture. Today this processor is even cheaper than normal too, with prices dropping to £88 at Ebuyer in the UK.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda has announced The Elder Scrolls: Castles, a new mobile experience from the team behind Fallout Shelter.
Like Fallout Shelter, Castles is a management sim, with Bethesda stating in an X post that “you'll build your own dynasty where every day in our world is a year in the game's world. Citizens are born, they die, rulers change, and can be betrayed.” Players control their own castle over multiple generations of rulers, families, and subjects. Decision-making dictates how well your kingdom operates and how content your subjects are; unhappy citizens may plot to overthrow you. 
Your castle can be expanded with new rooms and items, plus workstations for underlings. It appears to feature a turn-based combat system with players equipping heroes with gear to battle enemies and gather resources to grow their kingdom. Though the game's App Store page states that it includes in-game purchases, it is unclear if Castles is free-to-play or not. 
The Elder Scrolls: Castles has soft-launched in the Philippines and will become available in other regions over the next few months. It is the third mobile game in the series, following The Elder Scrolls: Blades, a traditional RPG, in 2019 and The Elder Scrolls: Legends, a collectible card game, in 2017.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian CEO Swen Vincke has been reading Ubisoft director of subscriptions Philippe Tremblay's thoughts from yesterday about how players need to "get comfortable" with renting their games as a package, rather than "having and owning" an individual copy. His broad takeaway is: that ain't it, chief. In a social media thread today, Vincke wrote that "it's going to be a lot harder to get good content if subscription becomes the dominant model and a select group gets to decide what goes to market and what not". He feels that "direct from developer to players is the way". As such you shouldn't expect Baldur's Gate 3, Divinity: Original Sin 2 or any other Larian RPGs to join the Game Pass bandwagon anytime soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When cute crafting RPG Bandle Tale: A League Of Legends Story was first announced at the end of last year, I don't think I really appreciated the fact it was going to be the next game from the devs behind mortuary farming-me-do Graveyard Keeper. I keep turning this fact over in my head as I watch Lazy Bear Games' associate producer Vlada Redko play a portion of Bandle Tale over Discord for me, with creative director Nikita Kulaga and Riot Forge's creative director Rowan Parker telling me about what's happening onscreen in front of me. As Redko explores the whimsical, knitting-themed city of Bandle as one of League Of Legends' tiny fluffy Yordle creatures, it is, to put it lightly, quite the tonal shift from their previous work. But don't let its cute looks fool you.
This is a crafting RPG with a ferociously long set of skill trees to master, with 40-60 hours' worth of new abilities to learn, objects to construct, errands to run, friends to enlist and - crucially - parties to throw. For in the Bandle woods of Runeterra, life's problems are solved by having a good old fashioned boogie, including the rather urgent issue of fixing the world's portal network, which has collapsed in a mysterious accident. It may have a softer, fluffier-looking surface than Graveyard Keeper, but underneath it looks as though there's just as much to dig into here, so here's what I've learned so far ahead of its release on February 21st.

Developed by apparent Macbeth fans Walking Tree Games GmbH, and published by Starbreeze, it's a heavily horror-themed tribe management sim with a roguelike campaign loop, set in what the developers are calling the "Lovecraftian Stone Age", with flagrant disregard for my nerves.

If you've never watched it before, I recommend loading up the Twitch stream at about 1am and sort of gently dissociating while someone plays an 80s NES game you've never heard of. Speaking of, one of the headline acts for this year's stream - which is running through to this Sunday 21st - was Peanut Butter, a shiba inu trained to press buttons on command, "playing" a NES game that came out in 1985. Although Peanut Butter obeyed his training, some technical issues colluded to snatch a world best time from him - but he raised many thousands of dollars, so good for him.
Peanut Butter is the latest high tide line in the efforts to put more weird and difficult hurdles between you and the controls of games when speedrunning or streaming them. And I must ask: where next? A cat? A snapping turtle biting pressure sensors? A Grey parrot to play a game without any input from you at all? Where will this madness end!?

Other than an Acclaim-style stunt where you offer people £500 to tattoo their baby's face with the game logo, I'd say perhaps releasing a Quake mod.

Last week, on January 11, someone with knowledge of the studio told Kotaku about the layoffs, noting that roughly 45 people lost their jobs. 
The person with the knowledge of PTW also told the publication that the majority of those laid off live outside the United States – it has studios in North America, Europe, and Asia – and were QA workers. However, jobs were cut in other departments, too, Kotaku notes.

Blizzard have formally unveiled the brooding action-RPG's Season 3, aka Season of the Construct, which launches at 6pm GMT and 10am PST on January 23rd, and features a new quest line in which you investigate an ancient technology, the Loom, created by the mage Zoltun Kulle, which has now been purloined by the demon Malphas.
Along the way, you'll both fight deadly arcane constructs (fantasy robots), and enlist one called Ayuzhan as your Seneschal Companion. These machinations aren't just devilish, in other words. They are literal machinations, with all manner of automated foe awaiting beneath the deserts of Kehjistan.

Personally, I'm extremely pleased to see they've added a photo mode, for example, as I spent inordinate amounts of time making Lara do creepy side-eye smiles during inappropriate Shadow Of The Tomb Raider scenes. But I'm also heartened to see they've kept in the original tank controls as an optional extra, alongside a more modern control scheme to make them more approachable.

It's called Wakerunners, and it's a team-based "battle action game" about heroes smashing at each other.

It'll have a demo in Steam Next Fest next month and there's a teaser trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wakerunners is the next game from developer Mintrocket, which made a name for itself last year with the excellent Dave the Diver. Mintrocket did confirm to us that Wakerunners is being developed by a different internal team (apparently it has a number of projects from distinct teams going at once), but the pedigree is still worth calling out.
As for the game itself, you can check out the game's teaser trailer below.


Technically, the game was soft-revealed in 2022 as Project TB and is a 4v4 and 5vr top-down competitive action game. The game follows a collection of factions trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic earth. The combat leans on a fast-paced system where players glide across the arena using acceleration and deceleration to their advantage as they engage in close-quarters combat. You will apparently be able to swap characters mid-battle, which will obviously affect strategies.

A demo will be available for the game during the next Steam Next Fest, which will include five different modes and seven playable characters. Right now the game is currently only confirmed for PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Embark Studios surprise-launched its free-to-play FPS, The Finals, back in December – Game Informer documented everything that goes into a stealth release like this – and the game has continued to garner a strong fanbase. Now, just a little over a month since its release, Embark is set to release Update 1.5.0 and a new limited-time mode, Solo Bank It, tomorrow, January 17. 
Embark calls this mode an "experimental" one, pitting 12 single players against each other in PvP matches. The first to obtain a total of 40,000 "Cash wins" takes home the win in Solo Bank It. Similar to standard Bank It, which is already in The Finals, contestants earn Cash by collecting and depositing Coins that drop from eliminated players; Coins can also be found in vaults around the map. 
Watch The Finals Update 1.5.0 trailer for yourself below: 


Elsewhere in this update, Embark is fixing plenty of bugs and making balance changes as well. Plus, Update 1.5.0 "comes with a security update to anti-cheat and fair play" and a store update, too. 
Update 1.5.0 and Solo Bank It go live in The Finals tomorrow, January 17.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2K's tennis series is returning after more than a decade of dormancy with TopSpin 2K25, the company announced today. It did so with a quick teaser trailer revealing that it's "coming soon." Its announcement coincides with 2024's first Grand Slam tennis tournament, the Australian Open, which began Saturday, January 13. 
"Today, 2K revealed the return of TopSpin with the teaser trailer for TopSpin 2K25, the next must-play sports game from 2K that fully immerses fans into the world of tennis," a press release reads. It also notes more information about the game is "to come." 
Watch the TopSpin 2K25 announcement teaser for yourself below: 


2K did not reveal a release date or a release window, but given that "25" is in the title, it's likely releasing either this year or the next. The last TopSpin game was released in 2011 with Top Spin 4 during the Xbox 360/PlayStation 3 generation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto V developer Rockstar Games and Alan Wake 2 studio Remedy Entertainment have a history that goes back years, namely due to the two's work on the Max Payne series. However, the companies are at the center of two trademark disputes filed by Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, as first reported by RespawnFirst. In the disputes, Take-Two takes issue with Remedy's new logo it unveiled in April of last year, which features a stylized "R," claiming it's too similar to Rockstar's own "R" logo. 
The trademark disputes – here and here – were filed in the United Kingdom, and Take-Two, based in New York, is named as the "opponent" in it. The disputes were filed on May 11, 2023, which is a month after Remedy unveiled its new logo. 
Notably, despite the trademark dispute, Rockstar and Remedy are working together on a remake package of Max Payne 1 and 2. In October of last year, Remedy said the Max Payne 1 & 2 remake, which is a single game, has "progressed into a production readiness stage."
While waiting to learn more about this trademark conflict, read Game Informer's review of Alan Wake 2, and then watch the official trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI, which Rockstar plans to release in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 2022 World War II horror game Martha is Dead is the latest video game getting a film adaptation. The game’s Italian developer LKA, is partnering with production company Studios Extraordinares to bring the psychological adventure to the big screen.
Martha is Dead is a first-person adventure that follows identical twin sisters, Guilia, the protagonist, and Martha. Set in Tuscany in 1944, during the final stretch of World War II, the sisters are fathered by a Nazi general and have a strained relationship due to the clear favoritism Martha receives from their mother. However, Martha is suddenly found dead, and their mother mistakenly believes Guilia to be Martha, forcing her to assume her late sister’s identity. Supernatural occurrences abound centering on the malevolent entity known as the White Lady.
The film follows the same premise. Studios Extraordinares is led by screenwriter/directors André Hedetoft and Andreas Troedsson, and the company’s website states it’s a “creative powerhouse writing and making high-end action, horror, and science-fiction films from original stories and extraordinary games.” The studio is also working on bringing last year’s sci-fi horror game Fort Solis to TV and film, as well as a movie adaptation of the upcoming horror shooter Veil. 
We didn’t particularly enjoy what Martha is Dead had to offer as a gameplay experience. In his review, editor Wesley LeBlanc scored the experience a 6 out of 10, writing, “LKA’s love of Italy is the only warmth I felt in Martha is Dead. The rest left me feeling as cold as Giulia’s dead sister.” Given the recent success of video game films like The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Five Nights at Freddy's, here’s hoping Martha is Dead can achieve even a fraction of that success. Or, at the very least, we hope it makes for a better movie than a video game.]]></summary>

Prisons will now have multiple floors to police, as well as a whole new inmate behaviour system to navigate along the way that will feed into gang warfare, escapes and other budding management problems. It's coming out surprisingly soon, too, with its reveal trailer dating it for March 26th.

They've published a new trailer to mark the occasion, in which a group of the game's quarantine zone mercenaries squat around a campfire, supping mugs of what probably isn't cocoa, and listening to guitar music. It strikes a fitting note of world-weariness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer GSC Game World will finally release S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl on September 5. The first-person shooter will launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC. 
The studio announced this release date in a quick trailer released today, which also calls September 5 the "final release date," indicating GSC Game World is confident it won't be delaying its long-awaited shooter any longer. The game was set to release in the first quarter of 2024 before today's delay.
Check out the Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl final release date announcement trailer for yourself below: 


Officially confirmed in 2020, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl has taken some time to get off the ground after various starts and stops. Then, following what appeared to be smoother development, the team paused its work in February 2022 due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, where GSC Game World is based. Employees were forced to evacuate their homes in places like Kyiv, which is Ukraine's capital. Some employees even volunteered to fight for Ukraine – developer Vladimir "Fresh" Yezhov was killed in combat in 2022, as reported by GameRant.
In December 2022, GSC Game World returned with a new S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 gameplay trailer, and we've been waiting on the game ever since. It was set to launch in 2023 before it was delayed to Q1 of this year, and now we know it's coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC on September 5. 
Are you going to check out Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl when it launches later this year? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer 11 Bit Studio has unveiled the first full look at Frostpunk 2 gameplay. First announced in August 2021, the sequel to the bleak yet popular city-builder is also coming to Xbox and PC Game Pass.
The trailer provides a look at how decision-making appears in-game. The demands you’ll receive from your citizens appear to be as stressful as the first Frostpunk, as you control a Steward overseeing life in a city situated in an unforgiving tundra where resources are precious and everyone has their own ideas about how society should function. How do you ensure everyone gets fed? What does the education system look like? How do you keep the streets clean of literal and criminal filth? Set 30 years after the original game, citizens can vote to pass laws, and these decisions steer the city’s direction toward multiple outcomes and finales.


11 Bit also announced that Frostpunk 2 is launching on PC Game Pass, alongside Steam, The Epic Store, and GOG, in the first half of 2024. The game will also come to Game Pass on Xbox Series X/S at a later date and is targeting PlayStation 5 as well.

But imagine my shock when I re-installed Immortals Fenyx Rising for the somethingth time, and realised that it has been a comfort game for me all along.
This might make me a massive hypocrite. It's a big Ubisoft RPG filled stuff I complain about modern games having, notably a big map of empty space filled with busywork quests and collectibles. But I don't know what to tell you! It requires concentration but not too much, the set dressing all looks great, and it's doing all that AAA stuff with a wink and a smile, so it's sort of fine. It has fourth wall-breaking meta narration! How can I not like it!

I still agree with that score today, too.
If I wrote what I want to say about The Last of Us Part II's story, I'm sure you'd find it very familiar because it's largely how I felt around the game's original release.

Rather than simply shooting your opponent, the goal is to coat them with enough foam so that you can slide-kick them to knock them out of the match.

It's unsurprising given it came out 18 years ago, but exploration is more akin to a slideshow and dungeon-running to a well-rehearsed routine.
But with an hour of Persona 3 Reload under my belt, P3's  remake felt immediately familiar. It's absolutely built for a seamless transition for P5-likers and takes away some of P5 Royal's learnings, too. Unless something disastrous happens when Reload fully releases, I can't ever see myself returning to the original.

Ever since I got my hands on Persona 3 Reload over the summer, I've described it to folks as "Persona 3 redone in the form of Persona 5 Royal." While that may be a gross oversimplification, it's also pretty high praise. Longtime fans of the Persona series point towards Persona 3 as the entry that changed the course of the series, pointing it down the path it's been on for nearly the last two decades. While Persona 3 may be the most important entry from a mechanical perspective, Persona 5 has the most mainstream relevance, particularly in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft's director of subscriptions Philippe Tremblay has said that for all the growth of videogame subscription services in the past few years, players are still accustomed to "having and owning their games". Accordingly, he feels his task is to help you grow "comfortable" with the idea that the game you're playing might be taken offline as part of the release schedule, with Tremblay pointing out that you can still resume your save file when the game is next available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rebel Wolves, the studio founded by a few of the CD Projekt folk behind The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077, have officially titled their forthcoming dark fantasy RPG. That title is… Dawnwalker. They’ve also shared a new teaser image, which I think could depict one of two things: a) a vampiric or otherwise supernaturally-inclined hero flying through the air care of a Dishonored-style Blink teleport, sword raised and clawed fingers stretched towards an unseen foe against a blood-red backdrop. Or b) a man with his trousers aflame swinging through the window of a second floor spa while attempting to use his umbrella as a parachute, having received only half a pedicure before the building caught fire.

It's, technically, I suppose, a horror game about manning a call line through a 90s CRT-screen PC, where people will be like "my kitchen is full of droppings that look like coffee grounds, what do?". You look through your list of potential household hazards and select the right one, so your caller gets sent the info on dealing with cockroaches. Except as your week at HSH goes on, your calls start to be less roaches, more "my house smells like death and my dog is acting strangely" or "I can see someone looking through my window at night and hear them breathing heavily."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In February 2022, former designers from CD Projekt Red announced the formation of a new studio called Rebel Wolves. The team revealed its first project would be, unsurprisingly, an RPG, and today, we learned a couple more details about the game, including its title.
The game is called Dawnwalker, and Rebel Wolves describes it as a “story-driven dark fantasy role-playing adventure.” Billed as being the team's dream RPG project, the game has officially entered the alpha stage of development, and Rebel Wolves plans to share more information about it later this year. 
The studio also announced another CD Projekt alumni Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz as the game’s creative director. Tomaszkiewicz work includes Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales.
“We want to craft a world that you will want to explore and dive deep into and tell stories that make you care about the characters,” said Tomaszkiewicz in a press release. “We aim to deliver an experience that will allow for a variety of choices and room for experimentation when replayed. Helping craft this experience with so many talented people will be my mission at Rebel Wolves, and I can't wait for everyone to see what the team has been up to for quite a while now.”
Rebel Wolves didn’t share any more info on Dawnwalker, so questions about its premise, narrative, mechanics, and platforms will go unanswered until hopefully later this year. Until then, the team did release a piece of promotional art, posted above, that should help fuel imaginations of what the team is cooking.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has released Tekken 8’s opening cinematic to whet fans' appetite for the game as its release date draws ever closer. The publisher also confirmed that long-time favorite Eddy Gordo will kick off the roster of Season 1 DLC fighters.
The intro cinematic is impressively rendered and, in true Tekken fashion, utterly absurd. In addition to seeing the main cast throwdown with implausible displays of martial arts, we even see them engage in a full-on battle reminiscent of the Wakanda fight in Avengers: Infinity War. 


The video concludes with the reveal that Eddy Gordo is joining the roster this spring. Since his first appearance in Tekken 3, Eddy has been both beloved and reviled for his extremely effective use of Capoeira, so we're excited to see new tricks he has up his sleeves. 
In a neat behind-the-scenes twist, the trailer shows off some of the motion capture and animation that went into bringing Eddy into the current generation of Tekken. Eddy is the first of four characters that will be added to Tekken 8 throughout the year for purchasers of the Year 1 Season Pass or owners of the Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions of the game in which the pass is included.
Tekken 8 launches on January 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can read our impressions of the game’s Story mode and Arcade mode here.]]></summary>

It's probably officially too far into January to get away with saying Happy New Year now, but stuff it, I'll wish you a good one anyway, as well as a warm welcome back to Letter From The Editor. This month's letter can be considered very much a part two to the one I wrote in November, in which we had a sneaky peek at the behind the scenes process of putting together our annual RPS Advent Calendar (or in regular video game website speak, our big games of the year feature). 
We always have a big old voting barney around November time to decide which games do or don't make the cut in our Advent Calendar (that is: we all submit top ten lists and we count up the votes afterwards), and every year lots of you try and guess which ones will make it over on the RPS Discord. Inevitably, there are only so many slots for what is always a heck of a lot of games put forward, but the key question has always been thus: who voted for what? WELL. For the first time ever, come and find out below as we reveal all.

But, with little over a month to go until the game's release, Square Enix has released a new trailer that teases a climactic fight between protagonist Cloud Strife and his arch-enemy, Sephiroth. 
Running exactly one minute long, this "Destined for Rebirth" trailer features new gameplay, shots of our party of characters like Tifa, Barret, Yuffie, Aerith, and more, and lots of Sephiroth. It also features the game's excellent combat theme, and while some might call it cheesy, it's pretty cool to see shots of Sephiroth and Cloud timed to the rhythm of said theme. 
Check out the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth "Destined for Rebirth" trailer for yourself below: 


Final Fantasy VII Rebirth hits PS5 on February 29, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[War Hospital, out now on Steam, is about subsisting on the periphery of a war and keeping it firmly off-screen by means of adept time management. Set in 1918, it puts you in charge of a field hospital in northern France, a few minutes drive from the frontline. Here’s how all that works: casualties arrive from the trenches by ambulance or stretcher, and are carried by your medics to a clearing station, where nurses look after them before they’re seen by a doctor. Patients may be lightly or severely injured, but they will all eventually die if they’re left unattended.

One was a live service version of Call Of Duty's zombies mode, and the other, a revival of a classic Raven IP. I'm not sad about one and I'm mildly sad over the other, with the mystery not being too hard to solve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I mentioned this in a What Are We Playing? and the podcast last week, but I've been playing a point and click puzzle game called Twilight Oracle, which is out at the end of the month. It's cool! It reminds me a lot of Legends Of Kyrandia, in that it doesn't need to explain why stuff in the world is like it is, it just is. Big talking fish? Sure. Skull floating in space? You betcha.
Twilight Oracle isn't immune to the kind of counter-intuitive puzzle solves that are sort of inherent to the genre (use pineapple on wallet, etc.), but there's a demo to see for yourself, and I thought it'd be just as well to make more of you aware of it before it comes out on the 30th of January. Also because I wanted to point out that one of the reasons I have been enjoying Twilight Oracle is the colour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given the sheer quantity of games releasing on Steam these days, having a neat little elevator pitch for your game can be vital in helping it stand out. For example, if I get an email saying a game is like "Obra Dinn meets such and such" or "Into The Breach but a deckbuilder", that's like personal catnip to me, and can be a handy indicator of whether I should investigate further - maybe watch a gameplay trailer for it, say, or see if it's got a demo. Case in point: this is exactly how I stumbled upon the upcoming Donkey Kong Country-esque platformer Windswept last week, although instead of an email, I saw it on the growing "Your game is too much like..." thread over on Xwitter - which is definitely worth a browse if you have very niche interests in need of a good scratch.

Because Ark: Survival Ascended developers Studio Wildcard and Grove Street Games are promising/threatening to "put the power of unbridled game creation directly in your hands" with the game's next major dev kit update, which will release by the end of January.
This will greatly expand the game's moddability, though concrete details are thin on the ground. It'll ship with a "Mario-inspired" platformer to show you how. There's also a dev kit update planned next week for multiplayer spin-off Ark: The Survival Of The Fittest. This will allow you to "sculpt the ultimate battlegrounds where your fellow ARK survivors will fight to see who will be the ultimate survivor".

Overcrowding in UK prisons was also taken into consideration, undermining claims that small-time pirates risk custodial sentences.

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for Orion Burger, the classic game by Sanctuary Woods. The engine also adds a few niceties that the original didn't have, such as mouse wheel handling, and using the spacebar to skip walk animations - something the original didn't do properly.
Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game's logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation. And please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, luck be with you. And remember, with the aliens cheating on the tests they set up for you, this will be no easy task.

Once again, you will decide the fate of a kingdom (this time, China) by swiping left or right on binary decisions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crystal Story: Dawn of Dusk is a combination of words that screams "predatory mobile fantasy RPG" but that's very much not my takeaway from the game's demo. Out tomorrow on Steam for £10.23, $11.99 or €11.83 including the 20% launch discount, this first instalment in the Crystal Story series blends the cuddly feel of a 16-bit Zelda with the dream logic of a Yume Nikki. There's a splash of Undertale's crackpot experimentalism to the writing and certain battles, as well. 


Those are big comparisons to invoke, and I don't expect Crystal Story to measure up to them. But it's a lot better than I was expecting from a game whose title had me picturing microtransaction-sodden levelling systems and a pouty elf in a bikini.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers, I have good news and bad news. Good news. My mum got me an incredible hot chocolate maker for Christmas this year, as well as a jumbo-sized box of grated chocolate sachets to use with it. It is, quite honestly, one of the best presents she's ever given me, and it now means I can have perfect hot chocolate, practically on tap, in as little as three minutes. Hotel Chocolat's Velvetiser, you're an absolute beauty. Honestly, it is so much better than anything I could make, or have made, myself. It's fast, easy, wonderfully smooth and properly delicious hot chocolate. Crucially, the machine itself is also dead simple to clean. Gone are the days I have to worry about washing up a pan of semi-encrusted milk afterwards, or faffing about with how many teaspoons of hot chocolate powder to plonk in because I accidentally coughed and sent half of it flying all over the counter.
Bad news. This recent revelation of such effortless, technological ease has instantly kneecapped any excitement or desire I might have had for Kitfox Games' new tea brewing sim they announced at the tail end of last year, or indeed any other kind of drink-based simulation game (of which there seem to be an increasing number of these days). Whereas before I might have revelled in the step-by-step process of making a perfect hot drink, I have now been fully converted to the ways of instant button pressing and time-saving efficiency. After all, why dwell on the manual minutiae when machinery is king?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Titan Forge Games and publisher Hi-Rez Studios have announced Smite 2, a sequel to Smite that is rebuilding the third-person action MOBA from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. There's no release date for the sequel, but Titan Forge Games says it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. Closed early alpha testing will begin this spring. 
The team says Smite 2 will feature a diverse roster of Gods from all sorts of mythological pantheons around the world, and while some playable gods will stay true to how they perform in Smite, others "will have new animations, FX, and even reimagined abilities."

It's come some way since, but its edges are still a little rough, with (usually) minor bugs and limited feedback wrapped up in a design that's influenced, of course, by that vague shimmering ghost of Rogue (and thus is innately bad and you're all just wrong). So yeah, it kinda has problems.
But I like it. Weird, huh?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CES 2024 is drawing to a close, and honestly, I’m not especially sad to see it go. While the Las Vegas tech megashow is probably the closest thing PC gaming hardware has to an E3 (and in some ways surpasses it, given CES still exists), this year’s event has been characterised by an all-too-credulous obsession with AI nonsense. Not the fun/useful DLSS kind that makes your games run faster – more the kind that replaces actual creative work with dubiously-sourced robot media. Icky stuff, even by Vegas standards.
Mercifully, not everyone was there to flog Stable Diffusion boxes and imaginary ChatGPT friends, so there is actually some interesting new kit to look forward to in 2024. I’ve rounded up the highlights here, along with some of the more questionable AI-based showings – because they may well merit discussion, even if that discussion amounts to "Is this a good idea?" followed by "No."

Discord CEO Jason Citron cites overhiring, which has led to the company becoming "less efficient" in how it operates. The layoffs affected people across various departments. 
The Verge obtained an internal memo from Citron sent to employees announcing the layoffs, which have already happened. That memo explained why the layoffs were happening, when affected employees would receive the email telling them they no longer have a job, and follow-up meetings for those who remain at Discord. 
"We grew quickly and expanded our workforce even faster, increasing by 5x since 2020," Citron writes in the memo. "As a result, we took on more projects and became le…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sand Land, the video game adaptation of Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama’s manga of the same name, has a release date and a new trailer setting up the story.
First announced during Summer Game Fest last year, Sand Land launches on April 26. The game centers on the Fiend Prince Beelzebub, a demon summoned to take down a corrupt King and his Royal Army by the human Sheriff Rao. Joined by Beelzebub’s chaperone, Thief, the three must also find the Legendary Spring, an artifact capable of ending a worldwide drought that has transformed the environment into a desert. 


The open-world action RPG features plenty of vehicle piloting and combat. Players take control of various tanks and dune buggies outfitted with weapons such as machine guns to mow down threats while traversing the sand-covered terrain. Sand Land is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC. 
If that’s not enough Sand Land for you, the animated series that premiered in Japan last year is launching worldwide exclusively on Hulu this spring. Sand Land: The Series tells a brand-new story that picks up from the events of the 2023 film. Check out the trailer below:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Golden Sun and its sequel, Golden Sun: The Golden Age are joining the Nintendo Switch Online library next week. On January 17, these two classic Game Boy Advance games will be available to play for all Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers. 
If you haven't yet played them before, there's probably someone in your life who has. And there's a good chance they mention it a lot, for good reason, too. Golden Sun is an excellent RPG and its sequel serves up even more of the story and magic-heavy combat. If you aren't familiar with these games, check them out in the trailer below: 


"From the humble village of Vale to the mystical peaks of Mt. Aleph, the Golden Sun game sets magic-wielding young heroes Isaac, Garet, Ivan, and Mia on a quest to prevent the ancient power of Alchemy from being unleashed on their home world of Weyard," a press release reads. "Their adventure takes them through towns, caverns, and dungeons as they face wily enemies, confounding puzzles, and epic challenges that push their magical abilities (Psynergy) to their absolute limits. Along the way, they get help from mysterious creates known as Djinn, who aid the heroes in harnessing their Psynergy to unlock potent spells and unstoppable attacks." 
In the sequel, The Lost Age, which is a direct follow-up to Golden Sun, the story follows Felix, another young magic-wielder with a unique twist. 
Both games feature co-op gameplay, so you can adventure through Vale with a friend if you'd like, but both must have access to the games. 

Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age hit the Nintendo Switch Online-Expansion Pack library on Wednesday, January 17. 
If you're curious about that library, here's every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Sega Genesis, and GBA game available with the subscription.

It's out 26th April 2024, and alternates beat 'em up action with cartoon tank customisation, in a sort of Dragon Ball X Mad Max homage with chunks of Dragon Quest thrown in for good measure.

"New Cycle" is obviously a bit of a self-contradiction, and I suspect that's deliberate - one of the questions the video leaves you with is whether there is "a future beyond survival", or whether we are doomed to just repeat the processes of extraction and gradual building-up, resource overexploitation and encroaching disaster suggested by these 12 jam-packed minutes of in-game footage.

These cards are rated for up to 150MB/s reads and have both UHS Speed Class 3 (3) and App Performance Class 2 (A2) certifications for minimum speeds, making them a decent choice for Steam Deck, ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go owners amongst other use cases in phones, cameras and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are few things the internet is hungrier for than news about the Switch successor. With relative silence from Nintendo, folks have been left to grasp at straws and theorize what it will look like, how it will be played, and when it will be released. Today, thanks to Digital Trends, we might have an answer to that last question, and it came from a rather odd place.
Back in the day, GameShark was known for making cheat code cartridges in video games. You could plug it into your system, download cheat codes, and use them to become the master of games on your N64, PlayStation, or Game Boy. However, in recent years, the company has decided to take a turn in the direction of the company. Renamed "AI Shark," it's now a software-agnostic program designed to provide "personalized hints and assistance that keep up with fast-paced, competitive gaming." What does any of this have to do with the Switch 2? It's all in one sentence at the end of the first paragraph of their press release. 
"The official launch is planned to coincide with the Nintendo Switch 2 in September 2024."
To be clear, Nintendo has offered no official confirmation that this is an accurate launch window, and there are myriad reasons to doubt the validity of the claim. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reports that AI Shark is simply guessing at the Switch console's release date. Regardless, it is an odd statement to make in an official press release, and it will be very interesting to see Nintendo's response, assuming it issues one.
For more Nintendo Switch, check out our episode of All Things Nintendo where we list our most anticipated Switch games, and then read up on how Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown runs on the console.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 1/11/2024:
Shannon Woodward, the actress who originally portrayed Dina in The Last of Us Part 2, has responded to the live-action casting of Isabela Merced. In addition to a tweet of general support for Merced, Woodward responded to a fan who wondered why she didn't reprise her role in the sequel. In short, it's because of her age.
Bcs I am…. Much older lol https://t.co/4Qe2SjnAiQ
January 11, 2024
"Bcs [sic] I am... Much older lol," Woodward's second tweet reads. Much like Ellie's original actress, Ashley Johnson, Woodward is about 20 years older than the character she portrays. Dina's character model is actually based on an entirely different person, Cascina Caradonna, who fits the age range of the character. That said, Joel's video game actor Troy Baker, along with Johnson, recei…]]></summary>

You can read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review by following the link, but that review pertains to the console version of the game and does not address a question many players have: how is Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown on Switch? The short answer is that it is solid. Playing on Switch does not feel like a major downgrade from the other versions. For the long answer, check out the video below!

The Prince of Persia series has a long and storied history going back decades, and I know none of it. The latest, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, from developer Ubisoft Montpellier, has me regretting that because if this game indicates what else awaits me in the franchise, I’ve clearly been missing out. The Lost Crown uses exhilarating platforming, a deep combat loop, and more to create a new Metroidvania classic. While I would like a more compelling story and a few tweaks to its systems, I struggled to pu…]]></summary>
