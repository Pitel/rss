        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not so Horrid Henry.
Set in the 15th century and taking place in the tumultuous land of Bohemia, Kingdom Come Deliverance follows the exploits of nice-but-dim blacksmith’s son Henry. Struggling through the political and religious machinations of the lords and ladies around him, he seeks to avenge the death of his family and find a place in the world. But first, he needs to learn how to use a sword…
One of the very first tasks in Warhorse Studios' epic RPG is to collect a debt from a lowly drunkard. After a short intro to dialogue choices, you proceed to confidently throw hands with the peasant. After being roundly beaten within an inch of your life, you limp off to mother to get fixed up. It’s an appropriate intro to this gritty journey of bloody revenge. There are many ways to approach a confrontation, it’s going to be a while before violence is the easy option.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mention Lionhead's '05 management sim about running a film studio and someone will crash through the wall, Kool-Aid Man style, to say they really liked it and there should be a remake or a sequel. In recent years there have been a few attempts to make a game like The Movies, with games like Moviehouse and Filmmaker Tycoon sitting pretty at 'mostly negative' status on Steam because they are not, in fact, like The Movies beyond the basic premise. But Blockbuster Inc. has shouldered its way into the conversation, wearing big puffy trousers, shouting through an old-timey megaphone, and openly billing itself as a "spiritual successor" to The Movies. It's launching on June 6th this year, but you can play the prologue on Steam for free right now.

Tell me if this sounds familiar: You're making your way through the Cutting Edge Warbond and spot the Punisher Plasma weapon. You always wanted an electric shotgun, you just didn't know until now.

In that short timeframe it has earned rave reviews (including a 9.5 out of 10 from us), positioned itself as a Game of the Year contender, and sold 1 million copies. To the delight of many, a mobile version was recently announced to be in the works. 
For some players, Balatro seemingly came out of nowhere and its sole developer, LocalThunk, is just as mysterious. The highly private creator doesn't share his real name, but I was able to speak with him about his game development history, his philosophy for making games, how he came up with the idea for Balatro, and his reaction to its positive reception.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Stardew Valley 1.6, we’ve been blessed with four new Seeds - one for every season. While they’re not particularly hard to come by, it’s not entirely obvious where to get them at the very beginning. Don’t worry, I can help with the veggie intake, here's how to get Broccoli in Stardew Valley. 


Broccoli is a Fall crop, and once you’ve planted Broccoli Seeds, they take eight days to fully grow. Once mature, Broccoli plants provide additional crops every four days, so it’s well worth setting up a field of these. At base level, Broccoli provides 63 Energy and 28 Health, but this increases depending on the quality level. 


How to get Broccoli Seeds in Stardew Valley

There are four main ways to get Broccoli Seeds in Stardew Valley, perhaps the easiest being through Mrs. Raccoon's store. She sells Broccoli Seeds in exchange for five Moss. Unfortunately, you’ll need to complete at least the first couple of steps in the Raccoon questline for this to be a possibility. 


Thankfully, there are other ways to get Broccoli. It can be found in dig spots around Pelican Town, but only if the worms there are green. You can also get Broccoli Seeds from Lewis’ Prize Machine. 


The easiest way to get Prize Tickets is by fulfilling special requests when they’re posted on the Bulletin Board outside Pierre’s. Not all of these requests will reward tickets, but the ones that do will display a ticket in the bottom right corner before you accept the request. 


You can also find Broccoli Seeds inside boxes and crates within the Mines, so if you’re heading down to deeper floors, make sure to keep an eye out for things that can be broken for the goodies inside. 


All of the new crop types - Carrots, Powdermelon, Summer Squash, and Broccoli - have Seeds that can be found in the ways mentioned above.

Step aside Mario, because Princess Peach is here to show everybody what she's capable of. Yes, after a reasonably short wait, Princess Peach: Showtime! is about to launch on Nintendo Switch, but the big question is whether it's actually any good.
The good news is that, yes, it does seem to maintain the usual Nintendo magic that you'd expect, and it received a more-than-respectable score of 8/10 from ourselves. We said that "there's creativity, style, and fun to spare here, with levels packed full of secrets, cool outfits, and enough new mechanics to ensure nothing ever outstays its welcome". Sounds decent!

It’s remarkably simple to get, too, as long as you’ve met a few requirements. Here’s how to get Meowmere in Stardew Valley. 


In Terraria, the Meowmere is an incredibly strong melee weapon that is only obtainable deep into the game once you’ve overcome the Moon Lord. When swung, it shoots a cat-shaped projectile, which leaves a rainbow trail. Essentially, the sword summons Nyan Cat. 


Admittedly, its stats are less impressive in Stardew Valley, but it is a level 4 sword and it’s definitely an item that will bring you some bragging rights and it’s adorable to boot.

These Xbox players, however, have one extra obstacle the rest of us don't  — FFXIV Coins. 


FFXIV Coins are the new currency introduced with the debut of the Xbox version, available from the Microsoft platform's store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In November last year, the Australian post-apocalyptic CRPG Broken Roads was abruptly delayed mere days before it was meant to come out. Review code had even been sent out to press. But it was clear that the game needed more time in the oven, as developers Drop Bear Bytes acknowledged they needed "additional polish time and QA manpower" to test the "thousands of permutations" available in its deeply decision-driven storyline. Happily, that polish time has now come to an end, as the devs have today announced a fresh release date of April 10th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie has banned the Destiny 2 accounts of participants in the tirade of toxic and hate-filled comments that underscored the first Into the Light livestream. 


While the stream showcased a free update offering the horde mode players had long begged for, the Twitch chat quickly became awash with racist, homophobic, and otherwise vile remarks. Then, after one developer inadvertently showed their Steam username, a flood of friend requests began to appear on stream, most with equally racist or otherwise toxic public-facing handles.


The internet is no stranger to toxicity, but the Destiny community has a history of acting out. Bungie previously had to reduce community communication as a direct result of harassment and abuse. This included death threats and racial slurs, often communicated to Bungie employees via their unlisted personal phone numbers and emails.


Of course, Bungie and the Destiny 2 community don't always see eye to eye on everything. However, this seems to be the latest example of the toxic side of the Destiny community rearing its head.


How did Bungie respond to the toxic Destiny 2 stream behavior?

Responding to a post on Reddit, Bungie immediately commented on the racist and toxic behavior during the first Into the Light livestream. Bungie said, "It was disappointing to see those notifications, but we know they were from a few awful individuals and not reflective of the community at large."


The studio followed up by noting that it had already identified some of the bad actors involved and promptly banned them from Destiny 2. Bungie also added that after this incident, efforts will be made to ensure that a situation like this can't happen again. Bungie noted, "We are taking extra measures to make sure this doesn't happen again and look forward to sharing more info with you all in next week's stream."

Fae Farm, the charming life sim from developer Phoenix Labs, isn't quite done with updates just yet. The latest, aptly titled the 'Spring Update', brings a number of improvements and additions to the game that should prove most welcoming for fans.
The biggest change is honestly something that we wish was a thing in real life, and that's the 'double-day length' feature. In a nutshell, it essentially slows down time to allow you to perform more tasks within a single day. Given how much there is to do in the game now, this sounds like a dream come true.

So far we’ve seen the past, the present and the problems surrounding this new buzzword as it filters its way into our games and communities. In this final part of the series, I want to try and think concretely with you about what the future might hold; to go beyond what we think is just or legal, what we might be excited by or fearful of, and instead think about the practicalities of making and playing games today and how that might be impacted by generative AI's growing dominance.

        <updated>2024-03-21T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ark: The Animated Series has surprised launched today on Paramount +. Based on the hit Ark: Survival Evolved, the series was first announced at The Game Awards in 2020 and went from not having a release date or platform to suddenly having its first six episodes available now in the U.S. and Canada.
The series follows Helena Walker, a paleontologist who washes ashore a mysterious island brimming with dinosaurs and other extinct wildlife. After meeting another survivor and hunter named Bob, Helena learns how to fend for herself in this strange land while encountering myriad threats and survivors from throughout history. While the first six episodes of Season 1 are out now, the remaining seven episodes will arrive at a later date. 
The show’s star-studded cast includes Madeleine Madden, Michelle Yeoh, Vin Diesel, Gerard Butler, David Tennant, Russell Crowe, Jeffrey Wright, Karl Urban, Zahn McClarnon, Devery Jacobs, Elliot Page, Malcolm McDowell, Deborah Mailman, and Alan Tudyk. Check out the premiere trailer below. 


To mark the occasion, Ark: Survival Ascended is holding a special tie-in event in which players can unlock skins based on characters from the animated series, which replicate the show’s art style. Obtaining these involves collecting a series of notes titled “Dear Jane” written by Karl Urban’s character in the show, Bob. The first drop of skins will be for Helena, Bob, Dodo, and Scary the Parasaur. New notes will appear in the game each Tuesday and Thursday until April 11. Check out the trailer below.


Meanwhile, we're still awaiting an update on the long-quiet Ark 2 (also featuring Vin Diesel) which was announced in 2020 at The Game Awards. That game is currently scheduled to launch towards the end of the year. Hopefully this animated show is a decent holdover until the next big game arrives.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-03-21T16:34:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While playing Stardew Valley, you now occasionally receive a notification in the bottom left of the screen noting you have ‘new ideas to sleep on’. This is a recent addition with update 1.6, so it’s resulted in players questioning its meaning. 


It’s actually remarkably simple  —  the 'You've got some new ideas to sleep on' notification shows up whenever you level up a skill, letting you know you've made progress before turning in for the night. Previously, you’d have to wait until the end of the day for a level increase, but this notification can happen at any time of the day. 


There’s no more satisfying moment than leveling up, regardless of what game you’re playing, and Stardew Valley is no different. Each level up brings additional recipes or skills, so you’ll want to pay attention to this notification. 


How to level up skills in Stardew Valley


Screenshot by Destructoid


Each skill — Foraging, Mining, Fishing, Farming, and Combat — has 10 levels gained through earning exp. This exp comes from performing actions related to that skill, such as Combat exp earned while exploring Mines and Farming exp earned through planting or harvesting crops. 


Each increase in level requires more exp to achieve:


Level 
Exp needed


1
100


2
280


3
390


4
530


5
850


6
1,150


7
1,500


8
2,100


9
3,100


10
5,000






Once you’ve reached level 10 in every skill, you can unlock the new Mastery System which was added in the 1.6 update, offering the chance for you to get new tools and skills that otherwise aren’t available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No matter the industry – sports, television, movies, or games – the debate of "the greatest of all time" inevitably comes up. These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.
Though we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.
Will this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. 
While this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet. Be sure to bookmark this page or follow us on social media to be alerted when a new round starts!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you take a look at Metacritic, you can see that the best-scoring entry in the Alone in the Dark series is the original trilogy from way back in the '90s. The first game was such an inspiration within the survival horror genre, but that term didn't really exist until Resident Evil came along a few years later. Yet its impact is undeniable.


Now, with Pieces Interactive's new take on the iconic series doing the rounds, we once again find ourselves wondering whether we can welcome AitD back to the fore. At the time of writing, reviews for the latest game are trickling in, but from what I've seen, there's an overall feeling that the franchise is struggling to make any kind of significant comeback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh lord.
The latest Japanese charts are in courtesy of Famitsu (thanks, Gematsu) and it's another victory for Atlus' Unicorn Overlord, which comes in at number one again after selling a further 16,012 copies. Not bad considering how difficult it's been to picked up a physical edition recently.
It's another resounding success for the Switch as a whole, actually, with the only representation for the PS5 being Final Fantasy VII Rebirth at number two. Elsewhere, we've got Mario Kart 8 Deluxe at number three, Super Mario Bros. Wonder at number four, and Splatoon 3 even pokes its head in at number ten.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Claymation-me-do Harold Halibut is one of those puzzle-y adventure games that instantly catches your eye when you see it in screenshots and trailers. I mean, who wouldn't be intrigued by its beautiful handmade models and sets? They all have such a lovely texture to them, and the slightly ramshackle way they fit together gives the game a firm sense of place. But after playing an early preview build of Harold Halibut this week, I've been disappointed by just how frustrating it is to actually play. It's not that it's difficult. In fact, the tasks Harold's assigned in the opening few hours of the game are almost insultingly easy, extending to little more than 'feed the fish' and 'talk to so and so', all of which can usually be accomplished by interacting with a single button prompt to move the story along.
Rather, it's Harold himself that makes everything feel like such a chore. He's a bit of a dolt, you see, and everyone around him knows it, treating him with such weary and open disdain like he's some kind of village idiot that I, too, quickly came to dislike him. Harold doesn't help himself much either on this front, weathering everyone's underlying frustration with him like it's all water off a duck's back. It doesn't seem to faze him in the slightest, perhaps because he's too oblivious to even notice. But while this doziness might wash in a book or TV show, taking control of such a character in a game isn't nearly as pleasant. After all, it's not just Harold that's being treated like an ignoramus. By extension, you, the player, are as well, which isn't just immersion-breaking and frustrating, but it's also insulting to your own intelligence. And that, my friends, does not equal happy adventure game fun times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One advantage video game sequels tend to have over movie sequels is the ease with which you can outdo the original. 


Movie sequels tend to fall for the trap of just repeating the once-fresh beats of the original or bloating the whole thing via unnecessary fluff — like the part of this phrase you're reading right now. Good video game sequels only need to refine what was good about the original and perhaps add a few more details. This isn't about merely good sequels. 


This is about the best of the best, sequels that boldly risk it all to make revolutionary changes that result in undeniable classics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I usually know right away when I'm going to enjoy interactive fiction. But I don't always know why. Isle Of Maligree is a bit of an all-rounder, as pretty much every part of it is doing something right, but it's the sense that you're making your own version of its story that marks it out.
People are going missing on the island, and you've been sent to investigate. Only, it seems this isn't the first time, because some sinister magic is causing everyone to forget the whole thing ever happened. If you don't figure it out in time, you'll have to make a new character and try again. And if you're an amazing genius who figures it out on your first try... you'll want to try again anyway, to play it a different way and see what you missed. Maybe one day I'll even do it without getting stabbed.

Now Slice & Dice has finally arrived on Steam in search of a wider audience, accompanied by an update adding oodles of new heroes, enemies, items, and more. For newcomers, hey, it has a demo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a while, but I'm finally back on the Nancy Drew mystery game train. Choo choo, next stop: San Francisco! This has pleasing synergy with my real life, because I'm currently watching through Monk, a popular detective show also set in San Francisco. Mr. Monk would be displeased by the house Nancy finds herself in this time, which is a mansion being converted into a B&B. The owner, Rose, is working on a shoestring budget and has decided that the best player to add to her renovation team is a young-adult woman who's a friend of a friend. It all makes sense! 
Nancy Drew: Message In A Haunted Mansion is the third game in the Nancy Drew mystery series of puzzle games, and boy does the weird first-person fixed camera work against you here. It's also a more disappointing plot than the previous games, but it adds in a new time system that, much like Stay Tuned For Danger, is an ambitious move - and in this case I think it sort of works. It's a mixed bag, is what I'm saying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its release in early February 2024, Helldivers 2 has been slowly increasing the number of weapons and Stratagems available for players to utilize. At first, it was mechs, then a new Warbond, and now, it looks like we may even get some vehicles to drive around. 


Recently, though, and I do mean very recently, it's the enemy factions who have been iterated upon. While Helldivers have been getting new toys to squish Terminids and get blown up by Automatons, Arrowhead Game Studios has quietly upgraded our enemies. It wasn't until I saw the flying bugs, Shriekers, that I realized we're in an arms race for the future of humanity.

The good news for us both is that Games Workshop has announced an upcoming fourth edition of Age of Sigmar, and it will center around shenanigans from everyone's favorite rat-men. The Skaven are returning to the fray in a major way, streaming from the shadows and darkened places into the light. The day of the rat has come, and it's time to usher in the age of Vermindoom.


Overall, details are slim, but a new trailer shows plenty of fighting between Skaven and Stormcast, and Games Workshop is promising that this will be something of a rework of the rules. Age of Sigmar was originally a very simple system, and over nearly a decade has stayed…]]></summary>

Let's dive deep into the story of the original so you don't miss a beat when venturing out into the world of the sequel!


Dragon’s Dogma puts players in the shoes of the “Arisen”, a kind of person picked by the hand of destiny to slay dragons. That might sound way too similar to the plot outline of Skyrim, but Dragon’s Dogma came out shortly after Skyrim, so chances are this is but a coincidence. Similarly to Skyrim, again, the Dragons here are entities hellbent on terrorizing the world, but they're also intelligent and seemingly mischievous beings. Much like Skyrim, however, and for the last time, we have a face-to-face with a drag…]]></summary>

Now, the announcement of AMD FSR 3.1 isn't just about incremental improvements to the technology's supersampling algorithm: AMD is also adding its very own version of Nvidia's DLAA anti-aliasing solution, as well as decoupling FSR's own upscaling feature from its frame-generation capabilities. In effect, this allows Nvidia GPU owners to choose, as well as mix and match between Nvidia and AMD's native solutions in fully supported games, which is a huge boon for performance and image quality…]]></summary>

Launching on 28th March, 2024, the game ditches the top-down retro aesthetic of the original for a sprite scaler approach. It looks pretty great though, and we're all for developers that are willing to deviate from what made previous titles so successful.

Warframe's 11th anniversary is particularly interesting now that the game is out on iOS devices. This means you can - if you've got an iPhone - keep up with all of the game's many Dex item alerts on the go. As per usual, the developer Digital Extremes is setting everything up to give away oodles of exclusive gear over the coming days and weeks. This is cool stuff on its own, of course, but the really interesting bit is shown off in the trailer, suggesting that we may get something related to Warframe: 1999 as well.

It's kinda hard to believe, especially given how ridiculously popular the whole Mushroom Kingdom thing is, that we've had so few games starring its actual ruler as the protagonist over the years. Yes, there was Princess Toadstool's Castle Run on Nelsonic Game Watch back in 1990, Princess Peach's very first leading role (which you probably don't need to rush out and buy), and Super Princess Peach on DS, but nothing that feels like a proper turn as the core of a full-on adventure. Until now, that is.
Yep, whilst we were fully expecting this to be a throwaway sort of experience given the above track record, it turns out Princess Peach: Showtime! is easily Ms. Toadstool's finest hour (shocker), and a far more engaging romp than we had prepared for. It's still 100% a game aimed squarely at children, mind, and there's really not a whole ton of challenge for those seeking it, but for younger gamers, for relatives or friends sitting down to have a good old Nintendo sesh with some smaller kids, there's a whole lot of fun to be had with this one.

It's finally here in the form of Princess Peach: Showtime, and this one is a lot less risky but far more palatable as a result.

Princess Peach: Showtime (Switch)
Developer: Nintendo
Publisher: Nintendo
Released: March 22, 2024
MSRP: $59.99


Like any good Mario-adjacent game, it takes roughly five minutes (if that!) for Princess Peach: Showtime to get started. There is practically no nonsense or filler here: Peach is attending a play at a massive theater, and her plans are dashed by sorceress Grape and the Sour Bunch. It…]]></summary>

We’ve played as Peach in plenty of Mario-starring games through the years, but not since 2005’s Super Princess Peach has the artist formerly known as Princess Toadstool been the exclusive protagonist of her own journey. Princess Peach: Showtime is a wholly original adventure with an impressive amount of unique mechanics, but it fails to reach the platforming heights Nintendo has attained with its other characters in the past.


Showtime’s overall premise is one of the highlights as it creates an aesthetically interesting world that is able to look and play differently from level t…]]></summary>

It doesn't take a genius to appreciate that the Ultrahand ability featured in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a remarkable feat of technology that completely transformed the way you interact with the land of Hyrule, even if you weren't completely enamoured with the experience itself.
It should come as no surprise, then, to learn that implementing such a vital new mechanic into the game was a rather tricky endeavour for Nintendo during its development (and some folks wonder why it took so long!).

Nintendo left a lot of ideas on the cutting room floor during the development of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and now at this year's Game Developers Conference, the game's director Shiro Mouri and producer Takashi Tezuka have shared some insight.
In a series of slides (shared by Chris Kohler of Digital Eclipse), Nintendo's Mario Wonder team showed off the kind of brainstorming sessions it had - with ideas like Mario surfing, riding a unicycle, and jumping about on a pogo stick. Then there were a few other slides of "Wonder Effect testing sessions", "unused Wonder Effects" and even a look at a prototype level that was cut from the game.

Just the opening notes of his theme song, One Winged Angel, are enough to get the heart racing. But Sephiroth didn't make a name for himself with Final Fantasy alone. A particular Disney and Square Enix collaboration, Kingdom Hearts, introduced the villain to a new era of fans, and his appearances in that series are just as menacing, if not more so, than his Final Fantasy 7 presence.


If players missed out on Sephiroth's 1997 Final Fantasy 7 debut, it might be hard to discern why fans go gaga over the character. Heralding a planet-ending event and haunting protagonist Cloud Strife throughout FF7, Sephiroth presented himself as a fearsome villain from the get-go. However, for …]]></summary>

The cross-platform friend invite fix was announced on the official Helldivers 2 Discord sometime after the big patch went live. According to Arrowhead Games' community lead, Katherine Baskin, the patch was applied directly to the game's backend. You probably didn't even notice.

While this isn't gameplay footage of me playing the game, I did get a chance to play the game recently, so Marcus Stewart and I decided to get together and chat about his time playing the game.
Hyper Light Breaker is entering early access on PC some time this year. For more on my time playing the game, you can read my full Hyper Light Breaker preview here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article's headline is the characterisation of Everdeep Aurora given to me by publisher Ysbryd Games, but bizarrely enough, it reminded me initially of Bloodborne. A 2D platformer from Nautilus Games, Everdeep Aurora begins on the surface, where a ruptured crimson moon fills the sky with blazing meteors. That menacing moon is the first hint of Bloodborne, obviously. The second is the lamp-lit, locked-up house to one side, whose unseen occupant tells you to get lost, adding that they don’t believe all this crazy talk about the apocalypse. 


I thought at once of the wealthier residents of Yharnam, feasting and laughing hysterically behind the shutters of their fancy townhouses on the night of the Hunt. There are no pitchfork-wielding mobs or werewolves stalking the vicinity, however. But there is a frog by a campfire, who tells you that everybody else has sought shelter underground, and hands you a drill so you can follow them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skydance New Media’s mysterious World War 2 Marvel game has a title: Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra. It also has its first trailer and a release window.
First announced in 2022, the game stars Captain America and Black Panther Azzuri, who is the grandfather of T’Challa. The trailer shows them pursuing the mutual goal of taking down the Nazis/Hydra, though for their own personal reasons. Hailing from different worlds, neither is particularly fond of the other's methods, which draws them into conflict. The game also stars Gabriel Jones of the Howling Commandos and Wakanda spy leader Nanali. First revealed at GDC, check out its first cinematic trailer below. 


Marvel 1943 is a linear single-player experience where you’ll occupy the roles of all four characters at various points, providing different perspectives on the narrative and the war. The project is led by Skydance president Amy Hennig, best known as the principle writer of the Uncharted franchise. 
Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is coming in 2025, though platforms are currently unknown. You can learn more about how Skydance is approaching the game’s storytelling by reading our 2022 interview feature with Amy Hennig and Skydance's story consultant, Marc Bernardin.]]></summary>

If you're a fan of Hotline Miami and have been itching for something similar on Switch, then the upcoming top-down shooter Otxo (pronounced 'oh-cho', by the way) could be one to keep an eye on.
Launching on 28th March, 2024, Otxo features a pixel art visual approach with a black and white colour palette; apart from the incredibly bright, gruesome blood, of course. Utilising a roguelike structure in which you can gain upgrades by purchasing various beverages, you'll be gunning down foes left and right with gameplay that isn't too dissimilar from Hotline Miami itself.

People play games for a variety of reasons. It could be that you want to experience a few thrills, get lost in a world beyond your imagination, or simply relax and wind down after the stresses of day-to-day life. Some games, however, are designed to test the very limits of your patience, inducing a level of anxiety that many would rather avoid at all costs. If you’re someone who thrives on tension and welcomes relentless challenges like a warm hug, then Krimson might just be the game for you.
Everything about developer CryingPsycho's platformer, from its visual design to its audio, has been designed to be a total assault on the senses, and for good reason. It takes place in a rather abstract depiction of hell, and your job is to simply make it through each level in one piece. We say “simply”, but nothing about Krimson is particularly simple. It’s an exceptionally tough game that, like Super Meat Boy and Celeste, utilises death as a means to educate the player on how to overcome its myriad challenges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma 2 is an RPG of many admirable qualities. I’m especially attached to my Arisen’s current pair of Pawns, one of whom speaks with the wonderfully stretched intonations of a pitch-shifted Matt Berry. Sadly, none of its achievements pertain to technical fidelity. While decent-looking, Dragon’s Dogma 2 takes some serious hardware to maintain consistently smooth performance, with lowered quality settings lending only the most limp-wristed of helping hands.
DLSS and FSR 3 upscaling are more effective, but this is one game where powering through the worst of its stuttering and framerate drops will take more than a musclebound graphics card. Not for the first time with an RE Engine game, Dragon’s Dogma 2 appears severely CPU-limited, so it really does demand a fully-upgraded rig to ward off sluggishness – especially at higher resolutions.
Improving performance isn’t a completely hopeless endeavour, but besides the FPS wobbles, there are some settings oddities that need navigating as well. I’ll cover all that and more in this guide; even if we can’t fix Dragon’s Dogma 2 ourselves, at least we can better understand its strangeness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know when you remember a game really fondly and instead of ageing alongside you, it becomes more modern in memory? The Dragon's Dogma 2 experience is, essentially, how I remember its predecessor Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. To me, DD2 feels like a remaster of the first, except it looks nicer, is more expansive, and features some rejigs to things like your AI pals.
Not that any of this is a bad thing! In fact, DD2's closeness to the original makes it just as much of a joy as the first, where your grand adventure isn't only grander, it's still at the whims of a world governed by chaotic physics and the passage of time. Quirks remain, for good and bad, but ultimately this is an RPG where you make travel plans and the game does it best to dash them. It never gets old.

Creating a sequel to a 12-year-old game is never an easy task. Recapturing the magic of the original while implementing modern technology and design strategies can mangle the core values that made the original special. Dragon’s Dogma 2 never loses sight of its roots, and constantly finds big and small ways to surprise me even 50 hours in. At its core, Dragon’s Dogma 2 captures a sense of adventure. While you’re the center point of the conflict and strife in the world, Dragon's Dogma 2 isn’t afraid to make you feel small. Around every bend, it…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball Sparking Zero had a big coming out party in the form of a 13-minute gameplay presentation that gave fans a nice look at its moment-to-moment combat. Bandai Namco showed off what's new, what's staying the same, and even revealed more characters joining the roster. 
Naturally, Goku and Vegeta square off to show off Sparking Zero’s combat. The 3D fighter retains the familiar behind-the-back style of its predecessors, but graphically speaking, the flashy ki blasts and transformations look better than ever. 


The presentation introduces four new mechanics. First up is Skill Count, a number that rises as you execute moves during the battle and is then spent to trigger special abilities. Revenge Counter lets players retaliate with a big attack in the midst of absorbing damage. Super Perception is a parry-type move that lets players deflect an attack at the last moment (such as Goku smacking away Vegeta’s Galick Gun), but doing this spends Skill Count points. Lastly, Vanishing Assaults are teleport-based attacks designed to close the gap at mid-range to keep the pressure on your opponent.
Dragon Ball Sparking Zero looks to have a massive roster of fighters (many of them variations of Goku and Vegeta), and the following characters are joining the line-up:
Broly (Super Saiyan Full Power)
Burter
Dyspo
Hit
Jeice
Kakunsa
Kale (Super Saiyan Berserk)
Master Roshi (Max Power)
Nappa
Super Trunks
Toppo

Dragon Ball Sparking Zero still doesn’t have a release window, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's deeply frustrating and disappointing when games get pulled from store shelves due to licenses expiring, and too few ever return. So it's great news that almost four years after Sega stopped selling Obsidian's fascinating spy thriller RPG Alpha Protocol on Steam due to music rights expiring, it has returned to sale on GOG. I'm always surprised that Alpha Protocol hasn't reached serious cult classic status because, as much as parts are distinctly wonky, the globetrotting sneak-o-shooter fizzes with ideas for intense dialogue, branching plot, and reputation systems with consequences. You do feel like a spy going up against the world, backed up only by shifty allies and a ridiculous pair of giant sunglasses.

We got the excellent Super Mario RPG late last year and the Mario vs. Donkey Kong remake in February, which was preceded by the Nintendo-published Another Code: Recollection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's highly publicized acquisition of Blizzard has had wide-reaching effects, and while some of them have been quite awful, this month showcases one of the upsides. Diablo IV, one of Blizzard's big 2023 releases, comes to Xbox Game Pass late next week, on March 28. We enjoyed the game quite a bit at launch, calling it a "massive and deeply engrossing action RPG," so if you've been waiting to check it out, now is a good time to do so.
This month also includes a trio of games built around cars, though the three are each very different. F1 23 simulates the realism and intensity of Formula 1 racing, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 is an arcade racer full of child-like wonder, and Open Roads (which will launch on Game Pass) is a quieter, narrative-driven game about a mother and her daughter going on a road trip. Maybe they'll help me on my journey of learning how to drive.
Here's the rest of the line-up:
What's Coming To Game Pass This Month
Lightyear Frontier (Game Preview) (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – Today
MLB The Show 24 (Cloud and Console) – Today

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just when I thought I was past being surprised by games adding battle royale modes, Blizzard today announced one for World Of Warcraft. Plunderstorm will drop 60 pirates onto the Arathi Highlands to fight monsters, loot chests, level up, acquire abilities, and beat the hell out of each other as a storm closes in. It's initially due to run only for several weeks and will use wholly separate characters, though you can unlock cosmetics for your main wizards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Later this week, Payload Studios' open world vehicular survival builder TerraTech Worlds launches into early access. As the name implies, it's a bigger, bolder and more ambitious take on their still very popular sandbox game TerraTech, but according to Payload's founder and CEO Russ Clarke, they're viewing this new version as more of a successor to TerraTech than a full-bodied sequel. "The overall quality of experience is really a huge leap forward," Clarke told me during a press presentation last week. "We're not calling it a sequel because we felt that making it a sequel would be a bit too constraining." Rather, it's "more of a reimagining" of the original game, says Clarke, with a change in engine and fresh investment from Tencent allowing them to reach the full potential of their original vision.

        <updated>2024-03-19T16:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, after months of rumors and speculation, LEGO (in partnership with Wizards of the Coast) revealed the first full look at the new Dungeons & Dragons-themed building set entitled Red Dragon’s Tale. The large 3,745-piece set is set to release on April 1 in LEGO stores and to those in the LEGO Insiders program. Everyone else can roll for initiative on snagging a set on April 4, for the price of $359.99.
Produced through the popular LEGO Ideas platform, where fans are able to submit their own build concepts that are then refined and produced as official sets, the final set includes a full dungeon and tower, a tavern, and six minifigures (including an Orc Rogue, Gnome Fighter, Elf Wizard, and Dwarf Cleric). Builders also get several iconic D&D monsters, including an owlbear, beholder, displacer beast, and, of course, the red dragon Cinderhowl, who acts as the centerpiece of the set.

Interestingly, LEGO is offering an actual D&D adventure book to LEGO Insiders as a free digital download or as a paperback book that can be purchased with 2,7000 Insider points. That same book will show up on D&D Beyond (Wizards of the Coast’s digital hub for D&D) complete with characters sheets and digital dice. Presumably, the idea is that you could play out the adventure with the included LEGO minifigs and monsters as the miniatures used on the table, which is a pretty slick way for dedicated players to capitalize on the completed build.
In addition to the larger set, LEGO also revealed plans for a full line of D&D-themed minifigures, launching in September 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn't have any particular expectations for Heart Machine's open world roguelike Hyper Light Breaker, but I wasn't expecting it to feel so... broken-up, I guess. In this sequel to 2016's alternately wistful and frenzied action-RPG, you are a debonair-looking sod with a hoverboard, paraglider, blades and guns, sent out into the procedurally generated realms of the Overgrowth to kill Abyss Kings, eat stat boosts and extract with loot.
The aforesaid hoverboard and glider, together with the streaking neon visual direction, suggest a game of fluid acrobatics, akin to the studio's last release Solar Ash, which, to quote Ed's review, "has you rollerblade around shattered worlds like a post apocalyptic gazelle on wheels". Perhaps that game exists deeper within Hyper Light Breaker, but during my 20 minutes with the game at GDC, I found myself stopping and starting and struggling to build momentum using a combat system that felt both deliberately challenging and stilted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The remake of the 1997 classic Riven is officially launching later this year. This modern facelift of the acclaimed sequel to Myst is also coming to VR.
Developed by Cyan Worlds, a team led by the masterminds of the original game, Riven is being remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. First announced in 2022, the game is promised to be a faithful homage that leverages modern tech to allow for immersive visuals, free movement, expanded storytelling, and new puzzles. Check out its latest teaser trailer below. 


Riven: The Sequel to Myst was first released in 1997 and has been hailed as a PC classic of the era. It's so beloved that an existing fan-driven remake, The Starry Expanse Project, was already in the works when Cyan Worlds announced this remake. Recognizing their efforts, Cyan Worlds worked with The Starry Expanse to incorporate their efforts into this official remake. 
Outside of PC, it's unclear which platforms, VR or otherwise, Riven will target. To keep up with similar projects, check out our Big List of Upcoming Video Game Remakes.]]></summary>

Eight years after its official launch, Stardew Valley remains one of the most popular games on the market right now, which is no surprise; whether you're marrying a neighbor, farming crops, or toiling away in the mines, it's a game with something for everyone. Its creator, solo developer ConcernedApe, has updated it with plenty of free patches over the years, adding multiplayer, new farm types, and more, but when he moved on to work on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier, the Stardew updates came to an end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Balatro, the hit poker-inspired roguelike deckbuilder, has hit 1 million sales within its first month of release. Publisher Playstack also revealed a mobile version is in development.
Created by solo developer LocalThunk, Balatro is a roguelike tasking players to play poker hands to fulfill score criteria and advance a series of rounds. Along the way, they’ll spend money to augment their deck with new cards with special effects while collecting powerful Jokers that bestow a wide range of passive and trigger abilities.  
The game has earned widespread acclaim and popularity since launching on February 20. I awarded it a 9.5 out of 10, writing in my review, “Balatro is an ingenious and entertaining roguelike and one of my favorite games of the year. Playing it has become a near-obsession; everything feels perfectly designed to encourage you to keep trying because that next run could be the run of your life. Even after hours of play, I still can’t overcome Balatro’s biggest challenge: putting it down.”


In a press release announcing the 1 million milestone, LocalThunk writes, 
“I'm so grateful to all the players and people that have made this happen. I still can't grasp the response to this game, and I am overjoyed that so many people have been able to have fun with my silly creation. I'm so fortunate that I can continue working on my passion as a career. Thank you!”
Balatro is currently available for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. There’s no release window for the impending mobile versions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyan Worlds today announced plans to launch their fancy real-time 3D remake of Riven later this year, coming with support for both VR cybergoggles and standard meatspace screens. Riven: The Sequel To Myst was the 1997 sequel to Myst, the 1993 pre-rendered adventure game which sold a million CD-ROM drives and launched a thousand specks of spittle from John Walker's mouth. The remake previously had a longwinded name of its own, Riven: New Discoveries Of The Lost D'ni Empire, but now is simply named Riven. They should rebrand again and call it Riven: The Sequel To The Myst Remake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detective Edward Carnby looks very different these days, and not only because he’s made of a lot more polygons. Gone are the professorial waistcoat and bow tie of his angular 1992 incarnation, replaced instead by the grubby suit of a life-bruised 1930s noir PI, complete with hipflask of brandy for when the stress of being unaccompanied with the lights out gets too much.
Carnby isn’t the only one who’s transformed in this reboot of Alone in the Dark, the classic survival horror avant la lettre, either. Veterans will find plenty of callbacks and familiar names as they poke around its Louisiana manor house – talk of the Pregzt Shipping Company might raise an eyebrow, for instance, as may the gnarled tree filling much of the conservatory. But like these, everything here is remixed, rewritten, relocated. Indeed, Decerto house is no longer empty but a ‘home for the mentally fatigued’, while player characters Carnby and Emily Hartwood now arrive together, since she’s hired him to help check on her uncle, a long-term resident who may be in danger.

Clearly, it was also a question on the minds on Japanese indie developers ThinkGames Inc, who have just announced their debut game Valiant Tactics EX. The 38-second long reveal trailer paints quite an enticing picture ahead of its Steam launch on March 29th, and that's not even the half of it either. For Valiant Tactics EX isn't just an anime Total War-like. It's also a whopping great deckbuilding game.

The program launches today in the Steam Beta Client and it replaces the Steam Family Sharing and Steam Family View features. 
Steam Families can have up to six members, and joining gives you access to any sharable games in each member's library. “Sharable games” is an important distinction, as Family Sharing is a feature that any developer can choose to opt out of for any reason at any time. Some games are also ineligible for sharing due to technical reasons. 
Noteworthy games currently eligible for Family Sharing include Helldivers 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Balatro, Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, and Hogwarts Legacy. You can read the full list here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Relative quiet over the past few months may have given the impression that Australia has lost interest in site-blocking injunctions. But just like waiting for a bus, suddenly two come along at once. The first aims to block Australians' view of more than 30 pirate sites, a disproportionate number serving the pirate anime market. A brand-new application sees Apple in a surprise partnership with Hollywood and Netflix, because everyone has exclusives to protect these days.

An entire generation of fighting game fans have been born, hit puberty, graduated college, found a career, and possibly started a family in the time between the last Fatal Fury game and the upcoming City of the Wolves. The most recent entry, Garou: Mark of the Wolves, was released in 1999 for arcades (and 2001 for Dreamcast in the West), meaning the series has been dormant for over 25 years. Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves sees the series make its long-awaited return, and it already feels ready to stand alongside the big boys of the genre.
I had a chance to play over an hour of City of the Wolves at the SNK World Championship Finals last weekend, where I also spoke with director Hayato Konya . Fatal Fury has been an arcade mai…]]></summary>

It helps that I'm hunting Bigfoot. Hefting my magical bow, I peer around a tree trunk at the creature as he wanders down a slope of vivid orange grass sprinkled with pale blue rock. I only have a couple of arrows in my quiver, which doesn't feel like nearly enough, so I edge across the hillside to another tree trunk, where I can hopefully line up a headshot.

Why are people angry that this character has seven fingers? Why does Nvidia want me to talk to a robot about ramen? Why is everyone saying AI is smart when it still can’t manage its Classical Era luxury resource economy in Civilization properly? In this new series, we’re going to explore what 'generative AI' is, why it’s arrived now in the games industry, and what it might mean for people who make, write about and play games in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Animal Well, the gorgeous indie metroidvania that will also be the first game published by Videogamedunkey's Bigmode, will hit PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC this May. More specifically, developer Shared Memory, which is just solo dev Billy Basso, revealed in a new gameplay trailer the game will launch on May 9. 
Dunkey revealed Big Mode, his own publishing arm, back in 2022, later announcing that Shared Memory's Animal Well would be the first game it publishes. Now, just shy of two years later, Animal Well will finally be in the hands of players in just a couple of months. 
Check out the Animal Well release date trailer for yourself below: 


"After nearly 7 years of development, Animal Well is finally almost ready to be released out into the world," Basso writes on X (formerly Twitter). "I have made this trailer to commemorate the occasion. I hope you like it. I don't really know what else to say." 
As you can see in the trailer above, Animal Well continues to look hauntingly gorgeous, and even kind of cute if you're a fan of spooky animals. We also get new glimpses of the game's metroidvania exploration, too, by way of a special yo-yo with a light that lures animals forward and more. Plus, there's a dog, which rules. 
Animal Well hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on May 9.

Well, it probably has something to do with looking like a sentient chicken nugget, I suppose. Come and watch the release date trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Amazon Spring Sale is back, refreshed and renamed as Amazon Spring Deal Days. Maybe because there’s so many of them: this flowery festival of buying stuff begins on Wednesday March 20th and runs all the way through Monday March 25th. And I thought Prime Day was getting too long, sheesh.
On the upside, this should mean more chances topick up some quality PC gaming hardware on the cheap. Been putting off that new SSD or graphics card upgrade? Spring Deal Days is likely your best opportunity to exploit mass discounts until Summer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SNK has released a new gameplay trailer for its upcoming fighter, Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, revealing it's due out in "early 2025" as well. This trailer arrives roughly half a year after SNK formally revealed Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in a trailer similar to today's, featuring Terry Bogard facing off against Rock Howard. 
That duo returns for another fight in the latest trailer, spotlighting the game's new "REV" system that features Rev Guard, Rev Blow, Rev Accel, and presumably more we'll learn about when the game is released next year. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves gameplay trailer below: 


Unfortunately, the trailer doesn't reveal anything else about the game, including platforms. Presumably, it will come to PlayStation and Xbox (possibly Switch), and PC. 
SNK will release Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in early 2025.
In the meantime, check out SNK's original tease for the game from 2022, and then watch the Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves reveal trailer from last year. 
After that, catch up on Game Informer's thoughts on the latest fighting game releases:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Next week sees the Game Developers Conference arrive in San Francisco along with our Edwin, who'll be sniffing for scoops and—I hope, for his sake—big burritos. My years of GDC left me devestated by the full realisation of how bad Mexican food is in the UK and I'm still not over it. Even the 'fancy' tacos and burritos you find nowadays cannot stand up to whichever burrito joint was closest to the BART station, especially as those were $7 and you'll pay £15 for a bad burrito here. Just. God. I miss them. I miss them so much. And the grackles. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on!

Variety has more details about these crewmembers, including quick descriptions of each: 
Red – Captain of The Skeld
People-pleaser, blowhard
Task: leadership, confidence
Fun fact: failed upwards
Purple  – Chief of Security
Safety, suspicion, sarcasm
Task: wet blanket
Fun fact: trust issues
Orange – HR
Spineless corporate shill
Task: eliminate redundancy, redundantly

Big Mouth and Star Trek: Lower Decks studio Titmouse is the animation studio for this series, which has Owen Dennis as the show's creator and executive producer.
"Members of your crew have been replaced by an alien shapeshifter intent on causing confusion, sabotaging the ship, and killing everyone," the CBS series logline reads, according to Variety. "Root out the 'Impostor' or fall victim to its murderous designs." 
Variety reports that there is no network or streamer attached to the show.

I've only seen three of them so far, out of its total of eight, but it's immediately obvious just how much of a step-up these places are compared to the dusty plains and rolling hills of the most recent Final Fantasy game to hit PC, FF15. An obvious take, perhaps, given that FF15 first came out eight years ago in 2016, but I'm sure anyone (all right, mainly me) who's ever despaired at Noctis' seeming inability to climb even the smallest hillock in front of him, or how everyone always rides right into your backside while gunning about on a chocobo, will feel some m…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Combat is such a routine activity in video games that it often doesn't feel much like conflict at all. It's just something done to move the simulation along - a propulsive chore stripped of drama or significance or lasting emotion beyond a vague desire to see what lies beyond whatever it is you're trying to kill. In Death Of A Wish, combat has substance: it's a form of redemptive self-expression. The game's fights are a means of asserting and cherishing yourself in the face of a world that regards you as a deviant, a world whose poison you carry on the inside.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma 2 is right around the corner, launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next week on March 22. Ahead of the game's launch, Capcom has released a new gameplay overview trailer with more than seven minutes of new footage; and perhaps strangely, it's narrated by actor Ian McShane (Deadwood, John Wick, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides). 
Broken up into three sections in the video, McShane discusses "The Hero" of Dragon's Dogma 2, the "Two Nations," and, of course, "The Monsters" that players will be killing plenty of during their journey. 
Check it out for yourself in the Dragon's Dogma 2 gameplay overview trailer below: 


Dragon's Dogma 2 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 22, 2024. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's hands-on Dragon's Dogma 2 preview, and then check out this story about how Dragon's Dogma 2's main story campaign is about the same length as the first game. After that, read about how Dragon's Dogma 2 has an uncapped framerate but no visual presets or modes on consoles, and then check out this story about why Dragon's Dogma 2 has just one save file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is right around the corner, hitting Xbox Series X/S exclusively on May 21, and ahead of the game's release, Ninja Theory has revealed it will have a dedicated photo mode. Plus, the studio released four new images of Hellblade II taken using the game's photo mode. 
While in-game photo modes are becoming the norm more and more with each new release, there are still some games that launch without one. With how good Hellblade II continues to look in trailers and screenshots, it's great to hear the game will feature this mode. 
Check out the four new Hellblade II images taken using the game's photo mode for yourself below: 

Based on the tweet revealing the photo mode, it sounds like players can expect it to launch with the game. 
"Photo mode returns in Senua's Saga: Hellblade II," a Ninja Theory tweet reads. "Here are some shot we took purely using photo mode in-game this week." 
Senua's Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S on May 21, 2024. 
For more about the game, watch the latest Senua's Saga: Hellblade II trailer, and then check out this gameplay trailer from December. After that, watch this other gameplay trailer for another look at the game's action.

It's one of those rereleases that exists mostly for modern consoles, made a bit useless on PC by the fact that you can still buy and fully play the originals for half the price. It's made even less useful by launching in a right wonky technical state, with bad lag, crashes, and reportedly only three 64-player servers online at first.

I don't mean to assume, but let's face it, it's probably your phone, where some idle doomscrolling likely awaits you, or some other, time-wasting distraction that will help fill the dead air between one task and the next. Well, While Waiting is a game that delves into precisely this fundamental human question: what is the best thing to do while waiting for something else to happen? It's from the makers of the very good puzzle game Moncage, and its newly released Steam demo is a pure, fidgety brilliance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My day in Lightyear Frontier starts out with a bit of farming. On a good day, it’s raining, so I don’t need to water the crops. On a bad day, there are weeds spontaneously spawning from the sky and I need to catch them before they land right on top of my precious plants. Either way, when I’m done, I’ll put the day’s harvest into the processing machines to work while I’m away, and then go exploring for minerals.
My goals are clear. I need to build a new machine, or upgrade my mech so that I can clean up a new area of the map and get new resources in return. Those will – you guessed it – let me build new machines or upgrade my mech again. There might be a few steps to juggle on the way, but nothing that needs me to hold long recipe flowcharts in my head. When I get back I’ll have everything I need to take the next step. It always feels like I’m making forward progress.

Having spent months of stubbornly maining Veteran and sticking as closely as possible to FPS convention, I’ve since found peace in the simple act of swinging knives/swords/giant electrified hammers into and through people. Mainly because it’s not so simple: for all its chaotic spectacle, the meleeing in Darktide (this month’s RPS Game Club star) works because it’s secretly been a rhythm game.

Last month, we learned that Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal, was reportedly set to sell Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake developer Saber Interactive. The deal apparently carried with it a $500 million price tag, according to a Bloomberg report. 
Now, it's official: Embracer has sold off Saber Interactive to a group of private investors under Beacon Interactive, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. Beacon Interactive is controlled by Saber Interactive co-founder Matthew Karch, the publication reports.

Shortly after the game's launch on March 14, players across all platforms (but especially PC), experienced server issues preventing them from getting into matches as well as other connectivity issues like disconnects, rubberbanding, and more once actually in a match. The result was a wave of disappointment from players excited to play these classic multiplayer games. Now, a day later, Aspyr has acknowledged the issues and is working to fix them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gameloft, the studio behind Disney Dreamlight Valley, has revealed it is partnering with Wizards of the Coast to create a new Dungeons & Dragons game. It's being developed for both consoles and PC and Gameloft describes it as an "innovative hybrid of survival, life simulation, and action RPG."
Disney Dreamlight Valley is popular in the life sim genre, mixing fun gameplay, unique customization, and Disney together into a package that players seem to really enjoy. It launched into Early Access back in 2022 before the full release debuted in December. All of this is to say: if you're a fan of Disney Dreamlight Valley and Dungeons & Dragons, there's a new game to keep an eye on. 
Currently untitled, Gameloft says in its announcement on Instagram that the game is set in the mythical Forgotten Realms, which is also the D&D setting Baldur's Gate 3 takes place in. The game, which will mix survival, life simulation, and action RPG elements into one, will feature "unique cooperative gameplay," the studio says. 
"Players can expect an adventure where the rich lore of this legendary franchise meets real-time strategy in a unique campaign of resilience, camaraderie, and danger at nearly every turn," the announcement reads." 
There's no name for the project and no release window either. Gameloft is currently hiring for the project. 
News of this D&D game arrives roughly a year after Wizards of the Coast, which owns the D&D IP and is a division within Hasbro, reportedly canceled five unannounced games. The last D&D game released was Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance back in 2021 – read Game Informer's review of it here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2's Cutting Edge Premium warbond, aka DLC battle pass, is now available to buy in-game, and it is chock-full of oddball gadgetry such as lightning shotguns, burst-fire laser rifles and experimental armour. As with the Arc Thrower stratagem, the lightning shotgun fires arcs of electricity that conduct between players and enemies alike, but there's a fresh armour perk, Electrical Conduit, which reduces arc damage by 95%, allowing close-knit teams of Helldivers to roll around the battlefield frazzling themselves without much penalty. 
Still, I think the real star pick here is surely the Localization Confusion booster, which extends the time between enemy spawns, allowing weirdo solo players such as myself to disentangle from a dragged-out gunfight a little more gracefully.

In fairness, the newly revealed Open (or Opthreen), an RPO-themed metaverse battle royale thing, does look, sound, feel, and smell horrible, so a solid chunk of this week’s Electronic Wireless Show podcast is just us despairing over it. But there’s also some honest-to-goodness games chat, as we field a question from EWS listener Pete (thanks Pete!) on the games our younger selves were parentally forbidden from playing – and how we feel about them as ostensible grownups.

While Sega's Japanese social media account shared a photo of a Red statue standing alongside Sega's other mascots (see below), we haven't seen the acquisition impact the games to this point. That changed today, as Sega and Rovio announced a multi-game crossover event between Sonic and Angry Birds on mobile devices.
The crossover event even comes with its own storyline, which includes a plot to steal the Angry Birds' eggs that accidentally creates a portal between the world of Angry Birds and Sonic's world. Sonic, Red, and their friend groups must work together across five mobile titles to stop Dr. Eggman. The event will include new playable characters, cross-brand c…]]></summary>

Today Gameloft announced they're making a D&D game offering a "hybrid of survival, life simulation and action RPG". They don't have much more to share about the game, not even a name, so presumably it won't be out for some time. Whatever it might be, it's headed to PC and consoles.

While Embracer have yet to actually state this out loud, it sounds like the KOTOR remake will be a "joint project" between Saber and Embracer. It also probably won't be out in the next 12 months. Given the project's repeated disruptions and delays, I suspect many of us will settle for the game coming out at all.

That's according to a new "Notice of End of Sales" post on the game's Steam page. From Friday, March 29, 2024, onward, the game will no longer be available for purchase in Japan on the storefront. 
However, online play will remain available after the game's delisting, and purchased copies of the collection will remain available for re-download from the Steam store. 
Released less than two years ago on August 30, 2022, on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, The Cowabunga Collection getting delisted so soon comes as a shock. However, it's seemingly only affecting TMNT players in Japan. Game Informer reached out to publisher Konami to ask if there are plans to delist the game outside …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your eye over the original Outcast from 1999 today, and you'll find a world that's more abstract than alien. Hazy, almost block colour textures are stretched to breaking point over terrain that looks like it's been pulled and poked by a child sculpting in putty slime, while its cast of beige, three-fingered Talans are so rigid that they'd all be reigning champions at the local robot dance-off. Understandable, given the era in which is was made, but even so - what a difference 25 years make. Even after 2017's remake glow-up with Outcast: Second Contact, A New Beginning's version of Adelpha is a lush and verdant paradise, with treetops soaring over your head, and mountains requiring several triple or quadruple jetpack jumps to traverse. It's no Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, admittedly, but it leans in very much the same direction, punching your eyeballs with such bright, primary colours that you'll feel enticed to explore every inch of it.
A shame, then, that all its visual splendour amounts to is little more than an empty husk filled with open world busy work that already felt tired and done ten years ago. Its non-linear approach to storytelling remains intact, letting you tackle the quests and problems of its numerous village settlements in any order you wish, but even this has been boiled down to tedious checklists of fetch quests, escort missions and shooting up the same identikit facility one after another. Topping off this fatal combo is returning protagonist Cutter Slade, whose macho army dude dial is still set firmly to cringey wise-cracking and patronising stereotypes. A new beginning this ain't.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The creators of RuneScape, Andrew and Paul Gower, have revealed Brighter Shores, a new point-and-click fantasy adventure MMORPG. And if you're a fan of RuneScape, Brightet Shores looks like a game you'll want to keep an eye on. 
After starting Jagex in 1999, the Gower brothers focused their efforts on the studio's first big release: RuneScape. The rest is history. RuneScape is still a very popular game today, both in its modern form and as Old School RuneScape. The Gowers left Jagex in 2010 and little was known about what they were up to until now. It turns out Andrew Gower was working as the lead designer on their new game, while Paul Gower was working as the narrative designer for it.

Luckily for me and you, we’ll be able to give it a go for free for the next week, as the game’s pre-alpha playtest is now live over on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Ubisoft Montpellier's excellent metroidvania, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, hit consoles and PC in January, and it's still one of Game Informer's top scoring reviews of the year. You can read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review here to find out why we love it so much. Now, Ubisoft is giving players another reason to jump back in with a new post-launch content roadmap. 
What's more, all of the new content coming to the game is set to release throughout the year, starting with new Speedrun and Permadeath modes this month as well as new outfits for Sargon. In spring, a Boss Rush will be released alongside even more outfits for Sargon, and in summer, the Divine Trials update brings new combat, platform, and puzzle challenges as well as new amulets, outfits, and more. All of this will be free, too. 
However, later in 2024, new paid story DLC will hit Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, although Ubisoft offers no teases about what to expect. 
It's an exciting roadmap, doubly so considering the majority of the new content is free. 
For more, read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review, and then check out our breakdown of the four ways Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown gets the metroidvania genre right. After that, check out this guide about how to beat Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's hardest platforming challenge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In some respects, Helldivers 2 did come as a bit of surprise. Not a huge amount of marketing, no betas, and review codes didn't go out until it basically launched. Before it landed on my PC, there was a small part of me that thought it was going to be a rocky ride with severe performance issues or the like. Nope! It's easily slid into one of my favourite games of the year without question, and presumably, for the hundreds of thousands of others who've also opted into preserving democracy.
But there seems to be this sentiment that Helldivers 2's roaring success has come as a shock, so much of a shock that top execs and investors are doing YouTube thumbnail faces in boardrooms with mini-nuke explosions erupting from their heads. Should its success come as that much of a surprise, though? No, probably not.

This was surprising, because while I'd been broadly positive about the vibes of Vampire Therapist, I was reasonably concerned about the specifics of how it would all shake down. But it turned out that the critical perspective was something Nemati appreciated, and so we had a chat that dug down into the meat of it all. Although I was initially interested in how he'd come up with the idea of a vampire therapist, it turns out all roads lead back to Twilight's Edward Cullen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios quietly snuck flying Terminid bugs into the game in the latest update, it seems. Windows Central noticed flying Shrieker bugs are enemies that appear on planets plagued with Terminids and while official accounts for the game play coy, more and more players are running into them. 
It seems the Shriekers were added with Patch 1.000.102, which went live yesterday. Coincidentally, that patch was centered on Terminids and nerfing spawn rates for Bile Titans and Chargers on the harder difficulties of Helldivers 2. Windows Central reports Shriekers only appear when a "Shrieker Lair" is one of the side objectives on a planet, noting they look like "smaller versions of the mushroom-like Spore Towers that perpetually keep a large area around them covered in a thick haze." 


Shrieker Lairs, like the Spore Towers and Terminid egg nests can be destroyed up close and from afar with a well-placed rocket, grenade, or strategem. 
Keep your eyes on the skies, Helldivers and remember...DEMOCRACY.
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about a recent patch that introduced meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the game. After that, check out the Cutting Edge Warbond coming to the game tomorrow.

It's "built upon the principles of freedom, consequence, and mastery within a living universe", and "represents the next step in CCP Games' journey to create virtual worlds more meaningful than real life", which, you know, wind your neck in.

I mean, I kind of refuse to believe that hard-boiled future crime detective James Karra saying "I'm in the business of secrets... But it's more of an addiction... And I like 'em straight...

This new mode, dubbed Single Player+, lets three players journey together through the story of Sea of Stars, and it will feature new traversal and combat mechanics to accommodate playing with friends. 
Sabotage announced this news today with a special teaser trailer you can watch below. In it, you'll get a glimpse of what Sea of Stars' Single Player+ mode looks like, how it works, and what to expect. Check it out: 


"Staying true to the game's core turn-based roots, each player will engage in traversal and combat with a new 'co-op timed hits' mechanic as they embark with friends on Sea of Stars' grand adventure," a press release reads. "The new mode is currently in development and more details are set to be released soon." 
As you can see, Sabotage isn't quite ready to reveal when this new mode will hit the game. After all, the team is still working on Throes of the Watchmaker, a new DLC coming to the game sometime in the future. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Sea of Stars review, and then read Game Informer's Sea of Stars cover story for behind-the-scenes details about the game's development.

Players can sign-up via a Google Form now if they wish, though Pocketpair stress that "the testing branch is not intended for free play or experiencing new content early, so we hope that only those of you genuinely interested in bug hunting and testing will apply." And presumably, those genuinely interested in also not being paid for their free QA support.

If there was ever a reason to return to Dark Souls 3, this is probably it.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/13/new-playstation-5-update-enhances-dualsense-audio-share-screen-and-more"/>
        <updated>2024-03-13T12:30:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation is rolling out a new update for the PlayStation 5 that enhances audio on the DualSense controller, adds new Share Screen features, and more. This update was in beta last month but rolls out for everyone starting today. 
The biggest features are coming to the PS5's DualSense controller. The built-in speakers can now produce higher volume sound, which PlayStation says will allow players to hear in-game sounds and voice chat audio more clearly. Plus, the noise cancellation on the controller's built-in mic has been improved. 


"The mic input quality on these controllers has been improved, courtesy of a new A.I. machine learning model," a PlayStation Blog post reads. "Background noise from button presses and game audio are suppressed, resulting in a better voice chat experience."
Share Screen is also getting some new features with today's update. Namely, viewers can move a pointer around and send a ping or draw a line on a shared screen, allowing them to highlight objects in-game or guide a player. Plus, viewers can now send emoji-based reactions to the host's screen – these features are turned off by default and the host and viewer must turn them on. PlayStation says these Share Screen features will hit the PS App, which also allows Share Screen, later this month. 
Finally, today's update allows users to adjust the brightness of the PS5 power indicator. Simply go to Settings, then Beep and Light, and then Brightness. 


For more, read about the last big PS5 update that added Dolby Atmos, larger SSD capacity, and more to the console, and then check out this story about a retailer listing of a "V2 DualSense" with a 12-hour battery life. After that, read about how the PS5 surpassed 50 million units in December, and then check out Game Informer's top 10 PS5 games to play right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stealth games in which you can become "one with the shadows" cover a wide range, though I guess spectrum is the more appropriate word here. You've got sober infiltration games like Thief, which metes out gradations of light and dark with the care of somebody calculating their tax expenses, and stylised affairs such as Mark Of The Ninja, in which stepping into shadow desaturates you and sort of makes your character far too fancy for enemies to notice.
There are games such as Splinter Cell, in which hiding in shadows rests on a gentleman's agreement with NPCs not to perceive the big green torches attached to Sam Fisher's head. And then you have games like Ereban: Shadow Legacy, which has just been given a release date - 10th April. In this mystical third-person stealth-platformer, your character can literally disintegrate and travel through shadows as a ripple of dark energy - a transformation that puts me in mind less of Thief than of squid-mode in Nintendo's Splatoon.

        <updated>2024-03-13T04:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who is Jeff Minter? Unless you’re a long-term fan of his work, you might have asked that upon hearing about Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story, the latest interactive documentary from Digital Eclipse (following on from The Making Of Karateka and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration). You might have heard Minter’s name in connection with the remake of the unreleased Atari arcade game Akka Arrh in 2023. Maybe you played his mind-warping shooter Polybius in VR. You might remember as far back as the Atari Jaguar and Minter’s phenomenal Tempest 2000, the unexpected highlight of the console’s library. Or perhaps you recall his work from the 8-bit glory days. You could just know him from the daily videos of him feeding his sheep on YouTube.


The point is that Jeff Minter has been making games for a phenomenally long time – more than 40 years, in fact. And in all that time, he has stayed true to what he believes in. “One of the things we say in the game itself is the idea of him being the last indie developer,” says Chris Kohler, editorial director at Digital Eclipse in California. “The last of the people from the early 80s who very consciously never sold out, never took the money, never looked to expand or do anything other than [be] just Jeff at his computer, making the sorts of video games that he wants to make.”

Draw from enough unique inspirations, and eventually, a game begins to feel entirely novel. That’s the sensation that emerges as you play Unicorn Overlord, Vanillaware’s vast fantasy adventure of tactics, strategy, and storytelling. I was consistently reminded of other systems and mechanics from prior genre releases, but the resulting combination felt consistently original and entertaining, even after many hours of battle and exploration.

As unlikely as it may sound, LaLiga may have no evidence that any subscriber did anything wrong, so ISPs have been instructed to find some.

The remake today is in great shape on PC, and players should expect a well-made retread of the classic game. This remake had been in the works for years before its PC release last year – check out the game in a pre-alpha state in 2016 here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you ask any Final Fantasy fan what their top five favorite songs in the franchise are, there's a 99 percent chance one of them is "To Zanarkand" from Final Fantasy X. However, it turns out, it wasn't originally intended for the game. 
This news comes from Audrey (aitaikimochi on X, formerly Twitter), a mega Final Fantasy fan, Twitch streamer, and CEO of Aitai Japan Inc., who translated a recent interview between Weekly Ochiai and Final Fantasy X composer Nobuo Uematsu, whose credits also include One-Winged Angel and Aerith's Theme from Final Fantasy VII and so much more. In that interview, Uematsu revealed "To Zanarkand" originally began as a piece for a French flute player, meant to be played during a recital. 


"'To Zanarkand' was actually not meant to be the theme for Final Fantasy X," Uematsu tells Weekly Ochiai, as translated by Audrey on X. "There was a flute player from France who originally asked me to write a song for them to play during a recital. When I wrote the piece, I thought perhaps this sounded a bit too sad for a recital. So I set it aside for the time being. 
"Sometime after, when I was making the score of Final Fantasy X, I was falling behind all the while the producers were hounding me. So since that flute piece was unused, I just kind of meekly handed it to them. They listened to it and said, 'Yes! This is brilliant!'" 
In retrospect, it's wild "To Zanarkand" wasn't originally composed by Uematsu for Final Fantasy X because it fits the game's themes so well, nailing the somber and sad tone present throughout Tidus and Yuna's journey in Spira. 
For more about Final Fantasy music, read Game Informer's exclusive four-part series on composer Masayoshi Soken's score for last year's Final Fantasy XVI:
Part 1: Creating The Prelude
Part 2: The Victory Fanfare
Part 3: Finding A Main Theme
Part 4: The Sound

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday’s Capcom Highlights Day 2 presentation gave us our first look at Akuma before he joins Street Fighter 6 sometime this spring. The master of the Satsui no Hado serves as the game’s final Year 1 DLC fighter.
A cinematic trailer shows off the now white-haired Akuma’s new look and his apparent mastery of the art of punching giant statues to rubble. We’ll have to wait to see gameplay, but this teaser certainly sets the mood for the brooding warrior. 


Akuma joins previous Year 1 characters Rashid, A.K.I., and Ed, and Capcom plans to detail Year 2 content later this year. In the meantime, be sure to check out our Street Fighter 6 review.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/12/starbreeze-studios-ceo-out-less-than-six-months-after-payday-3-launch"/>
        <updated>2024-03-12T14:16:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starbreeze Studios CEO Tobias Sjögren is no longer with the studio and the Payday 3 developer is now recruiting for a new leader. This news comes from a recent notice to investors that explains board member Juergen Goeldner is taking over as interim CEO in the meantime, as reported by GameDeveloper. 
While Starbreeze's messaging around Sjögren's leave isn't super clear – the team simply says it is bidding farewell to the former CEO – today's news arrives after Payday 3 failed to meet expectations, according to GameDeveloper. 


"On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to thank Tobias Sjögren for his achievements during the past three years," board chairman Torgny Hellström writes in the notice to investors. "Tobias took over the helm of Starbreeze in a challenging phase of its journey and we wish him well in his future endeavors."
Goeldner, the new interim CEO, adds, "Starbreeze has a strong history of developing and publishing games globally. After launching Payday 3, the company is well-positioned to leverage the strengths of the organization to monetize and develop the IP portfolio. I am looking forward to assuming an operative position and, together with the management, ensure the execution of this strategy."
Goeldner has 40 years of experience in the games industry, including several executive positions, according to the notice. His last executive position was as CEO of Focus Home Interactive. He has been a member of Starbreeze's board of directors since last year. Starbreeze has initiated a recruitment process for a permanent CEO. 


Payday 3 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 21. We enjoyed the game around launch, giving it an 8 out of 10 in the Game Informer Payday 3 review. More than 3 million people played Payday 3 in its first month, but the game still failed to meet the expectations of the studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moon Studios co-founder and tech and production director Gennadiy Korol has revealed the team's upcoming action-RPG, No Rest for the Wicked, which is also the game on Game Informer's cover this month, will not require an online connection to play single-player. Although, if you've read our cover story about the game, you already know this, and you also know you can play the game with up to three friends on a shared living server.
What's more, Korol says the game will feature "a rich Offline Mode" for those not interested in the game's multiplayer elements.


Korol announced this today on X (formerly Twitter), expanding on Moon's thoughts about No Rest for the Wicked as both a single-player and multiplayer game. 
"Even though Wicked was built from the ground up with multiplayer in mind, we did not want offline-play to feel like a second thought and we want people to be able to play on the go when connection quality is not always ideal," Korol writes. "Our April 18th [Early Access launch on PC] will focus on the single player experience and we will be sharing more details about the Multiplayer aspect of the game later in our Early Access campaign." 


Game Informer has played hours of No Rest for the Wicked, so far only in single-player, and it's been a blast. You can read our preview thoughts on the game's opening hours here, and you can watch it for yourself in our No Rest for the Wicked New Gameplay Today.
Read about No Rest for the Wicked's early access roadmap and Cerim's Crucible endgame content after that, and for even more exclusive content, head to Game Informer's No Rest for the Wicked coverage hub.

In the early 2000s, tennis video games were everywhere. Whether you were talking mass-appeal titles like Virtua Tennis and Mario Tennis or more niche, lower-budget games like Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament and Hard Hitter Tennis, the market was absolutely flooded with choices. One of the most beloved of this era was 2003's Top Spin, which started as an Xbox exclusive before making the leap to PS2 and PC in subsequent years. Since that inaugural game, Top Spin has seen three more numbered entries, all receiving high review scores.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.
The program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.
Like last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.
ScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.
We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.
Based on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.
Looking forward to hearing from you!

He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed.
