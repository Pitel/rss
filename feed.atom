        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And it's very soon.
TRAGsoft's Pokémon-like RPG Coromon has a brand new release date of 21st July, publisher Freedom Games has announced. The game was originally due to be released on Switch back in March, but due to cross-platform multiplayer issues, the game was delayed on the console.
Coromon was meant to hit the Switch on the same day as the game's Steam release, but the team needed time to work out the issues with multiplayer. Now, those are seemingly fixed and fans of monster-catching games can relax and they'll have a brand new adventure to embark on in just two weeks time!

The world of Aionios is in a perpetual state of war, endlessly engulfed in flame and littered with corpses. Countries Keves and Agnus love to hate each other, and both factions' armies pay the price. To make matters worse, these seemingly mass-produced soldiers are cursed with short, 10-year lifespans. The goal, then, is to endure front-line service and be forever immortalized in the Homecoming ceremony, an honorable send-off for Aionios' most tenacious survivors. 
I meet Noah, Eunie, and Lanz, during the latter stage of their lifespans (or terms). The leading trio has slain their fair share of Agnusians and watched many beloved…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peter Weller is on board
Yes, there's a RoboCop game on the way, and not to jinx us, but it looks good! Nacon and Teyon — who you might remember from another recent licensed game, Terminator: Resistance — debuted the RoboCop: Rogue City gameplay trailer at Nacon Connect 2022.
It's hard to adapt a perfect movie into a video game, but they're going for it.
https://youtu.be/jQ2hZ-4JCTE
In line with the 1987 movie, OmniCorp has taken control of the Detroit Police Department, and it's now on RoboCop to clean up the streets by popping scumbags' heads. Today's gameplay trailer showed several first-person skirmishes, including RoboCop's iconic targeting system, and I hope Teyon goes all the way with the HUD elements.
I'm not expecting glossy high-budget FPS action, but that's okay if they nail the little details. If this one's "for the fans," that'll be fine. I hope it's widely enjoyable, though.
"You have the power to decide how to fulfill prime directives in your own way, but as the story unfolds proceed with caution because corruption and greed know no limit," according to the summary. It's also confirmed that RoboCop himself, Peter Weller, will return for "voiceover work on the game." It's a check they needed to write, for sure.
The Steam page has a few more screenshots, including one with ED-209.

Remember those directives
I'm curious what kind of progression this game might have — how do you make RoboCop feel powerful without going overboard? To be honest, I wouldn't mind being totally OP. As the crime wave escalates, I'm sure OCP's heavy weaponry will come out in full force.
RoboCop: Rogue City is in development for PC (Steam and the Epic Games Store), PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch. (I was surprised by that last one, but there's a logo and everything at the end of the trailer.) It's launching in June 2023, and I'm hopeful.

While Cult of the Lamb's impending August 11 release was already confirmed, a few noteworthy reveals and updates should have indie fans on PlayStation excited for the near future and beyond. Here's a quick rundown of the games making their way to PS5 and PS4. 


Inscryption
One of the best and most surprising games of 2021 makes its way to consoles for the first time. The PS5/PS4 version of the horror deck builder features exclusive features, such as the talking Stoat card's audio coming through the controller speaker, haptic feedback support, and atmospheric lighting that, accordion to creator Daniel Mullens, "spills out from your controller."

Bards are officially rocking the stage in Baldur's Gate 3. Larian Studios is adding the Bard class to Baldur's Gate 3 today, alongside Gnomes as a playable race and more updates in Patch 8.
Shown off during the Panel From Hell, Bards can spur on the party and wreak havoc with their music. They can inspire teammates to greater heights, or just insult the enemy to bring them down. And crucially, they can rock a tune.
The Bard will get two subclasses, under the College of Valour and College of Lore. Valour Bards get Combat Inspiration, allowing them to stir something within their allies to add a bit to their prowess. That something being an extra D6 bonus on their next Attack Roll, Ability Check, or Saving Throw.

The original Live A Live is full of iconic music, and as the first project that Yoko Shimomura worked on after joining Square Enix, the soundtrack has cemented itself in video game history. That means the remake has some big shoes to fill, but from the trailers, it sounds like the music is going to be a dream.
To hype us up even more for the upcoming Live A Live remake's music, producer (and director of the original) Takashi Tokita sat down with singer Hironobu Kageyama — who's known for singing the openings to several shows such as Dragon Ball Z and various Sentai shows — to talk about one particularly iconic song, Go!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stay out of trobble
Nacon is getting set to kick off its summer Nacon Connect live stream, offering updates, trailers, and reveals pertaining to the publisher's upcoming wares. The action will kick off in about 15 minutes' time and is expected to run for around an hour in length. You can check out the action in the stream below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwkTwMa3c-A
Nacon has been pretty forthcoming about the titles it will be spotlighting during the stream. We can expect new updates on robo-revolution title Steelrising, Lord of the Rings adventure Gollum, racers Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown and WRC Generations, and Games Workshop's ultra-violent sports sim Blood Bowl III. We will also be hearing about several new Xbox accessories in development in Nacon's hardware division, including the Daija Arcade Stick and the snazzy Pro Compact Colorlight controller.
Perhaps the most intriguing title on the lineup is RoboCop: Rogue City, which was first revealed during last summer's Nacon Connect live stream. Developed by studio Teyon of Terminator: Resistance fame, we still know so little about Alex Murphy's latest jaunt into the digital realm. Though RoboCop, as a franchise, seems custom-designed for video games, the brand has always struggled to truly recreate the cinematic excellence of Paul Verhoeven's 1987 classic.
While Teyon's Terminator title admittedly left something to be desired from a gameplay standpoint, it was clear that the studio does understand the potential buried within these enduring cinematic licenses. Fingers crossed that the developer will deliver the goods with RoboCop: Rogue City, and that we'll see some promising gameplay footage today.
Join us on Destructoid this lunchtime and we can see what's in store. You have 15 minutes to comply.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fine line between stupid and... and clever
In news spotted by GamesIndustry.biz, PlayStation will be removing certain purchased content from certain user accounts next month, citing "evolving licensing agreements with content providers."
The content in question belongs to movie publisher Studio Canal, whose titles will be removed from the German and Austrian versions of PSN on August 31. Not only will this render some 100 films unavailable for purchase, but users who have previously purchased the affected content will also be unable to access the films once this date passes. You can check out the full list of affected films here — remember, this (currently) only affects German and Austrian PlayStation users.
The Studio Canal situation is an inevitable part of PlayStation's shuttering of PSN's movie rental/purchase market. While the discontinuation of film purchases came into effect in the spring of 2021, the continuing "rolling over" of licenses suggests that Sony will be forced to come to terms of closure with each and every studio that has offered its film and TV properties for purchase. Clearly the agreement between PlayStation and Studio Canal has come to an end.
Of course, there are a lot of specificities here. We are, for now, only talking about purchased content involving one particular studio in two particular territories. But the prevailing concern is obviously focused more on the fact that publishers of any digital content — music, film, gaming, TV — have the essential right to remove and/or withhold access to any and all paid content at the drop of a hat. This may not be the last time such a story crops up in our headlines.

It's time for another remaster, as the confusingly named Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series hits the Switch eShop on July 8.

Amid some spinoffs and a Wii remake in 2008, the series has remained dormant until the 25th anniversary of Reverie this year. Time on Frog Island, which debuts on July 12 on the eShop, is the other big game Nintendo is highlighting this week.
The eShop is full of smaller games, though! We're back in full force with 48 additional SKUs, which is actually around 50 if you account for a few things like the Little Nightmares bundle packing in two games, or the aforementioned releases. Expect our review of Klonoa Phanta…]]></summary>

The Entertainment Software Association is set to host E3 again, and it's partnering with ReedPop to make it happen. Today, the two announced that E3 2023 will be organized with ReedPop's help.
ReedPop is the company behind PAX, New York Comic-Con, EGX, and the Star Wars Celebration. It's also the parent company of several gaming sites. including GamesIndustry.biz and Eurogamer. (Disclosure: I was previously employed by ReedPop at USgamer.)
The duo plans to host E3 2023 in the Los Angeles Convention Center again, during the second week of June 2023.
https://twitter.com/E3/status/1545046476597956608
The event will host digital showcases and in-person components too, which will be open to consumers. Further details, like confirmed exhibitors, will be shared in the coming months.
"It is a tremendous honor and privilege for ReedPop to take on the responsibility of bringing E3 back in 2023," said ReedPop president Lance Festerman. "With the support and endorsement of the ESA, we're going to build a world-class event to serve the global gaming industry in new and broader ways than we already do at ReedPop through our portfolio of world leading events and websites."
A new union
This partnership is wild, but also makes sense. E3 has fully called off two shows since the outbreak of COVID-19, in 2020 and 2022. And in 2021, the ESA hosted a digital-only event. PAX dealt with some called-off shows too, but has been returning to the convention space with events like PAX East 2022 and the upcoming PAX West.
Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley has been growing Summer Game Fest more each year. This year included both a stage show and an in-person event in Los Angeles. And, as the event republicized today, Summer Game Fest will be returning in June 2023 with both digital and in-person events. Looks like E3 will have some competition for its big return.

Elsewhere, Gran Turismo 7 has rejoined the top ten, marking the only blip in an otherwise Switch-centric offering. Mario Strikers: Battle League is still clinging on in last place, though with the release of KLONOA Phantasy Reverie Series this week, the soccer title will likely drop further for next week's charts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[They started with Dark Souls 3, and almost quit after the first boss
To quickly recap, shortly after the launch of Elden Ring, a legend was born among players. Their name is Let Me Solo Her: a user who logged in, fought the hardest boss in the game by themselves, and assisted others in getting a clear. They did it with such panache (the name, the outfit, the loadout, the tenacity) that they quickly became a meme (it's gotten to the point where they even have cosplay fans [image is semi-NSFW]) and now, they're being honored directly by the game's publisher, Bandai Namco, for their 1000th kill.
Let Me Solo Her announced on Twitter that Bandai Namco US gifted them a special box with all sorts of goodies in it:
A personalized letter
Wood art of the boss they took down and famously soloed
A map of the game
A long sword with the phrase "rise, tarnished" on it
Note that this is the influencer bundle some folks got, but the personalized letter is unique. They didn't just tweet out photos of their care package though: over on Twitter, Let Me Solo Her actually shares their Souls story too, and it's pretty fascinating!
"I can still remember my first experience with the soulsborne series and almost quitting because of Iudex Gundyr in Dark souls 3. I'm glad I persisted and went on to enjoy the game, because this community is one of the most passionate and dedicated people I've ever seen in a game, and I'm proud to be a part of it."

In retrospect, Dark Souls 3 is a pretty fantastic place to start, with a lot of quality-of-life upgrades that newcomers would find helpful. Once they get over that hump (whether it's the first boss like Iudex Gundyr or the first few), they're generally on their way.

Indie publisher FINJI, who has put out some rather splendid titles on Switch including Chicory: A Colorful Tale and Night In The Woods, has announced that Northway Games' I Was A Teenage Exocolonist will be coming to Switch on 25th August.
Described as a "coming-of-age narrative RPG" with card-based battles, it was previously confirmed for PlayStations 4 and 5 (plus PC and Mac) and now Nintendo's console joins the mix. The game sees you growing up on Vertumna, a beautiful though potentially dangerous planet where humans have set up an extraterrestrial colony. Life is rewarding but tough as the colonists work to build a future for themselves and their families, and you'll be making all sorts of life choices as you grow from a child to an adult over the course of the game.

The Devil In Me was revealed last October, and it will be the finale to Season One of The Dark Pictures Anthology.

There are fatal booby traps, maze-like halls, shifting walls, and more. Whatever this house in The Devil In Me is, one thing is for sure: it's a house of horrors inspired by the infamous hotel of serial killer H.H. Holmes.

Xbox has confirmed that it will be in attendance for Gamescom 2022, which is scheduled to take place in Germany next month. The industry giant is expected to offer up further information regarding its upcoming hardware and software plans, focusing on the next wave of releases for the Xbox Series X platform.
"Following our recent Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase, we’re excited to confirm that Xbox will be back on the show floor at Gamescom 2022 in Cologne, Germany," wrote the company in this morning's press release. "Fans in Europe and around the world can expect updates on some announced games coming to Xbox in the next 12 months."
As noted, Gamescom 2022 will see the industry event return in a live capacity for the first time in two years, since the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic forced the trade show to shift to an online model. Returning to its regular stomping ground of the Koelnmesse center in Cologne, Germany, Gamescom 2022 will offer attendees the opportunity to check out hundreds of upcoming releases on a multitude of platforms. Geoff Keighley will once again host an "Opening Night Live" stream to kick off the event.
While Xbox will be appearing on the show floor, both PlayStation and Nintendo have already confirmed that they will not be hosting booths at this year's event. Since the pandemic shifted the balance of marketing mechanics, many publishers have chosen to highlight their products through their own channels, utilizing live streams and smaller, more localized events to demonstrate their upcoming releases.
Gamescom 2022 will take place in Cologne, Germany from August 24-28. You can find out more details about the hybrid event and its range of in-person and online activities over on the official website.

If it wasn't for the efforts of people like the folks behind Operation Rainfall, a lot of us may have never experienced the original Xenoblade Chronicles.

Now there's a lot of "what ifs" in there, as Nintendo and Monolith Soft could have collectively decided to localize the series at any point — but I'm happy that everything played out the way it has so far. That includes the road that led to Xenoblade Chronicles 3, which could end up becoming my favorite of the series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A quick guide to Xenoblade Chronicles 3 amiibo
Xenoblade Chronicles 3 amiibo support is very straightforward — and as long as you have three total figures, you'll get the most out of it.
Here's a quick breakdown of how it all works.

You'll scan amiibo via the main menu early into the game
Almost immediately after completing the tutorial story mission, you'll be able to access the main menu. It's here that you can pause the game, and head to the "amiibo" portion of the system screen.
It's amazing that all these years on, there's a specific "amiibo" menu option front and center. I love how Monolith Soft calls it a "little reward." You get a little treat for buying all that plastic!

The main Xenoblade Chronicles 3 amiibo is Shulk
As you may have seen via the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Direct, the sole core Xenoblade amiibo, Shulk, will unlock the biggest game-specific bit of content: the Monado sword skin.
Party members who are using the swordfighter class are able to use the skin. You can find it via the "characters -> clothing -> attachments" submenu, which you'll unlock later in the game.

Other amiibo, when scanned in Xenoblade Chronicles 3, will provide random items
The rest of the amiibo support isn't that exciting, which, as usual, is probably a good thing if you aren't a fan of the figures.
Scanning other amiibo will grant random items in "collectible sets." These are usually groups of reagents or ingredients, like the ones listed above, fresh off of a scan from our copy of the game. Once scanned, they'll get dumped all over the ground, so you'll need to quit the menu and pick them up with your player character.
Note that up to three amiibo can be scanned per day. And that's it!

With just a few more weeks to go now until the release of Xenoblade Chronicles 3, we've been busy getting to grips with the latest entry in Monolith Soft's epic action-RPG series and, you may be relieved to hear, it's more than living up to our lofty expectations so far.
Xenoblade Chronicles 3 introduces us to Aionios, a war-torn world where the warriors of two factions, Keves and Agnus, battle each other in an endless cycle of all-out destruction. These warriors are fully committed to their roles in life, unwavering in the belief that they are born from Aionios' Queen and destined to serve her by fighting constantly through the ten years — or "terms" — that make up their short and brutal existences, at which point they'll return to her embrace through a ceremony known as "Homecoming", if they're lucky enough to make it that far.

The first few months of 2022 have seen the video game industry struggle with sales, with a drop in figures month-on-month. Now the NPD Group has officially reported that this trend looks to continue, although there's some good news for Nintendo in the midst of this.
NPD analyst Mat Piscatella predicts that the Switch will be the best-selling console of the year, gameindustry.biz reports. That's probably not too shocking to read given the hybrid console's success over the years, but it's good to see given the competition from this year's big video game release — Elden Ring — which is leading the individual game charts. Though Piscatella still predicts that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 will take the top spot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japanese artist Kazuki Takahashi, the creator behind the mega-popular Yu-Gi-Oh! manga, has died at 60. 
This news comes from reports from Japanese public broadcaster NHK, as reported by IGN. According to information coming from Japan, Takahashi was found floating in shallow waters on the coast of Nago City on the Island of Okinawa by the country’s Coast Guard yesterday, July 6. He was wearing snorkeling gear when found by the Coast Guard. Both the Coast Guard and local police are investigating his death. 
Takahashi’s manga career began in 1982, but it didn’t truly take off until the release of Yu-Gi-Oh! in 1996. In between his start and Yu-Gi-Oh!, though, Takahashi published titles like Fighting Hawk and Tennenshoku Danji Buray, according to Kotaku. After Yu-Gi-Oh! hit shelves in 1996, the series only continued to grow in popularity, spawning a real-life card game in 1999 (that’s still extremely popular today) as well as multiple anime series. Today, the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise spans not just manga, card games, and anime, but video games as well, like this year’s Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel.

As you might've seen in the summer gaming streams, there are too many frog games to keep track of this year (arguably a good problem to have!), but one of them, above all, is not leaving my sight. Frogun is a collectible-grabbing 3D platformer inspired by the Nintendo 64 and PS1 era, and its protagonist, Renata, wields a frog that is also a "gun."
It's a genre close to my heart, with a cute style, and I'm all about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf2Mzf-GcZo
After making the wholesome rounds and recently sharing a demo on Steam, developer Molegato is now in the home stretch. Frogun will release on August 2, 2022, across Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. That's... pretty soon!

It looks like The DioField Chronicle is just around the corner. The new RPG from Lancarse and Square Enix has a release date set for September 22, 2022.
The date was first shown during a livestream about The DioField Chronicle for Japan, with a date of September 22, 2022 but no mention if that included North America.
Store pages and pre-orders have been going up, however, with a Sept. 22 date set on the PlayStation Store, Xbox store, Steam, and Square Enix Store.
The DioField Chronicle is retailing for $59.99, though a Deluxe Edition can nab you some extras for $74.99. Or there's the $169.99 Collector's Edition set, which includes a full-on board game based on The DioField Chronicle. I do respect the creativity with this particular pack-in.

It was me, The DioField Chronicle
The DioField Chronicle is a new strategy RPG from Square Enix and Lancarse. It follows a band of mercenaries called Blue Fox, as war erupts around them.
It advertises a real-time battle system that utilizes strategy and decision-making about units' strengths and weaknesses.
Plus, it's also got a diorama-style visual for battles that looks pretty great. It's reminding me a bit of Triangle Strategy with its isometric view and shading.

The DioField Chronicle was first revealed during a Sony State of Play in March, alongside another Square Enix game Valkyrie Elysium. That new Valkyrie game has been locked in for a September 29 date for PlayStation platforms, with a PC launch coming later on November 11.
It looks like between those two games and the Crisis Core remaster, Square Enix has a good amount of games in store for the months ahead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fall Guys proves it has legs
Fall Guys has been one of the most successful online games over the past few years, and for good reason. After the flood of battle royale games we got, it was a nice change of pace to have one that was a colorful, goofy platformer that we could play with friends. I know I certainly got swept up in it when it first came out, and had a blast trying something new even if I was terrible. Now, Fall Guys is seeing even more success, and I couldn't be happier that a creative and genuinely fun idea is getting the love it deserves.
The official Fall Guys account tweeted this morning that the game has officially surpassed 50 million players! Exciting news for a game with such humble beginnings. If you're wondering why the game is just now garnering such a big player base, it's because Fall Guys just switched to a free-to-play model with battle passes and all that good stuff on June 21. The other significant change was that it moved off of Steam and onto the Epic Games Launcher, and was made available on Xbox and Nintendo Switch for the first time.
https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1544698314242793473
After the rerelease, Fall Guys garnered 20 million players in 48 hours, which is a pretty impressive feat for a game that's over two years old. Now it's more than doubled that after two weeks.
If nothing else, this scenario has proved that the free-to-play model can be pretty effective at getting players to try a new game, and because the outfits are such a fun part of Fall Guys, the battle pass system should work well for them. Here's hoping that the game continues to stick around for a while, because every time I see clips of it, it just makes me happy.
I guess now is a better time than any to jump back on the train, and try to claim a crown of my own once and for all.

The Competition and Markets Authority is looking into Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The UK regulator is officially looking into whether the deal could be anti-competitive.
September 1 is the deadline for the first phase of the investigation. In this phase, the CMA will determine whether Microsoft's Activision Blizzard deal could harm competition, and if it should launch an in-depth investigation. It's also inviting comments on the transaction from any interested party.
"As with all merger reviews, this investigation will consider whether the deal could harm competition and lead to worse outcomes for consumers—for example, through higher prices, lower quality, or reduced choice," the CMA said (via GamesIndustry.biz).
Microsoft corporate VP and general counsel Lisa Tanzi said (via CNBC) that regulatory scrutiny of the deal was to be expected. Microsoft will "fully cooperate" with the CMA.
"We’re committed to answering questions from regulators and ultimately believe a thorough review will help the deal close with broad confidence, and that it will be positive for competition," said Tanzi. She also added that Microsoft remains "confident" the deal will close in fiscal year 2023.

A massive merger
The scrutiny isn't a surprise, especially with a deal as big as Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard. The CMA in the UK is not the only one looking into it, either. The FTC is also investigating the deal, as chair Lina Khan told lawmakers in June. The FTC's investigation will look at, among other things, how the deal would impact workers at Activision Blizzard.
The $68.7 billion deal was announced in January, and made a lot of waves. With a portfolio of games including Call of Duty, Diablo, Overwatch, Warcraft, and much more, it could be a huge deal for Microsoft once the ink dries.

Gwent is back on the table, as CD Projekt Red reveals a new style of The Witcher card game is coming very soon. Gwent: Rogue Mage takes a deckbuilding, roguelike approach to Gwent, and it's out for PC, Android, and iOS on July 7.
IGN revealed the game this morning, as a standalone expansion of Gwent. It will have the same core mechanics, but operate a bit differently; first and foremost, it's a roguelike.
Players start with a set of cards in their deck, focusing on certain playstyles. Then more cards can be added as more nodes on the map are explored. Experience gained over the course of each run goes towards increasing the pool and strength of cards available in each run.

Square Enix has announced that it will release its upcoming fantasy action-adventure Valkyrie Elysium this fall. The Soleil-developed RPG will arrive on PlayStation platforms September 29, with a PC release to follow a little over a month later on November 11.
The latest release in the long-running Valkyrie/Valkyrie Profile series, Valkyrie Elysium will feature all of the deep adventure and Norse mythology that is the franchise's trademark. The plot sees the coming of Ragnarok, the cataclysmic event fated to destroy the world, the gods, and civilization itself. With the end times looming, the mighty Odin creates a sole emissary, Valkyrie, who stands as the final opposition to the collapse of the kingdom of the gods.
https://youtu.be/XXG0xBnY_zo
Valkyrie Elysium will incorporate the series’ trademark "Einherjar" spirit battles, while adding all-new mechanics such as the "Soul Chain" combo system. As they embark upon their quest, players will be able to further customize their weaponry, gear, and abilities to access more powerful spirits, skills, and devastating "Divine Arts." Valkyrie Elysium will retain the series' pedigree for beautiful and sweeping worlds, punctuated by an evocative score from series veteran composer Motoi Sakuraba.
Valkyrie Elysium will launch on PlayStation September 29, with PC (Steam) to follow on November 11. The PlayStation version of the Deluxe Digital Edition will also include a brand new port of the 1999 PSP release Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth. The PC release will not, unfortunately, include this port.

While modern Blizzard is perhaps best known for constantly putting out fires and fixing game launches, old-school Blizzard was practically untouchable from a quality point of view. This Wrath of the Lich King retrospective showcases one of the publisher's best periods, when for many, World of Warcraft was arguably at its best (Burning Crusade is the right answer, but that's neither here nor there).
The series is called Building Azeroth: Northrend, and the cast includes Ely Cannon (Art Director World of Warcraft), Sarah Boulian Verrall (Lead Level Designer World of Warcraft), and Aaron Keller (Game Director Overwatch), as they muse on their time with the series, and direct involvement with the original expansion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a scant seven months of availability, The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience will be leaving digital console storefronts on July 9. 
According to the Matrix Awakens website, those who add the tech demo to their library on PlayStation 5 and/or Xbox Series X will still be able to launch and mess around with the experience after the delisting date. Here’s what the official site has to say on the matter: 
The Matrix Awakens was first announced and made available on the same night during the 2021 Game Awards. The Unreal Engine 5-powered demonstration from Epic Games stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who introduces the impressive graphics engine and how close to real-life its visuals can look. Awakens includes an on-rails car shootout throughout a city that often looks like it was ripped from the silver screen despite being rendered on the spot. The demo then lets you roam the massive pre-populated city and change things like time of day or traffic congestion to flex what UE5 is capable of. It’s a terrific showcase for the future of games, so if you haven’t given it a download yet, you’ll want to check it out before the delisting on Saturday.

The tech demo experience The Matrix Awakens is leaving digital storefronts soon. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S owners have until July 9 to pick this demo up, before it departs.
Announced during the 2021 Game Awards, The Matrix Awakens is an Unreal Engine 5 tech demo that also intersects with The Matrix. It features performances from Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss in alarmingly realistic CG.
But it's also not just a cutscene, but some playable slices of game and an open-world sandbox where you can mess with the world. Different areas show off parts of Unreal Engine 5's tech. It is a tech demo, after all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WU0gvPcc3jQ
The Matrix is here
It's a fun demo with some neat tech to show off, and is already worth the low, low price of free for that. But for Matrix fans, there's also some charming banter between Reeves' Neo and Moss' Trinity that makes for a genuinely nice little slice of game. It would kind of rule to see a new Matrix game with this kind of approach. Especially considering how wild The Matrix Online got.
You can find The Matrix Awakens tech demo on the PlayStation Store and Xbox store until July 9, 2022.
Meanwhile, if The Matrix Awakens awoke a taste for new Matrix games for you, there's not much else new. You can, however, check this cool Sifu mod that replaces the main character with Neo and the enemies with Agent Smith. It's not the Path of Neo, but it's a mod that unsurprisingly fits the mood of the Burly Brawl from The Matrix Reloaded. Agent Smith just cannot catch a break, no matter where in The Matrix he goes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's live now through July 10
Genshin Impact is still trucking, and as we move into the eventual 3.0 expansion, the team is incrementally adding more stuff through new updates (2.8 is arriving on July 13). The next tie-in event is the Genshin Impact slime game Bouncing Blobby Slimes, which you can play now via a web app.
Unlike several other previous web games, this one is entirely skill-based. You'll take various slimes (with different properties and physics systems) and jump from block to block in a bid to score as many points as possible. To jump, you just hold on the screen (or click), aim the jump, then release to fling your slime. The closer you are to the middle of the platform when you land, the more score you'll net.

To play more levels you'll need stamina, which is tied to:
Logging in to the web event daily
Logging into Genshin Impact daily
Completing two daily commissions in Genshin Impact daily
Using 40 original resin in Genshin Impact daily
Visiting the HoYoLAB website
Rewards include the typical loot linked to these types of things:
Primogems
Enhancement ore
Mora (gold)
Hero's Wit (XP boosting books)
The event is more fun than a lot of former tie-ins because of the interactive element, so give it a shot if you still play Genshin. You can partake until July 10 at 23:59 (UTC+8).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Still due "this winter"
Square Enix has showcased some extra Final Fantasy VII Remake Crisis Core quality of life changes via a new tweet, and most of them look great. Let's take a look at what Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII Reunion has in store for us eventually (the publisher is still sticking to a release window of "this winter" as of this week).
Here are the main Final Fantasy VII Remake Crisis Core quality of life upgrades:
Improved camera
Optimized UI
New menu-based battle system
New background music (by Takeharu Ishimoto, who worked on Legend of Mana, Kingdom Hearts, and several modern Final Fantasy games)
Full voiceover for text-based scenes in the original
I bolded the "new battle system," as that's easily going to be one of the most interesting elements of the remake, depending on how Square Enix handles it. While I lived through it on PSP (and came out fine), searching for discussions on the original "roulette" style battle system will garner results from "who the hell thought the roulette thing was a good idea?" to "it was one of my favorite parts of the game."
It remains to be seen how much has changed in the remake, as the roulette mechanic seems to still exist, based on the inaugural trailer. My guess is a lot of folks will see any change as an upgrade!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Luminous game takes some more time
Forspoken is slipping out of this year. Square Enix confirms today that its action-RPG Forspoken is now set to launch on January 24, 2023.
On social media, the team says that all game elements are complete, and development is in its final polishing phase. But as a result of "ongoing discussions with key partners," Square Enix and Luminous Productions have decided to move the date back.
https://twitter.com/Forspoken/status/1544675140780392453
Previously, Forspoken was set for October 11, which was pushed back from a date in May. At the time, Square and Luminous said it needed some extra time to get it right.
Another one joins the 2023 calendar
While this move pushes Forspoken out and away from the fall window with games like Marvel's Midnight Suns, it's still headed into a growing 2023 lineup. The Dead Space remake is set for January 27, 2023, just a few days later.
Other big games have also moved into 2023, including the sequel to Breath of the Wild, Starfield, and Redfall. Plus, Final Fantasy XVI is currently slotted for a summer 2023 window.
Basically, next year is looking stacked with games already. It's not like this year will be quiet, though. Sony Santa Monica announced that God of War Ragnarok arrives on November 9, 2022.
As for Forspoken, it's been an interesting one to follow. The game previously dubbed Project Athia is an action-RPG, starring a girl named Frey who gets transported to another world and gains magical powers. It's a gorgeous game, even if the narrative gave a moment's pause. Square Enix says more information is on the way about Frey's journey this summer, so there might still be some more to learn before it heads back into prep for the new year.
Forspoken will now be starting off the new year's release schedule on PlayStation 5 and PC on January 24, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most popular open-world fantasy RPGs ever made for several reasons, including its in-universe card game, Gwent. 
CD Projekt Red, the studio behind Wild Hunt and 2020’s Cyberpunk 2077, has already created a game based on Gwent, aptly called Gwent: The Witcher Card Game, but it seems the developer is not ready to leave that in-universe game behind just yet. That’s because the studio is launching Gwent: Rogue Mage, a new single-player roguelike deckbuilder, tomorrow. 
Announced by IGN, Gwent: Rogue Mage launches tomorrow, July 7, on PC, iOS, and Android. IGN reports that this game is what Project Golden Nekker, which the team revealed earlier this year, has turned into, and CD Projekt Red is marketing it as a single-player expansion to Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. However, you won’t need to own that because Rogue Mage is standalone. You can purchase the standalone version for $9.99 or the premium edition, which includes in-game skins and cosmetics, and card packs for the multiplayer portion of Gwent, for $19.99. 
“Rogue Mage came out of us noticing that years after The Witcher 3’s release, there are a significant number of players who want a more PvE experience from Gwent,” game director Vladimir Tortsov told IGN. “While Gwent multiplayer is a fantastic game for those who are looking for a great PvP multiplayer experience, we perfectly understand that many Witcher players loved the original mini-game of Gwent for totally different reasons. With Rogue Mage, we aim to give this audience a reason to play modern-day Gwent in the format they prefer.” 
IGN has an exclusive preview of Gwent: Rogue Mage after going hands-on with it ahead of tomorrow’s release, and if you’re looking for even more details about it, including what this single-player deckbuilder roguelike’s gameplay is like, be sure to check it out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valkyrie Elysium, the next entry in the previously dormant Valkyrie Profile series, has a new gameplay trailer and a pair of release dates.
The new video provides a lengthier look at the game’s action-oriented combat and story compared to its more enigmatic debut trailer back in March. 


Square Enix also announced special editions and pre-order bonuses containing extra goodies based on the platform. Pre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on PlayStation gets you the Alscir: Sword of the God of Light in-game item and a special themed avatar. The $74.99 Digital Deluxe Edition includes 72-hour early access, the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld in-game weapon, and a digital copy of Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth, the 2006 PSP port of the first Valkyrie Profile game. 
Don't worry, fans. Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth will also be sold separately on PS5/PS4 on September 29, so you don’t need to buy the Digital Deluxe Edition to play it. Additionally, after buying Elysium on PS4, you’ll also get access to the PS5 version. 
Pre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on Steam grants the 72-hour early access window and unique wallpapers. Its Digital Deluxe version also tosses in the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld. 
Valkyrie Elysium will launch first on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 29. It then arrives on Steam on November 11.]]></summary>

Pre-heating the oven and a rigorous badminton schedule didn't mingle too well with an open world that demanded every ounce of my concentration. I went MIA from the Lands Between for three months, spending my time watching cushy reality TV like Below Deck Mediterranean and lying in my bed, hoping its springs would somehow channel electricity into my bones and recharge my weary mind.
Over the past few days I've returned to the Lands Between with renewed vigor. I've taken a dustpan and brush to the map, sweeping up optional bosses and forts and quests with the wild energy of a cleaner who mustn't stop for even a second. In doing everything it takes to finish this game before I burn out again, I've learned the importance of investment and why spending is good, actually.

Publisher Ubisoft, conspicuous by its absence during this summer's live stream series, has announced that it will be holding its next premier "Ubisoft Forward" live stream this September, where it will offer news, updates, and reveals pertaining to the company's current and forthcoming releases.
"On September 10 at 12:00 PT / 21:00 CEST, Ubisoft Forward returns in full force, ready to reveal updates and news on multiple games and projects from Ubisoft teams around the world," wrote the publisher on its website. "Ubisoft Forward will broadcast on YouTube, Twitch, and on our official website. We'll have more to share about Ubisoft Forward as we get closer to the event, so be sure to keep an eye on Ubisoft News for the latest updates."
Additionally, Ubisoft will host a live stream presentation tomorrow, July 7, focused entirely on its seafaring RPG Skull and Bones (formerly "Skull & Bones"). This spotlight event is expected to showcase extended gameplay of the upcoming adventure game, which will see players engaging in period piece naval warfare on the waves of the Indian Ocean. Currently in development for PS4, PC, and Xbox One, we are still to receive a release date for Skull and Bones — so perhaps we'll hear more about the game's launch window during tomorrow's stream.
The "Ubisoft Forward Spotlight On Skull and Bones" live stream kicks off tomorrow at 11:00 PT / 14:00 / 19:00 BST and can be watched via the official Ubisoft YouTube and Twitch channels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forspoken, Square Enix’s upcoming action RPG, will no longer launch in October and has been pushed to January 24.
In a post on the game’s Twitter page, developer Luminous Productions, a team made up of Final Fantasy XV developers, states that Forspoken is largely complete and is in the final polishing phase. It describes the delay as a “strategic decision” and that we’ll learn more about the game in the near future. 
Forspoken is no stranger to delays, as it was originally slated to arrive on May 24 before getting pushed to October 11. Though this second delay isn’t as long, it’s disappointing that we won’t get to experience Frey Holland’s adventure this year, but we trust that the delay will only help get the game up to snuff. The adventure drops Frey, a modern-day New Yorker, in the fantasy world of Athia where she acquires magical powers and a sentient talking bracelet. She’ll use her newfound abilities to free Athia from tyranny while also searching for a way back to her world. 
Forspoken graced Game Informer’s cover in March, and you can catch up on a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age is one of my favourite game series. I replayed Dragon Age: Origins recently not for this column, but for fun. That's the kind of wild gal I am. Origins was one of the reasons I got into PC gaming, because my dinky laptop wasn't good enough to run it and I was desperate to play it after seeing the trailers. I spaffed some of my student loan on a new desktop and spent four months eating nothing but cheese sandwiches. At the time it felt worth it. Watching those trailers now is like opening a time capsule full of fantasy tropes and, for some reason, an incongruous chugging guitar song by someone we don't need to mention ever again.
Replaying it now is a different experience. It's still a really cool RPG, notable for very good world-building and a cast of interesting characters (that you can have sex with in a cold tent), and it continues to hold a dear place in my heart. On the other hand, there's a whole section that's such a mind-numbing slog to get through that everyone hates it and there's a mod specifically to remove it from the entire game. Origins is a game I very much like, yet sometimes struggle to explain why it is good. But I'm not alone in thinking so, 'cos in 2009 this was RPS's Game Of The Year. Can't blame me for that. I didn't even work here then.

Nintendo has announced a new Splatoon 3 Switch OLED, which is set to be released later this year on August 26, right before the game launches on September 9.
The publisher has provided a full look at the system (front and back) in the video below, as well as the dock and the Joy-Con layout. Nintendo describes the color scheme as "a set of one blue and one yellow gradient Joy-Con controllers with white underbellies and a white, graffiti-themed Nintendo Switch dock."

The company reiterates that this will be the same Switch OLED model that sports the 7-inch upgraded screen, complete with the wired LAN port in the dock, and 64GB of storage space. In other words, you aren't missing much if you don't want the new dock or the Joy-Con. The Splatoon 3 Switch OLED will cost $359.99.
I won't lose sleep over not picking this one up, but Splatoon fans will likely jump at the opportunity to pick something up! It's not every day (or year, really) that Splatoon gets a big celebration like this in hardware form.

Also arriving on September 9 is the Splatoon 3 Switch Pro Controller (which will retail for $74.99), and the Splatoon 3 Switch carrying case (which retails for $24.99).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and Sony Santa Monica Studio have released a brand new God of War: Ragnarok trailer, revealing that the highly-anticipated follow-up to 2018's God of War will be released this November. 
More specifically, Ragnarok will hit PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on November 9, meaning we're less than five months away from playing the game. The new trailer released today is short and sweet but still packs a godly punch. Clocking in at just 30 seconds, we see Kratos and Atreus fending off some standard mob enemies before coming face to face with a gigantic black wolf. 
Check out the cinematic "Father and Son" trailer for yourself below: 


Fans of Norse mythology might recognize this beast as Fenrir, the son of Loki. Fenrir plays a significant part in the Norse story of Ragnarok, but we won't spoil that here. Plus, Ragnarok's take on Fenrir could be completely different anyway. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait long because God of War: Ragnarok hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on November 9, 2022.]]></summary>

Nintendo just announced a Mario + Rabbids free trial on Switch, and it kicks off today, running through July 12.
To be exact, the trial actually starts today, July 6, at 10AM PT, and will run through July 12 at 11:59. So if you think you can get through roughly 20-ish hours of story in six days, you can just finish it! This trial comes directly after the release date announcement for the sequel, which is coming later this year in October.
Like all trials, you need to be a Switch Online subscriber to partake. You can find the trial here, or via the eShop directly on the Switch.
There's two bonuses to this July 2022 Mario + Rabbids free trial run
The full game is on sale for $9.99 through July 20: so if you decide to buy in, you can upgrade to the full version from the trial (Nintendo also reminds us that save data will be preserved, so you won't need to start over if you upgrade after the trial)
As usual, you'll net 100 platinum for participating in the trial: if you own the full game, just boot it up during this period to get the points

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 100 or so hours I've spent playing Death Stranding in the last couple of years, I've often wondered about the state of Sam Bridges' limbs. Specifically, the strain they must be under carrying those preposterously high columns of metal cased packages up and down the slopes of post-apocalyptic America. If I were in his hiking boots, I'm not sure all the reinforced skeletons in the world would help me reach the same kind of porter-ing skills as he does gambolling about the place, at least not based on how sore and tired my dinky little wrists are after a couple of hours of playing Strange Scaffold's new Strand-type game, Witch Strandings. Yes, that's right. Someone other than Hideo Kojima has made a so-called Strand-like, and it's quite possibly the strangest game you'll play all year.

Months later, the team is still adding new things to the game, which is exactly what today’s Patch 1.17 does for the open-world RPG. 
More specifically, Patch 1.17 brings three new things to the game: variable refresh rate (VRR) support, high refresh rate (HFR) support, and a new “Balanced” graphics mode that introduces a 40Hz refresh rate for displays that support it. 


The game only supports VRR on monitors or TVs that feature VRR and if yours does, you can expect improved “dynamic resolution scaling on 60Hz.” Both VRR and HFR target a refresh rate between 60Hz and 120Hz, so if…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearly 30 years after its initial release, Live a Live is finally coming west. This 1994 Super Famicom RPG is from creator Takashi Tokita, one of the key developers behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV. While it would be fascinating to play through Tokita's original vision of Live a Live, we're getting an enhanced remake using the same HD-2D graphical style from the Octopath Traveler games.
I recently spent roughly five hours in this ambitiously designed title, and can confidently say I enjoyed almost every second of its unique approach to storytelling and how it's brought to life through beautiful retro visuals. Square Enix is releasing Live a Live on Switch on July 22. Here are a handful reasons why you should put it on your radar:
Seven Distinct Stories
A Fun Assortment of Characters
Adult Language and Humor?
Excellent Writing
Combat Has Depth...But Will We See It Enough?


It's Beautiful
The 2D-HD look is every bit as stunning as it is in Octopath Traveler. The backdrops in each story are a feast for the eyes. The sprite characters don't offer much animation but do move appropriately to convey an emotion or to highlight a dramatic sequence. The visuals scream of the 16-bit age, but also have modern touches everywhere, like realistic lighting of saloon doors swinging when the stranger strolls in to grab a drink.]]></summary>

Honestly, look at it. For days I’ve been absorbing these images of a baby CPU air cooler, yoked to the dinkiest of PC storage, and I still can’t decide if it’s brilliant or just sheer crawling madness.


Except, in the not-so-distant future, there’s a chance that active SSD cooling won’t seem so excessive at all. That’s because PCIe 5.0 drives are coming and, while they’re set to outpace even the best SSDs that use the current-gen PCIe 4.0 interface, it sounds like such speed will come at the cost of higher temperatures. And, in turn, a higher risk of throttling.

A new Fall Guys event is rolling in on Thursday, bringing some more Assassin's Creed theming. Abstergo's Challenge adds some new objectives to complete for prizes, while Eivor and Odin roll into the Fall Guys Store.
Abstergo's Challenge kicks off on July 7, with a bunch of objectives themed around the game mode Sweet Thieves. This is the mode where one team plays invisible beans, trying to steal away candy, while the guardians of the candy try to grab and capture them.
Beating objectives like winning as a Thief or Guardian, as well as carrying enough candy and pressing buttons, gets you points in Abstergo's Challenge. Prizes include a title, pattern, and a shiny Apple of Eden-styled backpack.

This six-core twelve-thread chip is a solid upgrade over the likes of the Ryzen 5 3600 from the previous generation, but mostly makes sense in a new budget gaming build or as an upgrade for an older Ryzen 1000 or Ryzen 2000 system.

Cuphead is built upon the fun of replaying and mastering boss fights, and that also goes for the new DLC, The Delicious Last Course. With that said, the three mausoleum levels in the original game — and a secret boss in the DLC — are seemingly set up as one-time hurdles. Is there any way to replay this content? Turns out, yes. With a hidden input.
Without spoiling anything, if you ever want to replay the DLC's secret boss (or just try the ghost-busting mausoleums again for the heck of it), here's how: stand facing the level entrance on Cuphead's overworld and hold the L+R triggers until it opens back up.

I’m excited by the news because I was worried these excellent spin-offs would never receive a revival like the platforming Mega Man series did a few years back. Many Battle Network games are currently only available on the Game Boy Advance or the now-dying Wii U virtual console, while others remain locked away on the Nintendo DS. However, a large chunk of the series will now be available to anyone who owns a PlayStation 4, Switch, or a PC running Steam. It’s great to see these classic games on modern platforms, and I hope other companies take note of the preservation strategy Capcom has taken …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skull and Bones, Ubisoft's long-delayed pirate multiplayer game, rises from the depths of the sea on Thursday during a livestream presentation. Announced by Ubisoft today, this show kicks off at 11 a.m. PT and will hopefully provide a substantial look at the open-world multiplayer ship battles and progress made since the delay. Skull and Bones showed promise when it was first announced during an E3 press conference in 2017. Slated to release in the following year, it was indefinitely delayed, even thought to be canceled given the lack of updates from Ubisoft. With fresh wind behind its sails, we will now see what it looks like on current-gen platforms. Come Thursday, you can view the Ubisoft Forward livestream right here.
Ubisoft also revealed a second livestream slated to air on September 10. We don't know what games are in this presentation, but Ubisoft's blog says it will be for multiple projects. Here's hoping Star Wars, Avatar, Assassin's Creed, and Splinter Cell are mentioned in some capacity, if not outright shown.
Until then, are you excited for Skull & Bones? Were you a fan of Ubisoft's pirate-focused Assassins' Creed: Black Flag? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

During an Indie World Showcase last December, Nintendo highlighted Endling: Extinction is Forever, and I was immediately intrigued by the premise. It's attempting to tackle the issue of deforestation and climate change sorrowfully. 
Endling begins with a terrifying look at the destruction of nature at the hands of humans. You control one of the last foxes on Earth, and you must escape a forest – presumably your home – being ravaged by a fire. Shortly after finding a new lair, it turns out you have a pack of cubs to care for. Doing so requires you to feed and nurture the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My first definitive verification of Haunted Chocolatier came straight from the source as I sat down with developer Eric Barone, AKA ConcernedApe, to look over Stardew Valley’s remarkable success. He touched briefly on his upcoming projects (yes, plural projects) and was happy to report that the game likely to come out first – Haunted Chocolatier – is a solo endeavor. Despite the lack of specifics, I was thrilled to hear the indie creator’s next project was in the works.
Then he surprised everyone. Barone publicly shared early Haunted Chocolatier gameplay footage, and it looked incredible. The art style immediately evoked Barone’s first title, though the developer made it clear fans shouldn’t expect the same experience.
“In Stardew Valley,” Barone writes in his news blog, “the focus was mor…]]></summary>

Black Forest Games' remake of Destroy All Humans 2: Reprobed is getting couch co-op. That's right, the world will now suffer from the might and insensitive jokes of two Cryptos invading at once. The latest trailer for Reprobed shows off the co-op carnage, and also provides a great look at the rearranged maps, which feature more buildings, plant life, and things to blow to kingdom come.
Reprobed is slated to release on PC and PlayStation and Xbox consoles on August 30. A $399 collector's edition is on the way and comes with a 27.6-inch Crypto figurine, an Arkvoodle statue, a CD of the orchestral score, and an artbook.
The remake of the original Destroy All Humans felt a bit dated. In our review, Joe Juba said "The brightest moments are when the action gives way to pure chaos. I watched electricity arc between humans, made brains pop out of heads, and turned a secret base into smoldering ruins with my spaceship’s death ray. But like a person floating above the ground in the glow of an abducto beam, those moments aren’t connected to anything substantial; they just make some noise and get flung aside." The remake of the sequel modernizes more of the content. Let's hope that helps Crypto find new life again. I'd love to see an entirely new adventure with this foul-mouthed alien leading the charge.

It's a puzzle-o-rama firing up a mysterious old computer to download pirated software from a BBS, letting us play everything from logic puzzles of circuits and flesh to a model kit-building simulation. I've played a wee bit and am keen to explore more, even as someone who is the absolute worst at Zachlikes.

Shots that, even with a 90% chance of hitting their target, still end up going wide and punching a hole in your carefully laid plans. In the moment, they induce feelings of white hot injustice, but for many, they're an integral part of what makes XCOM, well, XCOM. Looking back on his time making XCOM 2, however, Firaxis' creative director Jake Solomon tells me that he, too, now feels the pain players have felt for close to a decade.  
"It was really interesting for me to return back and play XCOM a couple of years ago, and man, when I missed shots, I was unbelievably frustrated. I felt the ghosts of everybody everywhere looking over my shoulder," he says.

Emmanuele Bassi v zásadě souhlasí, X11 už nedostává žádnou novou funkcionalitu a framework GTK se již delší dobu architektonicky posouvá směrem k Waylandu, jeho API se tak běhu na X11 stále vzdaluje.

Like Hyrule Warriors, which received a Breath of the Wild-specific sequel in Age of Calamity, this new Warriors game is set in the Fire Emblem: Three Houses universe. Three Hopes integrates the world, characters, and lore of the 2019 hit, and you can dive deeper into what I mean by that in my review. 
I interviewed Nintendo Co. Ltd. supervisor Genki Yokata, Intelligent Systems character designer and supervisor Toshiyuki Kusakihara, Team Ninja head and producer Yosuke Hayashi, and Koei Tecmo Games director Hayato Iwata to learn more about Three Hopes.

Kicking off his first adventure in 1992, Kirby has grown into a juggernaut in the game industry, starring in dozens of titles and making appearances in countless others. The long-running franchise is among video games’ best-selling. One of its most successful titles, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, released in March 2022. It’s not only breaking series records but also sucked in a whole new generation of fans. To celebrate the formidable gumball’s third decade in the industry, we’re looking back at the franchise, from how it started to where it’s floating now.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/07/01/new-cult-of-the-lamb-trailer-highlights-best-practices-for-keeping-your-cult-happy"/>
        <updated>2022-07-01T18:59:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting a cult isn’t easy work, but somebody’s got to do it in Massive Monster’s Cult of the Lamb, which hits consoles and PC next month. Fortunately, the team behind the devilishly cute game has released a new trailer with tips and tricks to start, and maintain, the best cult.
The first step is simple: grow your flock. All you need to do is fight through hordes of demon monsters to save innocent woodland creatures that will make for perfect initiates. Of course, you rename each addition and select other facets of their new life to dictate what kind of cult member (and worker) they’ll be for you.
Check it out in action: 


As you can see in the trailer above, growing your flock is just the first step. You also need to satisfy the faithful. To do this, you must tend to your congregation by leading and feeding them and ultimately keeping them happy. You can give them gifts, invite them to feasts, and much more. The final step is to cleanse the non-believers, naturally. 
Unhappy cult members might lose faith in you, but this is fixable. You can opt to re-educate them in the ways of your cult, which will hopefully stop them from persuading other members to rise against you, or, if you just can’t see a solution, you can always sacrifice them to the gods. 
And there you have it – you’re ready to start a cult. For more, watch Game Informer’s exclusive Cult of the Lamb New Gameplay Today, which features never-before-seen gameplay, and then watch this new gameplay trailer that recently debuted during Summer Game Fest, which is where we learned Cult of the Lamb will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Aug. 11.

Hot on the heels of the premier of Thor: Love and Thunder on July 8, the company is giving away a custom Series X modeled after Thor’s trusty hammer, Mjölnir. That means the console looks like a big, cracked slab of dwarven-crafted uru that still channels electricity and may or may not be liftable depending on if you’re worthy. It's hard to tell if that handle is real or simply edited into the photo for full effect, but you should probably assume the worst (best?) when considering making space for this thing. 
The contest begins today and concludes on July 21. To enter, you just need to follow the Xbox Twitter account and retweet #ThorLoveandThunderXboxSweepstakes. You can read the full contest rules here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sucker Punch Productions, the studio behind 2020’s hit new IP Ghost of Tsushima, has revealed it is not working on anything related to its previous Infamous and Sly Cooper franchises. The studio also says that no other developer is working on projects related to the franchises. 
This news comes from a new blog post highlighting Sucker Punch’s 25th anniversary. Since opening its doors more than 20 years ago, the studio has worked on Rocket: Robot on Wheels, the popular Sly Cooper platformer series, the superpowered Infamous series, and of course, Ghost of Tsushima. In this blog post, though, the studio clarifies some things amidst rumors of a Sly Cooper 5 and an Infamous remake.

I've nothing against 2D platformers, but to stand out in such a saturated genre you really need to capture something special. Wonder Potion have more or less nailed both the tricky but rewarding platforming, grappling, and baddie smacking parts of their formula, and perhaps more impressively, the story parts as well. This is a game with character, and the storytelling chops to make the most of its relatively simple ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I’ve been down in the hardware mines, searching for the best early Amazon Prime Day deals and choking on consumer advice fumes, Graham has been working on how to make this list a little more colourful and readable. Behold, then, our new-look guide to saving some cash on your next component or peripheral upgrade – even before Prime Day 2022 itself, which will run July 12th-13th.
What’s more, you won’t need an Amazon Prime account for any of these, unlike most of the big deals that launch on the 12th. Amazon’s Prime Day landing page might already point to various bits of discounted PC hardware but you won’t be limited to the big A alone, as plenty of rival retailers will be running their own, competing sales. I've included some of the best early non-Amazon deals right here, and I’ll eventually post a full anti-Prime Day deals guide for those who’d rather avoid Amazon entirely.

Announced earlier this week as part of the game's 10.0.2 patch notes, enabling DLSS does bring some welcome frame rate improvements to proceedings, but it also, err... has the rather unexpected side effect of shaving off everyone's hair / fur. And in a game about felling all manner of feathery, scaly lizard animals, that's not exactly ideal.

Plus, Nintendo has since introduced SNES, Nintendo 64, and even Sega Genesis games, giving players a chance to play some fan-favorite classics and some deep cuts, too. It’s hard to predict when new games might arrive as the company has maintained a somewhat inconsistent cadence in doing so, but that’s okay because this list is all you need. 
As Nintendo adds new titles, we’ll be sure to update this list to include them. If you’re looking for something specific, use this story’s Table of Contents to jump to the different consoles quickly. Here’s every NES, SNES, 64, and Genesis game added …]]></summary>

The pack promises to introduce staples of high school life like attending classes, getting detention, going to prom, and graduating, all as on-screen activities that the player can guide their Sims through. While there's a fair bit of overlap with the series' established college-themed expansion packs like The Sims 4 Discover University, giving this treatment to high school-aged characters is a franchise first, and something that's been on the fandom's collective wish list for a very long time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Stars, the promising-looking retro RPG from the team behind The Messenger, is the latest title to get pushed out of 2022. 
Developer Sabotage posted a message on Twitter stating it simply wants to polish up the adventure as much as possible without crunching its staff.
While the delay is a bummer, we appreciate the team’s respect for the employee’s work/life balance and strive for quality. The idea of getting a demo this year is certainly enticing too, as Sea of Stars has looked phenomenal every time it’s made an appearance. 
The game was first revealed in 2020 after a successful Kickstarter campaign and evokes JRPGs like Chrono Trigger, Illusion of Gaia, and Breath of Fire. It even features music contributions by Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Despite being a role-playing title, it serves as a prequel to 2018’s The Messenger, a Ninja Gaiden-inspired action game that was well-recieved (here’s our review). Sea of Stars centers on two heroes who wield the power of the moon and the sun to battle an evil alchemist. You can watch the original reveal trailer below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every so often, a game development studio comes up with an idea so good other developers insert it into their games. In Pow Wow Entertainment's newly announced racer, Stuntfest: World Tour, I'm hoping the unique ejector-seat functionality is so jaw-droppingly incredible that it becomes the next craze. In the game's first trailer, we see drivers rocketing out of their cars to bounce off pads or ignite a jetpack's thrusters.
Stuntfest: World Tour is in development for PC with publishing duties handled by THQ Nordic sometime in 2022. We don't have many details yet, but a press release states that the player can assume the identity of a "punker granny" or a "famous streamer" with the hope of winning elimination-style stunt shows featuring 18 drivers. The competitions range from destruction derbies to glider racers. When the player hits the ejector button and their driver launches hundreds of meters into the air, they can be freely controlled and gadgets can be used to gain an edge. When descending, the next car you see can be yours to drive. Progress in the world tour rewards you with vehicle upgrades.
Stuntfest: World Tour has a hell of a hook, but it's difficult to figure out how these races will unfold. I can't wait to get my hands on this game to see if this unique gimmick (and the high levels of destruction) add up to something special.]]></summary>

Much like the multiplayer beta that proceeded Infinite’s launch last fall, this co-op beta, which runs July 11 to July 22, allows registered players to tackle the entire campaign alongside a buddy to ensure everything works as planned for the full rollout. Because this is a new campaign build that players must download, 343 states that no previous story progress carries over, so players will be starting from scratch. Progress made during the beta will also not transfer back to the retail version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You'll soon have the chance to play EA's highly anticipated Skate sequel, but not in the way you would expect. Developer Full Circle and publisher Electronic Arts are looking for players who want to playtest the game and provide feedback on its development. You can sign up for this "insider" program here. As EA notes, you cannot share your videos or screenshots from your play sessions.
If you are curious what Skate currently looks like or what you can expect from the gameplay, EA has released a trailer with the appropriate title "Still working on it." The first few clips focus on bails, which must have been captured early in development given how rough the animations are. As the trailer moves on, the animations smooth out and the series' skating realism returns and is on display in a handful of awesome sequences. Full Circle also looks to be upping the scale of the challenges through some wild clips featuring impossible grind opportunities and huge ramps. Most of these clips are lack any kind of texturing or lighting and truly give us a look at how games are made.
Regardless of where it is at in development, this trailer gives a fun look at a series that never should have left us. Skate is alsmost back and it looks like it's going to be a blast.]]></summary>

Ms. Chalice sports a unique moveset such as a double-jump, a dodge roll that can safely bypass hazards, and even one extra health point. She’s a blast to use, and I loved taking advantage of her added maneuverability. Does she make…]]></summary>

There was once a group of warriors who attempted to defeat the darkness.

June 30, 2022
In Stranger of Paradise fashion, it's hard to parse through what's happening in the footage, but we see Jack and co. cleaving their way through armored adversaries ranging from shield-holding knights to winged beasts with dazzling blades of their own. In one scene, a kingly figure sits upon a throne – is it safe to assume this is the Dragon King? – and says, "You will die here, and I will live forever." We're sure Jack will make him eat his words. 
Stranger of Paradise is as bizarre as Final Fantasy gets. Andrew Reiner gave the game a 7 out of 10 and concluded his review by saying, "Stranger of Paradise is the strangest Final Fantasy game yet, bounding wildly between awful and fantastic. If you can tolerate Jack (and that's a big ask), the excellently crafted combat is worth a look. You may be coming to this game for the story and Final Fantasy experience, but it's all about combat and little else."

Crash Bandicoot: It’s About Time (PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4)
The Dark Pictures Anthology: Man of Medan (PlayStation 4)
Arcadegeddon (PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4)
While waiting for these games to go live, be sure to download last month’s games – God of War, Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker, and Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl – and then read about the revamped PlayStation Plus subscription service to find out which new tier is right for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2020, a group of digital art smugglers lifted the National Gallery’s entire art collection, nabbing each of the 2,400 hi-res digital artworks straight from the institution’s website. Since the collection is made up of paintings long past their copyright expiration, countless works by Van Gogh, Da Vinci, Titian, Vermeer, Rembrandt, and the rest were all legally (technically) snatched up in what could have well been the biggest digital heist in art history.
The cheeky looters in question were StikiPixels, the very same team behind the art gallery sim Occupy White Walls, and now anyone who owns a PC and a copy of the game can hang these priceless paintings in their own private virtual collections. In OWW (officially pronounced Owouawwouaw if you have the time), you can build your own architecturally ambitious gallery and stuff it full of artwork.

After one of the busiest starts to the gaming calendar in recent memory (looking at you, Elden Ring), my backlog is barely keeping it together right now. I've started so many things on as many different services that just keeping track of what I've played when is fast becoming a second job. If you, too, have been feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of new and exciting releases coming out, then why not have a gander at this freshly compiled list of all our favourite games from the year so far? Maybe you'll find something that will similarly catch your eye, just as it's done ours. I'll warn you now, though. It's a big list.

Some of the puzzles are quite clever, and many of the jokes made me laugh—plus it's only an hour or two to complete.

All them lambs being sacrificed in the Old Testament, shepherds, flocks, the lion and the lamb. In Cult Of The Lamb, which is sort of a dungeon-crawling roguelite with a colony sim bolted on, you are a literal rather than metaphorical lamb. Although possibly also a metaphorical lamb. Point is, the game makes great hay from the juxtaposition of cute fluffy animals and a violent cult.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam Deck production might be ramping up again but it turns out more recent orders could be something of a lucky dip, SSD-wise. Valve have quietly updated their Steam Deck tech specs page with a note that the NVMe SSDs in “some” 256GB and 512GB models might now use the PCIe Gen 3.0 x2 interface, meaning the drive has half the usual bandwidth of the Gen 3.0 x 4 SSDs that previously featured as standard.
As first spotted by German site HardwareLuxx, there's no indication as to why Valve made this change, and it doesn’t look like anyone with an outstanding Steam Deck order will know which SSD bandwidth they’ll get in advance. However, Valve's added note explains that “In our testing, we did not see any impact to gaming performance between x2 and x4.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Round two of the Overwatch 2 beta is finally here, but what can fans look forward to with this latest tech test? Join us on this fresh episode of New Gameplay Today as we check out the title's latest tank and show off the new map players can get their hands on later this year.
coverage here.



The Junker Queen is here, and she means business. The leader of the Junkers is more of an offensive tank than some of her other colleagues within the category. She comes strapped with a shotgun that maybe doesn't have the power of Roadhog's but has plenty of damage to dismantle the opposing team. She also comes equipped with a handy throwing knife that can cause quite the commotion. If players land a hit with an electrified weapon, enemy health drops over time. If she misses, the knife can still help as you can call it back, similar to the Leviathan Axe from God of War (2018), and actually pull enemies closer. Pair those abilities with her deadly charge up and a devastating ultimate attack, and she has a chance to really make some waves.
On top of a deep dive into Junker Queen and her moveset, we're also showing off the Push game type and Colleseo, a brand new map for Overwatch players to explore and dominate in. Is all this enough to get players to jump back into Overwatch? You'll just have to watch for yourself to find out!]]></summary>

We learn about how they're pulling inspiration from the worlds of Final Fight and Third Strike, why Modern Control Type "is not an 'Easy Mode'" and should be used in tournament play, and finally, how the team is learning from Street Fighter 5's mistakes to ensure a vibrant future for the series.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monster Rancher was revived late last year with the release of the Monster Ranger 1&2 DX collection, and Bandai Namco isn't going to stop there. In fact, the series is going bigger. Much bigger!


The first trailer for Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher asks a crucial question, "How would you like to raise your very own Ultra Kaiju?" To which I responded, "Yes, please. I'd very much like that. Give it to me now." Foregoing the dull, average-sized creatures you used to raise in Monster Rancher, Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher lets you take care of some colossal sweet boys. You'll raise the likes of Zettan, Gomora, and Alien Baltan – all licensed Kaiju from the Ultraman franchise. Many other existing Kaiju appear in the game, and you'll take them to help townsfolk in ways only a giant monster could. You can also participate in massive monster battles or watch the colossal beings waddle like big clumsy babies. As a fun bonus, the Kaiju can be bred, making wild combinations of their attributes appear in their children. It all seems like a lot of goofy fun.
We're not sure if Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher is coming to North America, but it's slated to hit Japan and Southeast Asia this year. At the very least, a version will be translated into English for those looking to import.]]></summary>

2017's Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle pleasantly surprised players by deftly combining two very different universes and utilizing the unexpected template of a turn-based tactics game. Five years later, a sequel, Sparks of Hope, launches on October 20 and builds upon the winning formula while also shaking up the foundation to make it more than a retread.
Speaking to the game's associate producer Christina Nava, Ubisoft was pleased as punch at Kingdom Battle's success and how it entertained turn-based strategy fans and non-fans alike.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tri-Ace and Square Enix have largely kept quiet about Star Ocean The Divine Force since its reveal last fall, but that changed in a big way today. In addition to dropping not one, not two, but three videos fleshing out the game's narrative, characters, and combat, we now know the JRPG launches in October. 
The Divine Force arrives on October 27, exactly one year after it was first announced. The first trailer showcases the plot with a montage of out-of-context story clips that sets the tone for what's to come in the sci-fi action RPG. 


The second video provides a more thorough walkthrough of Star Ocean's characters and combat. Players assume the role of one of two protagonists: Raymond Lawrence, a hot-headed merchant ship captain searching for his lost crew, and Laeticia Aucerius, a princess fighting to save her kingdom from destruction. The story unfolds differently depending on your chosen hero, and a ragtag party of allies accompanies each. The action-focused combat utilizes four party members players can swap between on the fly. You can battle in real-time or pause the action using Stop Mode to allow time to change tactics.  


Lastly, you watch the entire 8-minute opening cinematic for Raymond's campaign to see how the adventure kicks off for the young captain. 


Tri-Ace promises to share more information in a future Mission Report video. Star Ocean The Divine Force will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

So, I sat down with the game's creative director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête in the hopes he could shed some light on the aforementioned vibes, perhaps even turning them from ethereal gusts of Annihilation-ness to concrete info on just how the game aims to be a "true adventure".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Spellbreak developer Proletariat released a blog post detailing the future of its spell-based battle royale that launched years ago. In it, the studio revealed that the servers for Spellbreak will shut down in early 2023, effectively ending the run of this battle royale. 
This shutdown likely had to do with the game’s low player count. Still, there might be more to it than that: Blizzard Entertainment, the studio behind franchises like Overwatch and Warcraft, is acquiring Proletariat and using its force of roughly 100 employees to staff up its World of Warcraft team, according to a new report from GamesBeat. 
“We are putting players at the forefront of everything we do, and we are working hard to both meet and exceed their expectations,” Blizzard president Mike Ybarra told the publication in a statement. “A big part of caring for our teams is making sure we have the resources to produce experiences our communities will love while giving our teams space to explore even more creative opportunities within their projects. Proletariat is a perfect fit for supporting Blizzard’s mission in bringing high-quality content to our players more often.” 
This news comes just months before the launch of the newest World of Warcraft expansion, Dragonflight, which you can read more about here. As noted by GamesBeat, this acquisition is one of the largest in recent memory for Blizzard. This purchase means that the Proletariat team will be under the Microsoft-Xbox umbrella soon following the completion of Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
According to the GamesBeat report, the purpose of this acquisition is to beef up World of Warcraft staff numbers so “that it can hit quality and timing goals for expansions.” Neither of the involved parties has publicly released a price for this transaction.

This wasn’t a bad thing, mind. Far from it. I found Rise to be a substantially better-paced MonHunt entry compared to its predecessors, the series’ steep barrier to entry readjusted to a gentle incline that was more palatable for newcomers like me. Monster Hunter’s particular flavour of RPG design has always felt like trying to find a fork in a friend’s kitchen while they’re in another room. Nothing is where you expect it to be and there are a lot of things here you just don’t understand. Admittedly Rise wasn’t much better, stuffed as it was with endless text-based tutorials, but at the very least it pointed out the right drawer this time around.
