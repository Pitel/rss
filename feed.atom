Paris. 1789. The Renaissance was so very long ago... Did it even happen?
Looking around the fallen capital, one would fairly assume not. The City of Lights, a place celebrated for its art, invention, culture, and architecture now resembles The Gates of Hell, a vision soon to be crafted by Rodin himself. The streets are awash with blood and bodies — innocent civilians, rebellious conspirators, and even the king's own army lying in miserable piles of broken flesh.
And the king himself? This citywide massacre is his doing, the heart of his capital torn in two by a seemingly unstoppable army of robotic soldiers. Far from being the loyal guardians and entertainers of Paris, as initially designed, the automaton army has instead become her oppressor, stal…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We don't want it, 2K
Fifteen years later, BioShock remains one of the most recognizable and beloved series in gaming, and publisher 2K is still releasing updates to support the series. Or, more specifically, to make the games run through their own launcher, as evidenced by the patch notes from both older updates and a new one (via PC Gamer). This time around they even labeled the patch as a "Quality of Life Update," when all it did was enable linking to 2K accounts and added the new launcher "which includes a store to purchase new content."
So they're forcing yet another game launcher on us, but what really has fans peeved is that this new update has rendered the games unplayable for players running them on Linux. At first, it seemed to just be BioShock Infinite that was affected, but now it's looking like the entire series is a bust. The Linux Gaming subreddit is full of players decrying the changes, and trying to find solutions to fix the problem. Some players are expressing their wish that Steam would let them access earlier builds rather than forcing them to use the most recent version, and I'm kind of surprised that wasn't an option already.

Naturally, fans took to the review section on Steam to voice their discontent, where one user said that 2K's launcher is riddled with bugs, crashes, and corrupted saves.
I have my BioShock collection on my PlayStation so I'm in the clear, but man, I am feeling the frustration on behalf of PC gamers. Here's hoping that 2K gets the message soon and decides to scrap the launcher altogether, or at the very least releases a patch to fix the games for Linux users.
Recently I've been partial to arguments about why it's important to own physical media, and I have to say this situation is only pushing me further into that camp. If I spent money on a game, I certainly want to be able to play it without the meddling of a company years after the game's release.

Ubisoft is set to discuss what's on the horizon this weekend, during its Ubisoft Forward stream. And several reports say that a healthy amount of Assassin's Creed will be there.
Bloomberg reports today, confirming other reports, that Ubisoft is set to announce several new Assassin's Creed games this coming Saturday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Fr3cS3MtY
According to Bloomberg's sources, Ubisoft plans to show off a mobile title and two major games. The first is code-named Red and set in Japan, being developed by Ubisoft's Quebec City office.
The second is code-named Neo or Hexe, according to Bloomberg, and is set during the later Holy Roman Empire, specifically revolving around the witch trials. This is being developed by Ubisoft Montreal.
Both of these are reportedly part of Assassin's Creed Infinity, a platform for the series that will contain multiple settings that has been previously reported on. Neither game is expected to release until 2024 at the earliest.
The future of Assassin's Creed
Ubisoft has already confirmed it plans to showcase Assassin's Creed Mirage as well. Though it hasn't revealed further official details about that game, it has been the subject of leaks and reports as well.

Suffice it to say, we'll likely be seeing a lot of Assassin's Creed this weekend. And while it might not be everyone's cup of tea, I'm actually pretty interested in all of this.
Assassin's Creed taking a platform approach could be interesting. I enjoy the more recent games in the series but never got around to finishing Valhalla due to how huge it was. Focused experiences with a bunch of different time periods could be intriguing.
Either way, it won't be long until we know for sure. Ubisoft is airing its Forward stream this Saturday, at 12:00 p.m. PT / 3:00 p.m. ET. You can watch it on Ubisoft's Twitch channel here.

With six cores and 12 threads to access, you get good performance in modern game engines, while the higher single-core speeds introduced with this generation of AMD processors allows for better performance in single-core-limited (often older) games. It's a potent combination that makes the 5600X - and the 5600 - the best value AMD CPUs for gaming out there. 
Normally the 5600 retails for £173, in comparison to £185 for the 5600X, but today it's down to £150 on Amazon, coming within £10 of the best price we've ever seen on this model.

Not until I saw several scrunching up, pretending to be the eyes, nose and mouth of someone’s face in images from upcoming psychological horror card game Out Of Hands. See, Out Of Hands has a slight fixation on the ol’ phalanges. Witness for yourself in the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the first wave of RTX 3080 reviews, when we had no idea of the graphics card supply shortage to come, I remember being really impressed by the Asus Tuf Gaming model. It didn't look particularly special on the outside, but it consistently beat even more expensive models in terms of thermals and performance. I resolved to get one for myself, but things went mad and I only eventually managed to get one through my work. Now though, you can get the upgraded version of that high-performer at a more reasonable price: £650 for the Tuf Gaming OC V2, an overclocked model offering excellent performance for £400 below this model's UK RRP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Console users will have to wait for a while
Would-be Gundam pilots will get to show off their skills this month on PC. Gundam Evolution, a free-to-play team-based shooter is going live on Steam on September 21 for North America.
The new Gundam game takes a six-on-six, hero-based approach to the wide, wide expanse of the Gundam universe. It's a little bit of Overwatch mixed in with mobile suits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVWpQDJtxHk
Gundam Evolution will feature mainstays from throughout the Gundam-verse, duking it out on the field of battle. Today's trailer spotlights a melee-configured Zaku with some hefty axe swings, the Mahiroo from Turn A Gundam, and the titular Unicorn Gundam.
These, alongside classics from throughout the series, all have their own weapons and abilities they bring to the battlefield. Personally, I'm rooting for the Guntank. He may not be as shiny as something newer like the Barbatos, but darn it, the Guntank is cool.
Matches feature several objective-based modes, including Destruction, Domination, and Point Capture.
A new type of Gundam battle
The PC launch of Gundam Evolution is currently set for a global launch on September 22 in Japan, which puts it at 7 p.m. PDT on September 21 for North America.  The launch will also mark the start of Season One.
There will also be cosmetics to purchase, of course. So if you want to deck out your mobile suit to stand out from the crowd, feel free to do so. It worked for Char, after all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFI6v49v68
While Steam players get in on the carnage right away, console players will have to wait. Currently, the team is planning to launch Gundam Evolution on December 1 in Japan, or 6 p.m. PST on November 30 in North America.
Once the end of November rolls around, Gundam Evolution will launch on both the current and previous generation of PlayStation and Xbox consoles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hide your PlayStation 5 in plain sight
If you're tired of the out-of-the-box look of your PlayStation 5, Sony has a new option rolling out. A controller, headset, and console cover for the PS5 are all getting gray camo, as part of a new collection for PS5 owners.
The Gray Camouflage Collection variants of the PS5 DualSense controller and Pulse 3D wireless headset. Alongside those accessories, there is a console cover for both the disc drive-less and disc-capable PS5.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0qDTET_tvY
In the accompanying PlayStation blog, Sony says the pattern subtly incorporates the iconic "PlayStation Shapes" into the pattern. And it's true, they are in there, as little details you can notice between the splotches.
The Gray Camouflage Collection will be available this fall, with pre-orders starting next week. The DualSense wireless controller and PlayStation 5 console covers will roll out first, with a global launch on October 14. The Pulse 3D wireless headset is set to roll out sometime in December.
Tactical fidelity
Sony has been steadily rolling out a number of console covers. In June, the console manufacturer launched several different variants, including the Starlight Blue, Galactic Purple, and Nova Pink. That's alongside the previously available Cosmic Red and Mdnight Black.
While I haven't opted to pick up a new color for my PlayStation 5 yet, I did pick up a Midnight Black DualSense. It's a pretty nice controller, and has lasted a good while.
As for the actual functionality of the camouflage, I cannot say. The sheer size of the PS5 might make obscuring its presence in your living room difficult.
Still, if you're looking for different options for DualSense controllers, the Gray Camo will at least make your PS5 controller fairly distinct. No price has been announced yet, though console covers have usually gone for $54.99 and DualSense color variants tend to add a little extra.

Developer WayForward has released a brand new trailer for its upcoming release River City Girls 2, which not only introduces us to the narrative's wretched hive of villainy, but also debuts the brawler sequel's chaotic, knuckle-dustin' four-player co-op action.
River City Girls 2 will see schoolyard superheroes Kyoko and Misako take to the streets of gaming's most violent town in order to, once again, serve up their own brand of dopey, two-fisted justice. Standing in their way are a slew of familiar and not-so-familiar faces, including returning gangland boss Sabuko, her obnoxious step-brother Ken, (which die-hard fans will remember from River City Girls Zero), and River City's most hated antagonist — the sibling's murderous father Sabu.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OrWkuUfHlk
Fortunately, our hometown heroes will not be charging into battle alone. Not only will Kyoko and Misako be aided by long-time Kunio-kun protagonists Kunio and Riki, but Double Dragon's Marian and River City Underground's Provie will also be stepping up to the plate, bringing their own unique, hard-hitting combat styles. The trailer debuts RCG 2's four-player co-op action, which will help the River City Girls even the odds further against armies of bullies, street criminals, gangsters, and other dangerous roustabouts that stand in the way of street justice. Put up yer dukes...
River City Girls 2 will launch later this year on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. Be sure to check out our previous write-ups on both River City Girls and River City Girls Zero, as well as our interviews with director Adam Tierney, and awesome composer Megan McDuffee. For an exclusive look at the new sequel, check out this feature over on *checks notes* IGN.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Players can hop in either weekend for an early peek
Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds recently revealed its upcoming strategy game Moonbreaker. And if en end-of-September Early Access launch seems too far away, the studio is hosting several playtest sessions very soon.
Moonbreaker will hit Steam Early Access on September 29. Prior to that, though, Unknown Worlds and Krafton will host two playtest weekends, on September 9 through 11 and September 16 through 18.
The primary goal of these sessions will be to stress test the servers. Getting signed up for the playtest is pretty easy, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef5ajtJuKns
How to sign-up for Moonbreaker playtest
Log onto Steam
Find Moonbreaker on the store (link)
Click "Request Access" under the playtest section
Confirm!
Easy enough, right?
Paint it, black (or any other color you'd like)
During these weekend playtests, players will have access to the full game, barring some systems and the store. This also includes all Season 1 units and Captains. While those will be gradually unlocked in the Steam Early Access version, the Moonbreaker playtest will make them available right away so everything can be tested.
All progress will be wiped too, with one notable exception. Paint jobs will carry forward into the Early Access. Since painting the virtual miniature figurines of Moonbreaker seems like a big draw, that's nice to see.

Unknown Worlds also warns that these tests are meant to push the servers to their limits, and so interruptions and emergency maintenance can occur.
It's a pretty easy playtest to sign up for, though. And with the Early Access not far off, this is a nice way to test the waters to see if this new Unknown Worlds experience is worth checking out on launch. I'm already into the surprisingly detailed painting features, but for those who want some tabletop strategy without the real-world clutter, this seems worth keeping an eye on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roll up, roll up.
Circus Electrique is quick to pique the interest of any fans of a turn-based tactical RPG, especially those who loved Darkest Dungeon. However, its unique design raises the question of what Darkest Dungeon would be like if it were filled with mechanical mimes and pretentious police officers, all while being set in a gritty, steampunk Victorian London. Zen Studios has answered with this eccentric part circus-sim, part story-driven RPG, and unfortunately the answer is 'not as good'.
From the moment the game begins, players take on the role of Amelia, the niece of Electrique's ringleader and a young journalist commissioned to report the re-opening of the show following a deadly accident ten years prior. Coincidentally, the accident's victim was Amelia's mother, so there is a prevalent tension between niece and uncle. However, upon Amelia's visit, an unexpected turn of events unravels with 'The Maddening,' an incident that plunges London into chaos and turns its inhabitants into vicious enemies. So, instead of reporting the Circus' re-opening, Amelia takes it upon herself to discover the source of The Maddening and relies on Circus Electrique for support.

Everyone involved with Live a Live Switch has a lot to celebrate, as a recent livestream just confirmed that the game has shipped + digital sold over 500,000 units. The news was confirmed by series steward Takashi Tokita on air at roughly 16:30 in the below video. Takashi Tokita served as director for the original game (among other duties), and was also a producer on the 2022 Switch edition.
It's hard to believe that Live a Live clawed its way up from a 1994 SNES exclusive only released in Japan, to where it is today. It was only a glimmer in the eye of many JRPG fans, back in an era when importing was even tougher to do; but now it's easily accessible on a worldwide marketplace, on the widely successful Switch no less. It just goes to show you how far game preservation can come when it's done with care.
As of late, Tokita has been sharing a ton of fan art for the game, as well as stories from fans all over the world. Many of those fans are located in Japan, but there's a wide spread of folks from multiple regions: showcasing the staying power (and wide appeal to this day) of Live a Live. How many other forgotten classics could get the same treatment? It'll be fun to find out.

Japanese developer Miracle Kidz! has reported the sad news that its president, Mitsuhiro Yoshida, passed away "suddenly" on August 30. Yoshida, who has been part of the games industry for many decades, is best known as the co-director of one of the most popular brawlers in history, River City Ransom.
Described by his Miracle Kidz! colleagues as the "father" of the Downtown Nekketsu franchise, Yoshida — alongside co-director Hiroyuki Sekimoto — may not have been responsible for the creation of the Kunio-kun franchise, but certainly helmed its most well-known and widely played entry. River City Ransom, (known in its native Japan as Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari) launched on the NES in 1989 and is one of the first titles to marry the belt-scrolling brawler action of the series with a non-linear RPG structure. The international success of RCR helped paved the way for a slew of sequels and spin-offs.
https://twitter.com/miracle_kidz/status/1565907621072470016?s=20&t=1EUKMC8KdRfhUOeqUT2pDg
Yoshida would continue to work with the franchise, directing the goofy NES port of Nekketsu Koko Dodgeball (Super Dodge Ball), before starting up a studio comprised of many former employees of old-school developer Technos Japan. Since founding Miracle Kidz!, Yoshida has continued to work on several titles set both in and out of the Kunio-kun universe, and was reportedly working on a new game right up until his untimely passing.
As a mainstay of any NES owner's catalog, River City Ransom has provided brawler fans with hours upon hours of double-fisted action — paving the way for the series' enduring appeal, recognized today in the form of WayForward's popular River City Girls franchise.
We at Destructoid offer our condolences to his family and friends.

Nintendo and The Pokemon Company have been trying an array of strategies for promoting Pokemon Scarlet and Violet: from primo Pokemon streams, to mysterious teases, to hasty trailer drops with new info. The next Scarlet and Violet update is going to be via the latter. Announced on Twitter, a new trailer for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is on the way, and scheduled for tomorrow, September 7 at 9AM ET.
Typically these will showcase new mechanics, creatures, and storyline additions, clocking in at a few minutes long, or up to six-ish minutes. Sometimes these are accompanied with voiceovers that provide a ton of new info, coupled with website additions that elaborate on what was discussed in the video. Either way it's all getting dropped at once at 9AM ET, so everyone can enjoy it at the same time. When that happens, you can find the video here, where it will just appear.
I'm not really sure what to expect or what I even need to see at this point beyond some sort of game-changing evolution for the series. So far Scarlet and Violet look like competent Pokemon games, and the "open world" seems to be the biggest focus thus far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["I'm not going to be able to show anything until it's ready"
Two years ago, Microsoft announced a new Fable at an Xbox Games Showcase event. I completely forgot that even happened, and was reminded of its existence this past weekend. Head of Microsoft Studios, Matt Booty, had something to say about that at a PAX West Microsoft panel (which you can watch right here at roughly the 45:00 mark).
Here's what Booty had to say about not showing the game off as of late:
"Part of my job is giving air cover to the team, right? So they don't want to show stuff early before it's ready to go, but if there's one game where that's kind of flipped around, where every time I see something I say, 'we should show this', it's Fable. Because there's a lot of cool stuff...uh...the team has made it very clear that I am not going to be able to show anything until it's ready. But Playground...what I'll say is that the craft and dedication that they brought to Forza Horizon, every bit of that will be applied to Fable. They get it."

"It's Fable" is an interesting statement that's worth unpacking. Surely, the name still means something as the announcement garnered discussion; but Fable has been through the wringer, with an uneven set of core games, as well as a few odd spinoffs and a now-defunct digital card game. Reading a bit more into it, "it's Fable" has some baggage attached to it, and showing off the game outside of a cute little teaser will require a bit more finesse.

Pre-orders begin on September 15. The cover plates and DualSense launch globally on October 14. The headset becomes available in December. Sony has not listed prices for these items. 
Maybe one day we'll get a camo version of the recently revealed DualSense Edge controller. In related news, Sony recently increased the price of the PlayStation 5 in multiple non-U.S. territories. It also acquired Savage Games Studios as part of its newly formed mobile division.]]></summary>

I say it's a trailer that's kind of new because if you've been keeping up with Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, there's a good chance you've already seen it. It's the NSFW one released last week, but it featured Japanese VO with subtitles. Today, CDPR has released the same trailer with the English dub now. 
Check it out for yourself below: 
Q: Will Cyberpunk: Edgerunners have English dubbing?

As you can see, the English dub sounds great. The studio also announced the series will feature 12 total dubs, including English, Japanese, German, Polish, French, and more. There will be subtitles for each of those languages and many more too.

Street Fighter 6 fans, eager to see recent reveals Kimberly and Juri in action, won't have to wait too much longer before the colorful duo start throwing fists. Capcom Japan has announced that it will be broadcasting a new episode of its studio-based "Capcom TV" show, which will spotlight both of the World Warriors in action.
The episode will see Capcom TV hosts joined by Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto, who will be showing off both Juri and Kimberly in the duo's first-ever real-time gameplay demonstration. We can expect to see Juri's fully revised Fuha system and returning, lightning-fast divekick, while new gal Kimberly will be giving us all a lesson in the ways of Bushinryu.

Golden path locales like Midgard and its massive Lake of the Nine, Alfheim, home to light and dark elves, Helheim, the underworld, and Jötunheim, the land of Giants, were sprawling zones in their own right, filled with enough content to keep players engaged.

So as for what to expect, your guess is as good as anyone else's. I wager we'll be seeing some new Pokémon, perhaps some more information about the legendaries and how they play into the wider narrative of this gen, and maybe a new look at some gym leaders. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait long. 
In the meantime, watch the latest Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer for a quick look at this gen's competitive play, and then catch up on everything we learned from the recent Pokémon Presents livestream.

Coming to the Switch in 2024, LUCID will boast a "massive overworld" and tasks players with solving challenging puzzles, facing off against fearsome beasts, and revisiting previously explored areas with brand new items and weaponry. Sure sounds like your typical Metroidvania!

It's an Xbox Game Pass Disney Dreamlight kind of week, as Microsoft has unveiled all of the new Game Pass additions arriving soon.
To be clear, Disney Dreamlight is coming to multiple platforms this week in the form of an "early access" version: even on Switch! It's described as a simulator with quests added in, and we have someone checking it out now to see if it's worth your time. Note that "[Xbox Game Pass]  members get early access, exclusive cosmetic rewards, and in-game currency."
Beyond Dreamlight, Microsoft has also added a typically unique array of games to Game Pass, including Train Sim World 3, and a family game in the form of DC League of Super-Pets: Adventures of Krypto and Ace. It's not the most exciting set of games, but given how on the fence so many people are with Dreamlight Valley, we're getting one "Game-Pass-Perfect" title at the very least. You can find the full list of games coming through September 15 below.
Xbox Game Pass Week of September 5 additions:
Disney Dreamlight Valley: Founder’s Edition, September 6 (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Opus Magnum, September 6 (PC)
Train Sim World 3, September 6 (Console and PC)
Xbox Game Pass Week of September 12 additions:
Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation, September 13 (PC)

It’s the stuff of dreams for anyone with any level of attachment to Disney properties, and it's what you get to experience every day in Disney Dreamlight Valley.
Dreamlight Valley could easily be a cynical play on nostalgia, letting you build a miniature Disney theme park village, sprinkling some shallow life-sim elements, and leaving it at that. Instead, it’s a surprisingly character-driven experience that’s heavy on customization, with some thoughtful commentary on growing up and a (mostly) relaxing loop that wants you to have as much fun as possible. It’s just a shame it runs so poorly on the Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony veteran bows out after decades-long tenure
Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced that one of the PlayStation brand's longest-running developers, Masayasu Ito, will retire from the company at the end of September. Ito's departure was first communicated to Bloomberg, before the publisher made its own statement on the official SIE website.
Masayasu Ito started with Sony way back in 1986, where he worked on the company's range of vehicular stereo systems — back when audio equipment was the cornerstone of Sony's technological output. Ito would not join the PlayStation brand until the year 2000, when his design know-how would be put to use in the development of PS2 accessories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaAY-jAjm0w&t=1s
Ito would become a key player in the division, becoming part of the architecture team for the PS4 and PS4 Pro consoles, as well as the popular handheld console PlayStation Portable (PSP). Most recently, Ito had the unenviable task of co-engineering Sony's most recent hardware release, PS5. Creating powerful, next-gen technology against the backdrop of severely hampered production, component, and distribution shortages is no small feat, though the console would see its heralded arrival on November 12, 2020.
Ito's contribution to the PlayStation brand's success in the past two decades is clearly his legacy, having overseen the release of some of the best-selling game consoles of all time. Ito will retire from Sony Interactive Entertainment on October 1, 2022, when he will be replaced by Lin Tao, who currently serves as SIE's SVP of Finance, Corporate Development, and Strategy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["You've got my blessing!".
One of the biggest surprises of the year was undoubtedly the launch of Portal and Portal 2 via the Portal: Companion Collection on Switch. Widely regarded as two of the greatest video games of all time, the ports run like butter on Nintendo's hybrid console, no doubt introducing a swathe of new players to the world of Aperture Science along with characters like Wheatley and the esteemed GlaDOS.
One of the running jokes with Valve is that the publisher is seemingly incapable of creating a third entry to their popular IP. Franchises like Left 4 Dead, Portal, and Half-Life have all more or less come to an end with their respective sophomore titles (though you could argue that Half-Life Alyx is technically the third mainline entry to the Half-Life series), but this hasn't stopped fans from requesting and petitioning for more of that Valve goodness.

Footage from the build was shared by Reddit user Parzalai, who said they had been banned from their EA account for leaking a previous build. Modders have been running their own multiplayer servers based on leaked builds of skate. for months, so it’s not surprising to see further leaks spring up from the game’s playtests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a time before GameCube.
Beta footage can often be a double-edged sword. On the one hand you get to see the origins of some of your favourite games - with poorer graphics and mechanics to boot - but on the other you occasionally experience a sense of delayed loss, especially when seeing footage from a game that never saw the light of day.
We are currently in the stages of something like this after watching GameXplain's latest video (thanks, Go Nintendo for the heads up) which breaks down footage from a Japanese promotional video for the Super Mario 64 soundtrack - pfft, as if those bangers needed promotion. Aside from some pre-release Mario footage, the advert also contains a small number of clips from the cancelled Kirby's Air Ride game on the N64. Some of this footage has appeared online in the past, though the higher quality of this video really gives us a sneak peek at what the console's puff-ball racer could have been.

Sega has opened European pre-orders on its upcoming retro hardware Sega Mega Drive II Mini — The dinky, old-school console can be ordered exclusively from retailer Amazon at a cost of £104.99  GBP / €104.99 EUR. The console is expected to ship next month on October 27.
The Sega Mega Drive II Mini comes bundled with one controller, an HDMI lead, and a USB power lead (it does not include an AC adaptor). The console itself is pre-loaded with 60 classic Sega Mega Drive and Sega Mega CD games, some of which will be making their Euro debut. Unfortunately, as predicted some of the obscurities that are included on the JPN edition of the hardware will not be making the jump overseas — but the console still boasts an impressive roster of hit releases...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sight of a two-carriage train is normally something that prompts a deep sigh of despair from me in real life. Nine times out of ten, it's a sign that something's gone wrong further up the line - that someone, somewhere, has sent out a train with half its usual number of carriages, and is therefore destined to ruin everyone's day in the process by cramming us all in like a pack of sardines. 
In Afterburn's adorable train puzzler Railbound, however, two carriages are a cause for celebration. In a game that's about guiding numbered compartments onto the back of an engine (using a limited number of track tiles to get them there in the right order), two-carriage puzzles offer the perfect amount of cerebral head-scratching. They've got a bit more bite than simply guiding a single carriage to its destination, but they're not so complicated that they'll repeatedly make you reach for the hint button to help you fill in the gaps. Railbound has a tendency to be a bit too abstract in its later stages, but more on that in a sec. All you need to know right now is that there are plenty of smart ideas to wrap your head around here, and that you'll be grinning from ear to ear by the time you reach the end of the line.

With the likes of Splatoon 3, Bayonetta 3, and Sonic Frontiers launching in the coming weeks and months, you might have forgotten that a little game called Dragon Quest Treasures will be making its way to the Switch on December 9th, 2022.
Although billed as a Dragon Quest spin-off during Nintendo's own Direct Mini showcase earlier this year, Treasures nevertheless features a boatload of characters, locations, and monsters to discover, and Square-Enix has now lifted the lid on some more of the game's core mechanics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mesa recently landed BPTC software fallback handling that is a requirement for OpenGL 4.2 support but BPTC is not natively supported by all GPU hardware, particularly on the embedded side. That software emulation support for BPTC is similar to what already has existed within Mesa for the ASTC and ETC formats too. A merge request is pending that also adds S3TC software fallback handling, which helps out some of the smaller, embedded GPU drivers too for getting more games running that are dependent on S3 Texture Compression...]]></summary>

Each button has a tiny screen behind it, and when pressed can do any number of things - launching a program, changing to a new scene in a stream, adjusting your media volume, muting a microphone or sending out an alert. It's ideal for automation, giving you an easy way to trigger scripts or shortcuts that speed up the dreary parts of your job or your favourite game, and of course for game streamers it's invaluable. The MK.2 model normally costs £139, but today at Currys you can pick one up for £97 using the code GAMING30.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BioShock Remastered, BioShock 2 Remastered and BioShock Infinite have all fallen afoul of some questionably titled “quality of life” updates that publishers 2K Games released last week. These updates added a new 2K Launcher to all three BioShocks that appears when booting them up from Steam, but as found by GamingOnLinux, something about this launcher doesn’t take kindly to Linux-based operating systems. Linux-based operating systems like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS.


As it happens, then, there's a chance – if you’re trying to play on Valve’s handheld PC – that all these updates will do is swing a bloodied 9-iron into the Deck’s ability to launch the affected games at all. Whoopsie doodle.

As our PAX West team found out over the weekend, NuTales will still be split up into an episodic-style chapter structure, according to director of production James Lopez, but you won't have to wait several months before you can play them altogether.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A truly dynamic story is a goal game designers have strived toward for decades. Worldwalker Games' Wildermyth gets closer to that goal than most. In this spellbinding RPG, players guide bands of heroes through a lifetime of adventure, embarking on dozens of short, whimsical quests wherein they grow, age, and quite literally evolve, with the potential to transform into walking trees, celestial beings, and anthropomorphised crows.


Wildermyth is an inspired example of narrative design, with some nifty tactical combat to boot. But when Nate Austin, his wife Annie, and his brother Doug began developing the game around eight years ago, the weight of emphasis between storytelling and combat was very much the other way around.

Ellen McLain (the TF2 announcer), Gary Schwartz (Heavy and Demoman), John Patrick Lowrie (Sniper) and Robin Atkin Downes (Medic) answered all our questions including how they each created the voices for the characters and if they would they return for a completely metaphorical release of Team Fortress 3 which - spoilers - was a resounding yes.

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v pondělí 5. září od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končíme o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

My experience with the PS2 version of Destroy All Humans 2 is rather limited. While I enjoyed the original back when it was released, I merely rented the sequel. Then my brother-in-law and I just messed around in co-op and I never made it anywhere. However, the fun with physics gameplay left such an impression on me that it’s been on my hit list for years. The problem is, the memory that stuck out most for me was its ugly-as-sin graphics and oppressive draw fog.
Thankfully, THQ Nordic and Black Forest Games decided to go all the way with the series and gussy up Destroy All Humans 2 in the same way it did for the original title. That means, while the graphics have been upgraded to the nines, the warts of the PS2-era gameplay are still present underneath. …]]></summary>

It's another outing for a gaming icon in this week's Arcade Archives entry, as everybody's favorite pill-popper Pac-Man returns in one of his less-remembered releases, Pac & Pal, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, courtesy of the fine folks at Hamster Corp.
Released to the arcade market in the summer of 1983, Pac & Pal is the third mainline entry in Bandai Namco's in-house Pac-Man series, and sees the puck-shaped protagonist return to his maze-chasing origins. In Pac & Pal, Pac-Man must once again gobble up power pellets and items of fruit strewn around a series of mazes, while staying one step ahead of returning ghosts Inky, Pinky, Blinky, and Clyde.

Good morning, one and all, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing?

We can just entertain ourselves with endless stories of mergers and acquisitions. Why won't somebody acquire me? I could really use the dollarydoos (or Renminbi, or whatever).
Why won't somebody merge with me? Like Rebecca Ferguson, or you, reading this. I guess that's a form of merging. You're merging with my psyche...

Set in a dystopian future straight out of the cocaine haze of the 1970s, Rollerdrome takes two of gaming’s most cherished pastimes—pulling off sick combos and murder—and mashes them up into an audacious spectacle that is definitely not Norman Jewison’s Rollerball. Taking control of mysterious rookie Kara Hassan, it’s skate or die for players as you’ll have to grab, grind, flip and twist your way to high-score combos while gunning down enemies hellbent on stopping you. Kara clearly has the skills to be the next Rollerdrome champion, but with the corporation behind the sport plotting against her, she’ll have to use every trick in the book to survive.
Again, this is not Norman Jewison’s Rollerball. With most of the social commentary pushed to the background in f…]]></summary>

Before I even started playing Cult of the Lamb, I knew I was going to love it. First off, we've got the cute art style going on, so that box was ticked immediately. Plus the conceit of a simulator about running your own cult is hilarious and fresh in its own way.
I think us roguelike and simulator fans can agree that both genres are having something of a renaissance right now, and Cult of the Lamb manages to hit every note in perfect harmony. Now maybe it's the antidepressants talking, but playing through it has been some of the most fun I've had with a game all year.

Gilbert was lovely enough to tell us all about the next game in the Monkey Island saga -  what it was like to return to Monkey Island's world after so long, what we can expect from the puzzles, and snippets of the game's story.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's day two of PAX West and to kick off our second day of game events and demos we got hands-on with a build of Neowiz's Pinocchio RPG, Lies of P. The gameplay demo caused quite a stir when it was at Gamescom earlier this year, so we made it one of our priorities to check it out here in Seattle.
Neowiz are not actually at PAX so there wasn't anyone on the team to give us some behind-the-scenes info, but I got stuck into the demo for a solid 30 minutes, brawling with the game's angry robot lads that roamed the city's blood-washed cobbled streets.
Overall, I had a great time with the demo. Yes, it is incredibly similar to Bloodborne in both its combat and environments but there are plenty of other elements that steer it away from FromSoftware's horror-filled gothic RPG. If you want more details instead of that short summary then check out our video below where I talk about my time with the build, and about having my arse kicked by giant mechanical automatons. Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blast back to the '90s in a tale of pop and romance
A new kind of love story is headed to Steam, with a musical twist. Riley & Rochelle is an upcoming new mystery from Sheinman Games that sees you untangling the relationship of two musicians.
Riley and Rochelle are two artists from different worlds, who wind up falling in and out of love in the '90s. Hailing from Detroit is Riley Stone, a rocker who came up through the indie music scene. Meanwhile Rochelle Robert is a former child pageant star who gets discovered and makes her way into the spotlight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5LO9H8YCfM
The two collide and grow closer, and it's your job to figure out how, why, and what happened after. Riley & Rochelle lets you piece together music, journal entries, and information to figure out the story. Maybe, even, whether anyone gets a decent ending.
The game is a collaboration between Tim Sheinman and Natalia Yanchak, with art from Mack Chater, Murray Somerwolff, and Josiah Whitfield. And the Sheinman Games label is what caught my eye about this in the first place.

He was a boy, she was a girl
Sheinman has made several investigation-centric games in the past. One in particular I dug was Rivals, a similar mix of music and detective work that had the player piece together the history of a band and its falling out.
Just the general idea of pulling together scraps of info for a VH1's Behind The Music style program is interesting enough. But the music here is spot-on, too. A clever mix of information hunting and good tunes makes for a pretty unique style of detective game.
Riley & Rochelle is currently aiming for a launch on PC and Mac. You can head on over and wishlist it on Steam at this link.

Ever since Paradox Interactive announced Victoria 3, I've been in a state of semi-disbelief. It was a strategy game in-joke for so long that I couldn't believe it was really happening. I was provided a preview build of the upcoming socio-economic grand strategy game thanks to Paradox. To quote Sidra Holland and Jackie Chiles, it's "real, and it's fantastic." And soon, you too can politick to your heart's content when the game releases on October 25, 2022.
For those of you present who aren't cool enough to know what the Victoria series is all about, an introduction is in order. Victoria is a grand strategy game series aptly set during the Victorian era. Whereas other entries in the Paradox family of grand strategy games focus on war or lineage,…]]></summary>

By the time I knew something was up with Sam Barlow and Half Mermaid's latest FMV mystery, I had already ripped open Pandora's Box. I just didn't know it yet. Little hints and bread crumbs were laying there. Percolating theories were just waiting to be blown open to something big. And I just kept tugging at the threads.
Immortality is the latest game from Barlow and co., and it sees Barlow returning to full-motion video similar to Her Story and Telling Lies. The most obvious difference is how the experience itself handles; rather than typing queries into a database, you have a reel setup similar to a classic Moviola machine and a crosshair.
Point that crosshair at something that catches your eye, and Im…]]></summary>

This time though, you'll  need to use code FANCY15 to knock 15% off the price of the BoostStation, bringing it down to that alluring £93 price point once again.

God of War Ragnarok is on its way, with some all-new battles for Kratos and his son Atreus to wind up in. Today, we got a quick hit of some combat, showing off new moves Kratos will have in November.
As part of Game Informer's cover story for Ragnarok, the team has already talked about changes coming to Kratos' arsenal. Today's video shows just what that looks like in action. We see him running around an arena, beating the daylights out of some merfolk-looking enemies.
A key component of Kratos' move set, as the video describes, is the idea of playing with your food. The god of war can really send enemies flying and bouncing around, as well as employ some elemental moves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QZhk4w66_8
These elemental moves are part of a new system for Kratos' weapons. The Leviathan Axe can bring out frost magic, while the Blades of Chaos elicit fire. By holding or mashing the Triangle button, the weapons become infused with the elements, doing extra damage to enemies.
He's really in his element here
It's a quick little burst of gameplay, with the video coming in at under two minutes. Still, it's nice to see some gameplay of God of War Ragnarok. I've been curious as to how different the combat would feel in Ragnarok versus the 2018 iteration. Seems like Sony Santa Monica Studios have found some ways of adding on top of what was already a pretty solid set of mechanics.
The written portion of Game Informer's cover story also talks about the shields, both the Dauntless and Stonewall versions, as well as some other granular bits of gameplay detail. It might still seem far away, but November is inching ever closer. And with it, plenty more enemies for Kratos to smash apart.

A bundle of trouble is headed to Warner Bros. Games crossover fighter MultiVersus in just a few short days, as developer Player First Games has dropped a new teaser trailer that points to the arrival of Gizmo, the heroic little Mogwai from Joe Dante's 1984 hit, Gremlins.
A short teaser video sees the ancient, ornate chest that is Gizmo's home open up in response to the sound of cavorting mayhem, suggesting that the sweet lol' fuzzball is headed to MultiVersus in order to keep his arch nemesis, Stripe, in line. While details on Gizmo are very sparse at the time of writing, it is believed that he will be an individual character from Stripe, with his own moveset and abilities.

Then, during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live event, Gearbox officially revealed the sequel, which is less a direct continuation of Telltale’s story and more a spiritual successor to the series, which is evident in its official name: New Tales from the Borderlands. 
That new trailer gave us a look at the new protagonists – altruistic scientist Anu, her street-wise brother Octavio, and local business owner Fran – as well as a look at just how Tales from the Borderlands this new entry is this time around. Sure, it’s a new cast and an all-new story in the world of Borderlands, but it’s clear it will play and feel familiar…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-09-02T22:16:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of Splitgate, the sci-fi multiplayer shooter with portals, received some bittersweet news today. Developer 1047 Games has announced it’s finally bringing the game out of its lengthy beta and launching it in 1.0 next month. It also revealed plans to create another title within the Splitgate universe. But to facilitate work on this next project, it will cease feature development of Splitgate.
1047 explains in a press release that it’s developing a new shooter in Unreal Engine 5 set in the world of Splitgate, which means it will also feature portals. There aren't any more details beyond this, but it will be the team’s full-time project going forward. 
As such, 1047 is launching Splitgate out of beta on September 15, but it will move away from creating substantial content after that. However, the team assures fans that Splitgate will remain online. The game’s launch will kick off a new season, which includes a new, free battle pass featuring an infinite number of levels along with new characters, skins, and other goodies. Splitgate’s weekly featured playlists, and item drops will continue, and the team will still work on smaller fixes and updates. 
You can read 1047's full statement below (click to enlarge):
Splitgate launched in PC beta in 2019, but the game really caught fire when its console beta began in 2021. The game became so popular on PlayStation and Xbox that servers regularly became congested, to the point that 1047 decided to postpone the full launch and keep the game in an indefinite beta to focus on further stabilizing the online infrastructure as the project continued to receive more funding. Season 0 began last August, adding a new map, game mode, and other features.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DC Fandome, the virtual fan convention showcasing DC movies, TV shows, and, of course, video games, will not take place this year, Warner Bros. Discovery confirms. 
The first DC Fandome took place in 2020, serving as a livestream alternative to in-person conventions in the wake of the pandemic. It featured virtual panels with celebrities and filmmakers that provided new announcements, trailers, and early looks at all things DC media. In terms of video games, the 2020 and 2021 editions gave us substantial new looks at Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. 
In a statement to Popverse, Warner Bros. Discovery explains the decision by writing:
Fandome’s cancellation is an unfortunate blow in the ongoing transition resulting from April’s Warner Bros./Discovery merger. Although only two years old, Fandome has found great success, generating millions of views. Last year's show was highlighted by new trailers for The Batman, Black Adam, and The Flash. Unfortunately, the DC film slate has largely been flipped on its head since then as several projects have been delayed (Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Shazam! Fury of the Gods), in limbo (The Flash), or canceled (Batgirl). 
While we won't see them during DC's big event, Gotham Knights launches on October 21, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League arrives sometime in 2023.

As a total freshman to the series, I was a little intimidated by the prospect of sinking my feet into the trenches of a dense strategy bonanza, especially as things kicked off with a literal history lesson.
But after watching and absorbing one of the game's early missions, I can genuinely say that I'd be confident enough to give it a go when it comes out. Even perhaps, confident enough to say that I'd genuinely enjoy it quite a bit as a total newbie.

I almost don't want to say any more about it, not because it can be spoiled but because it seems appropriately respectful. Not in a reverent sense, you understand. It just feels like such a world should be preserved, even slightly feared, rather than trampled on by some idiot with a camera in her face.
To call Northern Journey "retro" would completely misrepresent it. It's beautiful in an ugly, desolate way reminiscent of Kenshi or Morrowind. It's translucent in its exposition but not obtuse, hostile, or obnoxiously hard. It's a bit clunky, without that ever undermining the experience. It's vaguely amateurish, yet almost consciously so, like a painter who knows their talent and intent is enough to overcome any technical flaws. This is a bloody treat and I'm so glad I got to play it.

This time, they’re adding in a new game mode, quick start, and a very odd new character.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another indie developer has come forward publicly with allegations that UK-based publishers PQube have withheld money from them. Thai dev team Corecell claim they’ve only seen some of the minimum guaranteed money agreed when they signed the European console publishing rights to their action-puzzle game AeternoBlade 2 over to PQube in 2019. 

Corecell say they attempted to resolve things with PQube but that didn’t work, and they had to terminate the publishing agreement in 2020. Since then, Corecell have tried to regain the rights to AeternoBlade 2 from PQube to no avail. Corecell allege that PQube did offer to return the rights to the game, but only if they would agree to keep the situation secret.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Statistically, there’s a good chance you clicked onto this page with a Logitech G502 mouse. Between its Proteus Spectrum and refreshed Hero models, the G502 has sold boatloads, and was voted as RPS readers’ favourite gaming mouse in both 2019 and 2021. Not undeservedly either, as it’s sat atop our best gaming mouse rankings for years. Making more drastic improvements to it wouldn’t therefore seem like a pressing priority, but Logitech have had a crack regardless with the new G502 X series.


There’s a trio of redesigned rodents in this family: the standard G502 X I’ve got on review here, the wireless G502 X Lightspeed, and the G502 X Plus, which is essentially the G502 X Lightspeed with added RGB lighting. Since prices max out at £150 / $160 for the G502 X Plus, the two Lightspeed-equipped mice could be less expensive alternatives to Razer’s new DeathAdder V3 Pro and Basilisk V3 Pro – but as the cheapest and most direct successor the G502 Hero, it’s the G502 X that’s likely to see the most desk action. Does it deserve to?

For the uninitiated, Night City Wire is basically like CDPR's version of a Nintendo Direct, except the showcases are specifically focused on Cyberpunk 2077. They were quite prevalent in the leadup to the release of Cyberpunk 2077, but now, with it nearing two years old, Night City Wire has grown to be rarer. The next one airs on Sept. 6 at 8 a.m. PT/11 a.m. ET, though, and will be "about our upcoming anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners and what's next for Cyberpunk 2077."
Choooom! There's something new on the horizon – a special episode of Night City Wire!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First impressions can be interesting. I didn’t know what to expect when I met David Ventura at the Backbeat booth, after a long opening day of the weekend-long Japanese indie gaming event BitSummit. I knew of his work - now the CEO of his self-founded studio Ichigoichie with developers based both in Japan and Sweden, Ventura has had his hands in a number of highly-influential rhythm games over the course of his career. This includes work on Gitaroo Man and Elite Beat Agents during his time in Japan at iNiS, having worked at the studio for a decade before moving to Sweden to work outside of games on educational music software. In 2018 he returned to games by founding Ichigoichie (stylised as 151A). Their first game, Hexagroove, blended strategy, rhythm and educational tools for a game that captured the building blocks of being a DJ.


Ventura was at BitSummit to showcase the successor to this game, Backbeat. It’s a bit of a departure from much of his past work, acting more like a puzzle game with a musical soul, albeit one where the act of creating and playing music together is imbued into every solution. As the crowd began to leave the bustling convention hall for the day, I went to the booth for one last demo, and the chance to speak to the person behind it all… who was sat at his demo kiosk playing the keytar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Avalanche and Warner Bros. Interactive have released a new Hogwarts Legacy featurette that dives deep into the design of the titular school. It also features the first-ever look at the four house common rooms in Hogwarts Legacy, a sneak peek of some of the easter eggs in the game, and more. 
This new featurette runs more than four minutes long and gives players the most in-depth look at the actual school of Hogwarts in this game thus far. As noted in the video, the design of Hogwarts is based on the eight Harry Potter movies and the books written by controversial author J.K. Rowling, who will undoubtedly be making money from the sales of this game. 
Check out the featurette for yourself below: 


As you can see, Hogwarts is looking great, as are the four common rooms. What’s especially interesting is it gives viewers a look at the Hufflepuff common room, which has rarely been seen on screen in the wizarding world, as pointed out in the video. 
What’s more, the featurette also contains information about linking your WB Games account to your Harry Potter Fan Club account. Doing so will automatically bring your Fan Club wand into the game alongside your Hogwarts house, which can be determined on the Fan Club’s site through a special sorting quiz. You’ll also unlock some in-game rewards for doing so, too, including a special decorative house robe and a beaked skull mask. Check them out in the gallery below: 

For more, read about how Hogwarts Legacy has been delayed from 2022 to February 10, 2023, and then check out the unique PlayStation 5 DualSense features for Hogwarts Legacy. Watch this Hogwarts Legacy trailer from last week that showcases unforgivable curses and Sebastian Sallow’s Dark Legacy questline after that.

Their games scratch the nostalgic itch while not reverting to the technical problems and gameplay hurdles that we’ve long since moved beyond. Part of what makes Gunvolt appealing is that it refines and expands upon a formula we see in the Mega Man X series, and it’s a similar intent that defines the company’s approach to their latest project, Grim Guardians: Demon Purge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As indie developers from Japan and around the world descended upon the former Japanese capital of Kyoto for Bitsummit 2022, some developers present at the event were showcasing their games a little closer to home. Having already been hyped up amongst Japanese games outlets for its unique visuals and inspirations from Japanese yokai and folk tales, Kitsune: The Journey Of Adashino was a rather hot ticket at the event, and with an English localisation and a release in 2023 or 2024 planned, it stands with the opportunity to shine a light on the Japanese indie gaming scene.


While it may perhaps be reductive to make a Studio Ghibli comparison to the game’s opening moments, the familiarity many have with those films compared to Japanese folklore makes the equivalence an easy one. My time with the demo was from a moment early in the game, when you’ve already set foot into this new world but don't have much knowledge about the yokai-infested supernatural surprises that await you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After growing to become one of the most-leaked games in franchise history, Ubisoft has confirmed that Assassin's Creed Mirage is real and we'll be learning more about it next week.
That's because the publisher is hosting a Ubisoft Forward on Sept. 10 at Noon P.T./3 p.m. ET, which has been previously advertised as the event where we'll learn more about the future of Assassin's Creed and more. It seems Assassin's Creed Mirage will be the big highlight of the show, but it's possible we learn more about Assassin's Creed Infinity, which is Ubisoft's in-development Assassin's Creed live-service platform. We might even learn about non-Assassin's Creed games, too. 
Assassin's Creed Mirage is the next Assassin's Creed game.

September 1, 2022
If rumors and leaks about Assassin's Creed Mirage are correct, we're in for a game set in Baghdad with Basim, a major character from Assassin's Creed Valhalla (if you know, you know), as the protagonist. Leaks indicate that he's not yet an assassin at the start of Mirage and instead, a thief who comes to discover the Hidden Ones, which later become the Assassin's order in the series. Rumors also point to this game being a much more stripped back take on the franchise, feeling more like older games in the series rather than the massive and sprawling open-world RPGs of late.
The potential for this to feel like a bridge between classic Assassin's Creed and new Assassin's Creed has me incredibly excited. I love the new games, especially Origins and Odyssey, but they're downright exhausting. An Assassin's Creed game I can beat in less than 80 hours? Sign me up!
In the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of every Assassin's Creed game and then catch up on everything announced during the Assassin's Creed 15th Anniversary Celebration stream that aired earlier this summer. 
Are you excited about Mirage? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

The biggest addition in the update finally goes live following a beta period in July. Campaign co-op, which supports up to four players, features cross-platform support, shared progression, mission replay, and a batch of new achievements. 
However, campaign co-op will be online only. 343 announced that it has chosen to cease development on local splitscreen co-op to reallocate those resources towards quickly implementing online updates and improvements based on player feedback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back at Geoff Fest, I spoke with Glenn Schofield about The Callisto Protocol, its gore system, spiky walls, and batteries. From what I'd seen and heard, I was keen to see more of the sci-fi horror game that's not Dead Space but is also quite like Dead Space.
So, at this year's Geoffscom I was able to see a 20-minute presentation of some new Callisto goodness and then chat with Striking Distance Studios' chief technology officer Mark James about what I'd seen. We touched on dismemberment, 3D printers, and Shaun Of The Dead, naturally.

        <updated>2022-09-01T15:18:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a new blog post, Xbox head Phil Spencer discussed Microsoft’s intentions for Activision Blizzard’s IPs following its ongoing acquisition of the company. Among those plans, naturally, is to bolster the value of Xbox Game Pass by adding Activision Blizzard’s library of titles, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, and Diablo.
Spencer discusses expanding player choice through Game Pass by offering library titles for an affordable subscription fee, appealing to players of various budgets. Spencer hopes that including Activision Blizzard games will make the service more appealing to existing and potential subscribers. 
Spencer also reiterates Microsoft’s promise to keep popular Activision Blizzard franchises multiplatform, citing its handling of Minecraft as an example. Additionally, the company hopes to expand Activision’s portfolio to mobile platforms and make them available to play on other devices via cloud streaming. 
Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard is projected to be completed sometime during the summer of 2023. After that, it's anyone’s guess as to how long it will be before we see these franchises land on Game Pass. On the Blizzard side, Overwatch 2 launches in free-to-play early access on October 4, and Diablo IV is seemingly years away. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II releases in October, but the series will reportedly skip 2023, meaning the first entry under the Microsoft banner won't be until 2024 at the earliest.

August 31, 2022
Endnight Games' post on Twitter (seen above) says, in recent months, an exact drop date has been hard to pinpoint, but the newfound scope led to the team's hard decision:
Based on trailers, Sons of the Forest is the studio's most ambitious title yet, with a vast open world, a new AI companion, updated visuals, and multiple warring factions scattered throughout the landscape. It looks to be even more brutal and terrifying than the last game, and I can't wait to get my hands on it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stories always came first for the team at NOVECT. The critical and commercial success of The House In Fata Morgana surprised many upon the title’s international release, including the developers themselves. Headlines were made when the game shot temporarily to the spot of most critically-acclaimed game of all time on Metacritic, despite being still relatively under the radar beforehand. Fata Morgana first released to the public in Japan in 2012, and gained a cult following before its eventual successful international release. The reason for it's acclaim? Storytelling. Every single review praised Fata Morgana's surprising and enthralling twists and turns as what made this visual novel a must-play title, even for non-fans of the genre.


At the time development started, NOVECT were less a development studio, and more of a group of univeristy friends with minimal coding experience but a love for telling stories; a hobby project run by friends on the side of university and normal jobs inside and out of the games industry, only becoming a fully-fledged studio later down the line. Fast forward to today, NOVECT are a firmly-established indie developer with games and multimedia adaptations of their work under their belt, and new project still mysteriously known as "Project Code Name 'M'" now in the works. Originally starting development in 2019 and announced earlier this year, Project M had its first public demo at this month’s Bitsummit indie gaming showcasing in Kyoto.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There were high expectations going into Buried Memory, patch 6.2 for Final Fantasy XIV - new raids, new story, and, most importantly, a new mode called Island Sanctuary to fulfil all of your farming dreams. There were Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing memes aplenty in the run up to release, with players hungry to customise their own cosy piece of Hydaelyn.


Meant as a casual mode to relax away from dungeons and grinding levels, Island Sanctuary has no Job level limitations and can be enjoyed by anyone. Even though you can craft your own buildings and gather materials, you don’t need to have played any gathering or crafting classes. With a base to customise, crops to tend to and a pasture full of animals to pet, it’s easy to see why comparisons were drawn to other farming games such as Stardew Valley.

Ubisoft say they’ve been “exploring what is possible to reduce disruption” over the last month, hence the shuffled date for decommissioning.

That's £300 below RRP and a new low-water mark.

In it, you'll see him control Anita, one of the game's many playable characters, as she searches for her partner in the small town of Sardinia, Italy.
Unfortunately for Anita, it's not a great time to be in the town because of some strange ritualistic things happening. That translates to a terrifying creature that stalks Anita and others through the darkness of the night and you must avoid it all while remaining alive as you search for clues to end this night of terror and misery. 
In the New Gameplay Today segment below, we have more than 15 minutes of brand-new Saturnalia footage to showcase. Enjoy!


Saturnalia is being developed and published by Santa Ragione. It's due out on PC exclusively via the Epic Games Store sometime this year. For more, check out the Saturnalia reveal trailer.]]></summary>

Having gone hands-on with a short 20-minute-ish demo of the game at this year's Gamescom, I can confirm that the remake is real and seems faithful to the original despite some heavy tinkers in the modernisation station. For nostalgic fans it should make for an exciting revisit to cyberspace, but I'm unsure whether it'll land quite as well for newcomers seeking a showdown with Shodan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've got a pretty good line in interesting folk traditions here at RPS. I grew up in a county where staying up all night at the stone circle to welcome the Summer Solstice was an annual tradition (later augmented by a woman wearing antlers offering a selection of downers and hallucinogens), and as a child I had an unnecessary encounter with the Salisbury Hob-Nob. For the past few years Alice0 has gone to the Burryman's Parade, gracing us with pictures of that most wholesome gentleman. Rural traditions are fun if you're part of them, but to outsiders they can be unsettling at best. 
This is relevant to my thinking about Saturnalia, an upcoming survival horror game by Italian studio Santa Ragione, where a small group of outsiders try to escape a village on the night of an ancient ritual. I've been playing a preview build of Saturnalia for the last week or so, and also got to talk about it with the studio director Pietro Righi Riva. "I usually tell people, 'Oh, you should make a game in like six months', and I have tried to do that in the past," he tells me. "This one just kind of got out of hand. I found an email yesterday, as I was looking for finishing the credits, about me discussing some story items in April 2017." And, while I am sure that most developers don't wish they'd been making a video game in the middle of the pandemic, I think the extra time may have allowed Santa Ragione to make something excellent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember the release of The Last of Us better than any other video game – which is to say I remember it at all. 
In 2013, I was 19 and still practicing the unfortunate act of pre-ordering video games before I knew if they were good or not. As misfortune had it, it came out while I was out of town, but my Dad went and picked it up from our local GameStop for me. Like an absolute dork, I remember spending weeks looking at the picture of the box he sent me, practically counting the nanoseconds until I could play it myself. 
And when I did, it was everything I could've hoped. I was admittedly a less savvy media viewer back then and truly believed its story was unlike anything else. I don't think that's true anymore – it pretty shamelessly borrows from Cormac McCarthy's The Road, No Country F…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stranded: Alien Dawn is Haemimont Games’ second sci-fi sim on the trot, and despite being set on a planet that actually has air this time, it could well make Surviving Mars’ well-funded colony building feel like an afternoon playing with Lego. In Stranded, as I saw from a hands-off preview at Gamescom 2022, you’re certainly not planetside by choice, having crash-landed on an uncharted world with just four surviving astronauts left to scavenge, hunt and build their way towards something resembling a life.


“Like RimWorld”, I thought to myself upon hearing the pre-demo pitch, and subsequently wrote in my notes four separate times before ceasing to bother. If only mere words could convey just how much “like RimWorld” Stranded: Alien Dawn is – other 3D-ified clones exist, like last year’s Going Medieval, but here, even the exact spaceship-wrecking premise matches that of Ludeon Studios' seminal survival sim.

Just today, Chinese developer-publisher NetEase announced it was acquiring Detroit: Become Human dev Quantic Dream, and now, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Tencent have increased their stakes in From Software, the prolific developer behind the Dark Souls series and this year’s mega-hit, Elden Ring. 
This news comes from Gematsu, which posted a press release from Kadokawa Corporation, the parent company behind From Software. It says that through third-party allotment, Sixjoy Hong Kong, a Tencent Holdings subsidiary, has purchased 16.25% of From Software’s shares, while SIE has acquired 14.09%. Despite this, Kadokawa Corporation is still the largest shareholder of From Software, holding 69.66% of the shares.

But in a surprising turn of events, I left thinking the game was a real highlight of my time in Cologne's multi-hall maze of excellent people and overpriced schnitzel.
And most importantly, the guns didn't annoy me at all! In fact, their craic contributed a great deal to my enjoyment of the strangest FPS I've played in a while - one where I was forever grinning at the screen like an idiot. If you're a fan of Rick And Morty from before it got weird to be a fan of Rick And Morty (or Squanch Games' back catalogue, or general bizarro laughs), this is one for the wishlist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get your shovels ready because Shovel Knight Dig will burrow its way onto Switch, PC, and iOS via Apple Arcade next month. 
More specifically, the exciting Shovel Knight follow-up/spin-off title will hit those platforms on Sept. 23. What's more is that if you have an Apple Arcade subscription, you can play the game for free. It'll cost $24.99 on Switch and on Steam, however.
This news was revealed in a comical trailer released by Yacht Club Games, which you can watch for yourself below: 


"When Drill Knight and his dastardly digging crew blast apart Shovel Knight's peaceful campsite and steal his loot, he grabs his trusty Shovel Blade and starts tunneling after them," a press release reads. "But as he and Shield Knight soon discover, this adventure goes much deeper than a simple heist."
"Meet new friends and foes, visit strange lands, and outfit yourself in your quest to keep the entire land from collapsing underfoot. Jump, slash, and dig your way down an ever-changing chasm of mystery in Shovel Knight Dig, an all-new Shovel Knight adventure." 

While waiting to play Shovel Knight Dig on Sept. 23, read about Scrap Knight, a new character that will be featured in the game, and then watch the reveal trailer for the title.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The thrill of a card game is in the hand you get dealt. Luck can either be on your side, or you can earn it back by using your wits, carving out a victory you never thought possible. Other times, it all goes to pot and you get absolutely walloped, but hot damn if you didn't go down fighting. ORX has these moments in spades. Part deckbuilder, part roguelike and part tower defence, this is a real-time strategy game played by the seat of your pants, where a rolling deck of cards determines not only what kind of defences you can build, but also what buffs, spells and additional forces you can deploy to help defend your keep from the oncoming hordes. It's a gripping mix that's already claimed over a dozen hours of my time in recent weeks, and it's a number I can only see going up and up and up as it continues to develop in early access.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While mooching around Samsung’s Gamescom booth, waiting for their 990 Pro SSD reveal, I took the opportunity to play with an altogether more unusual addition to their hardware catalogue. The Samsung Odyssey Ark, for the unfamiliar, is a kind of all-in-one entertainment screen: a mammoth 55in Mini LED panel that can act as a desktop gaming monitor or living room TV, complete with honking great speakers and built-in support for all the big game streaming services so you can play on it without a PC or console. Unlike other monitors of this magnitude, it can also rotate into portrait mode, leaving the top curve towering over you like an unsympathetic Victorian headmaster. 


I actually enjoy a touch of design madness creeping into the occasional piece of PC gear, regardless of whether it can hang with the best gaming monitors that sensible people might buy. What I experienced with the Odyssey Ark, however, was a device that too often veered onto the wrong side of senseless – when it was even working properly.

At the time the project was being referred to as Rift, but multiple sources are now saying the game will be called Assassin’s Creed: Mirage. Both Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier and Giant Bomb’s Jeff Grubb say they’ve been told by people familiar with the game that Mirage is accurate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm going to level with you: I'm not a GSG player. I play strategy, sure, but grand strategy has always been a bit beyond me. I'm a fundamentally un-grand person; I spend most days dressed like a 14-year-old fan of Tony Hawk, I do not like olives or scallops, and I'm unable to predict the consequences of actions if they exist outside of, say, a 12 month timeframe. A game like Victoria 3, where the whole point is making decisions that have country-wide effects and outcomes years in the future, is essentially operating in a different language to any I understand.
I'm trying to learn new languages, though, so it's not an unwelcome challenge. The problem is that previewing Victoria 3 is quite an advanced level to dive in, the Paradox GSG equivalent of being a live translator for a UN summit when you're only just about able to read the French version of The Famous Five. In a presentation before I and others were let loose on the better part of a week with the game, it was claimed that Victoria 3 is the best yet for onboarding newcomers, with a deep and detailed tutorial system. And to that I say: kinda. Luckily, the AI in Victoria 3 is so advanced it's better at playing the game than I am.

Bouncing between appointments in this sea of booths and lanyards was jarring, but I'd eventually settle in after a few minutes of reconfiguring my brain to whatever presentation or control scheme was placed in front of me. Hyenas never gave me a chance.
I sat in a 20-minute presentation of the game and tried my level best to understand SEGA's stab at a live-service FPS. Instead, I exited the booth with whiplash... and a sense of curiosity. Somewhere inside the game's insufferable tone is a kernel of cleverness, I just need to get my mitts on it to confirm my suspicions. Otherwise, it's very difficult to really understand whether it can survive in such a saturated space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Drumroll, please, for the latest interactive, live action, film archival puzzle from Sam Barlow, of Her Story and Telling Lies. This latest rumination on voyeurism also delves into storytelling, sex, death, religion, love, lust, lies, pretence (as distinct from acting), power and self. That's a lot to pack into the partial, out of order clips of three different films, which manage to span both decades and careers. The central figure is Marissa Marcel, an almost-star actor who made three movies before disappearing. So the question you strive to answer, by looking through unedited takes and rehearsal footage, is: what happened to Marissa Marcel?
In typical Barlow fashion, the entirety of the footage isn't easily spooled through. From one starting clip you're able to watch it, flick back and forth through the recording, and pause it to use the in-game search tool to focus on a face or object on screen. Selecting it will then take you to that face or a similar object in a different clip, and eventually you build up a much fuller catalogue of footage.
Now. Immortality also talks quite a bit about sex, in various ways and for various reasons, and there is female nudity. So yes, you can enhance! Zoom! on a tit. And the game will take you to another clip featuring a similar tit. Ba-dum, tsh!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gungrave G.O.R.E. marks the return of the Gungrave franchise after almost 20 years (well, besides that VR game), and today we found out that the sequel is coming just in time for Thanksgiving. A new cinematic trailer shown during Gamescom reveals a November release date, and it runs down the wacky cast of characters and why you'll be riddling them with bullets. 
The largely CG trailer sprinkles in a bit of in-game action, though you should check out this previous gameplay video for a better taste of the over-the-top combat. We’re introduced to Grave’s allies who band together to take on a fearsome foursome of antagonists looking to rule the world (probably). Fans of the PS2 games and the anime that spawned from them will be happy to know that G.O.R.E. looks as bombastic and absurd as they'd expect. Newcomers that enjoy bullets, blood, and insanity will likely feel right at home. 


Gungrave G.O.R.E. launches November 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Pre-ordering nets you a special Grim Reaper skin designed by former Tango Gameworks designer Ikumi Nakamura, who is working on G.O.R.E. as a character artist.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mafia celebrates its 20th anniversary today, and in a new blog post by Hanger 13, the principal minds behind the series reflect on its creation and history while also teasing what’s next.
Longtime Mafia designers Roman Hladík (general manager), Tomáš Hřebíček (head of production/media director), and Alex Cox (game director) sat down to discuss Mafia’s entire history and their most cherished memories of the franchise. It’s worth a read if you consider yourself a diehard fan (check it out here), but the most exciting news from the conversation is the confirmation that the next game in the series is in development.
Hřebíček writes: 
“A few years away” is a long time to wait, especially since the last mainline entry, Mafia III, is approaching six years old, launching in October 2016. But we're happy to see the series continue and are curious to see where it heads next. In 2020, Hanger 13 released enhanced remasters of all three games, the most substantial being a complete remake of the original dubbed Mafia: Definitive Edition.

        <updated>2022-08-29T13:06:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has reportedly canceled its Resident Evil series after just one season. 
This news comes from a report from Deadline, which reports that Netflix has decided not to move forward with a second season of the show following the release of Season 1 last month. As far as why, there’s no official reason as of yet but considering Netflix’s past, it’s likely that Resident Evil didn’t meet expectations in terms of both critical and audience response. The show will now join many other shows canceled after just one season at the streamer including Cowboy Bebop, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, and more.
Deadline notes that Resident Evil’s release came right after the highly anticipated Season 4 of Stranger Things, which might have led to its less-than-stellar first weekend on the service. However, the series still debuted in the number two spot, behind Stranger Things, pulling in 72.7 million watch hours. Deadline reports that viewers watched Resident Evil for 73.3 million hours in its second week, taking the number three spot on Netflix, before dropping out of Netflix’s Top 10 by week three. 
This isn’t Netflix’s first foray into the world of Resident Evil, though. Its 2021 movie, Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, holds that title, but that anime series wasn’t well-received either. For more about the series, check out this retrospective video that looks back at 25 years of Resident Evil.

There’s something about the memory of that taste that is amazing, even if you know the sophistication of your palette has evolved a lot in the intervening years. That’s a bit how I feel about the early Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games. I can recall with crystal clarity being gathered around a TMNT arcade cabinet with my friends, pumping in tokens to try and beat Shredder before the birthday party ended. Or spending a weekend banging my head against the wall of the first NES game and its absurd sewer challenges. The Cowabunga Collection exists to service the nostalgic recollection of these types of experiences, and it does so with aplomb. Are these truly great games worth …]]></summary>

You’ve likely heard of Lies Of P after it took the internet by storm after Gamescom Opening Night Live. If you haven’t, I’ll quickly catch you up to speed: it’s a Pinocchio-themed Soulsborne.
You play as the iconic marionette fighting to become human in a fictional French city inspired by the historic Belle Époque era – a time of abundant affluence for the country. Familiar characters like Geppetto, Pinnochio’s creator and father figure, and Gemini Cricket help familiarize the story, but Lies Of P promises intriguing twists through a dark reimagining.

Endless Dungeon, the successor to 2014’s Dungeon of The Endless, is a tower defense twin-stick shooter created by French developer Amplitude Studios; and after my hands-on session at Gamescom 2022, it has the potential to be the next big roguelite. 
Interestingly, this upcoming roguelite is more a reimagining than a sequel. Instead of the point-and-click navigation and automated combat featured in the first game, players now directly control characters and weapons in real-time. Endless Dungeon reimagines its predecessor’s pixel art dungeons into larger, gorgeously-lit 3D spaces. Also, up t…]]></summary>

Nero reprises his starring role, but he's joined by Dante and mysterious newcomer V. The three demon slayers, alongside familiar allies, unite to combat a powerful demon lord.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Drinkbox Studios’ Nobody Saves The World is getting a shot in the arm via a new expansion arriving next month. Dubbed Frozen Heath, this update adds new forms, challenges, and a fresh region to explore.
Frozen Hearth takes place in an underground region that hosts The Tempering, a series of trials consisting of combat challenges and puzzles. Overcoming this contest rewards two new forms: the Killer Bee and the Mechanic, which can be used in the main game. 


On September 13 you can buy the Frozen Hearth expansion separately for $4.99 or pick up it alongside the main game in a bundle for $27.99.  
Nobody Saved the World launched in January and became one of our early favorites of 2022. Former editor John Carson scored the game an 8.25 out of 10, writing in his review that, 
“Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish as I leveled my way through form ranks for the next body or ability to work with. It's most fun when unleashing devious yet approachable combat scenarios, keeping me on my toes to find the best solution to survive. Thankfully, it gave me plenty of those unrelenting loops throughout, justifying the time to save this funny little world.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Ninja’s dark fantasy action title Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty impresses in a new gameplay trailer that captures the fast-paced thrills you'd expect from the minds behind Nioh and Ninja Gaiden. 
Fans of the studio's previous action titles should find plenty to love with Wo Long if this video is any indication. Set during the Three Kingdoms era of China, you'll battle invading demons as a soldier using a blend of graceful swordplay and Chinese martial arts based on the Five Phases philosophy. The trailer shows off the many demonic foes awaiting your blade, including a bipedal tiger that is swiftly kicked out of the way by the protagonist. 


Next month, those attending Tokyo Game Show will be the first to play Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty via a show floor demo. Everyone else will have to wait until early 2023 to experience the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Sony Interactive Entertainment announced it will increase the price of PlayStation 5 consoles in various non-U.S. territories due to global economic conditions such as inflation. Microsoft then declared later that day that it will not be doing the same with the Xbox Series X/S. Now, Nintendo has chimed in on the matter. 
In a statement to Eurogamer, Nintendo reiterates a quote from president Shuntaro Furukawa, made in June, in which he stated the company has "no plans to increase the trade price of its hardware.” Furukawa made this statement during the 82nd Annual General Meeting Shareholders that month, in which he also said: 
"While we cannot comment on pricing strategies, we currently do not have any plans to change the price of our hardware due to inflation or increased procurement costs in each country. We will determine our future pricing strategies through careful and continued deliberations.”
Although the PlayStation 5's price will remain unchanged in the U.S. (for now), both versions of the console have become more expensive in Canada, Europe, the UK, Mexico, Japan, and Australia. The price hikes have already gone into effect in those regions except Japan, which occurs on September 15. 
The only time Nintendo significantly adjusted the price of its current consoles was last fall, when it permanently reduced the cost of the standard Switch model in the UK and Europe. Nintendo has yet to do the same in the U.S.

Join us at 5:00 P.M. Central Time (6:00 P.M. ET/3:00 P.M. PT) to watch the build. We likely won't get through the whole thing today, but we'll be live for at least a couple of hours. 
And as you might've guessed from the picture above, we have a lot more Gunpla kits to get through. Bandai was nice enough to send us a few, and we'll absolutely be live streaming lots of fun hobby-adjacent activities over the next few weeks.
 Again, we're going live on our Twitch channel at 5:00 P.M. Central Time (6:00 P.M. ET/3:00 P.M. PT). Hope to see you there!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atomic Heart reemerged during Gamescom with a new trailer devoted solely to showing off its impressive, Bioshock-esque combat. Over three minutes of gameplay footage shows off the carnage you'll unleash against adversaries, both artificial and organic. 
Players wield melee weapons or firearms in one hand and more, shall we say, unconventional abilities in the other. That includes electrifying targets with lightning bolts, tossing them around with a telekinesis-like power, freezing foes solid with an ice blast, or using wires to hijack machines. The action-packed video shows off how players can creatively combine their arsenal to dismantle and disembowel anything standing in their way. 


Atomic Heart was first announced in 2018 and takes place in an alternative futuristic version of the Soviet Union in 1955. Robotic technology flourished post World War 2, allowing humanity to create a high-tech utopia. Unfortunately, these mechanical helpers have started rebelling against their human creators. If that wasn’t enough, killer mutants born from secret experiments have also run amok. Players control private agent P-3, who embarks on a secret mission to get to the bottom of what’s caused this seemingly perfect society to collapse and clean up this mess. 
Atomic Heart launches this fall for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It’s also launching on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

A video game sequel is hard to create, especially if the previous game was a commercial success. Why did the game resonate with fans? How many new features does the sequel need to justify another price tag? Should anything be changed at all? How do you make something fresh while retaining the identity established in the first release?
These are the questions developers constantly ask themselves while making a game. The road to publishing a project is full of pitfalls, and it’s easy to lose the path.

In other years, that means fine-tuning some lesser areas of an already solid team. NHL 22 was a good-looking game, but the gameplay felt long in the tooth and in need of changes. While NHL 23 doesn’t rebuild the gameplay from the ground up, it does offer several features, tweaks, and enhancements in hopes of being better than the last iteration.
NHL 23 represents the series’ second entry using EA’s Frostbite engine. As such, various refinements come online as the development team further familiarizes itself with the proprietary engine.

Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn't find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
