        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Outcast was a PC-exclusive, 3D open-world action game that predated Grand Theft Auto III by two years. It was an innovative, well-regarded, but underplayed game about landing on an alien planet and trying to survive in the face of its dangerous fauna. A remake of that game, called Outcast: Second Contact, was released in 2017, but Outcast: A New Beginning is the long overdue, proper sequel to the cult classic.
Join Marcus Stewart and me as we check out what the game has to offer, which is primarily impressive jetpack mechanics that let you literally fly around the alien world at high speeds. Outcast: A New Beginning is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 15.

That should be less of an issue in future. One of those community-hosted servers, Homecoming, has been granted an official license to operate by City Of Heroes' IP owners NCSoft.

One of the first major releases this year is Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, the first brand-new console game in the series since 2010's The Forgotten Sands (yes, really!). And recently, developer Ubisoft has unveiled the upcoming release's frame rate, resolution and accessibility options on Switch.
And it's good news for Switch owners for this upcoming Metroidvania-style take on the legendary franchise. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown will run at 60fps on the Switch, both handheld and docked. This was stated by The Game Awards' host Geoff Keighley way back in the summer of 2023, but it's good to get the official word. Handheld, the resolution will be at 720p while docked it'll be 1080p — standard stuff, then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has released a promotional video highlighting some of the biggest games coming to its console this year. The video hypes both first and third-party releases, many of which already had release dates/windows, but it also casually confirms 2024 launches for two previously un-dated projects.
Specifically, the video labels Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill 2 as 2024 games. Both games, each a remake of their respective titles, had no launch window prior to today. But the video and the accompanying PlayStation Blog post confirm as much, which is a little surprising to see happen with relatively limited fanfare instead of Konami rolling out individual red carpets for each game's launch update. But if you're looking forward to playing either title, this is welcomed news nonetheless.


Silent Hill 2 was announced in 2022 as a remake of the 2001 classic and is being developed by Bloober Team. The studio recently shared that work on the game was “progressing smoothly”, and it is a PlayStation 5 console exclusive (but will also launch on PC). 
Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a Unreal Engine 5 remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. It was announced during a PlayStation Showcase last May, and Konami released its first in-engine gameplay footage last October. Despite its inclusion in today’s PlayStation video, Snake Eater is also coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC.]]></summary>

Apex Legends is the latest live service game to take the plunge with its first crossover event. It's with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and it'll bring the Buster Sword, Aerith, and other elements from the JRPG to the battle royale on January 9th.

This was an extremely secretive thing a few years ago, but eventually it became more widely available as City of Heroes: Homecoming. The team behind it went as far as providing content updates to the game, integrating previously paid content into the base game for free and expanding the classes and abilities within the game.

For anybody who plays video games on a regular basis, it's long been a joke that when the mainstream media discusses gaming in any capacity, they'll inevitably bring up how games are surprisingly popular, how it's not just socially-challenged dweebs in their bedrooms anymore, and how video games are big business. Did you know that the gaming industry is bigger than Hollywood? Yes, Steve. Everyone knows that.
Despite this, the mainstream stereotype is largely still that gamers are socially-challenged dweebs who need to get out more. You'd think that people would know better by now — and in some cases, it's difficult to imagine how they don't know better — but here we are; still being told to take a shower, leave the house, touch grass, and expand our horizons beyond a high score and a flagpole.

Feast your eyes on the officially licensed Series S toaster, which is on sale now at Walmart. The novelty appliance boasts a wide slot to toast thick slices of bread, bagels, waffles, English muffins, and probably most PlayStation discs for the truly devoted. In a neat twist, the oven roasts the Xbox logo on the food itself to add a flavorful touch of corporate branding to your carb intake. 

The toaster also sports a digital LED countdown timer, a six-setting shade selector dial for browning customization, a removable crumb tray, automatic temperature control, and a cool-touch exterior, among other perks. Though a cool appliance, I can’t help but wonder how many people will request a Series S as a gift from friends/family and receive this elaborately disguised kitchen accessory instead.

Katharine says it's decent, however, and the latest trailers are intriguing. One is an overview of the new metroidvania's locations, of which you can read much more in Katharine's last preview. The other is a quick dive into the game's approach to accessibility, which appears to be a lot more holistic than you'll find in many games.

Only appearing for a limited time, snowballs have an entire series of upgrades dedicated to them as part of the Dawning progression system, as they allow players to take down enemies and apply crowd control via Stasis effects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The developer of 2021’s Buck Up and Drive, Fábio Fontes, has been showing off his work on the upcoming sequel. While it’s still early in development, things look to be progressing well on the title.


If you’re unfamiliar, Buck Up and Drive, it’s similar to Out Run if it was taken to its furthest extremes. You not only race against time, but you also flip the hell out, performing absurd stunts that look like your car got stuck in the level geometry, and the physics don't know how to cope. There’s also drifting and rail-grinding, the normal sort of thing you’d expect from a racing game. It was part of my list of 2021 games you might have missed, which is what I did before just making the usual top 10 list every year.




Buck Up and Drive 2 looks to be expanding on that. I’m not sure how that’s possible, but Fábio Fontes obviously has the answer: driving on walls. Do you remember the Spider-Mobile from the 1970’s Spider-Man comics? It’s a lot like that but less dumb. Also shown off is character customization. I’m not sure why, but I’ll take it.


Buck Up and Drive 2 is built in the Godot Engine, probably because Fontes had a falling out with the GameMaker Engine following their move to a subscription model. Thankfully, the billboards have returned for the sequel. Some players complained about the original game’s common use of pride flags as billboards, so in response, Fontes added a “Pride Flag Billboard Toggle.” When toggled, it simply adds more pride flags. Respect.


Buck Up and Drive 2 is coming to PC. There is no stated release window, as it is still early in development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[QUByte Interactive has announced that their upcoming collection of the Top Racer series has been pushed back from its January 11 release date, to the new target of March 7. In the meantime, a demo that includes three tracks will be available on Steam starting January 11.




I knew these games as Top Gear. It was hard not to look at it as a kid since the cover features a car (possibly) driving away from an explosion. It was similar to Race Drivin’ in terms of its eye-catching cover, but unlike Race Drivin’, Top Gear is actually a decent series.


Created by Gremlin Games Studios, the series started out on 16-bit consoles as racing games that use a raster effect to depict a 3D-like road. It distinguishes itself from games like Out Run by having tracks that actually circle back on themselves, which was uncommon for the particular sub-genre. It also had more of a tournament racing feel with pitstops and ongoing rankings. It also had split-screen multi-player, kind of like Outrunners on Genesis, but not as terrible.


Though Top Gear 2 was ported to other platforms, the series stayed faithful to Nintendo platforms for a long time. After three games on the SNES, the series shifted to N64, with Boss Studios and Midway handling Top Gear Rally.


Top Racer Collection assembles Top Racer (Gear), Top Racer 2, and Top Racer 3000 into one package. On top of that, they’re including Top Racer Crossroads, which is a new title that features four new cars, including one that is plainly the Ferrari Testarossa featured in Out Run. I can dig it.


Top Racer Collection launches March 7, 2024 for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those who want to engage in more adult-orientated streaming, it seems like Twitch is not the best place for it. However, the Amazon-owned platform clearly has to deal with it, and a new policy update aims to clamp down on broadcasters casting their broads, so to speak.




Over on the Twitch website, the company says that, as of yesterday, it'll be cracking down on any 'implied nudity.' As the post itself says:



This update is in response to a recent meta on Twitch in which streamers use black censor bars or other items to block their bodies or clothing, or position the camera frame such that the viewer is led to believe that the streamer is fully or partially nude.




As of January 3, streamers will be required to make sure there is no suggestion that they may be hiding obvious nudity. The update specifies that, where required, "coverage must be fully opaque," adding that "sheer or partially see-through clothing does not constitute coverage."


Adults only...kind of


Given that Twitch is largely a place where people go to watch content creators play games or engage in creative activities, it stands to reason that sexual or adult content would not be encouraged.


However, the site recently updated another policy, which introduced a new label for streams classed as having "sexual content." This means content such as "erotic dances" and "fictionalized" nudity are allowed, providing they are correctly labeled. Full nudity...still a massive no-no, however. Also, streams of this nature are not present on the homepage.


As for the update to the attire policy, Twitch has made it clear that it does not want streamers to be presenting themselves with "implied nudity." The post states that such content will have its label changed to a more appropriate one, while repeat offenses will "lead to an enforcement action."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yuzo Koshiro and Ancient Corp have stated via Twitter that their modern Genesis/Mega Drive game, Earthion is aiming for release this summer at the earliest. The composer has also announced that plans to bring it to modern consoles are underway.




Earthion is a scrolling shoot-’em-up in development for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. While that is not entirely unique in these days of homebrew development, what makes Earthion special is that it’s being helmed by Yuzo Koshiro, the legendary composer behind games such as Streets of Rage and Revenge of Shinobi. While he did compositions for SNES games like Actraiser, Robotrek, and Super Adventure Island, he’s perhaps best known for his Genesis contributions. His company, Ancient Corp, beyond collaborating with other developers, also created Beyond Oasis for the console.


The company has been tinkering with Earthion as far back as 2022, with its big reveal happening at Tokyo Game Show 2023. There, Ancient demonstrated the game’s tremendous bosses and fancy scaling effects.


While Koshiro has moved on to composing for modern platforms with games such as the Etrian Odyssey series, he hasn’t lost his appreciation for old hardware. For Ancient’s recent game, Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness, there’s a suite of DLC available that changes the soundtrack to versions arranged for various consoles. This includes not only PC-88 and Mega Drive platforms but even less common consoles such as the Wonderswan. It feels very fitting that his company would eventually go back and create and new game for an old console.


Earthion is aiming for a Summer 2024 release (at the earliest) on Genesis/Mega Drive. Modern console versions are planned, but none have been confirmed. Physical distribution in the West will be handled by Limited Run Games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originally launched in 2014, the mobile app Kim Kardashian: Hollywood is shutting down. 


Players logging in will be met with a message informing them that the game no longer accepts in-app purchases and has been removed from mobile stores. In-game currency will be usable until April 2024, at which point the game will become inaccessible. 


In a statement to TMZ, Kim stated that she realized that "it’s time to focus that energy into other passions" though she does give thanks to "the Glu team and the many people behind the scenes who have worked diligently on making it a success." 


Glu has plenty to be grateful for too, as in Q3 2014, the game generated 54% of its revenue, according to Games Industry. As Forbes reports, by 2016, the mobile title had been downloaded 45 million times and generated $160 million in revenue. 


Although highly successful, it doesn't leave the mobile gaming industry with a dearth of titles. Plenty of companies have recognized the profit potential and want a slice of it, including Xbox.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft hasn't been afraid to have fun with its consoles and feature them as various appliances, including a fridge. One of the latest Xbox redesigns comes in the form of a Series S toaster that you can pick up at Walmart. 


We got our first glimpses last year when a French Twitter account posted images of the toaster along with its specs. It's now finally available for purchase, and it does everything you would want from a two-slice toaster, including a six-setting shade selector dial to get your toast just right. 


With a wide slot, it can sort out your artisan loaf bread slices, "bagels, frozen waffles, Texas toast, or English muffins." It also has an anti-jam function and as an attractive bonus, it also can imprint the Xbox sphere logo on your bread. To keep things from getting messy, you'll also get a removable crumb tray and non-stick-coated plates. 


Some high-tech features include a digital LED countdown timer as well as the ability to keep a list of the different preferred settings of household members. At $39.99, it's not out of reach for the sufficiently motivated Xbox fan. 


To complete the Xboxification of your life, throw in the Xbox Mastercard as well as the Wonka-inspired console and controller.

A grizzled mafioso whose cheeks glitter with fragments of other people's teeth has as much chance of winning Russian Roulette as a sleepy five-year-old in SpongeBob pyjamas. But take Russian Roulette, swap the revolver for a pump-action shotgun, mix up live and dud rounds, and add Inscryption-esque items which let you change the rules, and now you have a more skillful game. That's Buckshot Roulette, the latest from Mike Klubnika, the dev behind those excellent horror games about operating machinery. Great weird machines here too.

The good news is that everyone seems to be taking a bit of a breather in 2024, because (at time of writing at least) the official "big'uns" calendar is looking remarkably slim at the moment. There are still some heavy-hitters coming our way this year, such as , Star Wars Outlaws and Path Of Exile 2, but 2024 looks like another year where it will be the smaller, independent games that shine the brightest. They certainly make up the bulk of our most anticipated games list for 2024, which the RPS Treehouse has been feverishly putting together over the last few days. The bad news is that there are still loads of great games coming out. So come, join us, and see what's on our personal wishlists for 2024.

The lens shifted away from longtime series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu to newcomer Kasuga Ichiban, swapping out its real-time action for turn-based RPG combat in the process. It was, by most accounts, a rousing success. But there was still room to grow.


Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, then, seems like even more like a passing of the torch than its predecessor. And it was this shared custody of the spotlight that made me a bit nervous, going into a preview session way back in October. How would the focus manage both Kiryu and Ichiban? Why, after seeing one character hand the reins to the next, did we need to retread that ground?

Many people have fond memories of managing a rising business or running a cabaret club in previous entries. But Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is going somewhere new with Dondoko Island.


In the upcoming Infinite Wealth, Ichiban can wash up on a run-down version of Dondoko Island. And, with the help of some locals, he can start to rebuild it too. Whether picking up trash, farming resources, or placing down new decorations, the island can go from deserted to a real tourist attraction.

It went from being the most anticipated game of this generation to boring the pants off players to winning a Steam Award (though some are curious as to how that came to be). In any case, it hasn't quite gone away yet, and the modding community is still engaging with it.


One such example comes from user Korodic, who's attempting to put something into Starfield that Bethesda never did. It's mechs. I'm talking about being able to control giant mechs. To be honest, the title of this article sort of gave it away.




The above video shows the current work-in-progress, in which the player can pilot one of these huge machines, rather than them being stationary models, as the developer intended. At the moment, there doesn't seem to be any release date for the mod, but it's worth keeping an eye on if you are still playing the game.


So much potential seemingly wasted


I can't in all good conscience say that Starfield is a bad game. It's just not what people were hoping for. More fool us, perhaps? But the fact that it currently has a "Mostly Negative" score on Steam shows just how far it's fallen since it was released last September.


Of course, the story's not over yet. Bethesda has plans to bring some new elements to Skyrim-in-space. An end-of-year update on the official website suggests 2024 will be Starfield's year.


With updates inbound "roughly every six weeks" starting next month and some intriguing implementations being teased, Todd Howard seems determined to make sure you enjoy the game he's been dying to make for two and a half decades. Come hell or high water.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've never tried a Skyrim mod before – either on PC or console – you are truly missing out. The vanilla release just doesn't seem to cut it these days for a lot of fans, so the modding community has dedicated itself to making TES5 as brilliant, everlasting, and immersive as all get out.


With that in mind, Nexus Mods user JaySerpa is back once more with further Skyrim improvements. This time, they've made it so NPCs react to being attacked by one of their friends. The video below shows it in action.




Essentially, when you use a Frenzy spell – which temporarily turns enemies against each other – there's no vocal reaction to what's happening. This mod, however, uses spliced and vanilla dialogue from the game to make NPCs actually care an ally has turned against them. You can download it here (as the creator says, it's a measly 7MB, so you may as well).


"No! We've been betrayed!"


Some of you who are very familiar with the Skyrim modding scene will likely know JaySerpa's work. Fresh off their recent Christmas mod, this latest effort is yet another way of injecting that extra bit of immersion into the aging RPG.


It's also one of the reasons TES5 is still going strong after all these years. It's highly unlikely the game would enjoy such longevity without the community tweaking the base release, keeping things fresh for who knows how long.


Whether The Elder Scrolls 6 will get the same modding treatment remains to be seen, but let's not get ahead of ourselves just yet. Bethesda still hasn't given us an update on its whereabouts or development stage.

The Trails / Kiseki series might be one of the biggest RPG franchises around right now — at least, in terms of size and scope.
This storied JRPG saga takes place on the continent of Zemuria and follows different interlinking arcs, characters, and stories. Everything is carefully interconnected, with events affecting other storylines and characters frequently reappearing in future games. And with a staggering 12 mainline games to follow — with a 13th coming out in Japan later this year — its reputation is nothing short of prolific.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The controversial The Coffin of Andy and Leyley has attracted a lot of attention thanks to its story which is both disturbing and steeped in dark humor. It is being released in chapters, with the first two out already. A recent progress report on Steam lets fans know what's happening with the game's development. 


For the sake of communication, the plan is to have a progress report out on the first week of each month. Following the release of patch 2.0.9, work still needs to be done on the technical side, including a pending audio playback fix. It was postponed because it "needs more stress testing," so it may arrive in the next patch instead. 


There is a pair of quality-of-life features being evaluated. The first concerns better saved game labels, and the other is a chapter select menu. No confirmation is given on when you can expect these improvements to be released because they need "to be very thoroughly tested to avoid breaking game data as much as possible.


The update also addresses questions some have had concerning the different possible episode 2 endings. Kit9 explains that neither are signs of a "good" or "bad" ending trajectory. Instead, "Decay and Burial will be two entirely unique story branches. Each will have a variety of outcomes of their own."

The Coffin of Andy and Leyley Patch 2.0.9


The 2.0.9 patch is a very minor one, and the notes only include the following: 



Fixed typos.


Disabled file drag and drop to window.


Made double tile doorways function better.


Fixed a missing wall segment in demon puzzle area.



An official release date for episode 3 has yet to be announced, though it has been stated that it is coming in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was 13 years old, I struggled to beat Cynthia, the Pokémon League champion in Pokémon Platinum. U.S.-based 13-year-old Willis Gibson just beat an unbeatable Tetris game that players have been attempting to complete since its release on the NES in 1989. 
On January 1, Gibson reached level 157 of Tetris, a feat previously thought impossible. New techniques, like the "hypertapping" one discovered in 2010 by Thor Aackerlund (thanks, BBC), and "rolling," discovered in 2021 according to IGN, allowed players to reach never before seen levels. Before that, getting past the thirties was all but impossible and now, Gibson has made it to level 157. As you can see in the video below, upon reaching that level, Tetris serves Gibson a kill screen – meaning it has crashed – ending his impossible run. 


It took Gibson, who goes by Blue Scuti on YouTube, 38 minutes to reach this new kill screen. BBC reports that Gibson has been playing Tetris for about two years, or since he was 11. Alongside his achievement of reaching level 157, Gibson also obtained the new highest score for Tetris. 
IGN writes that players can theoretically make it to level 255, and players are already trying; they just have to get lucky and avoid the crash points from level 157 onward. Upon beating level 255, players are brought back to the first level. 
For more, be sure to watch Gibson beat the record here, and then read about these Game Informer editors who beat six gaming world records.

Christ, Philip, get your head out of the gutter for once, this is a family website. I was previously a snob about the Nancy Drew point and click puzzle games, and then came to regret it when a fan of them (very nicely) emailed me explaining they're actually really good. We're going to find out for ourselves by playing them. There are north of 30 in total, and I will update the rankings at the end of each article.
The first is 1998's Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill, in which Nancy solves the murder of a Floridian highschooler named Jake Roberts, and there's a lot to love about it right away. There's a restrained cast, three locations in total, and the school sports team is called the Fighting Manatees. Thus the icon for the game is a lil' cartoon manatee - and to be absolutely accurate, this is the remastered version of the game from 2010, not the original 90s version. I'm as disappointed as you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Appearing in the wake of the Z-Library shutdown late 2022, shadow library 'Anna's Archive' now bills itself as the "largest truly open library in human history." A complaint filed in December 2023 by the Italian Publishers Association, which represents publishers of books, scientific journals, and digital content, paints a somewhat different picture. As a result, telecoms regulator AGCOM has issued immediate blocking instructions to ISPs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dave the Diver was one of 2023's unexpected hits that accumulated plenty of awards in addition to a wave of fan support. On Twitter, Mintrocket announced that the game has sold 3 million copies globally.


This is certainly an achievement to be proud of, but it is far from the only thing the studio has to celebrate. Dave the Diver recently won the Sit Back and Relax award at The Steam Awards, and found itself nominated at both The Golden Joystick Awards and The Game Awards 2023. Our own Christine Choi gave the game a 9/10, praising its ability to "offer a lighthearted story and engaging gameplay." 




Despite the accolades, the game has attracted some controversy due to frequently being labeled an indie title, including at The Game Awards. Although Mintrocket is a smaller studio, it falls under the billion-dollar corporation Nexon, which brings the game's indie status into question. This raises debates over what qualifies as indie, and whether the category has become more a matter of aesthetics.


There are further content updates in store for Dave the Diver, as developers believe the characters still have more stories to tell. Planned content includes further side missions added to the latter half of the story.

One title, Close to the Sun, is out now for Game Pass owners. The rest will be spread out through the rest of January. Close to the Sun is a first-person adventure game from 2019 that has a bit of a Bioshock feel to it. It earned a 75 on Metacritic upon release, with critics coming away impressed for the most part with its atmosphere and story. 




Following that is Hell Let Loose, which arrives January 4. It's a World War 2 shooter that touts 50 v. 50 battles on large-scale maps. It's a game that demands teamwork, but with a Metascore of 84, it's said to be pretty fun for those who take the time to learn the ro…]]></summary>

Major films that were expected last year, like Dune: Part 2, got pushed back to 2024 instead. Which means that this year, the film calendar is actually pretty packed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kinetic Games is greeting the New Year with an updated roadmap for Phasmophobia. 


This Roadmap is a little unusual in the sense that it only features milestones but lacks any release windows. The announcement shows the planned feature updates through to the 1.0 release from early access, but doesn’t really give any idea as to what the timeline is. This isn’t even a 2024 roadmap. It’s for 2024 and beyond.

Nonetheless, it gives you an idea of what needs to be done before the developer considers it complete enough to call it done. This includes lighting updates in 0.9 (which arrives next week after the holiday event ends), new tasks in 0.10, new play models in 0.11, and further overhauls in the 1.0 release. Beyond this is also the console release, the Point Hope map, and other maps beyond that, which are planned for release as they’re done rather than being packed with major updates.


Beyond the roadmap, Kinetic Games’ announcement includes information about the Point Hope Lighthouse map, showing off the bathroom and the basement workshop. Also discussed is the changes happening to the two farmhouse maps. Previously, they were too similar (I couldn’t even tell you which is which), but they plan on giving both of them their own individual flourishes. Mainly, a number of rooms are being converted to having specific purposes. Grafton will also be made to look more rundown, while Bleasdale will be the opposite, being made more posh and ostentatious.


While a timeline for these updates isn’t given, we do know that 0.9 will be arriving next week. I can certainly understand why they wouldn’t want to make promises after development on the game was upended by an office fire last year. 


Phasmophobia is currently available on PC via Early Access. The Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PSVR2 versions have been delayed to an unspecified date.

Final Fantasy VII Remake gave fans of the original game quite a shock as Cloud and the party exited Midgar. Zack, the protagonist of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII and a key figure in Cloud, Aerith, and Sephiroth's past, appears to be alive, and helped an injured Cloud reach Midgar. This stands in stark contrast to his fate in the original continuity, where he was killed and his Buster Sword was handed over to Cloud. 
Zack's changed fate is emblematic of how the Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth teams approached the source material. "If we trace the original and stay exactly loyal to it a…]]></summary>

For all the brilliant aspects of retro games, the mod cons and performance we're used to now are pretty fantastic, too, and sometimes going back can be tough. Was this slowdown always here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long-time players of The Elder Scrolls series will need no introduction to Daggerfall, the second entry in Bethesda's fantasy franchise. However, if you have never played this absolute classic – albeit wholly retro-looking – RPG, now's the perfect time.


You see, the Daggerfall Unity project has finally released version 1.0 of this unofficial remake (thanks, PCGamesN), which you can download from GitHub. Intended as a more stable release of previous builds, this update represents the next stage of a recreation that's been ongoing for a few years.




Yes, some of you may scoff at the fact that this was made in the Unity engine. But you may take some comfort in knowing that it was made long before the debacle that saw the company's reputation take a nosedive.


Again, free to download


While The Elder Scrolls 2 is free to play through Steam, many would recommend the Unity version instead. It's a complete remake of the original 1996 release, done from the group up, but it doesn't lose its classic aesthetic and gameplay. It's simply been rebuilt in a different engine.


The visuals have been given a spit shine, but it still looks like a 90s DOS game. Add onto that Daggerfall Unity supporting mods, of which there are plenty to choose from, and it should make for a good time. 


While Skyrim is the one most people think of when it comes to TES, older gamers such as myself fondly recall some of the more dated installments. 


True, going back to their original iterations can be hard work on modern systems, but the Unity remake of Daggerfall is easily the definitive way to check out this legendary RPG. Especially now the full release is out. If you're at least interested, check out this rundown on changes and improvements in more detail.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Baldur's Gate 3 player has reportedly been banned for sharing their Xbox gameplay recording, as the footage automatically uploaded contained nude, in-game character models. 


Baldur's Gate 3 hasn't been out on the Xbox longer than a month, so this could be one of those BG3 oopsies, but it seems to come down to Xbox's own Terms of Service. Reddit user Daddy-Vegas claimed that one of his clips, fittingly named "naked camp time fun," landed him a ban lasting until the end of the year — yes, of the year that has just begun.




In an interview with DualShockers, Vegas explains that his clips were automatically shared to the Xbox public feed and that the ban occurred just a few seconds after the upload's completion. This left Vegas very little time to react to his malfeasance.


According to Vegas, he didn't intend to share the footage, but the console settings upload these by default  — you have to change the option yourself if you've got recordings that may violate ToS. The Xbox probably should not have that feature on by default or create a mature tag for this content, in case it finds it worthy of a ban. 


Naturally, players shouldn't have to worry about a ban over recordings of completely normal playthroughs of a game they'd acquired legally, but there's more. It's the old double standard of gore being fine, but looking at a naked body is a big no-no. 


And it gets even stranger


Vegas' post caused many other Xbox users to complain about similar penalties issued by Xbox, penalties that aren't even necessarily BG3 or nudity-related. Reddit user lmaoolivia talks about being banned on similar grounds when playing Attack On Titan, a game that doesn't even feature full-frontal nudity.




Destructoid has reached out to Microsoft and Larian Studios for comment, and will update this story should we hear back.

And just like when the film Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey took advantage of that whimsical character entering the public domain, someone has already started making a twisted, horrifying version of Mickey. In this case, it’s a video game.
It’s called Infestation: Origins, and it’s the debut title by Nightmare Forge Games. The game is an episodic four-player co-op survival adventure in which players control exterminators tasked with killing mutated vermin – and one of them happens to be a terrifying, person-sized monster modeled after Mickey.

With many of Nintendo's first-party lineup for the year consisting of remakes and remasters, it certainly feels like we're in the 'wind down' phase of the Switch, but that doesn't mean there aren't plenty of games worth highlighting.

Indeed, while the announcement did specify that Sony and Polyphony Digital would "end the distribution" of purchasable DLCs and online services for Gran Turismo Sport, the expectation was that the game would remain accessible in an always-offline form. This, however, hasn't been the case, as anyone who hadn't purchased Sport before January 31, 2024, at 06:00 UTC won't be able to purchase, download, or play the game at all in the future. The community isn't thrilled about this development.

Last year I complained about Puzzmo's crossword clues being very US-centric and Excors commented that US and UK puzzles seem very different, both in their form and in the fact that UK crosswords are often crytpic. Which is true! Often if you see a "quick crossword" in a UK paper that means "crossword with clues that are general knowledge questions and not an archaic set of riddles - you know, for if you're waiting for the kettle to boil, or are an idiot". So I decided to look into how you actually do cryptics. It's way harder than I thought, but at the same time I did not realise it's just smug puns.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whew! What a year it was. We saw The best Steam games of 2023 revealed – with some surprising results – countered by the tragic loss of a lot of studios and development teams. Above all, the last 12 months have shown the popularity of gaming is by no means dipping.


According to recent data from SteamDB, 14,533 games were released on the Steam platform in 2023. With the exception of 2018, we can see this number has been on the rise since the early 2000s. According to the graph, October was the busiest month, with 1,324 titles released on the platform.




Given what we can see – and providing the data is indeed accurate – we can expect this figure to rise even further throughout this new year.


Diamonds in the rough


Obviously, over 14,500 video game launches is a lot. But it's more than likely that many of these would have been obscure indie titles that perhaps didn't make much of an impact. But that's okay, the number alone shows that gaming – especially on PC – continues to be on the rise.


Actually, the indie scene did have quite an impact on the industry. The SteamDB chart shows that independent developers released a total of 6,408 games, which accounts for around 44% of all titles released last year. That and we got to see the enormous success of the likes of Lethal Company, which still holds a high position on Steam's Top Sellers (just behind Baldur's Gate 3, no less).


In short, 2023 saw a hell of a lot of video games being released on Steam. May it continue into 2024 and beyond.

Following that report, other outlets, like Variety, further confirmed that Black would be starring in Minecraft alongside previously announced cast members like Jason Momoa (Aquaman, Game of Thrones), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), and Emma Myers (Wednesday).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look, we're all excited about GTA 6. We'd been waiting for a reveal trailer for what felt like forever. The chance to revisit Vice City in the next installment of Rockstar's Goliath franchise is something many of us are looking forward to. But there is another project that's worth keeping an eye on.


As spotted by DSO Gaming, a studio called Revolution Team is currently remaking the original Vice City, hoping to succeed where the official remaster failed. The trailer below teases what's to be expected in what's being called the Nextgen Edition.




Going off the description on YouTube, the developer is taking the 2002 Grand Theft Auto game and importing it into Rockstar's RAGE engine. More specifically, it looks as though this remake will use the GTA IV version.


No AI upscaling here, it would seem


Revolution Team acknowledges the Definitive Edition, saying that this version of Vice City will be different, i.e. better.



The official remaster uses the Unreal Engine only for rendering, but the game’s physics engine is still RenderWare, released more than 20 years ago, with outdated mechanics and animations.




The project is expected to release sometime in 2025. Here's what else you can expect in the Nextgen Edition:



• Improved version of the city from Definitive Edition
• Improved weapons from Definitive Edition
• All cars from the Xbox version of the game
• Models of all characters and peds from the Xbox version of the game (with improved textures)
• All original radio stations
• Cut scenes from the original game
• Design in the style of the original game
• Neon on buildings from Vice City Stories
• Additional fixes and improvements from the Revolution Team

Excitement because I have never played Daggerfall and it is one of the weirder, more fantastical Elder Scrolls RPGs - the one with multiple endings which sequels have explained away as somehow all being canon thanks to a metaphysical event called a Dragon Break, whereby timelines branch and reconnect. And horror because I have never played Daggerfall, which is said to be 620,000 square miles in size, and I'm getting to that point in life where I seriously ask myself whether I can finish certain games before I perish.
Still the journey is more important than reaching the destination, right? Perhaps I can treat it like an occasional walking sim.

The studio announced this achievement on X today, alongside some new art from the game to celebrate the milestone. Selling 3 million units is no small feat, especially considering Dave the Diver is Mintrocket's first game. 
In Dave the Diver, players control Dave as he dives during the day to find treasure, fish, complete quests, and more. At night, Dave runs a sushi restaurant, and the game mixes its adventure gameplay with its simulation gameplay really well – read more about that in Game Informer's Dave the Diver review.

Dave the Diver received great word-of-mouth at the time of its PC release in June, bolstered further by a Switch release later in October. It also crossed over with indie hit Dredge last month. Shortly before that crossover, Dave the Diver picked up a nomination for Best Independent Game at The Game Awards 2023.

Developer Frogwares, known for its work on the Sherlock Holmes franchise, has become the sole publisher of its open-world investigative game The Sinking City after a lengthy legal dispute with Nacon (formerly Bigben Interactive).
In a post on social media, Frogwares stated that the latest version of the game will be published on the likes of Steam, Epic Games, GOG, and Gamesplanet in the coming weeks. As we mentioned a little while back, the Switch version of The Sinking City has been unaffected by the ongoing dispute since Frogwares originally published it instead of Nacon.

Publisher and developer Pichon Games has announced that the gorgeous but gory horror adventure The Bunny Graveyard will be making the jump (heheh) over to Switch at some point in 2024.
Originally released on Steam last September, the game sees you playing as a mouse cursor on a computer (yes, really) and setting out to help a bunny discover the truth behind its existence. Of course, this is a horror adventure, so we can expect a fair number of jumps and scares along the way — many of which can be seen in the above Steam launch trailer.

The first breakdown of physical sales in the UK for 2024 is here, with Hogwarts Legacy taking the top spot just ahead of Super Mario Bros. Wonder in the final week of 2023. According to GfK (thanks, GamesIndustry), the former is also the biggest boxed game of 2023, supplanting EA's footballing juggernaut for the first time in a decade.
You might remember that in our last UK Charts breakdown we mentioned Mario Wonder missed out on the Christmas number one. That's still technically true, but according to new GfK data, it was actually the highest-selling game on a single platform; EA Sports FC 24 beat it simply thanks to combined sales across multiple consoles. So, you could say Mario Wonder was Christmas number one and be correct... sort of.

        <updated>2024-01-02T22:38:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Earlier today, a Disney Parks blog pointed to Star Wars Outlaws releasing in late 2024, but the term "late" has now been removed from the post so that is now reads just 2024. Ubisoft also confirmed to Kotaku that, "the timing was incorrect and has since been amended." So, Star Wars Outlaws' release window has moved from late 2024 back to some general time this year.
Original story:
Star Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft's upcoming open-world Star Wars game, has enjoyed a vague 2024 release window since it was revealed at an Xbox Showcase last year. However, a recent post on Disney's official park blog has given the game a more specific window. According to the blog, Star Wars Outlaws is releasing late 2024. The blog post, which is a collection of 24 exciting Disney-things happening in 2024 reads, "And for Star Wars fans – Star Wars Outlaws, the open-world Star Wars game is set to release late this year."
Star Wars Outlaws follows an original Star Wars character named Kay Vess and seeks to explore a character archetype of the Star Wars universe we haven't spent much time with in video games: the Han Solo-inspired scoundrel. In the game, Vess (who has no Jedi abilities as far as we know) must survive by her wits and her ability to talk (or blast) her way through difficult situations.
For more on Star Wars Outlaws, you can read our interview with the game's narrative director, Navid Khavari, where we covered topics like whether or not the game will have an overlap with Shadows of the Empire and if the team has been communicating with Respawn regarding its Jedi series of games. The game is planned for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-01-02T22:12:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney dropped a blog post today teasing what the House of Mouse has in store for fans across the next 12 months. Among the things the company reaffirmed was that Star Wars Outlaws is indeed coming this year.


Oddly though, when the blog was initially published, it specifically stated "late 2024" as the release window for Outlaws. However, a few hours later, the post was updated to remove "late" and now simply lists 2024. 


A lot to explore in 2024. 


Nothing was really shared on the project other than a vague summation.  The blog simply teased that players will "explore distinct planets across the galaxy, both iconic and new." 


We were first introduced to the game when Ubisoft unveiled it during Xbox's 2023 Games Showcase. Set in the time period between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Star Wars Outlaws revolves around the underground world of the franchise. You play as an outlaw scoundrel by the name of Kay Vess as she attempts a massive heist alongside her companion, Nix. 


Developed by Massive Entertainment, the title features a variety of different forms of gameplay. While it's primarily a third-person action-adventure project, you'll also encounter stealth, vehicular combat, space combat, and more.


The "late 2024" designation may have been removed from Disney's blog, but it's still probably safe to assume that's the targeted window for Outlaws at this point. For whatever reason, Disney and Ubisoft must just not be ready to formally list the game's release date as such. Regardless, there's little doubt we'll be seeing much more of Star Wars Outlaws in the near future.

This brings to an end several years of uncertainty and litigation, which saw the Lovecraftian RPG delisted from Steam several times and at one point restored by its publisher via an allegedly pirated version of the game. 

The downside is that an updated version of the game is coming to all storefronts in the coming weeks and it won't be compatible with old save files.

This significant step forward affords an opportunity to look back on the studio’s young history, so we spoke with co-founder Vincent Yang to learn about how a small band of gamers in Taiwan formed one of the industry’s most promising – and, at one time, controversial – indie studios.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It would be easy to say that Final Fantasy XVI: Echoes of the Fallen is just more Final Fantasy XVI. See, it's so easy, I just said it right there. And that’s about 90% of what you need to know about this DLC.


Granted, I don’t think that’s a bad thing. I generally feel grated by DLC that’s kind of slapped haphazardly onto a game without a lot of thought, and that’s not the case with Echoes of the Fallen. Instead, Echoes of the Fallen functions as a neat bonus endgame quest that culminates in the game's closest equivalent to a superboss. I didn’t necessarily find Final Fantasy XVI lacking for content, but I really like how integrated into the game this DLC is. A totally new player wouldn't even know this was content added after the fact if the game didn't announce it!


That said, is Echo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an official blog post, Blizzard confirmed the next update for World of Warcraft: Dragonflight will drop on January 16. Titled Seeds of Renewal, the update brings a handful of new content to the popular MMORPG as well as concludes the current storyline campaign of the Dragon Isles.

Worldwide Dragonriding and Azerothian Archives and more


One of the most popular mechanics introduced in World of Warcraft: Dragonflight is Dragonriding. Currently, the feature is only accessible in the new expansion area, the Dragon Isles.  However, with the Seeds of Renewal update, Dragonriding is being expanded to be useable in all old-world continents where flying is available which includes most of Azeroth.


A new system is also being added called the Azerothian Archives. Players will have the chance to deliver into the history and lore of the Dragon Isles and explore an iconic time before the expansion over Weekly Public Events at the Traitor's Rest. Solo and Group activities will be available and reward players with Battle Pets, Mounts, and a Transmog set.


Fans of Worgens and Genn Greymane, the King of Gilneas, will be happy to see the King finally attempt to reclaim the kingdom of Gilneas in the Seeds of Renewal update. Gilneas has long been abandoned after being invaded by the Forsaken and then ripped asunder by the Cataclysm in the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm expansion. Players will have the opportunity to aid King Greymane in retaking Gilneas.


Finally, Follower Dungeons are being added in the Seeds of Renewal update as well. Players can enlist the help of NPC companions to clear through dungeons instead of doing so with other players. All eight Normal Dragonflight Dungeons will now automatically scale and fill between 1-4 AI players, with more dungeons to come in the future.


The World of Warcraft 10.2.5 Seeds of Renewal update is set to launch on January 16.

Focusing on technical rendering solutions as of late, Durante has now set his sights on a new kind of local multiplayer gaming.


More specifically, Durante's latest blog post, titled "A New Approach to Local Multiplayer / Splitscreen Perspective With Raytracing," goes in-depth on Thoman's idea of leveraging raytracing to develop a new kind of hotseat multiplayer screen-sharing experience. Historically, hotseat games have relied on one of several different types of split-screen implementations. A prominent example comes from racing games such as Gran Turismo, for one, where each player is allotted either one-half or one-quarter of the scr…]]></summary>

The 2008 Prince of Persia reboot didn’t reignite the series as Ubisoft had hoped, and 2010’s Forgotten Sands felt closer to a movie tie-in than a new, proper entry.
That game’s subtitle would end up being a portend of the future as the series seemed inexplicably lost to time. Though not completely ignored, thanks to the occasional cameo in other Ubisoft games and underplayed mobile releases, w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tim Cain wrote what is perhaps gaming’s most famous and influential monologue: the introduction to Fallout. “War never changes,” he says. “People loved it. I’m like, ‘I must be a writer.’” Yet much more recently, when Cain sat down to write his memoirs, nobody really liked what came out on the page. “I was really, really bad at it,” he says. “I had half a dozen people read it, and they all pretty much said that the stories were good, but my writing wasn’t.”


Cain’s writing strengths, as fellow Fallout originator Leonard Boyarsky has suggested, lie in shortform. Which was bad news for anyone who wanted to read the definitive account of his four decades at the heart of Interplay, Troika and Obsidian, three of the most important RPG studios of all time. Thankfully, though, it turns out Cain is a natural raconteur. The same anecdotes that appeared flat and toneless in his memoirs go down a storm on YouTube. There, for the past seven months, Cain has been delivering his stories straight to camera, as if at a dinner party with 73,500 other people. “When I started the channel, I would effectively just look at something in the book and be like, ‘I’ll tell that story today,’” he says. “Now I spend as much time answering questions and doing videos based on things people ask about.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consumer Softproducts’ follow-up to 2021’s shared fever dream, Cruelty Squad, is now listed on Steam. Psycho Patrol R is now available for wishlisting, though there is no announced release window.


I had noticed Consumer Softproducts tinkering around with a mech game since the release of Cruelty Squad, but with such things, sometimes an end result is never seen. However, it’s looking more likely with the official name and fancy store page.


Psycho Patrol R has you play as a federal police officer of the eponymous Psycho Patrol. You’re tasked with piloting a V-Stalker to solve “mental crime, among other things.” It bills itself as a “combination of high-intensity tactical FPS combat” and takes place in an open, non-linear world. You’re also able to customize the equipment on your stompy V-Stalker, which I think is an unwritten law in the world of mech games. It also appears that you will be spending some time outside of your robot womb and can engage in thrilling conversations about cryptocurrency with executives.


Right now, it looks like Psycho Patrol R will tone down the garish and nauseatingly surreal colors of Cruelty Squad, but the game’s graphics still scream jank-pop. I think I might have been disappointed if it didn’t.


I reviewed Cruelty Squad back in 2021. I called out its deliberately stilted gameplay, referring to it as “a purposeful desecration of the holy grounds of game design.” That was one of the first times I was quoted on Wikipedia, but the phrase was eventually expunged from the article to make room for more favorable acclamations. I meant it as a compliment. Cruelty Squad has been living in my brain ever since and is probably the source of trauma that has driven me into the arms of similar jank-pop titles.


Psycho Patrol R is currently set for release on PC, though no release window has been stated.

        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/square-enix-plans-to-expand-use-of-generative-ai-in-2024-according-to-company-president/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=square-enix-plans-to-expand-use-of-generative-ai-in-2024-according-to-company-president"/>
        <updated>2024-01-02T16:12:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a New Year’s letter, Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu plans to be “aggressive in applying” generative AI to their “content development and publishing functions” going forward.


Kiryu doesn’t really get specific about their intended uses for AI beyond that, merely spending a couple of paragraphs extolling the potential of the relatively new technology. He says, “I believe that generative AI has the potential not only to reshape what we create, but also to fundamentally change the processes by which we create, including programming.”


If you’re not familiar with Square Enix’s New Year’s messages, they have previously been undersigned by former president Yosuke Matsuda. They have, for the past couple of years, delved into the company’s intentions with Web 3.0, NFTs, blockchain, and the Metaverse. Square Enix even went as far as selling off Crystal Dynamics, Eidos-Montreal, and Square Enix Montreal to Embracer Group to help fund their investment in those technologies.


Considering this letter is meant to ring in the New Year after one that was rife with job losses and layoffs, it’s pretty bold to talk about AI. While the letter says nothing about an intention to replace employee processes with the technology, when the topic of the benefits of generative AI comes up, it usually involves the automation of roles. It’s tone-deaf to bring it up as a positive direction when the roles of artists and software engineers are often considered vulnerable to replacement by the technology.


So, in the spirit of that callousness, I feel it’s appropriate to bring up that a not-insignificant portion of executives have stated that their own jobs could be replaced by AI.


On the other hand, it can be perceived as amusing to hear Square Enix say this sort of thing – even bringing up text-based dialogue – when their previous experiments with such a thing went hilariously awry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy new year all. What's the weather like where you are? We've got Amber and Yellow warnings in London - I do not understand what these terms mean, but I'm going to add a Sapphire warning for escalating Maw activity. The creature was pretty lively over the Xmas weekend, but Graham managed to soothe it with posts about gaming-related new year resolutions and, of all things, the Spike Video Game Awards. We can expect the Maw's petulance to mount during January, a lean month for announcements and revelations, but there are a few tasty morsels in the offing - a new Prince of Persia and Tekken 8, for instance. Fingers crossed we can build up some kind of momentum.
Some new game releases we are pointing our telescopes at this week: Skeleton Rebellion (4th Jan), a scrappy offbeat RPG with claymation elements in which you are a skeleton trying to overthrow some mages, and The Night Is Grey (5th Jan), a point-and-click adventure about a beardy bloke and a little girl stuck in the woods with some weirdo wolves. If you like, you can also play a free drinking game I've just invented in which you do a shot for every time I accidentally write 2023 instead of 2024.

Final Fantasy VII is full of iconic scenes. Whether you're talking about the well-known sequences already depicted in Remake or the upcoming gut-punch at the Forgotten Capital, the Remake trilogy allows fans to experience these moments in their most fully realized forms. While this middle portion of Final Fantasy VII, which Rebirth depicts, focuses on Aerith and the looming specter of Sephiroth, so much of Rebirth's depiction emphasizes the deepening of relationships.
This is true with how the developers approached both the main story and side content in Rebirth, and it's sure to make it so …]]></summary>

At least, that’s what it feels like the game industry is increasingly saying I should do. A number of recently revealed titles have been slapped with 2025 release windows, so I can’t help but wonder how next year will shape up and, most importantly, what the awards seasons will look like.  
There are still hundreds of games yet to fill the 2025 release calendar, but let’s pretend they won’t exist. Let’s say 95% of the game industry collectively decided to take a year off. Making games is obscenely hard, and to avoid crunch, everyone decided to take some well-deserved (and well-compensated) R&R, so these seven titles are the only ones to launch in 2025.

Store shelves were crowded with poorly made games, and consumer interest waned substantially. Developers that ushered in the “golden age” of arcades and the first two generations of home consoles began to crash and burn at an alarming pace. In no time, the once billion-dollar industry was reduced to rubble.
In the summer of that same year, in Japan, gaming giant Nintendo released its first-ever home console with swappable cartridges. With its striking red and gold design, the Family Computer, better known as the Famicom, brought arcade hits like Donkey Kong and Mario Bros. into Japanese homes.
While the Famicom would go on to revitalize the North American gaming market as the VHS-inspired Nintendo Entertainme…]]></summary>

I have now read our so-called RPS 2023 Advent Calendar and found it to be woefully deficient in flirty rebels, lunar deities and stage coaches packed with damned adventurers. Never fear, however, because by happy coincidence I have also now written an end-of-year/start-of-year round-up article about these very things.

One deal that caught our eye this morning is this deal on a Gigabyte RTX 4070 Windforce 3X OC model, which is down to £530.58 when bought from Amazon US via Amazon UK. 
The deal price, which includes shipping and import duty, is significantly cheaper than UK-based options from major GPU makers which are in the £560 to £600 range. However, there are cheaper UK options if you're happy with a smaller, non-overclocked Palit card. Palit is more of a budget brand, but is built around the same Nvidia GPU and therefore offers the same performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyone's saying 2023 has been a stonking year for video games. To be honest dear reader, I don't think it's been my year. That might be because I've not had a huge amount of time to play loads outside of review duties and general life things, but there's only been, like, less than a handful of games that have truly commanded my attention.
One of said games comes backflipping in right at the tailend of this year: Astral Ascent. It's a 2D roguelike in the vein of Dead Cells, where you battle through stages, power-up, try and get as far as you can, inevitably die, reinvest your winnings, power-up permanently, then go again. It saddens me that I've not seen much excitement for the game elsewhere, so here I am with a little pudding for you. A little treat. Here comes the plane, nyaaaooownnn.

If all were just and right in the world, then it wouldn't have left out the following list of excellent games that came out this year! Plus a couple others that came out of early access in 2023 but which I sadly don't have time to write about in full. Trust me, The Last Spell and Against The Storm are both phenomenal games as well.
Anyway: in this handsomely decorated selection box, you'll find four of my honourable mentions for games I've enjoyed playing the most this year. If you have a hole in your Steam library, maybe these will help fill it over the Christmas break!

Probably something like 70% of my 2023 games time was spent on precisely two co-op shooters, neither of which I’ve written about much, nor were new enough to be eligible for the most recent Advent Calendar. I apparently have a type. I’m sorry.
Still, while the man’s rules prevent me from recommending Deep Rock Galactic or Darktide, I do have a few picks that fell short of full Advent Calendar glory. And they’re all... colourful, quite short indie platformers? Hmm, maybe I have two types.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And thus, we arrive at the end of another year. A year filled with some very excellent games, and some very not excellent games. And through it all, the RPS guides team has been quietly toiling away, appeasing The Beast That Is Google with medium-rare slabs of SEO meat, and providing the answers to oft-asked gaming questions.
It's important to me to have a moment in the year where we can step into the light for a little bit and celebrate everything the guides team has accomplished this year. Usually we stay well out of the spotlight, because people only like seeing guides if they're actively searching for it. But today, we're staging a coup. We're taking centre stage, and threatening the lighting technician with all manner of disagreeable bodily experiences unless they keep the spotlight fixed firmly on us for the duration of this post.
2023 has been an amazing standout year for guides. Let's take a look at the games that have defined the year for us, and celebrate some of the fantastic work our team has published.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the end of every year, gamers are faced with an undeniable fact: far too many video games are released in a 12-month span for anyone to reasonably play them all. It's literally my job to play video games and I bet someone could fill a reasonable top ten this year of titles I didn't even get time to touch. But even as it's a universal, undeniable truth, the revelation that you missed out on something popular is always met with the same incredulous statement.
“You've never played this?”
I understand the impulse. For instance, Baldur's Gate 3 took up so many hours of my 2023 that it's hard to fathom what the year would be like without it. This sentiment extends well beyond GOTY talks, though – some games are so fundamental to our taste or upbringing that it can be hard to process that peop…]]></summary>

It was a fantastic year for gamers at home with great tentpole releases from PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo, and some excellent indies, too. For years to come, we will all likely argue that 2023 was one of the best – if not the best – year for games. But it was also a terrible year for the people who make games, with more than 10,000 developers laid off, studios closed, and more. 
Between big video game releases, a heartbreaking amount of layoffs, record-breaking acquisitions and box office reports, and more, 2023 contained plenty of news stories that had us talking for weeks, speculating on the future of the industry, and reshaping how we view game development.

I didn't play quite as many small, odd things as I would have liked in 2023. I am very pleased with the shape of our Advent Calendar this year, though, especially the mid-table, which has some good weirdo entries and some surprises there.
So I thought I'd struggle to come up with three reminders for you for the Selection Box. And yet I didn't! They're also very on brand. Words and murder you say? Maybe in 2024 I should make a resolution to switch things up a bit. Gotta keep you guessing, dear readers...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve have put together their "Best Of 2023" lists on Steam. This is different from the Steam Awards, voting for which is ongoing, and instead is built from Steam data like revenue, peak concurrent players, and so on. It's interesting every year as older games or indie obscurities do better than you expect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than six years after the original Persona 5 arrived on U.S. store shelves, the RPG is still spitting out successors and spin-offs that capitalize on how beloved that title is to this day. The 2020 update, Persona 5 Royal, is the best-received successor, but both 2021 Musou hybrid Persona 5 Strikers and the recently released turn-based strategy RPG Persona 5 Tactica gave players plenty to love.
Among the reasons players love those games are the new additions to the cast. Each of those aforementioned titles gives the core Phantom Thieves new characters with whom to interact. Royal gave us Kasumi and Maruki, Strikers gave us Sophia and Zenkichi, and most recently, Tactica gave us Erina and Toshiro. With chemistry serving such an important role for the casts of these games, bringing in ne…]]></summary>

It's currently free to keep from the Epic Games Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's Game Awards ceremony garnered a lot of justified criticism for the way it rushed winning developers off stage in favour of adverts, rambling conversations with Hideo Kojima, and celebrity cameos from the likes of Timothée Chalamet. 

Obsidian's Josh Sawyer was right when he called it an "embarrassing indictment of a segment of the industry desperate for validation via star power". Yet I still can't help but also see the Game Awards as something else: a sign of progress. That's because I remember the Spike Video Game Awards from 2007, which remains the nadir of both the games industry specifically and popular culture in general.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cor, there's been a lot of games this year, haven't there? While I've only slapped one Bestest Best badge down in 2023 (woe is me), our lovely freelancers, current RPSers, and former RPSers have done a whole lot more badge-slapping. A grand total of 26 Bestest Bests have graced our monitors this year, which makes it three more than last year's Bestest Best round-up. And I'd say it's a nice mixture of big budget open worlders, puzzle gems, and indie delights that make up our roster for 2023, too.
So yeah, I'd encourage you to have a flick through the list below and see if there's anything you can add to the wishlist. Even as the person with "Reviews" in their job title, I can confirm I literally have loads of these Bestest Bests in my backlog. I will endeavour to play a handful over this Christmas break on my Steam Deck, maybe combining the experience with a nibble on a mince pie. Anyway, enjoy! And Merry Reviewsmas!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The quality of video game releases in 2023 has been discussed in detail by many, and it will absolutely go down as one of the best years the medium has experienced, strictly in terms of the excellent games that were released. The larger industry and its members will always look back on 2023 with justified frustration.
Patterns in any year are always a given. Trends inspire entire genres to be prevalent, and we also have events like 2009, where there were two high-profile open-world games about super-powered humans: Infamous and Prototype. This year will certainly be remembered for games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Baldur’s Gate 3, among others, but I can’t help but notice that RPGs citing a specific era of the genre were also, inexplicably, hugely popular.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2024 is right around the corner, and what better way to kick it off than to get some complimentary games from your PlayStation Plus subscription? As announced in the PS Blog, this month's selection of games is headlined by A Plague Tale: Requiem, Asobo Studio's 2022 tale of sickness and siblings. While he thought it dragged on a bit in the second half, our reviewer said, "Calling Requiem a standard sequel is a disservice; Asobo has created a Plague Tale epic." You can read that full review here and take a look at the other two offerings below.
The other two games are Evil West and Nobody Saves the World, each also released in 2022. Evil West is a third-person shooter set in a world that's a fusion between a classic Wild West and gothic horror and one that reminded one of our editors of his time as a kid playing Darkwatch. Meanwhile, Nobody Saves the World is about a shapeshifting Nobody (yeah, that's his name) on a quest to find the wizard who can stop a fungal infection from overtaking the world. Written by John Carson, the Game Informer review reads, "Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish."D All three games will be available to download on January 2.
And as always, as the new comes in, the old must go; subscribers will have until January 1 to download the current crop of PS Plus games, which includes Lego 2K Drive, Powerwash Simulator, and Sable.
Are you excited to check out any of January's PS Plus Games? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Prior to joining the RPS Treehouse in late October, I spent much of the year organising a massive international move with my family from the US to the UK, which meant that many of 2023's fresh releases - aside from the few that I've highlighted in this year's advent calendar - remained in the unplayed depths of my Steam list. Now that it's December and life has settled somewhat, I had to wrack my brain to come up with three entries for this Selection Box. After much deliberation, I realised that there were a few indie gems that I managed to crack open amidst all the chaos of arranging 60+ boxes for shipment across the Atlantic.

By the end of his journey through Silent Hill, everything will be chaos – his mind and even the world around him, a violent cacophony of anguish.
But in the beginning, it’s silent. The kind of quiet that’s deafening, where you hear your pulse in your ears, and every tiny sound becomes the worst thing you can imagine.
Includes spoilers for Silent Hill 2
The opening hour of Silent Hill 2 is – without question – the scariest thing I have ever played. Which, taken at face value, might seem a bit ridiculous. Your goal is simply to navigate James through a dilapidated apartment building. At most, you’ll face 10 enemies throughout the building’s three floors, but they hardly pose a threat; they’re easily avoided or killed. Gameplay primarily consists…]]></summary>

The categories are top sellers, best-selling new releases, most-played games on PC, most-played games on Steam Deck, highest-grossing early access games, most-played using a controller, and best-selling VR titles. The top 12 games in each category earn Platinum status, while everything below them is grouped into a descending ranking of Gold, Silver, and Bronze. It's a fun snapshot of the games Steam users dug into most this year and a reminder that games seemingly on the downtrend or long in the tooth (like, say, Destiny 2) clearly have a lot of players still logging in to play.

Back in 1997, Final Fantasy VII established Sephiroth as one of the most iconic antagonists in gaming history. In 2020, Final Fantasy VII Remake greatly expanded his role in the first act of the beloved RPG, and in 2024, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth hopes to give us even more context for the One-Winged Angel. We played a portion of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and spoke with several members of the development team to learn how Sephiroth is depicted in the upcoming second act of the Remake trilogy.

Sick of your family, sick of leftovers, wondering if the day after Boxing Day is still excuse enough to eat two dozen After Eights for dinner, your mind might start to slip towards the future. 2024! What all could you achieve with a whole twelve months stretched out before you? 

You could finally learn piano, you could re-commit yourself to bouldering, you could finally scratch out that novel. Or maybe you could just play a lot of video games. That's no less noble a pursuit. So what is your video game resolution for 2024?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has once again fallen to me to pick out my favourite features, this time from 2023. This is a terrible task, because there are always a lot I like. I've tried to cut it down a bit from last year, for both our sakes, dear reader, and decided that previews don't count (because as a format previews do a lot of the work for you, to be honest). Even reducing my task this way made it tough to whittle things down, and I'm sure I've missed some excellent articles and writers - and that I will be corrected in the comments!
Still, read on for a place to start if you want to look back at the year that was on RPS. We've got interviews, community nonsense, and even more interviews for you to enjoy here. I think in 2024 I'm going to advocate for more horseposting.

When you think of pirates, history mainstays like Blackbeard might come to mind alongside the fictional Jack Sparrow. An important but often forgotten name, however, is Cheng Shih. Not only is Cheng Shih one of history's most successful pirates, but she's also the woman who took over her late husband Zheng Yi Sao's pirate armada after his death, putting her in indirect control of 40,000-plus pirates for a nearly decade-long stint in Chinese waters in the early 19th Century. While Cheng Shih's story can be found on pages of books and elsewhere, Singer Studios aims to bring her story to life in VR.

It's Kuma's turn now, and the fighting bear is embearrassing challengers left and right.
Sporting a sweet headband and rugged gi, Kuma looks to be an unbearably challenging opponent. His furious paw swipes show he has no problem bearing arms, even against his perennial crush, Panda. In fact, she could bearly stand up to him! But don’t take my word for it. Bear witness to Kuma’s grizzly carnage by watching the trailer below.

Playing a giant timesink game all day hasn't appealed as I've sought to spend more time in forests and up hills and down rivers, and Destiny 2 burned me out so hard on live service games that I still can't face those. But a year of little games has been great fun, short bursts of play and ideas explored concisely, so here are some of my other favourites.

For over three years, Attila Kardos was one of the quality assurance testers at PlayStation Liverpool, one of the testing centers of Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe. During his tenure, he worked on first-party behemoths like God of War, Horizon: Zero Dawn, and Detroit: Become Human. But today, heʼs talking about a different type of testing involving a headset and physically mimicking movements for multiple hours at your office desk.
In games like Blood & Truth, where you take a starring role in action movie-esque setpieces, the fun factor of virtual reality quickly makes itself apparent. However, experiences like this can be taxing. A player can stop at any time. A tester doesnʼt have that…]]></summary>

The tuned-to-perfection turn-based combat, the beautiful soundtrack, the heartfelt story, and the eye-popping-for-the-time visuals created one of the most important entries of one of the most important franchises in video game history. However, one element was absent from Final Fantasy X that several of the key developers involved with the project lamented: an explorable world map.
For Yoshinori Kitase, a producer on Final Fantasy VII Rebirth who also served as a director on Final Fantasy VI, VII, VIII, and X, the world map's disappearance was a sore spot as someone who has been involved with the series since 1990. "We started off expressi…]]></summary>

Everyone knows that the days between your winter holiday and New Year's Eve are for gaming, right? At least, we hope you're doing some gaming today, tomorrow, and the day after! Or maybe you're kicking back with a good book, or watching a new movie?


We don't know what it is you're doing but we want to! In fact, we want to know what video game presents you found under the tree or in a beautifully wrapped gift box this year, too.
Did you get a new console? Did you get some games to add to your never-ending backlog – we're all still catching up on 2023's frankly absurd gauntlet of releases, right? Did you get some cool shirts, some Fortnite V-bucks, or a new coffee cup with Clive from Final Fantasy XVI on it?
Whatever it is you got, we want to know so drop a line in the comments below! And if this year's gifts weren't video game-themed, tell us what your favorite gift was anyway! 
On behalf of everyone here at Game Informer, we hope the holidays are treating you well (and we hope you're getting through that backlog for the sake of 2024's release schedule).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few weeks ago, I went to a Fortnite event where developer-publisher Epic Games unveiled its plan for the near future of its game: a Lego survival game, a racing game, and a music game à la Rock Band and Fuser. This is on top of the toolset allowing anyone to make and publish their own games within Fortnite.
The whole thing was kind of weird.
Not that any of the experiences are bad – the Lego thing is super not for me, but I really like the racing game (made by Psyonix, developer of Rocket League), and I think the music element has the potential to become something interesting down the road. 
I'm just not so sure Epic's utopian vision of Fortnite as this everything app makes sense. I agree with the idea that Fortnite is a great social tool – but only in the way most online video games can…]]></summary>

It was a challenging year for the industry as a whole, but in terms of artistic output, 2023 is absolutely a contender. Whittling the year's releases to a mere 10 games was challenging, but we did it (you can read our top 10 right here).
However, the year's game release calendar was so much more than just those 10 games. Below, you'll see our winners for various categories, allowing us to celebrate a wide range of games, moments, characters, and elements from the extremely strong year for game releases.

We got a 2023 release window alongside a new trailer back in 2022, but the mod needed more time, missing a release this year. Now, Team FOLON has revealed Fallout: London will be released in April, as reported by Eurogamer. 
More specifically, it will be available on April 23, 2024. The team announced this date in a new developer update released on December 23. In it, the team shows off more of the work it's done since its last trailer, highlighting well-worn and lesser-known locales of London alongside enemies, weapons, and more. It ends with the April 23, 2024, release date announcement.

It's also perhaps no surprise that in the big spreadsheet of games I've played this year, I've set yet another new record for things I've played to completion. At time of writing, my list stands at 58 games for 2023, and by the time you're reading this in your post-Christmas lunch coma, I wouldn't be surprised if it had risen further. 58! That's more than one a week! Honestly, what was past Katharine thinking? No wonder I'm so chuffing tired right now.
In any case, my list of honourable mentions is so long this year I've taken the cheeky liberty of cramming some extra entries into my 2023 Selection Box, bringing you five more personal picks that I think are just smashing and that you should absolutely play when you get a spare moment or three.

While she's out wish-hunting, here are some Christmas Crackers to distract you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

To celebrate this (plus some other, non-astronomical events), we're taking a week off! I imagine many of you will too. Oh how happy we'll all be, gathering at the window with our loved ones to count aloud the extra seconds of each day! This novelty will wear off in a week or so once we realise longer days don't mean warmer days, so we here at RPS will return on Tuesday the second of January. We have a few more bits and pieces still to come this year, mind. Expect more of our favourite games and—I'm very sorry—Christmas cracker jokes. Before I send you away, please, do tell us all: what are you playing this holiday?

The Finals offers rare novelty in the competitive multiplayer genre, encouraging creative strategies impossible in other titles because of its immense environmental destruction, physics-based hazards, and armory of whimsical gadgets. This first-person shooter occurs amid a digital game show where varying counts of three-person teams fight over money caches in an objective-focused format. The Finals is unpredictable in the best way: gameshow events like meteor showers or orbital lasers remap previously memorized paths, map variants like m…]]></summary>

I hope that, whatever you're celebrating this season, you have a lovely few days off, as I imagine most of you will. In the meantime, we will not leave you completely bereft!

While official updates since then have done little to address some of its most egregious problems - leaving modders to step in, as usual - the game’s latest patch has finally offered up a decent serving of improvements direct from the source.

Its world could almost be a post-apocalypse one, a feeling that persists even though it's unclear how true it is, how much is ambient cult brainwashing, and how much just the result of Boulder starting to lose himself after being undercover for far too long.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hear ye! This month marked the 25th birthday of Thief: The Dark Project. While not as infinitely mutable as other 90’s icons like Doom (which just turned 30, and can be played on a pregnancy test), stealth gaming’s grandpappy has maintained an enduring appeal and influence, especially for those more inclined to sneaking than slaughter. Buckets of digital ink have already been spilt examining this legacy, so I won’t dive into the weeds of a hagiography. What I want to highlight is a major event that marked the 25th anniversary – one that makes today as great a time as any to explore Thief’s still-thriving mod scene.


Notable: After a quarter-century, stealth fans were gifted a new, 10-mission Thief campaign called The Black Parade. Pitched as a prequel to the first game, it features a new protagonist, new story, and new heists, built by some of the most lauded modders on the scene. More notable still: The team lead is Romain Barrilliot, a fan-turned-pro designer at Arkane, where he, alongside other former Thief acolytes, iterates the immersive sim tenets in their patented im-sim laboratory. Mostest notablest? One of Thief’s original designers, Daniel Thron, joined The Black Parade’s team – and simultaneously released a new Thief short film, featuring the original game’s voice actors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The existence of the Upper Lunch Hut implies the existence of a Lower Lunch Hut, but as far as I can tell, no such building exists. It's one of many mysteries that surround the edifice, which I discovered during a holiday in the Cairngorms this August, while everybody else at RPS was writing about some tyrannous entity called Gamescom.
First, the approach: having exited a vast pine forest of primeval aspect and supernatural disposition, with distant, daylit clearings leading the eye deeper and deeper into the undergrowth, till it feels at last as though your gaze has become tangibly enmeshed with clutching root and lowering branch - having finally escaped from that terrible, terrible forest, with its single, mournful stream crossed by a bridge of predatory bareness that is surely a haven for trolls, you set out across a grey and purple oblivion of reed and heather, a moorland rising to the border between glens, broken only by the stark red stain of a door. Nearing this otherworldly aberration, this scarlet phantasm, you realise that there is a house constructed around it, a sloping excrescence of withered planks and flaking plaster. What fell secrets could it harbour? Let us go and make our visit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like a circus strongman's barbells, 2023's year in VR has been heavily weighted toward either end. The last twelve months were bookended with the launch of two excellent VR headsets (although only one is truly relevant to us PC gamers) and a whole bunch of great VR titles. The summer, however, was the quietest I've known for a long time, to the point where I ended up playing two VR minigolf games in the absence of anything better to do. Fortunately, the last few months have made up for it, providing enough fantastic VR games to feed us well into next year. So it's an unevenly weighted set of barbells, the kind that would give our moustachioed muscleman a slipped disk.
