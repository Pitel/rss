        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stats show that the COR-45 has the fastest time-to-kill among short-range meta weapons, but players aren't maximizing the pistol's potential on PC if they aren't using an underrated setting. 


In search of the best weapon for short-range engagements after the Season 3 Reloaded update, IceManIsaac stumbled across the COR-45. According to data from TrueGameData, the COR-45 has a significantly faster TTK than other popular weapons, at 525 milliseconds from zero meters away. 


For comparison, the Holger 26 comes in at 539, and MCW is at 600. With the XRK Lightning Fire trigger action and XRK IP-V2 conversion kits equipped that TTK improves to 400. However, that figure comes with a catch, as the weapon becomes semi-auto with the conversion, meaning players won't be able to reach that top speed because it's not possible for a person to fire a weapon that fast, pressing as fast as they can.

IceManIsaac showed it's possible to shoot 12-and-a-half times per second with the lightning fire trigger, but the average person can only shoot eight to 10 times per second. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to improve that delay even more.



Go into mouse settings 


Scroll down to calibration 


In the drop-down menu under mouse calibration, set mouse wheel delay to 0



With the mouse wheel delay removed, firing with the mouse wheel will feel like using a fully automatic weapon. As a result, the COR-45 will have one of the best TTK speeds in Warzone and shred through enemies almost immediately.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To build up anticipation for XDefiant, Ubisoft announced the All-Star Series, an eight-team tournament featuring FPS legends.


XDefiant All-Star Series challenges 16 of the best FPS competitors to compete in teams of four for a cash prize. Ubisoft confirmed that each qualifying round will be broadcast on YouTube before the finals on May 21, coinciding with the title's official release. The first matchup, featuring Aches and Pacman as team captains, will air on May 8 at 10 AM PT.

Patrick "ACHES" Price is a two-time CoD world champion and a core compLexity and Evil Geniuses dynasty member, which won 13 offline tournaments. In 2022, ACHES joined Ubisoft as a game developer and helped work on XDefiant. Meanwhile, Jonathan "Pacman" Tucker is also a former professional CoD player who had a long-respected career, and went on to coach and manage teams. 


Ubisoft wouldn't reveal the cash prize amount or full rosters, but there are plenty of exciting options for former FPS legends who would be itching to compete again. Based on everything shared during the official release date announcement, Ubisoft plans to support a competitive scene in XDefiant. The title will launch with a Ranked Mode practice playlist to test out 4v4 matches. The devs will release an official version of the game mode after the trial run, which will most likely narrow down the weapon and map pool. It's unclear if there will be an official league, but in March, Delco Gaming announced an official XDefiant roster.

With My Past, the debut game from developer Imagine Wings Studio, attempts to blend those feelings with platforming-puzzle gameplay and does so excellently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Rock and Dark type Tyranitar, with its formidable abilities, can dominate the battlefield. So, if you're looking to elevate its performance, here are the best Tyranitar movesets in Pokémon Go that will surely bolster your battle strategies.


What moves are the best for Tyranitar in Pokémon Go?


Tyranitar's move sets depend on the type of round you are playing, including PvE and PvP. While PvP is a high-octane, fast-paced challenge, PvE allows for a more strategic approach. We'll equip you with the best Tyranitar movesets for both Pokémon Go modes, empowering you to conquer any battle scenario.


Best Tyranitar PvP moveset in Pokémon Go


For better chances, you can use Smack Down and Brutal Swing in PvP. Smack Down features one of the highest DPS rates out of all the Fast Attacks, making it an easy choice for its move sets. This move is particularly effective against Flying, Bug, Fire, and Ice types. However, if you don't have this ability, Bite can be a helpful substitute.

When it comes to a Charged Attack, Brutal Swing is a reliable choice. Although it doesn't pack the same punch as Stone Edge, its lower energy cost makes it a valuable asset in PvP battles. Remember, in PvP, speed is key, and moves like Brutal Swing can give you the edge you need. 


Best Tyranitar PvE moveset in Pokémon Go


The best Tyranitar movesets for PvE are Bite and Brutal Swing. Bite can be devasting when paired with Brutal Swing. Together, they provide a high DPS rate without costing too much energy. No matter what, Brutal Swing should be your go-to for both PvE and PvP, especially against Ghost and Psychic types.

        <updated>2024-05-07T19:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The success of Marvel Snap rolls on, as does the seasonal structure of the free-to-play, deck-building card-battler from Second Dinner. Recent seasons have been themed after corners of the Marvel Universe, like Avengers vs. X-Men or Thunderbolts, but this season leans a bit more into the Marvel Multiverse with Blink and the Exiles. This season, titled "A Blink in Time," introduces five new characters, two new locations, and more.
The new characters joining the game in A Blink in Time are as follows:
Blink (5 Cost, 7 Power)

	
On reveal, swap the last card you played with a higher-cost card from your deck.

	
Nocturne (3 Cost, 5 Power)
	
You can move this once. When this moves, replace its location with a random new one.

	
Sage (3 Cost, 0 Power)
	
On reveal, +2 power for each different power among all other cards here.

	
Namora (5 Cost, 6 Power)
	
On reveal, give +5 power to each of your cards alone at another location.

	
Sasquatch (6 Cost, 10 Power)
	
Costs 1 less for each card you played last turn.

                  

On top of those all-new characters joining Marvel Snap collections, there are two new locations: Panoptichron, where cards that didn't start in your deck get +2 power, and Cancun, where power at that location doesn't count toward winning the game. New albums featuring Dan Hipp and Rian Gonzales also further incentivize Variant collections by rewarding items themed after Werewolf By Night, Silk, and Iron Lad. Finally, we know the dates of the Series 5 releases of this season. Baron Zemo and Nocturne get their Series 5 release on May 7, Sage arrives on May 14, Namora on May 21, and Sasquatch on May 28.
Marvel Snap's May season, A Blink in Time, kicks off today. For more on Marvel Snap, check out Charles Harte's opinion piece from when the game originally arrived on mobile devices.]]></summary>

In this case, the 'Aspects of Night and Darkness' incantation is the one you should be gunning for. It's offered to you by Hecate, but not freely; you'll have to prove you earned it first.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Limited Run Games and Konami have announced that the digital version of the Rocket Knight Adventures: Re-Sparked collection will be releasing on Switch, PS4, PS5, and PC on June 11.


Rocket Knight Adventures: Re-Sparked contains the three 16-bit games in the Rocket Knight series. This includes the original Rocket Knight Adventures, the Genesis Sparkster (subtitled Rocket Knight Adventures 2), and the SNES Sparkster (not subtitled). To be clear, Genesis Sparkster and SNES Sparkster are two completely different games featuring the series’ protagonist. Of the included games, one of them is the very best Genesis/Mega Drive ever made, and the other two are games.


Okay, that’s not quite fair. SNES Sparkster and Genesis Sparkster are both decent – maybe even above average – platformers, but they don’t even hold a candle to the original.




Limited Run Games did a round of pre-orders for the physical version of Rocket Knight Adventures: Resparked back in January and promised a digital release for anyone not interested in material possessions, but previously had not announced a date. I scooped up the Ultimate Edition of it at the time. I don’t usually go for special editions because I have enough random game collectibles, but Rocket Knight Adventures is one of my favorite games.


The collection will not only include modern comforts such as save states and rewind, but also a new boss rush mode and a “franchise museum and music player.”

The latest This Week in Destiny update explained that Master Rahool would once again become a gatekeeper to Exotic riches, and that Shader icons would become more identifiable.


Exotic armor is the key to powering different builds and effects during play. While Exotic armor has varying sources, one of the consistent methods for earning new pieces was running daily Lost Sectors solo on Legend or Master difficulty. That will change with The Final Shape, alongside an update to how the unlockable color palettes, Shaders, appear in-menu.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warzone players haven't been able to use the automatic tactical sprint setting for a week, but a fix is finally officially confirmed. 


The CoD support team confirmed that an update is scheduled for May 8 that will fix the automatic tactical sprint setting from interrupting reload animations, and will also address and issue with the interact priority setting from preventing controller players from reloading while near loot on the ground. 


Both glitches have been plaguing Warzone since the Season 3 Reloaded update went live on May 1. Along with a host of other small problems, players lost the ability to reloaded while automatic tactical sprinting. Turning off the setting acted as a temporary workaround, but limiting mobility came with its own pitfalls.

 Warzone's fast time-to-kill speeds are unforgiving and make every second matter. That slight delay between manual and automatic sprinting might not seem like that big of a difference. However, when you are running away from the storm or trying to reposition in one of the final circles, it could be the difference between winning or losing. And to make matters worst, it's likely that a large segment of the player base didn't even know there was a temporary fix for the glitch. 


Thankfully, there won't be too much longer of a wait for a permanent solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While out causing havoc around the realms, you may stumble across a few helpless Shades. A prompt to "compel" them will appear next to them, but you'll need a specific tool to keep them from wallowing in their sorrows. Here's how to compel Shades in Hades 2.


How to unlock compel in Hades 2


You can compel Shades with the Tablet of Peace, which requires five Psyche and five Silver. Psyche should be easy enough to find, as it is often given as a reward. However, you will need the Crescent Pick to mine the Silver. The Night's Craftwork can be handy for this, revealing nearby ore deposits.

After obtaining the necessary ingredients, unlock the Tablet of Peace in the Nocturnal Arms (weapons) section. Then, equip it via the Gathering Tools hub. Keep in mind that other tools like the Crescent Pick can't be used with the Tablet of Peace equipped. 


There isn't an exact location for the Shades, so you must be on the lookout for them. Once discovered, approach them to begin a short minigame. Completing this minigame is relatively easy; it only requires pressing and holding the right buttons. Just follow the prompt, which should give you a nice Psyche reward for the Arcana cards upgrade.

I tested out what happens if you fail, allowing players to make at least two attempts. However, those who are unsuccessful both times can no longer interact with the poor creature. Don't worry; plenty of lost souls are out there, so try your luck with the next one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of Oswald’s Many Dimensions questline, which allows you to build the lucky rabbit's house in Disney Dreamlight Valley, you will need to purchase 3D glasses to relocate the house into the next dimension. However, these 3D glasses are causing some issues. 


Unfortunately, some players are facing an issue with these glasses becoming available before the quest. This shouldn’t be a problem, but if these glasses are purchased before the quest prompts, they cannot be purchased again and the game doesn’t recognize that they’ve already been purchased, therefore halting quest progress. 




Gameloft has issued a temporary fix for this issue and those who have already encountered this issue will now find themselves boosted to the next stage of the quest upon logging in. This is great news, however, it isn’t a total fix for the initial issue, which the dev team says they are actively working on. 




At the time of writing, the bug is still present, and Gameloft urges players not to buy the 3D glasses until prompted to do so by the Oswald’s Many Dimensions quest, even if they’re available from Scrooge before that point. 


According to the Disney Dreamlight Valley issue tracking board on Trello, this bug in the Thrills and Frills update is not alone. There’s another where the Mechanical Parts recipe (necessary for completing the An Alarming Development quest) doesn’t show up in the crafting menu as it should, though it does unlock upon gathering the necessary parts.

With the introduction of the Depths, there's now a whole new world to explore with fearsome foes to battle. One of them is the Frox.


This boss enemy is a tough customer, especially with its heavy shockwave attacks. Link will have to throw bombs into its mouth, or shoot it in the eye to stun it enough to break the rocks on its back. This will take down the boss for good, and Link can use its monster parts to create elixirs and upgrade his armor. Here's a Frox map, showing you all 39 Frox locations you can find in Tears of the Kingdom.

One thing to note is that while I’ve played a staggeringly wide range of the NES library, I haven’t played everything. For example, I haven’t played Bases Loaded 3, and I’m open to the possibility that it’s the apogee of the NES library. This also isn’t about which games were most popular or influential. That’s another topic. These ones are the best for a myriad of other reasons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The newest Type Soul Shikai weapon is the Odachi, the only Mythic quality weapon in Type Soul yet. If you thought Legendary weapons were rare, the Mythic quality weapon is even more rare. Here is how to get Odachi in Type Soul.





How to get Odachi


You need to be really lucky to get the Odachi in Type Soul. As long as you are a Shinigami and have evolved your Zanpakuto to Shikai, you have technically fulfilled the requirements to get the Odachi. At the end of the path to become Shikai, you will fight a powerful Shikai boss after meditating four times. Upon defeating the boss, you will receive your Shikai as well as your Shikai weapon, though it is random. Here are your chances of acquiring each weapon rarity:



Common - 96.5%


Legendary - 3%


Mythic - 0.5%



As the Odachi is the only Mythic weapon in Type Soul at the moment, this means you will have a 0.5% or 1 in 200 chance of acquiring the Odachi.


How to reroll Shikai weapon and get Odachi


Unless you are super lucky, chances are you will not get the Odachi as your first weapon. While 1 in 200 isn't impossible, it's not exactly common either. If you fail to get the Odachi as your initial weapon, you will need to acquire a Locked Weapon Reroll. This item rerolls your weapon, once again giving you a random Shikai.


At the moment, the only guaranteed way you can only get a Locked Weapon Reroll either via codes or by purchasing the Weapon Reroll item from the shop using Robux. If you do not want to do that, your other option is to participate in 1v1 ranked matches which has a very low chance of rewarding you with a Locked Weapon Reroll after a victory.


Once you have a Locked Weapon Reroll, simply go into your inventory and click Locked Weapon Reroll on the left to reroll your weapon. Good luck on acquiring the extremely rare Mythic Odachi!

When your character gets a new set of peepers, it’s done through a roll. The eyes you get are random, though you can change them with an available reroll. You might want to try your luck again since among the eyes are Rare and Legendary ones that add a distinct flair to your look.


Eye rerolls are mostly obtained through inputting codes. You can find more information about them and grab a few from our handy code guide for Type Soul. With a bit of luck and a bit of perseverance, you may be able to reroll your way to some very unique eyes.

What are Rare and Legendary eyes


Rare and Legendary eyes are just rarer variations of eye appearance. Every character has eyes (obviously), but Rare eyes only have a 10% chance of appearing, while Legendary eyes a mere 3%. Even with frequent rerolling, getting one of these types of eyes is entirely luck.


The exact appearance and list of eyes can be found on the Type Soul Trello board. However, here’s a quick overview pulled directly from there.


Rare eyes (10% chance)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The clock is ticking.
Today, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa started a stopwatch that puts an official deadline on the reveal of the Switch successor — he says it's coming "this fiscal year," which means FY2025, which means between now and April 2025.
It's important to remember that this specifically refers to the reveal of the upcoming hardware, a system we've come to call 'Switch 2' through lack of an official name and the common-sense suggestion that Nintendo will stick to its winning handheld-hybrid formula with its next console.

The first of which, understandably if you don’t happen to carry a burning penchant for cultishly adored but undeniably niche 80’s schlock, is simple: Why? First, why get invested in another asymmetrical multiplayer game from a studio that has a bit of a history with limited shelf lives? And why, of all the licenses, have they chosen one so relatively forgotten, at least in comparison to Predator, Ghostbusters, and Friday the 13th?

From a top-down view, you still play as a newly awakened vampire on PVE, PVP, or private servers, and you're still tasked with becoming the most powerful bloodsucker around. It has, however, streamlined some things and added in an endgame zone. All of this combines to form a survival game that was great back then and is even better now, with thrilling MOBA-esque fights and little in the way of faff.

The game was released recently on PlayStation and, much like the Xbox Game Studios titles Pentiment and Grounded, has been rumoured to be coming to Switch and was rated by PEGI for Nintendo's platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hardcore tactical FPS Gray Zone Warfare is proving to be yet another of 2024’s unexpected successes, shifting over half a million copies when it launched into early access last week. Unfortunately, in its attempt to eat Escape from Tarkov’s lunch – a timely one, given that game’s self-inflicted DLC misery – it’s currently choking on the wishbone of some truly dire performance issues. Even players with tip-top graphics cards are seeing heavy stuttering while out in the field, and none of the updates released thus far, including today’s Hotfix #3, have done much to soothe it.
Said hotfix does include some fixes for other widespread problems, including a second attempt at preventing players from becoming headless when rejoining a server (an amusing though resilient glitch, given a previous hotfix had also tried to nix it). But having played a bit of this third patch on a usually reliable RTX 4060, there’s clearly an awful lot of work left to do before Gray Zone Warfare performs acceptably.

Naturally, our favourite gods and goddesses are emerging from our evenings of hacking and/or slashing. For me, Nemesis provides a lot of chuckles. Not because she's bright and jokey (she is frownier than a wet bulldog). But because she's determined to put the player in their place and to beat you at your own roguelike. Narratively, she fulfills a role similar to Meg in the first Hades, that of closest frenemy. But in gameplay terms, Nemesis won't stoop to something as trite as a boss battle. Oh no. She's out to mess with your build.

The game, which was being co-financed and co-published by Tencent, was in the early concept stage, according to Remedy, with only a small team working on it. 
The studio says it canceled Codename Kestrel to focus on other games it's developing in its portfolio, noting that because of this cancelation, its other projects will get "experienced developers reassigned from Kestrel."
Plus, Remedy says planned investment and the need to recruit additional employees for Kestrel is removed with this cancelation.

Nintendo has released its latest round of financial results, this time for the end of Fiscal Year 2024 (which ended in March). The Switch has surpassed 140 million units sold, further securing its place as the second-best-selling console in the company's history, and Nintendo has also revealed it will announce the Switch successor by March 2025. 
Despite great numbers in this round of financial results, Switch software is down roughly 5% compared to the same time frame for Fiscal Year 2023. Nonetheless, its games are still selling well comparatively in the wider market. With the latest numbers on Switch software, here's Nintendo's most up-to-date list of its best-selling Switch games:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed the Switch has surpassed 140 million units sold, further securing its current place as the second-best-selling console in the company's history. This news arrives at the same time Nintendo has revealed it will announce the Switch successor by March 2025, meaning there's still some time for the Switch to catch up to Nintendo's best-selling console: the Nintendo DS. 
Since the last financial results call, the Switch has sold an additional 1.96 million units, bringing its grand total up to 141.32. That keeps it in second place, only behind the Nintendo DS' massive 154.02 million. It's possible the Switch surpasses the Nintendo DS, especially considering the Switch will likely continue to sell even once its successor is released, but that's a big 13 million-unit gap to close. 


Elsewhere in the financial results, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has hit 20.28 million units sold, Super Mario Bros. Wonder has sold through 11.96 million, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe another 6.79 million, and Pikmin 4 3.33 million. The fiscal year ending with March 2024 was a strong one for Switch software, selling 163.95 million units in Q1 through Q3 of Fiscal Year 2024. However, compared to the same quarters for Fiscal Year 2023, Switch software is down 4.7%. 
With the Switch successor on the horizon, that number will likely be way up this time next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh Crab!
Over the years, many games have tried to recreate the precise, difficult nature of FromSoftware’s Dark Souls, a revolutionary title that created the aptly named Soulslike genre. Another Crab’s Treasure, from developer Aggro Crab, is another one of these endeavours, albeit with a significantly more colourful approach compared to the usual intensity of many Soulslikes.
The adventure begins with the introduction of protagonist, Kril, a Hermit Crab living above the surrounding ocean in a small tide pool. Before long, Kril is removed from his precious shell, as he now seemingly owes money to a creature by the name of the Duchess due to new tax laws. A Loan Shark — who takes the form of a plastic Shark-head-on-a-stick toy with a top hat — takes Kril’s shell as collateral, sending the adorable young crustacean on a journey to the depths of the ocean to retrieve his shell and return to his lovely tide pool. The writing is charming and full of witty remarks from the game’s cast of characters, resulting in an engaging narrative that will provide a few laughs here and there.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/07/nintendo-says-it-will-reveal-switch-successor-by-march-2025-but-not-at-the-direct"/>
        <updated>2024-05-07T11:52:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo will reveal the Switch successor within the current fiscal year, which ends March 31, 2025. However, the company says there will be no mention of this successor during a Nintendo Direct it is holding in June; this Direct will instead be focused on the games coming to Switch in the second half of 2024. 
While this isn't the first hint of a Switch successor from the company, it is the most direct and comes from the same financial results where we learned the Switch has sold an additional 1.96 million units since the last one, bringing its total up to 141.32 million. Software has reached 1.235 billion units. 


"This is Furukawa, President of Nintendo," the company's announcement reads on X (formerly Twitter). "We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year. It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015. We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation."
This announcement follows industry reports from earlier this year stating the Switch successor was targeting a March 2025 release date. That could still be the case given Furukawa's reveal, but given the timeline, Nintendo could also announce the successor that month, meaning we likely wouldn't have it in our hands until later that year. Only time will, though, but at least we now officially know that by this time next year, we'll know what the successor to the Switch is. 
For more, read about how Nintendo reportedly demoed the Switch successor to developers at Gamescom last year, and then check out Game Informer's top 10 Switch games.

It's about a middle aged woman navigating her past and present by taking a closer at her mind, which means sorting through a load of magical realist meldings of memories. It's very pretty, and I liked the demo a lot.

As part of Nintendo's end-of-year financial report for FY2024, the company has updated its top ten best-selling games list for the Switch with new sales figures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hades II has launched into Steam Early access, and it’s also Game Informer’s next cover story (which launches on May 14).  Whether you’re a returning fan or a newcomer, it may take a few runs to get your bearings as Hades II sports new progression systems, resources, and new layers to existing mechanics. It can be a lot to dig into, given the game more or less tosses you into the deep end without context for how things work, at least initially. Instead of spending several runs figuring things out, here’s a short, spoiler-free primer explaining some core new features to get you going on the right foot. 
What Are Ashes? 
Ashes are a currency used for unlocking Arcana cards. They serve a similar purpose as Darkness from the first game. They often appear as a reward for completing a room, but …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been sampling Hades 2’s early access build on the Steam Deck, and my only complaint – besides the smooching frog having eluded me for hours – is that it’s giving me very little to write about, performance analysis-wise. Honestly, it fits the dinky PC so well you’d have thought Supergiant had decided to make this roguelike sequel a Steam Deck game that just happened to run on desktops by accident.
Hades the first was much the same, taking to the Deck like Hercules to Augean shit, but Hades 2 barely even gives away that fact that it’s unfinished. It doesn’t crash, stutter, or hang, and there’s no point in talking about settings when it runs at a practically perfect 60fps on max quality. Make that 90fps on the Steam Deck OLED, too. It’s just a fabulous game for handhelds, even in its earliest of early access days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hades II, the much-anticipated sequel to Supergian's excellent roguelike, is entering Early Access today and is on the cover of Game Informer Magazine with incredible original art by acclaimed artist Jen Zee. Join Alex Van Aken – who visited Supergiant for the cover story and has played Hades II extensively – and myself for a look at the game's second area and boss fight. Spoilers ahead if you want to experience the locations and enemies for yourself, but otherwise, enjoy this New Gameplay Today episode!
This second area in Hades II is called Oceanus, an underwater realm Melinoë uses to bypass the armies of Chronos, the game's antagonist and Titan of Time. Oceanus is generally more difficult to navigate than Erebus, the first area, due to explosive hazards, more powerful ranged enemies, and darting schools of swordfish. The level culminates in a musical boss fight against a rock band of sirens led by Scylla, a well-known sea monster from Greek myth. Scylla sings while her keyboardist and drummer back her up. Despite sharing one health bar, the individual monsters can be stunned and knocked out of the fight, muting the appropriate instruments in the active music track.

Ah, Super Monkey Ball... Since its debut back in 2001, Sega's platforming, puzzle-solving, party extravaganza has had its ups and downs over the years, but has nevertheless remained a firm favourite with gamers - particularly those with a certain proclivity for Nintendo consoles.
In fact, Super Monkey Ball has shown up on pretty much every Nintendo platform bar the Wii U (pause for tiny violin) since its inception, making it almost as synonymous with The Big N as franchises like Animal Crossing, Mario Party, and — bizarre as it may be — Sonic the Hedgehog.

As a boss battle in Hades 2 they are a deadly trio that has bested me more times in the last few hours than I care to admit. But as a sign of things to come for this early access roguelike sequel, they are an encouraging bunch of characterful malcontents. The harbingers of a confident, slash-happy action game, and another poppy adaptation of classic Greek japes.

After playing several hours of the Early Access build (which is publicaly available as of today), we traveled to Supergiant Games' studio in San Francisco to interview several of the core team members – creative director Greg Kasavin, studio director Amir Rao, art director Jen Zee, composer Darren Korb, and voice actor Logan Cunningham – to get the full story of the game's creation. The cover story reveals why Supergiant decided to create its first sequel, how it chose a new protagonist in Zagreus' sister, Melinoë, along with her mythological origins, and how the team is changing its approach to early access and the content it has planned for the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost of Tsushima, the hit 2020 PlayStation-exclusive samurai game, rides onto PC on May 16, and ahead of the game's launch there, developer Sucker Punch Productions has revealed players will not need a PlayStation Network account to play through the game's single-player story mode, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. However, a PSN account will be required to play through Ghost of Tsushima's multiplayer Legends mode, or if you want to use the new PlayStation PC overlay to acquire trophies and more. 
This follows news from last week where PlayStation announced (and later walked back) that Helldivers 2 players will soon be required to link a PSN account to their Steam account, leading to widespread anger in the game's community. It seems Sucker Punch is looking to get ahead of this by revealing its PSN plans ahead of the game's launch in 10 days. 
Thank you for your feedback.
May 3, 2024
If you're unfamiliar with Ghost of Tsushima: Legends, it's a standalone multiplayer experience that allows you and up to three other players to fight enemies in special missions, defeat waves of foes, and complete raids. A PSN account will be required to play Legends, but if you want to play through the game's story (and Iki Island expansion), you won't need one. 
Ghost of Tsushima hit PlayStation 4 on July 17, 2020, before launching on PlayStation 5 with a Director's Cut on August 20, 2021. This is the version of the game hitting PC in 10 days on May 16, 2024.
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Ghost of Tsushima review, and then read about why the Director's Cut of Ghost of Tsushima is a must-play for fans.

Wrath: Aeon of Ruin has been a long time coming. Running on a heavily modified version of the Quake engine and developed by some of the Quake scene’s most skilled modders, Wrath looked set to take over the retro shooter world when it hit Early Access in 2019. Then it was hit with delay after delay, partially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A 2022 release date slipped to 2023, then 2024.
And now, finally, Wrath is here. And upon playing it, we understand why it took developer KillPixel so long to finish it, for both better and worse. What’s here is good, but Wrath often feels like it’s struggling under the weight of its own ambition and the limitations of being on a console - and no, we're not just talking about the Switch.

Of all the studios to potentially work on a Donkey Kong project, Vicarious Visions (now known simply as Blizzard Albany) admittedly wasn't particularly high up on our list.
However, details have emerged of a now-cancelled DK project at the studio via a new video from Did You Know Gaming (with prior reporting from DK Vine). According to the research, leadership at Vicarious Visions had wanted to collaborate more closely with Nintendo after the studio's work on Skylanders: Superchargers (which, if you remember, included the likes of Bowser and Donkey Kong on Wii U, Wii, and 3DS). It had received developer kits for the Nintendo Switch and wanted to create something truly unique for the upcoming system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

Norland is sort of The Sims meets Dwarf Fortress meets RimWorld. It gives you charge of several new kingdoms that have sprouted from the corpse of a fallen Empire and are now feuding for supremacy.

Ahead of the game's May 21 launch, developer Ninja Theory has revealed the PC specs and system requirements for Senua's Saga: Hellblade II and to play the game at its best, you'll need quite a powerful system. 
If you're familiar with Ninja Theory's work, you likely already know it pushes the envelope with technology so it might not come as a surprise your PC will need to do the same. But if you're new to this team, or just want to check if you're ready for the game later this month, we've got you covered. 


Senua's Saga: Hellblade II PC Specs And System Requirements
Below is a chart released by Ninja Theory detailing everything you need to know about running Senua's Saga: Hellblade II at its most demanding, recommended specs, and even at the bare minimum. And as you can see, it's a game that requires a lot of power (click the image to enlarge). 
Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21. 
For more, watch the latest Hellblade II trailer here, and then read about Hellblade II's photo mode and what to expect from it at launch. After that, watch this Hellblade II gameplay trailer.

Amongst other things, they'd reach over and flick the power off while I was playing The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. I didn't finish that game for 15 years. I'd flown the family nest before I braved the Eagle's Tower. Can you imagine what my friends would have done if I'd owned a Game Boy Camera? Probably, they'd have taken photos of... bottoms with it, and such. 
I'm aware I'm not making a great case for being a graduate of the School of Hard Knocks. The point is: I didn't have a Game Boy Camera then, so I'm delighted that the Game Boy Camera has caught on among a later generation of indie PC developers - prominent among them artist and educator Catharine Graffam, whose GB Camera Gallery: Mystery Show you can play for free in a browser.

The environments take hefty influence from Carceri d'invenzione, a series of prints created in the 18th century by Giovanni Battista Piranesi, whose name has become a byword for impossible spaces.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there's one thing that'll rile people up more than a robot blasting them with a laser cannon, it's having to create a new account. That's something Helldivers 2 players will have to do pretty sharpish, as Arrowhead announce mandatory account linking between Steam and Playstation Network. Why? Safety and security apparently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crossover fighting game Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite first sauntered onto various videogaming mechanisms back in 2017. We forgot to review it. Oops. But others did, sometimes complaining about the art style, which was a chunky and plastic-looking departure from previous games in the series. It's now almost seven years later but at least one person has not forgotten this missed opportunity. A fighting game modder has been tinkering with shaders to bring the comic book style of previous games to Infinite. Looks cool.

At one point it was trending on Steam and since then it's garnered loads of positive reviews, with people saying it's unsettling and drips with atmosphere. Reader, I do think it's quite atmospheric, but I do not think it's all that unsettling. If anything, I find it a bit dull, in a way that's semi-frustrating. Am I missing the liminal space-liker bit of the brain a lot of people have? Am I an anomaly here?

Ubisoft's elusive free-to-play shooter XDefiant finally has a release date, 21st May 2024.

May 13th (unlucky for some) will see this fairytale kingdom city builder launch into 1.0, after a comparatively short but successful early access run on Steam. It looks very sweet, and reminds me of a kind of Foundation meets Lakeburg Legacies - at least based on the trailer, which puts an emphasis on it laid back and idyllic citybuilding, and love.

I'm so far unconvinced by the need to pay real money to unlock a premium warbond, therefore. The trailer for the next premium warbond, coming May 9th, does contain glimpses of some weapons I'd like, however.

On the one hand, you've got to deal with interdimensional horrors of various flavours, such as multiple-storey cryptids and squishy skinless wolves; on the other, invading squads of Combiney soldiers. Fortunately, you've got a big fat Ivy League brain stuffed with knowledge of killer gadgets, base construction, subterranean farming and battlefield medicine. My increasing phobia for survival games notwithstanding, I think this looks and sounds like a hoot - and it's out now in early access. Here's the launch trailer.

His demonic influence manifests into world-distorting gameplay sequences as Indika explores the rural wilds of early 20th-century Russia.

It's often invoked as an archetype for the humanist worldview of Man the Measure and Centre of all Things, holding a perfectly proportioned universe in shape. Rin D'Lorah, the heroine of new narrative RPG Sky Of Tides, is a bit like the Vitruvian Man, and the result is a game I find at once bewitching and powerfully offputting in its refusal to satisfy the conventions of the genre.

We take some time on the Electronic Wireless Show podcast to talk about this patch of patches, and what it was like in the good ol' days, where a broken game came out and stayed broken, gosh darn it!
Nate isn't here today, which means I can make fun of him for owning fish, or whatever it is he does, but in his stead James steps up with an RGB lighting-themed game where I have to guess what accessories people stuck lights on to turn into gamer accessories. This is because Razer stuck RGB lights on a pandemic mask and are in trouble over it now. Naughty Razer. Plus, we talk about the games we're playing right now, and dish you up some juicy recommendations at the end of the show.

        <updated>2024-05-02T14:38:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keoken Interactive, developer of Deliver Us The Moon and Deliver Us Mars, has laid off nearly its entire staff. The studio’s two founders are the only remaining employees.
Founders Keon Deetman (CEO) and Paul Deetman (managing director) announced on social media that after the studio failed to secure funding during the Game Developer’s Conference (GDC) in March, it had “exhausted all our possible options for publishing, work for hire, and co-development.” As a result, the remainder of its staff has been let go. GameIndustry.biz confirmed that 13 employees were affected, 11 of which were full-time and 2 freelance contractors. 
The Deetmans have made a call for any studios with open positions to hire its affected staff. The founders plan to stay in business and have vowed to rebuild, which includes launching a Kickstarter to crowdfund Deliver Us Home,  a sequel to Deliver Us Mars. 
It was clear Keoken was in trouble when the founders posted a video in March revealing it had been unable to land a publishing deal after spending two years pitching five games to over 40 publishers. Instead, the founders decided to publicly reveal these projects to help garner interest, one of which was Deliver Us Home and two were Deliver Us The Moon spin-offs, including a VR game. 
Keoken once employed 45 employees, but the headcount was reduced to 20 by March 2024 before four more employees were let go that month. In an interview with GameIndustry.biz, the Deetmans revealed they had gone months without collecting a salary to help stay afloat.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-05-02T14:19:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Universal Orlando Resort has released a new video detailing what to expect at its Florida-based Super Nintendo World when it opens as a land in its Epic Universe theme park next year. In it, the company confirms the land will have three rides, including the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster that's expected to open later this year in Osaka, Japan's Super Nintendo World. 
The video includes digital fly-overs of the park, showing viewers what it will look like when it opens next year. If you've seen Super Nintendo World in Japan, this park looks nearly identical, with both the Donkey Kong Country (and mine cart coaster) section and the Mushroom Kingdom with Peach's Castle, Mt. Beanpole, the Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge augmented-reality ride and Yoshi's Adventure dark ride. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Super Nintendo World overview video below: 


As you can see, the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster will feature state-of-the-art track technology that allows it to create the illusion that riders will actually jump off the tracks, just like in the Donkey Kong Country games. 
Like in Hollywood's Super Nintendo World, which does not have the Yoshi's Adventure ride or the Donkey Kong expansion as a result of space at the location, and Osaka's Super Nintendo World, guests can purchase Power-Up Bands to play in interactive Key Challenges to earn coins and more. Plus, returning locations like the Toadstool Cafe restaurant and more will be at Orlando's iteration of the park. 
Here's a look at some of the locations to expect when Universal Epic Universe opens next year: 

For more details about the park, read Game Informer's breakdown of everything coming to Epic Universe next year. After that, check out photos from our visit to Japan's Super Nintendo World, and then watch this vlog of our day at the theme park.

Not ‘the country of Africa’ bad, but certainly not good enough that you’d want me on your pub quiz team. Also, I still do the Shredded Wheat rhyme internally when I have to follow directions. However, I do enjoy making maps turn a different colour in strategy games, Total War chiefly among them. Well, one such map is expanding before my confused idiot eyes, that being Total War: Pharaoh’s. It’s getting a new, distinctly Mesopotamia and Aegea-shaped bit. I believe that’s just south of Eastopotamia and Wegea.

Earlier today, we learned that Take-Two Interactive, the company-publisher behind the Grand Theft Auto series, had closed Rollerdrome studio Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 studio Intercept Games. Both of those games, and many others including the recently released No Rest for the Wicked, were published by Private Division, an indie-publishing arm under Take-Two.
Now, in a new update from GamesIndustry.biz, the publication reports that Take-Two has shuttered the "vast majority" of Private Division's teams in Seattle, New York, Las Vegas, and Munich, according to one of its sources. When GamesIndustry.biz reached out to Take-Two for confirmation, the company issued the same statement that can be read in Game Informer's original story below.

Not too shabby, considering that it's mostly the work of just one person, Grzegorz Styczeń of Slavic Magic, who has hopefully found time to sleep now and then between fielding bug reports and preparing the game's first patches.
Styczeń understandably doesn't have much time for interviews right now - those troublesome archers aren't going to balance themselves - but yesterday I spoke to Tim Bender, CEO of Manor Lords publisher Hooded Horse, about how Styczeń is getting on. The answer, apparently, is: pretty good, because Styczeń has a healthy approach to early access development in keeping players close, without quite handing them the wheel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember that bit in that Guy Ritchie film where Dexter Fletcher shoot a guy and then throws a glowing jar over his soldier that summons a bunch of skeletons to help him out? Me too! Must have been the direct influence for Sea Of Thieves' new Season 12, which launched earlier this week with a bang - from two smoking barrels! Among the additions in this season of the ever popular salty sea-dog open-world adventure are double barrel pistols. They deal less damage per shot but have higher rate of fire, and you can charge them up to fire both barrels at once. 
On the other end of the weapon scale are new throwing knives, capable of sneak attacks, light slashes, or, you know, throwing. You can nab any throwing knives you see lying around, too, which is fun. But honestly, the Bone Caller tool (the aforementioned jar of skeletons, which has a great Jason and The Argonauts vibe) and the Horn Of Fair Winds are are probably more useful. The winds from said horn can make your ship go faster, but can also put out fires or crowd control enemies, or for some reason make you swim faster? I don't think that makes sense, to be honest, but the horn has limited uses so as not to make you an unstoppable wind machine.

With the announcement of Fallout 76, fans are scrambling for clues that will shed light on the new game. A few concrete details come from the pre-existing information on Vault 76. Most vaults in Fallout were built for a specific purpose, and according to references in Fallout 3, Vault 76 supposedly held 500 people for exactly 20 years before opening and repopulating the surface.
Repopulation is important and all, but is this the most interesting route for a new Fallout? Playing a wastelander on a noble quest is something we’ve already done several times, but a game built around the events of a specific vault is an intriguing proposition. We delve into canon Fallout lore to reveal a bounty of bizarre and disturbing scenarios, any of which co…]]></summary>

In the lead-up to the game's release date, the NBA 2K24 developer Visual Concepts released a blog post running down the features of its card-collection mode, MyTeam. In that blog post, the developer laid out several features and rewards for the then-upcoming title. It took special care to devote a section to an upcoming Collector Level reward, Kobe Bryant.

Justin used a large language model to answer questions about the Catholic church and Catholic orthodoxy, and if you have any familiarity with how people love to test AI chatbots - or you read the headline of this article - then you know where this is going. Fr. Justin, who was already kind of controversial anyway, offered the sacrament and claimed to be a real priest to Futurism, and gave the thumbs up to baptising a baby in Gatorade in an emergency.
Catholic Answers (who have the domain Catholic.com; gotta imagine His Holiness wishes he'd moved quicker on that one) then defrocked Justin, making him  a lay theologian in a suit jacket, jeans and an open collar shirt that gives him a "me and my wife saw you across the bar" kind of vibe, when before he had the whole dog collar kit and caboodle.

The last day also saw a peak player count of around 66,000, putting it ahead of giants like Palworld, Rimworld, and Fallout 76. None of this would be especially notable, however, if this wasn’t a complete turnaround from how things have been for the best part of a year now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We learned a bit about Deep Rock Galactic's upcoming Season 5 update a few weeks ago, and now we know a bit more thanks to a Ghost Ship dev stream. Not only has it gifted us details on the new mission type and the new season event, it's also given us an idea of when we might see Season 6 emerge. I suppose you could liken the stream to a bushy Dwarven beard, from which the devs pluck out announcements like it's show and tell. And the show and tell is set in a dingy mine. And there are multiple pints involved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The high-fidelity rustic hurly-burly of Manor Lords is all very well, but some of us yearn for a simpler and perhaps, more elegant age, when city builders looked like a bunch of copulating squares, and could run on PCs with approximately the computing power of a slice of bread (toasted, but not buttered). Step forward Mini Settlers, which has a free prologue version you might try if you're weary of Manor Lording, or you've already exhausted the play possibilities of early access Franconia.

As rumoured in April, they're also apparently going to show off a new Gears Of War game. Nice to see the COG and Locust still getting work.

The CJEU's judgment leaves no stone unturned explaining why that isn't so, leaving case law to deal with the turbulence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zynga has released a new trailer for its upcoming competitive multiplayer game, Star Wars: Hunters, revealing a June 4 release date alongside a new cinematic look at some of the characters. Star Wars: Hunters will hit Switch and iOS and Android devices on that day, giving players the chance to compete with others in iconic locations like the forest moon of Endor, the icy planet of Hoth, and elsewhere while controlling Hunters like J-3DI, a droid who thinks he's a Jedi, Utooni which is two Jawas stacked on top of each other in a trench coat, and more. 
Zynga says each Hunter boasts their own unique set of abilities to aid them in the Arena, which is the marquee attraction of the new planet of Vespaara. "Star Wars: Hunters features a number of game modes for players to test their mettle, such as Squad Brawl, in which opposing teams will battle to rack up the most eliminations, and Trophy Chase, where competing teams will vie for control of the elusive droid TR-F33," a press release reads. 
Check out the action in the new Star Wars: Hunters trailer below: 


"We are beyond excited to welcome fans across the globe to Vespaara," Zynga vice president Sam Cooper writes in a press release. "We can't wait for gamers to meet our Hunters and hop into the Arena. There are so many fun twists and winks to recognizable, beloved Star Wars settings, creatures, and themes within our game that we also are eager to see players worldwide get the chance to discover." 
Star Wars: Hunters will be available worldwide on Switch, iOS, and Android devices. It will be free, and on Switch, it does not require a Nintendo Switch Online membership to download and play.

If you're a fan of a popular movie or TV show from any time in the last several decades, chances are, they've made a Funko Pop figurine of the main characters. The brand is ubiquitous in pop culture, so it was only a matter of time before it got a big video game adaptation. This sort of game could easily be a cheap cash grab, but after watching a preview demo and listening to one of the head developers speak about it, I'm confident that Funko Fusion is much more than that.
You've never played a game by developer 10:10 Games, but you probably know the work of its staff – the founders of the studio are some of the former architects of the Lego games developed…]]></summary>

Vengeance promises many new things: a revised battle system, a new story branch, new areas, and more. What I found when I played, was several punches to my metaphorical ribs. A few to my gut. Sure, I spent some time with the new stuff, but really, I spent most of my time being absolutely demolished in turn-based battles against various demons of a phallic and non-phallic nature. I will now attempt to summarise my time against these creatures, wish me luck.

        <updated>2024-04-30T14:05:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix, the company behind last year's Final Fantasy XVI and this year's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, has seemingly canceled some in-development games, taking on some big losses as a result. As for why, the company is aiming to be more selective about its projects moving forward. 
This news comes from a release related to Square Enix's holdings, which explains the company is incurring losses of 22.1 billion Yen, or roughly $140 million, on its financial books for the fiscal year that ended in March. 


"At the meeting convened on March 27, 2024, the Board of Directors of Square Enix Holdings voted, in light of the myriad changes underway in the environment surrounding its group, to revise the group's approach to the development of high-definition (HD) games with the intention of being more selective and focused in the allocation of development resources," the release reads. "As a result of a close examination, the company expects to recognize approximately 22.1 billion Yen in content abandonment losses on its books for the fiscal year ended March 2024." 
While potentially canceled games might sound doom and gloom, it sounds more like Square Enix is sharpening its developmental focus to ensure that the games it releases are hits or, at the very least, financially successful for the company. Nonetheless, it sounds like roughly $140 million of games in development have been canceled and it's unlikely we'll ever find out what they were. 
This release comes after a big splash from Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which Square Enix released in February. Elsehwere in 2024, Square Enix is releasing Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail, the new expansion for the MMO that will kick off a new saga for the long-running game, in July.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I once went back to a gathering after a friend-of-a-friend’s metal gig that I distinctly remember not because of either the party or the show, but because we drunkenly went to a big Tesco afterwards to get snacks. I also distinctly remember making a not-completely serious but also somewhat true statement at the party about how that Tesco trip was the most fun I’d had in months, after which one of the metal men sneered at me. I felt self conscious at the time, but I’ve since grown comfortable enough with myself to realise that the metal man was a joyless fool, and going to big supermarkets is at least as fun as going to average metal gigs. There is nothing a drop D power chord can evoke in me that compares to the feeling of blurrily espying a chocolate trifle in the reduced to clear section. So I wish to bring your attention to Supermarket Times.

        <link href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/harold-halibut-review"/>
        <updated>2024-04-30T14:00:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Harold Halibut has the vibes of a game that should be 4-6 hours long and is, inexplicably, 10-12. It's inexplicable not only because it's a slow game low on interaction - the game is really just a plot delivery mechanism; a TV show you can walk around where you advance the story by pressing A - but also because it's a game created using handmade miniatures. It's a sci-fi animated dolls house under the sea, self described as "a cross between a game and a stop motion film", and if my game required that amount of labour I'd edit that script down. Then again, there aren't that many locations, so maybe you'd really want to show them off.
I love miniatures, and Harold Halibut is beautiful. It's also a lovely story about finding yourself and your place in the world, even if that place is unexpected, and having the courage to take that step. There are unexpected silly bits and strange bits and bits where people break into song, and bits where you read undelivered letters. But, at the same time, I totally understand why some people would find it boring.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/30/housemarque-celebrates-returnals-3-year-anniversary-with-fallen-asteria-animated"/>
        <updated>2024-04-30T13:46:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Housemarque is celebrating the three-year anniversary of its hit shooter roguelike Returnal by teaming up with Dark Horse Comics for a graphic novel, artbook, and a new animated adaptation you can watch right now. This news follows yesterday's tease from both Housemarque and later Dark Horse Comics about Returnal, sending fans into an understandable frenzy about what the teams had in store for players. 
"Another year, another cycle," a post on X (formerly Twitter) from Housemarque reads. "The Third time around, extra loot is exposed with Dark Horse flair." 
Here's what that flair brings to the Returnal universe: 
Returnal: Fallen Asteria Graphic Novel
Returnal Artbook
Fallen Asteria Animated Adaptation
Now, even with PlayStation dipping its toes into cross-media production with Amazon's God of War series and Netflix's Horizon adaptation, this Returnal adaptation isn't the same. Instead, it's an "animated version of the first issue of the upcoming graphic novel, Returnal: Fallen Asteria." Check it out for yourself below: 


Housemarque says the 88-page graphic novel will arrive in paperback on bookstore shelves starting October 22, 2024, and it will hit comic book shops the next day. 
It's unclear if the animated adaptation above is the animated adaptation today's announcement refers to or if it's just the first part of it since it only adapts the first issue of the graphic novel. 
Here's a look at the Returnal: Fallen Asteria issues coming this October: 
There's no word on when the Returnal artbook will arrive, but presumably it's this year. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Returnal review, and then check out this story about the PC specs required to play Returnal on a desktop or laptop. After that, read about Returnal's Ascension update, which added co-op gameplay and a new challenge tower to the game. 
Returnal hit PlayStation 5 on April 30, 2021. It launched on PC on February 15, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield's first expansion, Shattered Space, is set to arrive this fall, according to director Todd Howard. Plus, a new update for Starfield is coming later this week that will make changes to ship-building mechanics and more. 
Howard revealed this and more about Starfield in a new interview with Kinda Funny, which is where the Bethesda executive producer also discussed Amazon's Fallout TV show and the Fallout series in general, as reported by XboxEra. As for what to expect of Shattered Space, Howard didn't say much. However, we already know it will bring new story content, locations, gear, and more to Starfield. 


As noted by XboxEra, Shattered Space will be free for all Starfield Deluxe Edition owners. 
As for the update coming to Starfield later this week, Howard says it will focus on the ship-building. This lines up with what the Starfield team shared last year in its 2024 plans for the game. Here's what it said at the time: "For those who love ship building, we'll also be expanding on ship customization with ship decorations, new ship building options, and more."
Other updates scheduled for 2024 include new ways to travel, city maps, mod support, accessibility and additional difficulty options, and more. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Starfield review, and then read about how Starfield is surprisingly great as a remote-play game. After that, check out this story about how Starfield is more like a sci-fi theme park than an open world adventure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wow, remember Starfield? I do, just about, although any interest in it feels like a distant dream now. But not to Todd Howard! The Bethesboss had a chat with Kinda Funny and confirmed that Shattered Space, the first big DLC for the brave little space RPG that could, has a release window of "in the fall". Shattered Space adds new locations and stories and gear, and is the sort of DLC that was announced before the game came out, and you got it bundled with some of the super mega hyper awesome pre-order editions (you can still get it bundled with the Starfield Premium Edition if you want to spend an extra 30 quid). 
Before that, though, Howard says we should expect (via VGC via the video) "a big update that's coming really soon", and that "we redid the map stuff, so we have some city map stuff." This is the literal first thing I complained about when I reviewed Starfield. Vindication! This is one of a number of changes teased on Starfield's Reddit community at the end of last year.

Two separate lawsuits filed by DISH against two IPTV resellers in recent months were classic examples, at least until they weren't. One reseller has just been ordered to pay damages of $30m. The second, a reseller in the astrology business, just had his case suddenly dismissed. Nobody could've predicted that.

And not just an arguably underrated-if-also-not-particularly-great action-adventure RPG or fairly okay Telltale adventure game, either, but a whole honest-to-goodness Game of Thrones MMO currently in development, according to new rumours.

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were synonymous with gaming in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, largely thanks to their influence over arcade brawlers. Games like 1989’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (also known as ’89 Arcade) and 1991’s Turtles in Time are time-honored classics that shaped the side-scrolling beat-‘em-up genre, and 2022’s Shredder’s Revenge demonstrated that the style is still viable in the modern landscape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Jackbox Party Packs have always allowed for adult-themed responses, but it was never solicited or directly encouraged by the games themselves. For those who have wanted a more mature experience, Jackbox Games is finally granting you your wish, as it has announced Jackbox Naughty Pack, a new release of three games that promises spicy prompts and dirty fun later this year.
We don't know what kinds of games will be included, but Jackbox Games teases "spicy surprises and maybe even some familiar faces." Does that tease a new, mature-themed You Don't Know Jack? Will we get dirtier iterations on some classic Jackbox titles? Or will these be all new games that just so happen to include some favorite characters from past games? Unfortunately, for now, Jackbox Games is being tight-lipped with the contents of Jackbox Naughty Pack.
However, the studio did release a teaser trailer, which you can view right here. Jackbox Naughty Pack will arrive sometime this year, and Jackbox Games promises more details this summer.
Are you excited for a spicier take on Jackbox Party Pack? Do you and the people you play Jackbox games with typically go mature-themed with your answers, or are you more of a family-friendly Jackbox gamer? Let us know what you hope from Jackbox Naughty Pack in the comments below!]]></summary>

Metroidvanias stand apart for me only in hindsight - it's all about the precise ratio of abilities to ability gates, of jump-doublers to overhangs, all things that take time to assess properly. Echo Weaver sets itself apart early, however, by declaring that "time is your currency" and that "when faced with eternity, knowledge is the only gear you need", a phrase that, admittedly, I would probably have extended to "...oh, and a spacetime-folding glaive that works like a throwable fast travel point".

In a post on X, the developer simply posted a graphic of what appears to be a fractured reflection of a woman’s eyes with the word “Tomorrow.”

Less than two hours later, Housemarque shared a brief video clip of the same image but in animated form.

April 29, 2024
While the kneejerk reaction is to assume this announcement is related to Returnal, be it a sequel or something else, that seems unlikely. In 2022, Housemarque stated it was developing a new IP for its next title. However, that wouldn't necessarily rule out the possibility of more Returnal DLC, if nothing else. Much has changed for Housemarque since Returnal launched in April 2021, such as being acquired by Sony just a couple of months later. Returnal launched on PC in February 2023 and has been updated with additional content and features such as co-op. 
Thankfully, we don’t have to wait long to learn what Housemarque has up its sleeve next. In the meantime, be sure to check out our review of Returnal here.]]></summary>

This will be the studio's next original game, after they wrapped up Layers Of Fear last year with, confusingly, Layers Of Fear (the natural progression for a series: Layers Of Fear, Layers Of Fear 2, and then Layers Of Fear again, although it was going to be called Layers Of Fears at one point).
Bloober Team are currently doing a lot of IP work for other people, with the Silent Hill 2 remake due out later this year, and a game codenamed "Project R" in concert with Skybound Entertainment. Skybound are The Walking Dead company, so I wouldn't give you long odds for a bet on what Project R is about. Neither would I be surprised if Project C is unveiled this summer by a man named Geoff with shiny shiny trainers. I'm interested to see what it is, and honestly I'm hoping it's a brand new standalone thing, rather than a forced sequel to Observer or 2021's The Medium (where I got the header).

The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass released in 2007 for DS and is controlled entirely by touchscreen. Back in 2017 while speaking with longtime Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma for our Breath of the Wild cover story, he cited Phantom Hourglass as his personal favorite Zelda game saying that his wife is a fan of that entry, and it was the first time he was in the role of producer. "I have a lot of sentiment for it,"Aonuma said.
Check out the video below for an hour Phantom Hourglass gameplay below.

In the heyday of the tennis-sim video game genre, Top Spin and Virtua Tennis were the best players in the crowded space. However, in the time since the genre’s boom settled, the offerings have fallen off considerably, with both franchises going more than a decade without a new release. TopSpin 2K25 signals the reemergence of the critically acclaimed series, and though it’s been a while since it stepped on the court, it’s evident the franchise hasn’t lost its stroke.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has decided to cancel this year’s BlizzCon. The company states the event will return in the future, but it plans to showcase upcoming games in a different manner over the coming months. 
First announced in a blog post, Blizzard plans to share details on upcoming games like World of Warcraft: The War Within and Diablo IV’s Vessel of Hatred expansion at other trade shows, such as Gamescom. The company also plans to launch “multiple, global, in-person events” for Warcraft’s 30th anniversary, which are described as being “distinct” from BlizzCon. 
“Our hope is that these experiences – alongside several live-streamed industry events where we’ll keep you up to date with what’s happening in our game universes – will capture the essence of what makes the Blizzard community so special,” Blizzard states in the blog post.
A Blizzard representative tells Windows Central that Blizzard made the call to cancel BlizzCon and not Microsoft, which completed its acquisition of the company last year. In a statement to the outlet, the representative says, “This is a Blizzard decision. We have explored different event formats in the past, and this isn't the first time we're skipping BlizzCon or trying something new. While we have great things to share in 2024, the timing just doesn’t line up for one single event at the end of the year.”
BlizzCon began in 2005 as an annual convention celebrating all things Blizzard. Last year's show saw the reveal of World of Warcraft’s next expansion, The War Within, as well as two other expansions coming after it. It's good that event is only taking a year off as opposed to being canned for good, and we're curious to see how the alternative events shape up over the coming months.]]></summary>
