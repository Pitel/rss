Today officially marks the end of the 3DS and Wii U eShops. While you'll still be able to download your existing purchases, you can no longer buy or redeem new games from these digital storefronts. Free content including demos are also off limits.
Now that the digital shops have officially entered the shutdown phase in all major parts of the world, Nintendo has released the following messages on these storefronts - reiterating the end of service. Here's the message you'll get on the Wii U, with the same rules applying to the 3DS:

Castlevania is a series so sprawling with so many high peaks that the low valleys kind of really stand out. Except I’ve learned that the valleys aren’t always that deep. You can usually, at least, see the peeks from games like Castlevania Judgement and Castlevania 64. I’ve yet to find a Castlevania title without some merit, even if there are a few that don’t exactly crack my whip. I honestly think that 2010’s Castlevania: Lords of Shadow might be the nadir for me, because I found it to be just so stiflingly boring. I don’t even want to know what the sequel is like.
Castlevania Legends is one that I’ve heard excluded at best and derided at worst. On paper, it has one thing that I’ve wished for in a Castlevania title: a lady-Belmont, but I’m told tha…]]></summary>

Over the years, Resident Evil has repeatedly reinvented itself. Some experiments, like the focus on action-oriented gameplay, haven't always been a hit, though some changes, such as the use of a first-person perspective, have managed to breathe new life into the franchise. In recent times, Resident Evil has been dipping its toes into virtual reality (VR), and the results have been nothing short of phenomenal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[E3 2023 has taken another hit, as Ubisoft has confirmed it will not have a presence at the show. In a statement to Video Games Chronicle, the publisher reveals that it will instead hold its own live presentation on June 12 in Los Angeles. 
The publisher statement to VGC reads “While we initially intended to have an official E3 presence, we’ve made the subsequent decision to move in a different direction, and will be holding a Ubisoft Forward Live event on 12th June in Los Angeles. We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon.”
Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated in February that the company would commit to attending “if E3 happens”. If that's the case, this news certainly doesn’t bode well for the fate of what’s supposed to be E3’s big return. 
As for what Ubisoft could show at its event, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Crew Motorfest, and (maybe) Skull and Bones are slated to release this year. Other announced projects include the long-quiet Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia remakes, a multitude of new Assassin’s Creed games, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. A rumored follow-up to Immortals Fenyx Rising could also make an appearance.  
Ubisoft joins Nintendo on the list of major publishers that have declined to participate in this year’s show, following a previous report that Microsoft and Sony plan to follow suit. E3 is largely organized by ReedPop this year and will take place June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The event will open its doors to fans and press, with separate attendance days for each. It will be the first in-person event since 2019.

It now joins other large video game companies, like Microsoft, in skipping the upcoming E3 event.

It might, at first, seem like Rift of the Necrodancer is going back to rhythm basics. Previous release Crypt of the Necrodancer experimented with a rhythm twist on the roguelite formula to great success, while Rift looks to dive back into the pure rhythm genre. But a combination of great mechanics, variety, and charm all combine to make Rift of the Necrodancer's styles harmonize well.

We got to sit down with a demo of Brace Yourself and Tic Toc Games' Rift of the Necrodancer at PAX East 2023, showing off three different stages of the game. Its core is still rhythm-centric, with extremely good tunes backing the action. The approach, at first, seems like musical routine: slimes roll down the track one beat at a time, and I …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You be changing your mind
VGC is reporting that Ubisoft has decided to back out of E3's attempted return in 2023. This comes a month after they claimed they were finalizing their plans to attend the expo. I suppose those plans are now finalized as being "nope."
Speaking to VGC, a spokesperson reportedly said, "While we initially intended to have an official E3 presence, we’ve made the subsequent decision to move in a different direction, and will be holding a Ubisoft Forward Live event on 12th June in Los Angeles. We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon."
This is disappointing news for anyone who was hoping E3 would return in full form this year after a three-year physical hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic. Sony and Nintendo have both stated they'll be passing on the expo, with Microsoft holding a separate event elsewhere in LA.
While those are hardly the only big companies in the industry today, E3 was once an event that publishers would be crazy to miss. It was the biggest event of the year, and while it's still an important time for announcements, the biggest companies in the business are progressively moving further and further away from it. It seems like the only way it would ever return to form would be if these publishers were lured into the convention center with the promise of cake and locked the doors behind them.
There's still something of a question mark above who's still going to be attending the Electronic Entertainment Expo, with show organizer Reedpop simply saying that "AAA companies, in addition to indie darlings and tech and hardware firms," will be in attendance.
E3 will be running this year from June 13 through 16 in Los Angeles. You can find the whole tentative schedule right over here.

At this weekend's AnimeJapan 2023 expo, publisher Bandai Namco announced a slight rebranding of its upcoming mech adventure, Synduality, which will now be titled Synduality: Echo of Ada. The third-person action RPG is currently in development for PC and Gen 9 consoles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMgOznJOzOo&ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainment
Originally announced during the fall 2022 State of Play presentation, Synduality: Echo of Ada, sees a young woman, existing in a polluted and dystopian future, who makes a living by gathering resources from the inhospitable atmosphere of Amasia. Guiding an A.I. mech, (or "Cradle Coffin"), through the poisonous terrain, players must fight off not only predatory creatures, but also other human players, in a race to bring home the lion's share of precious "AO crystals".
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzwpalvyRas&ab_channel=EMOTIONLabelChannel
A Synduality anime, exploring the lore of the world and its characters, is also in the works. This project has been newly rechristened Synduality: Noir and is expected to premiere in July of this year. A new trailer, which you can check out above, features new footage from the animated series. The video is soundtracked by the anime's theme song "Raytracer", as performed by artist Stereo Dive Foundation.
Synduality will launch on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X later in 2023.

In a developer blog post, Player First Games CEO Tony Huynh explains that since MultiVersus launched in open beta (yes, open beta) last July, players have offered a ton of feedback. The studio feels that the only way to properly implement improvements based on these fan requests is to shut the game down temporarily. Huynh writes,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That's All Folks!
Player First Games has announced that it will be taking its cartoon crossover fighter MultiVersus offline this June — The open beta, which first launched in July of 2022, will be closed down ahead of the title's official launch, which is now tentatively set for "early 2024."
"Throughout our Open Beta, we’ve been working hard to build the best gameplay experience, and we appreciate all of the inspiration you’ve given us. Our Open Beta has been an important learning opportunity for us and a stepping stone to the next phase of MultiVersus."
"We know there’s still a lot of work to do. As a result, we have a clearer view of what we need to focus on, specifically the content cadence of new characters, maps and modes to give you more ways to enjoy the game, along with updated netcode and more matchmaking improvements. We’ll also be reworking the progression system based on your feedback and looking at new ways for you to connect with your friends in the game."
https://twitter.com/multiversus/status/1640383551974825984?s=20
The FAQ notes that all previously purchased content will carry over into the main game, and refunds will not be issued for anything purchased during the beta phase. Following the server closure on June 25, 2023, players will still have access to local Vs. matches and the fighter's training mode, known as "The Lab". Player First Games suggests that the relaunch will see the arrival of new modes, features, and characters.
MultiVersus is available in open beta now until June 25, 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. Player First Games expects to relaunch the title in early 2024.

Because Consumer Softproducts gets by on deliberately mixed messages, and Cruelty Squad as a whole is possibly just one big sick joke, I was honestly not certain if this was real. And by that, I mean many things. I wasn’t sure if this was a real patch. I couldn’t tell if armor was actually non-functional before. And I’m still not certain if this really fixes it.

Dead Island 2 has been a long, long time coming. At 11 years on from the original and a whole history behind it, I went into my PAX East 2023 demo wondering what a new Dead Island would look or play like now, in 2023. The answer, as it turns out, is a lot like the first Dead Island.
How that answer lands for you will depend on, well, how exactly you felt about the preceding entry. Dead Island 2 certainly looks good; it's got some lighting that creates some memorable moments. When I started the demo, my player character was on a beach at night. Fires burned, creating silhouettes of the walkers and runners who were soon going to set themselves on me.
So, anyway, I started swinging.

It was a special edition that came with a code for Wind Waker HD and a gamepad emblazoned with a golden Triforce. For my brother and I, 11 and 13 at the time, respectively, this was a massive deal; we’d spent the last year seeing Wii Us at friends’ houses, yearning for our own, and struggling to explain the difference between it and our current Wii to our parents.
But while it was valuable to us, the Wii U struggled to sell and has ultimately gone down as one of Nintendo’s most disappointing consoles. Today, the system’s eShop shuts down forever, permanently closing a chapter of Nintendo’s history.
I’ll be the first to admit that the rosy lenses of nostalgia heavily tint my memory of the Wii U. It was a formative time in my …]]></summary>

I've had the time of my life finishing the Resident Evil 4 remake. While the efficacy of some of the game's remake-centric choices are up for debate, the gameplay is fantastic. Straight up, it's one of the most fun third person action experiences I've ever had. While living through all of that chaos I came up with some really quick and easy tips, so let's dig in.

Upgrade the knife early
In Resident Evil 4, the knife as you know it has been completely reworked.
Now it can be used to parry attacks (including chainsaw strikes!), stealth kill enemies, and take down foes when they're reeling on the ground. Oh, and you can slash it around like normal too.

That is to say I have none at all, and that any time spent dancing turns me into an uncontrollable set of limbs flailing in the wrong directions. Think Octodad in a night club and you’d be on the right track (although the disastrous limb flailing is enough to keep me out of the clubs).
That lack of rhythm isn’t just native to the dance floor of an awkward family party, though. Even nuzzled into my chair with a controller in hand, I simply can’t stick to the beat. My eyes glued to notes floating across the screen, trying to hit them at just the right time, you’d probably see Time hiding in a corner to my left, giggling at my repeated failure. A barrage of borked bleeps and bungled notes tend to leave me with spirits sunk.
In Hi-Fi Rush, though, I always leave with my head held high.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Samurai Shelldown
The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic The Last Ronin is being adapted into a video game. The surprising but intriguing news was confirmed by Paramount Global's senior vice president for games, Doug Rosen. A developing studio, platforms, or release date was not revealed.
Released in 2020, TMNT: The Last Ronin tells of a single turtle — wearing a black mask and wielding the iconic weaponry of all four Heroes in an Half-Shell — as they pick their way through a dystopian, futuristic take of New York, seeking revenge for their fallen brethren. The identity of the turtle remains something of a mystery until its revelation further in the tale, making The Last Ronin a particularly grim entry to the TMNT pantheon.
According to Rosen, (in comments made to Polygon), the video game adaptation will be a single-player adventure, though other characters will be playable in various flashbacks dotted throughout the story. Rosen makes illusions to The Last Ronin having gameplay similar to Sony Santa Monica's recent God of War releases — likely referencing a dramatic, third-person, combat-heavy escapade. The title is in its very early pre-production stages, so it is understandable at least several years away from release.
While most of the TMNT video games tend to be of the standard brawler/fighter variety, TMNT: The Last Ronin could shape up to be something very different — both tonally and from a gameplay perspective. While fans of The Fab Four await its arrival, they can still find plenty of digital entertainment in the great recent releases TMNT: Shredder's Revenge and TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection.

I'd flirted with the idea for years, but it was the release of BioShock Infinite that finally convinced me to take the plunge. And I can't exactly complain: the series' Rapture arc — made up of the first and second games, plus the prequel novel by none other than John "The Crow" Shirley — now makes up maybe 10% of my personality, having given me two of my favourite video games, my favourite video game tie-in book, and a front-running contender for my favourite video game locale all at once.
I just wish that, after all that prep I did for it, I'd actually liked BioShock Infinite a bit more.

Though we all have stuff we prefer, or series that we serve as the go-to expert on for in-house needs (I think vid bud Liam might actually walk around wearing an ASK ME ABOUT RESIDENT EVIL badge in his day-to-day life), we - unlike the blue-haired neo-Gods of streaming - often can't focus on one game all of the time. You have to know enough about enough to be able to write about enough.
There are, however, a bunch of big important games that I haven't played. Sometimes it's because a bunch of other people have, so that gap in the site's knowledge is already plugged (and I do always make sure to be aware of their impact and basic facts). Other times, they might be games that I'm not really interested in playing, either because they're not my genre or they seem too overwrought. Or, in some cases, it's because everyone says they're really good and I have to try them, though I've been burned before on this method (you people said the same about Ready Player One). But you know what would make me take in info about these games, even if it's just by osmosis? If they all got PowerWash Sim DLCs.

Fireshine Games has announced that ColePowered Games’ sandbox detective game, Shadows of Doubt will be hitting Steam Early Access on April 24, 2023. This follows an impressive demo released for Steam Next Fest this past February.
Shadows of Doubt puts you in the wingtips of a private investigator and lets you loose on a sci-fi city to try and track down a serial killer. You gather evidence, pursue leads, and solve crimes.
https://youtu.be/aUaVPh0-vYs
Early Access is slated to include a case that introduces the game, titled “The Dead of Night,” and a sandbox mode with an endless number of cases. A roadmap should be revealed soon, and the full release is targeting sometime this year.
Destructoid’s resident hair-haver, Eric Van Allen, looked into the demo recently and came away enthused. I think. I heard him get excited, then saw the premise of the game, then became very excited myself. So I haven’t read the article or looked into any more information on the game because I’m so jazzed that I want to stay blind until I can wrap my muscly fingers around it for myself.
I love detective games, and procedural design is great when it’s employed well. ColePowered Games are tackling an extremely ambitious concept with Shadows of Doubt, which won't be easy to pull off. My fingers are tightly crossed that this lives up to it potential.
Shadows of Doubt will release on Steam Early Access for PC on April 24, 2023. The full release is aiming for this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s gonna bug you
Ever since the fateful Pikachu celebration, Pokemon Scarlet & Violet have been on a tear with event content. We just finished a sweet and easy Blissey raid that ran concurrently with the fight against Decidueye, and already our next 7-Star challenge is on the horizon.
https://twitter.com/Pokemon_cojp/status/1640141589757452293
Via the official Japanese Pokemon Twitter account, Samurott will join Paldea from March 31st to April 2nd. These dates are based on UTC, so the event will go live by 8:00pm Eastern Time on March 30th. Samurott continues the tradition of introducing a starter from a previous game as a 7-Star event, this time giving Generation 5 some love. As usual, you’ll only be able to catch one Samurott while the encounter is live. Of course, you can continue to run the fight to help friends and farm materials.
Samurott will feature the Bug Tera Type, giving us early insight into what Pokemon will work best as counters. Flying-Type Pokemon should excel here, as they are effective against bugs while taking neutral damage from Water-Type attacks. Samurott will almost assuredly be a physical attacker, as it can’t learn any Bug-Type moves that scale with Special Attack. That said, it could be a mixed attacker similar to Greninja. We won’t know for sure until the event goes live.
If you can’t challenge Samurott, the encounter will rerun the following week from April 7th to April 9th. Walking Wake and Iron Leaves will also return soon, so stay tuned as we learn more about the upcoming event schedule for Pokemon Scarlet & Violet.

You replace pollution with lush life across a series of four randomly generated dioramas (plus four slightly more complicated challenge levels), covering the landscape in fynbos and forests, lichen and lagoons. When it all comes together and you can look over the fruits of your labour, birds chirping and piano melodically playing in the background, it’s beautiful. Getting to that point, though, is an often repetitive experience marred with frustration.

The Resident Evil 4 remake has a ton of little details that fans of the original will love, but this one really shocked me, and has some neat little implications for the village encounter early in the game. Light spoilers follow for one of the most iconic moments in RE4.
[caption id="attachment_370853" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
Snipe the bell yourself in the village, and the townsfolk will shuffle off
A hat tip to Twitter user Denzel (who credits Reddit users Sorekasho and Tactical_Banter) for sharing this little tidbit, which is one of the coolest things I've seen in the Resident Evil 4 remake thus far.
If you climb up on a rooftop in the village fight, you can snipe the bell that rings later in the encounter to signal its end. Hitting it early like this will immediately stop the fight, saving you tons of resources in the process. Note that this is ostensibly reserved for NG+ (New Game+) runs, as you will not have access to a rifle with a scope at this point in the game.
[gallery size="large" ids="370260,370851,370852"]
To do it yourself, just head into the building that triggers the chainsaw guy cutscene, and dive out of the window on the right at the top of the stairs. Then aim at the bell (we have a clear screenshot in the gallery above, which is behind some trees) and snipe it. Look for the weathervane on top of the building to center yourself. Done!
We tried it ourselves (as you can see in the gallery above) and yep: it works! It even can be triggered in Professional mode, mind. You're then free to loot the village entirely afterward and save a ton of resources.

Despite the fact that we've gotten multiple trailers over the past few months, Nintendo has yet to reveal any clip of gameplay longer than a few seconds, and every new glimpse seems to raise more questions than it answers. What are those strange vehicles? Does Link have a new paraglider? And why does the game cost $70? Whether or not tomorrow's showcase addresses those questions, we'll all find out when Tears of the Kingdom releases on May 12.
We'll be live streaming our reactions to the 10 minutes showcase on Game Informer's Twitch channel.]]></summary>

Valve's tactical shooter Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has smashed its own concurrent player record for the third time in just two months — This past weekend saw CS:GO pull in over 1.5 million players on Steam, beating a record set just a fortnight ago by almost 50,000 players.
According to the figures on Steamdb, 1,519,457 squaddies leapt into action on March 25, beating the peak player count of 1,470,183 recorded on Saturday, March 11, and further surpassing the previous record of 1,308,963 recorded back in February. And while CS:GO has never truly ever entered an era of unpopularity in its near two decades of operation, the reason behind this sudden resurgence is quite clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExZtISgOxEQ&ab_channel=Valve
Just five days ago, Valve finally confirmed the recent whispers that Counter-Strike was in line to receive a long-awaited upgrade, bringing technical improvements and mechanical overhauls to the tactical shooter's aging engine. Titled Counter-Strike 2, (though the project is more of an upgrade rather than an actual sequel), the free, Source 2-powered release will feature redesigned maps, a U.I. upgrade, improved ballistics, and new, further immersive effects for elements such as smoke, shadows, and light.
Valve has already confirmed that all statistics and gear from current CS:GO accounts will be carried over into the new edition. A release date was not announced, but the update is expected to roll out this summer, with limited testing windows made available to players in the meantime. You can check out the full details for Counter-Strike 2 over on the official website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead good.
In 2019, Magic Design Studios—a new team comprised of many ex-Ubisoft staff—put out the Rayman-esque Unruly Heroes, which we thought was a great platformer with some amazing visuals. For the next few years, the team went quiet while working on its next game, revealed in late 2021 as Have A Nice Death, a tough action roguelite about the grim reaper. Since then, it’s been gradually baking in early access on Steam and now that it finally reached 1.0 status, it’s received a console-exclusive release on Switch. We’re happy to report that the developer has succeeded with its sophomore outing; Have a Nice Death is an enjoyable and addictive experience that roguelite fans should take note of.
It places you in the role of Death himself, who has grown tired of the hard graft involved in harvesting souls for millennia. To take the weight off his shoulders, he decides to start a corporation to hire various ghouls and ghosts to do the work for him while he can distantly manage affairs from a comfy executive office. For years, Death enjoys putting his feet up and letting the Kafkaesque organization do its thing while he just rubber stamps the paperwork that comes across his desk, but matters begin to get out of hand when the admin rises to ridiculous levels. It turns out that Death delegated too many tasks; all the beings he appointed to oversee transitions to the afterlife have gotten much too trigger-happy and have been going way over quota. Death thus picks up his old scythe and begins a little corporate restructuring, setting out on a journey through every floor of every department to aggressively lay off his misbehaving staff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rod Humble has his son to thank for his upcoming life sim Life By You. After finishing up work on two successful mobile games around four years ago, Humble was itching for something new. But he wasn't quite sure what. "I was in the kitchen talking to my son about, 'Oh, what should I do? I don't know what opportunities there are,' and he was like, 'Why don't you just pick the company you want to work at and ask them?'" And as a life-long Crusader Kings player, the answer was clear. "Okay!?" Humble says incredulously. "I can do that, I guess. So I did. I wrote to [PR manager] Troy [Goodfellow], and he knew Fred [Wester, CEO], and that was it. It was two weeks later and I met him in San Francisco and said, hey, I'd like to start a studio, and here's the way I'd like to run it. And he was like, sure, let's go for it."
So began Humble's journey to creating Life By You, his upcoming life simulator that's set to give his former pet project, The Sims, a run for its money. With The Sims 5, or Project Rene as it's currently known, still some way off, Life By You seems poised to finally give life sim fans the game they've always wanted. "I wanted to make an open world life simulator where the core tenant was freedom," says Humble. "Where players could freely play and tell their stories with minimal friction." And what was standing in the way of that freedom? Loading screens, says Humble.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I keep alternating between wanting to play more and feeling weary at the prospect. While that might sound bad, it arguably means that it's balanced an appealing strategic challenge with the grinding theme of trench warfare.
The Great War Colon Western Front is about taking the Triple Alliance or Entente through the hell years of 1914-18, or beyond.

Kumazaki was at the San Francisco-based conference along with expert director Tatsuya Kamiyama to celebrate the pink puffball's 30th anniversary, and the two of them provided the goods (via Nintendo Everything).

The files state that the “severity” is “high”, the “version” is “2”, but what about the “priority?” Bad news for fans of the run-and-gunning zombie shooter: according to the files, the priority is “none.”

It appears that the mega-popular rougelite Dead Cells might be preparing to make its native debut on Gen 9 platforms, as a new listing on the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) points to a PS5 port of the award-winning release — which first launched on PC and consoles in the summer of 2018.
As noted by Gematsu this past weekend, the new edition is seemingly named Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania Edition, which suggests that it will launch on PS5 with all post-release content intact, including expansions The Bad Seed, Update of Plenty, and the recent crossover DLC, Return to Castlevania. As to whether this new edition will feature any technical boost, we will simply have to wait until publisher Playdigious shows its hand.
https://twitter.com/gematsu/status/1639901111799672832?s=20
Back in 2018, Dead Cells received praise across the board from critics and players, scoring close to full marks from a number of websites and outlets (including our own). The 2D fantasy adventure sees a mysterious protagonist known as "The Prisoner" battle their way across a monster-infested island on a quest to slay its monarch. With a fantastic, old-school aesthetic, fluid movement and combat, and a surprisingly deep challenge, Dead Cells won over an army of fans in a flash, and is still building upon its audience today, almost five years on from release.
Dead Cells is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and mobile platforms.

The Wii U and 3DS eShops are closing today, Monday 27th March.
The North American stores will be closing at 5:00 PM PT / 8:00 PM ET according to Nintendo (which works out to 1:00 AM BST / 2:00 AM CET on Tue 28th March in Europe, although no specific closure hour is given for European stores — we'd get in there sooner rather than later to avoid disappointment).

[Update: Microsoft has responded to the reports that it canned a PS5 edition of Redfall in comments to Eurogamer.
"We haven't pulled any games from PlayStation," said an MS spokesperson. "In fact, we've expanded our footprint of games that we've shipped on Sony's PlayStation since our acquisition of ZeniMax, and the first two games we shipped after closing were PlayStation 5 exclusives. We did the same thing since our closing of Minecraft as we extended the reach of that franchise.

While many are rightly lamenting the upcoming death of the 3DS eShop, we feel like fewer gamers are pouring one out for the Wii U digital store. Maybe it's just us, but we can't let that stand, as the console actually had some darn good games — some of which are still exclusives to this day. Nintendo's GamePad concept may not have paid off with the public, but it did give developers some fun ideas.

The 3DS eShop is closing down, after over a decade of service. It's not a huge surprise, but it is a huge bummer, because that means that we only have until 27th March 2023 to purchase some of the best games on the console — the ones that were only ever available on the 3DS eShop.

The demise of the 3DS and Wii U eShops has had many of us reminiscing on the days not too long ago when those digital stores were in their prime — as well as firing those stores up on their respective consoles to make sure we have all the games we want before they disappear for good on 27th March.

After spending twenty glorious minutes with its colourful demo at PAX East, I was keen to chat to creative director Steve Jimenez about the team's inspirations, the challenges of translating wrestling into a turn-based RPG and the  exciting locations that players will attempt to liberate from a group of devious heels.

We then had a chance to go hands on with the PAX East demo, and wow, we were both incredibly impressed. Watch the video below for our enthusiastic impressions:
If we could give an RPS 'Bestest Best in show' award to a game, is would be Animal Well. Liam and I loved the game's dense atmosphere, spider-web of interconnected caverns, and creepy creatures that lurk in the dark. We also loves the effects the game has, which reminded Liam of Octopath Traveler's visual flairs. If I had to compare it to one game, it would be Hollow Knight, which is very exciting.
We have plenty more PAX East indies for you to check out so make sure you have a peruse through our RPS@PAX tag. A couple of our favourites have been chaotic rouguelite Pizza Possum, Resident Evil-like Alone In The Dark, and island exploration game Mythwrecked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Show me a game about a feral, furry creature with a never ending hunger for junk food and I'm immediately interested. I played Pizza Possum on the first day of PAX and knew it would make a great indie highlight for our time here at PAX East. Liam and I have now both played the demo and you can listen to our impressions in the video below:
What really appealed to us about Pizza Possum is how chaotic it is. It's like Untitled Goose Game but at double the speed. Playing the eponymous possum, you need you scamper around a sunny Mediterranean town scoffing as much food as you can get your grubby mitts on.
There's an element of hide-and-seek too, as there are patrol dogs who will try and stop your food eating rampage, but you can quickly jump into a berry bush to thorw them off your scent. It's goofy fun, and we're completeley smitten with it.

Melon Journey: Bittersweet Memories really caught our eye earlier this month with its lovely green Game Boy-style visuals and weird, wonderful characters. So we knew we had to get our hands on it at PAX East.
And that's exactly what we did. The lovely Zion and Austin, who are both representing us at the event, headed over to XSEED Games' booth to have a look at this narrative mystery adventure. We've got some hands-on gameplay to show you, as well as our early thoughts and impressions on this bittersweet, melon-choly journey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Liam and I had a fun time chatting with the folks over at Mega Cat Studios about their upcoming wrestling RPG WrestleQuest last year at PAX West, and this time at PAX East we finally cornered them in the ring for a proper interview.
Watch below to learn about how the developers created their zero to hero story, how they're addressing myths and persaonl issues in the world of pro wresting, as well as sharing a story about how one of the team got their nose broken in a wrestling accident during development.
My main take away from the interview is how much of the RPG incorporates all aspects of Wrestling, not just the ring fights we see on TV. Another interesting thing is that Mega Cat reached out to a handful of real-life wrestlers to ask their permission to use their likeness in the game - not an easy feat to secure, I'm sure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've played a bunch of indie game demos at PAX East, but none left my head reeling as much as 43 Studios' fiendishly frantic action platfotmer Hell Of An Office. It's a super fast parkour adventure in the vein of Neon White, and after ten minutes with the demo my heart race was through the roof. If I owned a fitbit it would have been screaming at me to have a nice sit down with a cuppa. Check out my full impressions in the video below:
Hell Of An Office puts your platforming reflexes to the test as you're tasked with sprinting ad jumping your way straight outta hell. With only a stapler as your means of survival, you need to navigate through each level before it slowly sinks into the burning lava. React quickly, or fall victim to Hell's scorching pools.
If you love the blood-pumping, sweaty palm inducing action-platforming of Neon White, make sure to keep an eye on Hell Of An Office as it makes it's way through Early Access.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really enjoyed dark fantasy adventure Roki when it first released back in 2020, and keen to see what developers Polygon Treehouse have gotten up to since, I jumped at the opportunity to play the PAX East demo for Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island. You can watch my impressions of the demo in the video below:
In Mythwrecked you play as Alex, a backpacker who has washed up on the sun-drenched shores of Ambrosia Island. As she begins exploring, she soon realises that this island seems to be a hot spot for the gods from ancient Greek myths. Your task is to befriend each god, help them restore their memories, and find a way back to civilisation.
From playing the demo, you can see much of what made Roki fun reflected in Mythwrecked. The environments are interesting to poke around in, puzzles are breezy brain ticklers, and it has Polygon Treehouse's sense of humour. Each Greek god has a humerous twist on their lore,  and during the demo I had a fun time chatting with Hermes, who is dressed in nothing more than a pair of skimpy white speedos and a matching white sweat band - a bold choice of attire.

With the success of Castlevania and the Cyberpunk Edgerunners anime series, it is clear that game anime adaptations are worth investing in. They can heighten a franchise’s standing among the mass audience and attract new fans to each game.
Castlevania and Cyberpunk Edgerunners elevated the worlds they were based on. They had unique art styles, engaging characters, and intriguing storylines that should inspire any game anime adaptation. Here are a few we’d love to see follow in that same pattern.

This week's Arcade Archives addition is a real forgotten gem, and sees Hamster reach well into the past to deliver Taito's unique and mythical platformer Bonze Adventure to PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Originally released to the arcade market in 1989, before later finding fame in a successful PC Engine port, Bonze Adventure, (or Jigoku Meguri in its native Japan), sees a Buddist monk venture into the bowels of the underworld itself in order to confront its monarch, King Emma, who has gone a little bit doolally and has thus lost control of Hell's denizens, which are escaping into the human realm.
Check out the action in the video below, from no less than Hamster Corporation itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1jszprGlQ&ab_channel=HAMSTERCorporation
The surprisingly holy adventure sees Bonze venture through Emma's domain, defending himself with powered Buddist "Mala" beads, and warding off an array of demons, monsters, ghosts, spiders, and other creepy enemies and he picks his ways through a variety of glum, but strangely cute, environments. Several powerups can be gathered, and help is occasionally provided by an arriving Deva. A neat mechanic sees time represented by a series of melting candles. Despite its success, both in arcades and on the PC Engine, Bonze Adventure would fall into relative obscurity, not receiving any sequels.
Bonze Adventure is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Join us for another PAX East game highlight straight from the show floor, and this time we decided to revisit a cult horror classic: Alone In The Dark. This psychological horror is being developed by Pieces Interactive with publishing backing from THQ Nordic and is a love letter to the original game released back in the 90s.
As someone who had played the original, and RPS' Resident Evil uber fan, Liam decided to check out the demo and you can hear his impressions in the video below:
According to the devs at the THQ booth, this demo is a stand-alone prequel story that will not be in the final game, but shares the same eerie atmosphere and action that'll be in the main game. This reimagining is set in the Gothic American south and in the main game you'll be playing as Edward Carnby or Emily Hartwood as they navigate the monster infested Derceto Manor, the same mansion featured in the demo.

I had the chance to sit down with the demo and play KO_OP's teen dino adventure first hand. Check out the video below if you're interested to know what I thought:
Goodbye Volcano High follows a group of teen dinos as they begin their senior year of highschool. It's part coming-of-age visual novel part rhythm game as the group try to grapple with school while also trying to make it big as up-and-coming musicians.
I had a great time with the demo, and it looks like we won't have to wait long for the full release at Goodbye Volcano High is launching on Steam and PlayStation on June 15th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's almost become an RPS tradition to search the show floor at PAX events and find the coolest stuff and highlight it in a video, so that's exactly what we've done at PAX East. There's a lot of cool booths, fun props, and generally weird stuff to see, so we've chosen our absolute favourites and have listed them in video form for your viewing pleasure.
Everything at PAX East is situated in one massive hall (instead of PAX West's multiple floors, rooms, and buildings) so it's nice and easy to see everything in one or two loops. It doesn't feel cramped at all, even with Friday's busy crowds, and the booths are as spectacular as ever.
Some of our favourites included Devolver Digital's movie theatre-inspired booth, which has the new addition of a candle-lit shrine for Cult Of The Lamb's upcoming free expansion Relics Of The Old Faith. We also loved Ysbryd Games' Demonschool booth which had a school desk layout and cool retro TV. Another favourite was the animated robot dinosaur (complete with rideable saddle) that we found at the Roots Of Pacha demo builds.

To know that a game heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger will feature music from the man behind its score is exciting. Still, it is worth being excited for the soundtrack that Mitsuda will not be directly involved with, as well.
The majority of Sea of Stars’ soundtrack is in the hands of the talented Eric W. Brown, who also composed the soundtrack for The Messenger. Brown’s musical history started with playing drums in metal bands. “I've been a drummer since I was a kid and I'm still a drummer now, but, you know, I got into music production via chiptune essentially,” Brown says.  Around 2006 he decided to focus on making music on his own in the chiptune genre, primarily on Game…]]></summary>

Capcom has fully revealed the launch roster for its exciting-looking fighter Street Fighter 6, offering us an 18-strong cast of new and familiar faces, (with a few more fighters already waiting in the wings). It's a wicked cast, and the buzz surrounding newcomers such as Marisa, Kimberly, and Jamie seems more fervent among the community than usual, which is a great sign for the new generation.
The overall World Warrior cast is huge, however, and unfortunately, not everybody can make the cut. But it's always fun to speculate, and even more fun to see your article splashed on Reddit with people angrily sulking about your opinion.

Sora has enlisted the help of many Disney and Final Fantasy characters over the years, and Kingdom Hearts summons have provided a great way for players to get the upper hand on the Heartless and Nobodies. With Tinkerbell giving constant healing, and Peter Pan lifting Sora off the ground for some aerial attacks, there were plenty of awesome summons to pool from in order to create this list.
While not all Kingdom Hearts summons are useful (we're looking at you, Chicken Little), plenty of them can greatly assist Sora and his friends, both offensively and defensively.
Here are the seven best Kingdom Hearts summons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everybody do the side-step
A new video from developer Arika appears to tease an update in the works for cult fighting title Fighting EX Layer — The video, which sees Fatal Fury's Terry Bogard facing off against FEXL's Allen Snider was released by the developer ahead of Japan's EVO 2023 tournament, which takes place in April.
The key reasoning behind the new video seems a little obscure as of this writing, though said video was followed up by a newer, better-looking version — suggesting that Arika is currently working on something in regards to the Street Fighter EX spin-off title. The most notable moment of this video sees Allen Snider perform several side steps, Tekken-style. This seems to suggest that a "Dodge" ability might be in the works — which would add a 3D element to the 2.5D fighter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-lMEydK10o&t
A brief note accompanying the video references EVO Japan, and also asks fans to be patient with the quality of the video and its effects. The summary of this confusing content drop appears to suggest that Arika has something to show us at EVO Japan 2023, and that it might be a Fighting EX Layer update, complete with new mechanics and, potentially, tweaked visuals and special effects. Of course, we will be sure to give you all a heads-up once Arika's plan has been properly explained.
Fighting EX Layer launched on PS4 in the summer of 2018. Following a series of free post-release characters, the title would be successful enough to encourage Arika to develop a PC port later that year. In 2021, a complete edition titled Fighting EX Layer Another Dash was released for Nintendo Switch.

Epic Games has revealed the next title that it will be offering up to all Epic Games Store users — From March 30, EGS customers will be able to bag themselves the charming and challenging brawler roguelike, Tunche, completely free of charge.
Released in the fall of 2021 and developed by Peruvian indie outfit LEAP Game Studios, Tunche is a unique blend of screen-based brawler action, married to a challenging roguelike format. It is the tale of an Amazonian tribe who must venture through the rainforest on a pilgrimage to meet the titular jungle god and learn the truth behind a strange and overwhelming aggression that has become part of the flora and fauna of the green labyrinth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAn7fPiyrZA&ab_channel=ID%40Xbox
Choosing from one of five unique characters, including the sorcerer, Rumi; the balladeer, Pancho; scrappy bird-boy Quayru; and the beautiful warrior, Nayru — alongside a suspiciously quiet Kid wearing a large Hat — the player must complete run after run through the undergrowth, taking on armies of wild animals, bizarre creatures, and boss characters while progressing their chosen character's inate abilities. Tunche features beautiful hand-drawn animation, a distinct art style, and an evocative soundtrack, all while posing a meaty challenge for even hardened brawler fans. If you want the full lowdown, then be sure to check out my full review for Tunche right here.
Tunche will be available to download free from Epic Games Store from March 30-April 6. Until then, you still have time to pick up current freebiesChess Ultra and the WoW: Ishizuchi DLC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perfect Blue Velvet
As part of yesterday's Future Games Show presentation, Shiro Unlimited released a new trailer for its gooey psychological horror title Decarnation — In addition, the publisher announced that the title will launch on PC and Nintendo Switch at some point this coming May.
Described as an "intensely emotional story unfolding in a malignant, elaborate setting", Decarnation uses lo-fi visuals to tell the tale of a Parisian cabaret dancer, Gloria, who is struggling to find her big break, held back by a litany of problems related to her life and career. When a seemingly can't-miss opportunity comes her way, Gloria finally realizes that this could be her chance to pull the fraying ends of her life together. But the human mind does not always allow for the best-laid plans, and Gloria's spiraling emotions may be about to manifest themselves very real-world nightmares.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmeL6rfuJS8&ab_channel=ShiroGames%7CUnlimited
Decarnation will blend dramatic role-playing elements with puzzle action and elements of survival to create a uniquely creepy, brain-bending experience. With clear stylistic influences coming from the works of directors such as Satoshi Kon and David Lynch, as well as the familiar trappings of the giallo genre, Decarnation doesn't look like it will be standard "OMG Zombies!" horror title — instead reaching a little deeper into the darkness of the human soul, as it twists and bends to deal with the realities of the living, and unloving world.
I'm keeping several eyes on this... including the ones growing out of my arms.
Decarnation launches this May on Nintendo Switch and PC (via Steam).

Today sees the release of Capcom's long-awaited Resident Evil 4 remake, which launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms after much hype and hoopla — And it seems that the title is already seeing top-tier levels of success, setting the series' best-ever player record on PC gaming dashboard, Steam.
According to the Steam database, an amazing 140,240 players were simultaneously logged in and making their way through the Uroboros-infested nightmare earlier today. This number represents the highest amount of Steam user concurrently playing any Resident Evil release at any one time, including previous remakes Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3, as well as modern mainline sequels Resident Evil VII: Biohazard and Resident Evil Village.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj9UeZzp12o&ab_channel=ResidentEvil
Clearly, the nostalgia factor of the original Resident Evil 4 — still considered a series highlight some 18 years on from its initial GameCube release — will help drive the new 2023 edition to incredible success. The launch of the highly anticipated title is set to kick off what is expected to be a stellar year for Capcom, with dinosaur hunter Exoprimal and the stellar-looking Street Fighter 6 waiting in the wings for the coming quarters. The publisher will no doubt be quick to let us all know how RE4's week one sales work out, as players don the sheepskin coat of Leon S. Kennedy for another trip into a living hell.
Resident Evil 4 is available now on PlayStation, PC (Steam), and Xbox Series X. The additional Mercenaries mode will arrive as a free update on April 7.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Imagine someone saying ‘We need you to make a trailer for our movie, but we've only got half of the sets and props ready…” says Tim Bevan de Lange, Creative Director at Realtime Nordic, a studio that makes, specifically, video game trailers. “...and we haven’t actually shot anything, so you’ll need to do that yourself. Some of the actors won't come out of their trailers. One of them will but if you shoot him from the front you realise he's got no eyes, but don't show the audience that. It's not intentional, he's getting them fixed. Also can you film it twice, for different streaming platforms? Make a really good version for Netflix and a slightly worse looking one for Quibi.”


Every so often a game trailer comes along that makes me think, hang on, that was bloody brilliant! I bet some people made that! Most recently it was Creative Assembly’s Immortal Empires trailer. Well, I’ve been digging around and I’m happy to report that yes, although I’m the first one to just see a trailer as an algorithm trying to snatch my coin purse away like a manure-encrusted Victorian ne’er-do-well, game trailers are made by humans. They're often humans who do it as as specific job, either in-house at a developer or as an outside agency like Realtime Nordic. Enlightened and enthralled, I asked some of them about what went into the strange space that is making the trailers for your favourite games.

It's partly the tone: a compelling blend of gothic and biomechanical horror, with a 90s game boy goriness that's cartoony enough to feel colourful rather than repulsive. "Camp" isn't the right word, but a hint of melodrama gives the story severity without self-seriousness. I mean, within the first minute of the game, your soldier goes from a terrified Normandy-style amphibious assault on a fortified metal church to seeing their war made irrelevant when the moon explodes. The whole thing is kind of metal, to be honest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You DO know Jack
You know the name, and you could've predicted the number — Bandai Namco has released another character trailer for its great-looking fighter Tekken 8, this time focusing on the return of one of the franchise's longest-"living" characters: the destructive battle droid, Jack-8.
Jack, as Tekken fans will be fully aware, is essentially the name of numerous characters in the Tekken series, essentially depicted as newly upgraded versions of the original Mishima Zaibatsu robo-soldier. While each successive game has seen Jack's visual style and overall sense of technical reliability improve, the character has consistently been a heavy power hitter, taking down his opponents with huge, clubbing blows and an increasingly ridiculous range of weaponry and firepower. Let's take a look at Jack-8.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b4MyA6wPJI&ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica
From this first glance, Tekken 8's Jack-8 model looks incredibly — dare I say — "Cyber", somehow sporting a more futuristic design while still being oddly archaic in design. Still, despite his new look, our favorite metal man is still more than capable of flattening the opposition with the aforementioned haymakers and axhandles — given an extra boost in the form of explosive detonations on impact. To call it a day, Jack-8 calls in a ridiculously oversized energy cannon, wiping out the enemy, (and almost himself), with a devastating beam of raw power, not dissimilar to Iron Man's Proton Cannon from Marvel vs. Capcom.
Tekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch in 2023. Be sure to check out the previous trailers for Jin Kazama, Kazuya Mishima, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, and Lars Alexandersson. We only need see the returning Jun Kazama and the opening salvo of the sequel's roster is complete.

A Kansas court has settled the 2017 case in which a Witchita resident was shot dead by a police detective after officers responded to a fake "hostage situation" taking place at the man's house — the result of a "swatting" incident perpetrated by Tyler Barriss and concerning Call of Duty players Shane Gaskill and Casey Viner.
On the evening of December 28, 2017, 28-year-old Andrew Finch was at the house owned by his mother when he noticed police lights flashing directly outside of the residence. Opening the door to investigate the commotion, Finch was shot dead moments later by police detective Justin Rapp. Tragically, Finch was not remotely connected to the incidents that had led the police to his front door that fateful night.

It comes from Build A Rocket Boy, the studio founded by ex-GTA boss Leslie Benzies, and despite its cryptic reveal trailer, AliceB theorised it was some kind of Robloxlike. Turns out her hunch was correct - Everywhere is a platform that allows players to create their own custom content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Resident Evil 4 remake is a mostly cool runner on desktops, and good news if you’re recently picked up a certain handheld PC in the sales: its Steam Deck performance is alright too. Maybe not to the battery-sipping, framerate-abundant extent of the very best Steam Deck games, but with the right settings, nu-Resi 4 can keep its burlap sacked head well above 30fps even in its most visually demanding scenes.

Still, twelve maulings, three beheadings, and one chainsaw disembowelment later, I’ve got enough of a handle on Leon S. Kennedy’s disappointing Spanish holiday to help you get the most out of the new model’s PC performance. Including a guide to its best settings, which can especially help on lower-end rigs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's Game Developers Choice and IGF Award ceremonies were really heartening stuff. Getting to see so many great developers have their games celebrated by their peers will always warm the old cockles, especially when we celebrated so many of them in our own RPS Advent Calendar at the end of last year. Well, I say 'see'. In truth, I was tucked away backstage at this year's IGF and GDC Awards, clutching my dictaphone with a single question in mind: if each winner had to give away their award to another game in their category, who would it be and why?   
It's an idea Brendan (RPS in peace) came up with back in the primordial mists of 2018, and it was so good I just had to knick it and do it again. It might be cruel to wrench these awards away so soon after receiving them, but it's all in the name of spreading good vibes and extra shoutouts, I promise. So here are the games of the year 2022, according to the people who just won awards for games of the year 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's day one of PAX East and what better way to kick off our show coverage than highlighting a great indie game! We first came across Demonschool back at PAX West last year and have loved it ever since. It's a slick, tactical Persona-like where you play as a band of university students navigating school life by day and beating up ghosties and ghoulies by night.
I had a chat with Demonschool's Jenna Stoeber who talked me through what Demonschool is about, the game's many horror inspirations, and what spooky shinanigans players can expect. If the giant skeleton lad in the game's trailer and demo is anything to go by, we're in for a treat. You can watch the full interview by watching the video below:

If you've haven't yet, set your peepers on Demonschool's slick trailer to see what demon hunter Faye and her gang of misfits are up against. There's no concrete release date, but like Jenna said, Demonschool should be out sometime in 2023 with a playable demo available in May.
We've got plenty more interviews, demos, and highlights lined up for the rest of the week and you can find all our PAX East coverage by checking out our RPS@PAX tag.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Men Of War 2 doesn't do anything by half measures, as I discovered during a recent tussle with its online multiplayer modes. Whereas Relic's recently released Company Of Heroes 3 will let you pick from its four broad faction types in its WWII RTS battles, Men Of War 2 takes a much more granular view, offering up 14-15 different unit types for each of its three playable nations. That's a dizzying array of infantry, tank and artillery battalions to choose from, and that's before you account for all the individual nuances between its Soviet, USA and German army types. Throw in seven game modes across several different maps, and it's a veritable strategy smorgasbord to stuff your face into. 
Crucially, though, everyone gets access to some sort of tank, which let's face it, is always going to be the MVP of any WW2 strategy game, and probably the sole reason why we're here in the first place. As Men Of War 2 heads into its first open multiplayer tech test on Steam today (running until March 27th), here's my full report of my mildly doomed multiplayer tankventures in its Combat, Front Line and Incursion modes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A video game based on the hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel The Last Ronin is in the works, Polygon reports.
The news comes from Polygon's interview with Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global. According to Rosen, The Last Ronin video game will be a single-player action role-playing title in the vein of the Norse-themed God of War series. Like the story it adapts, the game will feature a mature tone. The game’s developer has not been named, and the project is years away from release. 
The Last Ronin was published in 2020 as a five-issue mini-series by IDW. It takes place in a dark futuristic New York, where three of the four turtles have been killed. The surviving turtle, whose identity is revealed at the end of the first issue (we won’t spoil it), dons a black mask and seeks revenge by fighting crime using both his and the weapons of his fallen brothers. 
It’s a cool (and very grim) story if you haven’t read it, and we’re excited to see it translated into a game. Rosen also mentions in the same interview that Paramount sees opportunities to create different types of TMNT games that target young and adult audiences. 
The Turtles are enjoying quite the renaissance lately thanks to the launch of the well-received beat ‘em up Shredder’s Revenge last year, the nostalgia trip of the Cowabunga Collection, a Shredder-themed Call of Duty pack, and even a new animated film coming to theaters this August.

After 20 years of support, however, Square Enix is putting Final Fantasy 11 in maintenance mode, meaning servers will stay up and it’ll remain playable, but with limited support.

In 2021, however, it was delayed to 2022. In May of last year, Daedalic revealed Gollum would release in September but then, in July, announced it had been delayed once more. Now, today, Daedalic has revealed that Gollum will finally be released this May. 
More specifically, Gollum will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on May 25. There will be a Switch version of the game, but Daedalic says it's planned for later this year. Alongside today's news, Daedalic has released a new story trailer. Check it out below: 


"The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is a story-driven action adventure," a press release reads. "Embark on a perilous journey as Gollum, chasing the only thing that is precious to you. Climb, leap, and sneak your way past dangers or into advantageous spots. Gollum is skillful and sly, and torn by a split personality. It is up to you to decide whether to yield to the darker side of Gollum or trust the kinder gentler hint of Sméagol." 
Check out some new screenshots from the game below: 

For more about The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, check out this trailer highlighting the game's supporting cast and then check out this trailer featuring some of the game's stealth-based gameplay. Watch this trailer showing off the game's parkour gameplay after that.

I’ve been a fan of Arkane Studios’ rich single-player worlds for years. Naturally, I had questions about Redfall’s position in the developer’s portfolio. However, after interviewing Studio Head Harvey Smith and playing the game for 90 minutes, I have the answers I was looking for – and I’m excited to share it all in this week’s episode of The Game Informer Show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Sonic Origins celebrated Sonic the Hedgehog's birthday by gathering Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD in one place with new features and some added bonuses. Despite some shortcomings, the compilation remains the best official way to experience those classic games from Genesis and Sega CD three decades following their original releases. Today, Sega announced the bundle is about to get better through Sonic Origins Plus, a premium upgrade that arrives a year after the collection's initial launch.
Sonic Origins Plus brings forward all the features of Sonic Origins delivered last year – Classic Mode, Anniversary Mode, widescreen support, added story animations, a virtual museum, and more – while adding a bunch of new content. First up, Sonic Origins Plus adds all 12 Sonic Game Gear games to the museum.
The full list of Game Gear games getting added is listed below.
Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine
Sonic Blast
Sonic Chaos
Sonic Drift
Sonic Drift 2
Sonic Labyrinth
Sonic Spinball
Sonic the Hedgehog
Sonic the Hedgehog 2
Sonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble
Tails Adventure
Tails' Sky Patrol
On top of that, Amy joins the roster of playable characters in the Genesis and Sega CD titles (Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD). One of the strangest exclusions in the original Sonic Origins release is also rectified, as Knuckles will become playable in Sonic CD. Sadly, this first press release does not make any mention of restoring the replaced music in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.


Sonic Origins Plus arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 23. If you don't already own the initial release of Sonic Origins, the digital version of Sonic Origins Plus costs $40. The physical version, which includes a 20-page artbook and reversible coversheet with new art, also costs $40. If you already own Sonic Origins, you can upgrade to Plus for $10.

The real-time tactical shooter pits a squad of marines against dozens of deadly xenomorphs, though we hadn't seen any gameplay footage until the release of a new video today.
A gameplay commentary video walks players through the basics, in which players command a team of marines to investigate a xenomorph outbreak on Moon Lethe. You’ll issue commands for teammates to attack or execute skills and can also slow time during firefights to select orders. However, your squadmates can perish permanently, but you can raise your survival odds by outfitting soldiers with various weapons and upgrades to ensure the best team composition.


Aliens: Dark Descent is being devleoped by Tindalos Interactive, makers of the Battlefleet Gothic: Armada series, and will be published by Focus Entertainment. It arrives on June 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something terrible lurks beneath the waves in Dredge. Actually, scratch that. There are a lot of terrible things that call the oceans of The Marrows home in this melancholy fishing adventure, but what they are, I couldn't possibly tell you. In all my hours sailing these cursed waters, I've only ever seen brief flashes of them - their ungodly, slippery masses, long spiny fins, and a dozen different combinations of glowing eyes, teeth and tentacles. They're forever fading in and out of view, cloaked by the thick fog that blankets the sea every evening. Sometimes your ship lights will catch them for a split second before they slip away, or maybe you'll only hear them hurtling toward you, with a scream of a jet engine and a maw that's white hot, ready for gnashing your flimsy wooden carcass into sawdust. 
It's unnerving, being out at sea after dark, but that's the time when the rarest and most vile catches raise their scaly heads. So the question becomes: are you willing to risk your own sanity for the sake of a quick buck? Or are you too afraid of what you'll find in Davy Jones' locker? In Dredge, the answer is always yes. Yes, you will be frightened of what's out there, whether it's real or born from your own fearful imaginings, but you'll sputter out into the darkness regardless, because the allure of this supernatural fishing sim is just too good to resist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Night Dive Studios, the team behind the upcoming remake of System Shock, for roughly $10 million. 
Night Dive Studios is currently led by Stephen Kick and Larry Kuperman and is both a development studio and a publisher. It has published more than 100 games, and will add its remake of System Shock to that list on May 30 (on PC). Atari says a key to the success of Night Dive Studios is its proprietary KEX engine that makes classic games playable on modern hardware. Considering Atari is a retro company, and one that just acquired 12 classic retro games, it's easy to see what Night Dive Studios can do for it. 


"In addition, Atari, SA also announced that it intends to proceed in the near-term with a €30 million bond issue co…]]></summary>

        <id>120190</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/03/23/redfall-microsoft-canceled-ps5-version-after-bethesda-acquisition-arkane-director-says"/>
        <updated>2023-03-23T12:14:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arkane was developing a PlayStation 5 version of its upcoming first-person vampire shooter, Redfall, before Microsoft acquired Bethesda in 2020. However, following the acquisition, the PS5 version of the game was canceled by Microsoft, according to Arkane director Harvey Smith in an interview with IGN France (translated by IGN). 
Discussing this with IGN France, Smith said, "We got bought by Microsoft and that was a huge sea change. They said, 'No PlayStation 5. Now we're gonna do Game Pass, Xbox and PC.'"


Smith said Arkane didn't mind the decision, even if Redfall was originally meant to release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. 
"Support from Game Pass and having to worry about one less platform, one less complexity," Smith told IGN France. "And Game Pass has a ton of people that can play. It could be our biggest game ever because of the 30 million Game Pass [members] or whatever that number is." 
News of this canceled PS5 version of Redfall doesn't come as much of a surprise. When Redfall was revealed during a 2021 Xbox and Bethesda E3 showcase, it was revealed as an Xbox console exclusive. And considering it's par for the course for companies like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo to keep their first-party releases off of competitor consoles, it's also not surprising Microsoft opted to make Redfall an Xbox exclusive after it acquired Bethesda. 
A spokesperson for Microsoft responded to this story, providing the following statement: 
Redfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2. 
For more about the game, watch the latest Redfall story trailer that introduces some of the vampiric big bass and then watch this gameplay trailer that invites you out to a bloody night on the town.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer showcasing some of the impressive visual work going into its upcoming Lords of the Fallen sequel, The Lords of the Fallen. 
The Lords of the Fallen, previously known as Lords of the Fallen 2, has had a rocky development history thus far, but with Hexworks taking over development back in 2020, the sequel has begun to shape up.
We got a reveal trailer during Gamescom last year that showcased the game's darker, more gothic tone alongside word that this sequel will feature online co-op and a world five times larger than its predecessor. We got another look at the game's grisly world in a new trailer released during The Game Awards back in December, and now, thanks to Epic's State of Unreal presentation today, we get to see more of the game. 
Because it's a trailer released as part of today's State of Unreal presentation, it's less cinematic than previous trailers and instead, focuses on some of the visual design work going into the game.
Check it out for yourself below in this new trailer for The Lords of the Fallen:  


As you can see, The Lords of the Fallen continues to look great, and fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer to go hands-on with it because it's due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime this year. 
For more information about the game, head to our hub for The Lords of the Fallen and then read our thoughts on its predecessor in Game Informer's Lords of the Fallen review after that.

Since 2019, the Xbox-owned developer has released two instances of behind-the-scenes footage, with one revealing the game is not a direct sequel to 2017's Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. We did get some gameplay during a trailer at The Game Awards in 2021 but since then, not much. 
Now, thanks to today's State of Unreal presentation highlighting the current state of Epic's Unreal Engine, we get another tease of what's to come in Senua's Saga: Hellblade II; this time, it's a look at the impressive facial animation Ninja Theory has pulled off in the sequel. 
Check out this new Senua's Saga: Hellblade II teaser for yourself below: 


As you can see, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II continues to look impressive. Unfortunately, we still don't know when we'll be playing the game, though. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice review and then head to our Senua's Saga: Hellblade II hub for more information about this upcoming sequel.

An official release date was not revealed, but Valve says Counter-Strike 2 will be a free upgrade to anyone who owns Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Plus, if you do own Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you can jump into a limited test for Counter-Strike 2 starting today. During this testing period, Valve says it will "be evaluating a subset of features to shake out any issues before the worldwide release." 
The company also says, "Counter-Strike 2 is the largest technical leap forward in Counter-Strike's history, ensuring new features and updates for years to come."
Alongside today's reveal, Valve has released three gameplay videos for Counter-Strike 2. You can check out all three below: 






Counter-Strike 2 will run in the Source 2 engine, which has tools and rendering features "available for community map makers to make it easier to build, experiment, and iterate."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft revealed Ghostwriter yesterday, marketed as an AI development tool (really just machine learning) that generates first drafts of NPC barks, which are the offhand remarks you might hear when running past NPCs. Skyrim’s “I used to be an adventurer like you” is probably the most famous example of a bark. Ubisoft Ghostwriter has been met with passionately negative responses from some narrative designers, while others have been arguing for its use cases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Storyteller is a make-your-own drama puzzle game, taking place on the pages of a book and within empty comic-ish panels on those pages. For each puzzle you're given a set of characters and scenarios (the Baron, the Knight, the Queen; a wedding, a kidnap, an execution) and are tasked with arranging them in a combination that fits the story title you're given (The Queen Marries). It's playful and cute, with surprising depth that draws inspiration from classic stories. It's also very short. I'd wager you'll have hunnerpercented Storyteller in two hours max, which will sound like mana from heaven to some, but may disappoint you if you've been waiting for Storyteller for over a decade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arkane’s upcoming co-op shooter found itself in hot water when fans heard of Redfall's always-online requirement, even when playing alone. This deflated some longtime Arkane fans since their other immersive sims - between Dishonoured, Prey, and Deathloop - had either no online functionality or were still playable offline. Thankfully, in an interview with Eurogamer, game director Harvey Smith said the team are now working to U-turn the decision.

Last November, the streaming service announced plans to adapt Gears Of War’s chainsaw-swinging into an animated series and a live-action film. The latter has now tapped a writer. Jon Spaihts is the Oscar-nominated screenwriter behind Dune, Prometheus, and Doctor Strange, and he’s now writing the Gears Of War film, Netflix announced today.

An underground volcano lair. A Smaug-pleasing gold hoard, conveniently adjacent to a finance executive’s office. Who’d have guessed, then, that its absolute best fight – not just a thrilling brawl in itself, but the point at which a stumbling adventure plants its feet back in greatness – would take place in a canteen?

I remember a chill ran down my spine as I cast my mind back to Far Cry 6, where the tutorial island itself was longer than anything else I'd played that year. I was scared Redfall might succumb to a similar fate. I imagined it filling my head with map markers until my head swelled, popped like a balloon, and dropped grey rarity brain matter.
Well, having given Redfall a go for 90 minutes I was, perhaps, being a bit dramatic. The game may be open world, and may have some slightly jarring open world-isms, but I felt like Arkane's magic wasn't diluted by it all. Their talent for storytelling and level design bubbled to the surface constantly, making exploration a genuine joy. Sure, I have some reservations, but I can't deny that I'm itching to play it again.

It’s beautifully animated and hilarious, even without context for Resi4. The only problem? These shorts are too damn short!

News on Marvel's Spider-Man 2, the highly anticipated follow-up to Insomniac Games' Marvel's Spider-Man from 2018 and 2020's Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, has been light since the game's reveal in 2021. But back in December, PlayStation did reveal that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 would be out sometime this Fall. 
According to the voice actor for Venom in the game, Tony Todd (who we heard briefly in the game's reveal trailer), Marvel's Spider-Man 2 could be out this September. Strangely, Todd responded to a fan excited about the game and spilled the b…]]></summary>

Tax Heaven 3000 is an upcoming dating sim that apparently prepares your US federal tax returns and asks you for personal information like your social security number - all while giving you a cheerful waifu to romance. Her name’s - wait for it - Iris. As in the IRS, aka the government branch responsible for taxes. Sigh.

Low framerates, stuttering, lighting glitches, texture popping, wonky shaders... if you could think of a technical woe, it was probably already undermining this remaster’s efforts to rework and enhance the original RPG’s visuals.
Publishers Private Division have since promised a series of updates to get the Spacer’s Choice Edition up to code, with the first of these – v1.1 – releasing late last week. I’ve given it a test on various graphics cards and credit where it’s due, it has bumped up general performance significantly, although many broken parts remain unmended.

The issue of "what makes an indie game an indie game?" is full of twists and turns, and nobody has ever really come up with an answer that covers all the bases. Lucky for us, that's not really what we're talking about here, although we do use that as a jumping-off point for our chat.
Instead, we try to come up with an Indiescovery Manifesto, one that will guide us in the future when we're thinking about what games we ought to cover on the pod. We achieve this through a lively discussion that mainly involves me playing devil's advocate by throwing out ridiculous edge cases until Rachel and Liam want to break down and weep.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of today, Ni no Kuni 2: Revenant Kingdom and all its DLC are available via Xbox Game Pass. Level-5's JRPG is set long after the events of the first game, has a new cast of characters, changes up combat a lot, and adds a sizeable kingdom management element to the game. I know people who like it and people who hate it, which in itself makes it interesting.

There are also a bunch of games leaving Game Pass at the end of the month, including Chinatown Detective Agency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, Netflix announced it was partnering with Gears of War developer The Coalition to bring a film and TV project to the streaming service. Today, the company announced the writer on the film project will be John Spaihts, known most recently for his work on Dune and Doctor Strange. In a press release, Spaihts had the following to say about the project:
 In the same press release, The Coalition called Spaihts "a master storyteller." The Gears of War developer will also be attached to this project as a producer. You can see their tweet about the announcement below.
🫡
@jonspaihts - a talented writer and fellow Gears fan - to adapt an authentic live action Gears of War film with @netflix. https://t.co/OQ3HtpiJkB
March 21, 2023
We still have no release window for the project, and given that they've only just attached a writer, it's probably still a few years out. While many are likely excited at the prospect of this movie's existence, there is perhaps nobody more eager to be in on the production details than Dave Bautista. The Guardians of the Galaxy star has been campaigning for years to be cast as the live-action version of Marcus Fenix, and was even available as a playable skin in a post-launch update to Gears 5.

So last month, it was pretty big news to hear he was leaving Firaxis behind to chase a “new dream.” At the time, it was unclear what that dream was, but thanks to a podcast interview with My Perfect Console (spotted and transcribed by VGC) we now have an idea of what Solomon will do next. It involves opening a new studio and working on strategy games, unlike the ones he made at Firaxis.

And that’s what a good demake is for; specifically, the Dead Space Demake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision has revealed that Crash Team Rumble, the 4v4 competitive multiplayer game revealed at The Game Awards last year, will be released this June. 
More specifically, Crash Team Rumble hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 20, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Activision has also revealed that a closed beta will take place from April 20 through April 24 and anyone who preorders the game will get access to it. This beta will feature Crash Bandicoot, Coco Bandicoot, Tawna Bandicoot, Doctor Neo Cortex, and Dingodile. 


The game will cost $29.99 but a deluxe edition for $39.99 will also be available. Crash Team Rumble will also include a battle pass and both editions include the first season's pass. The deluxe edition will also include the Season 2 battle pass, a free 25-tier boost for Season 1, and the digital proto pack, which brings "Blocky" skins to the game alongside some equippable items, according to VGC. 
Previews released today mention three different roles in Crash Team Rumble: Booster, Blocker, and Scorer. Using these three roles in a MOBA-like fashion, players will need to collect as much Wumpa Fruit as possible and bring it to their zone. If you've played 2021's Pokemon Unite, you probably get the gist here. 

Crash Team Rumble will feature crossplay. It is being developed by Toys for Bob, the team that developed the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy collection and Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. 
While waiting for Crash Team Rumble to release in June, read Game Informer's Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy review and then read our review of Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. 
Crash Team Rumble hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After playing a short snippet of Tchia back in January for a preview, I had complete faith that developers Awaceb would deliver on their promises for their open-world adventure. Tchia’s island is a marvel to behold. Not only is it gorgeous, but it’s bursting with things to do: sailing, climbing, totem carving, gliding, pearl diving, sharpshooting, tree hopping, treasure hunting - the list goes on and on. 
Not only that, but there’s a 10-hour story to follow, quests to complete, and baddies to tussle with. It's a lot, but Awaceb seem to take it all in their stride. Never once does Tchia feel like it’s bursting at the seams; its balance of activities, exploration and story make it feel perfectly whole. The game's incredible scope doesn't feel like the debut of a nine-person team, but astonishingly, it is. We've had a good run of Bestest Bests on RPS this month, and I'm more than happy to extend it because Tchia is an absolute triumph.

I recently upgraded a laptop I'm testing with their P44 Pro 1TB drive, and I've been thrilled with its performance - and now, this drive has hit a scorchingly hot price on Amazon US. You can now pick up this drive for just $69.99 after a 44% discount from its US MSRP of $124.99, an incredible price for a high-end PCIe 4.0 drive.

One thing I can’t stop thinking about are the game’s piss-coloured walls. They appear right at the beginning of the game’s latest expansion Lightfall and I genuinely believe they summarise Destiny perfectly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Want a big-ol' SSD for your games, media and what-not? The Crucial P3 Plus is currently reduced at Best Buy, where the massive 4TB size is down to $225. That's nearly $40 off its previous price and a great value for a drive of this spec. 
For the record, the P3 Plus is a PCIe 4.0 SSD, with up to 5000MB/s reads and 4200MB/s writes. It uses QLC flash in a DRAM-less design, but with HMB technology - so it uses your computer's RAM as its cache. That allows it to provide surprisingly excellent performance, although we'd still recommend a higher-end TLC drive with a DRAM cache for the most intensive workloads, like 4K video production. For gaming and regular use though, this is a great choice!

The trailer provides glimpses of Cal’s friends and crewmates Ceres Junda, Greez Dritus, and Merrin, all sporting five years' worth of age, strife, and hair (or lack thereoff). We also get a look at a new partner, the mercenary Bode Akuna. Some fresh gameplay clips are sprinkled in, too, as we see the now grizzled Cal duel stormstroopers, bounty hunters, and droids. 


Star Wars Jedi: Survivor launches on April 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. To learn more, check out this story about how the director hopes to turn the series into a trilogy and our interview with star Cameron Monaghan.]]></summary>

And yet I don't quite want to say that 24 Killers is an exception, because confining it to any genre feels reductive, let alone one that will probably put you off if you're anything like me.
It's a tiny bit like a Stardew Valley or Gleaner Heights, or any of those "do chores until you run out of energy" games, but mostly it's a "hanging out and being slightly weird" game.

In second place, players have attempted to beat Margit the Fell Omen 281 million times. In third, Limgrave Tree Sentinel 277 million times, Radagon of the Golden Order in fourth at 148 million, and in fifth, Starscourge Radahn at 139 million. Across all bosses in Elden Ring, players have initiated 5.9 billion attempts.

The only way I know spring has in fact sprung is from the other yearly indicators: Easter eggs stacked en masse in the aisles of supermarkets; pictures of bunnies, chicks and daffodils everywhere; and digital storefronts doing seasonal game sales. GOG kicks off their Spring Sale starts today, with literally thousands of games discounted, some up to 90%. It's running until April 3rd, and to give you a place to start we've highlighted some of our favourites on our GOG page.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 3/23/23: 
Another day, another horrifyingly cute and disturbing Resident Evil 4 anime short to watch. Earlier this week, Capcom released Episode 1 of its "Resident Evil 4 Anime – Leon and the Mysterious Village," following it up yesterday with the release of Episode 2. Episode 3 is now available for viewing and it's the most gruesome yet (but also, still very cute). 
Enjoy!


The original story continues below...
Update, 3/22/24: 
Earlier this week, Capcom released a cute (and disturbing) anime short based on Resident Evil 4 and now, just a couple of days later, the company has released another one. The first saw Leon attempting his way through the Village section of Resident Evil 4 but this time, we see him try to rescue Ashley Graham from El Gigante...and it doesn't go well.

More specifically, Trinity Fusion hits Early Access on April 13. You can access this Early Access launch via both Steam and the Epic Games Store. In Trinity Fusion, you play as Maya, a cross-dimensional warrior who is able to tap into three versions of herself across parallel dimensions. 
Check out the action all three versions of Maya must face in the multiverse in the new Trinity Fusion trailer below: 


"We have a ton of content in the works for Trinity Fusion," Angry Mob Games' Bogdan Iliesiu writes in a press release. "Given the amazing feedback we received from players throughout Steam Next Fest and events like EGX, releasing in Early Access was an easy decision to make. With the Early Access release, we'll be able to get that same great feedback on our new biomes, enemies, and bosses on an ongoing basis as we keep adding more for players to explore and fight through." 
Trinity Fusion hits Early Access on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store on April 13.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zack Snyder, the director behind "Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice," "Man of Steel," and more, has revealed that his upcoming Netflix movie, "Rebel Moon," is getting the game treatment. 
Snyder told The Nerd Queens podcast this alongside word that he was helping with the development of the game, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. As for the type of game, Snyder says it will be an RPG and apparently, it will have a "ridiculous scale." 
"The one thing that I'm having a really good time with – and I don't really know if I'm supposed to talk about it – is this RPG that we're doing that is just literally insane, and so immersive and so intense and so huge," he said on the podcast, according to VGC. "There's more coming, but all I'll say is that it was pitched to me – because I've always wanted to do an RPG – like, 'well, we could do it at this scale, or we could do it at ridiculous scale.'
"And I was like, 'ridiculous scale is clearly the scale that we should be doing it.'"
Snyder says the team behind the RPG said, "Well, it's going to take so much time, we've got to do all these brain dumps, you've got to tell us everything in the universe, what's happening, the science." And Snyder said he was happy to do that, telling them, "Let's go all the way." 
Snyder wrote and directed Rebel Moon and it hits Netflix this December. 
In the meantime, read about how Netflix is developing its own series based on video games, like this live-action Assassin's Creed show and this animated Gears of Wars series (alongside a live-action Gears of War film, too).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Father forgive me, for I have spent the weekend conversing with the damned. No, I haven’t gone all Alan Moore and grimoired up a demonic pal to go gallivanting around the big Tescos with. That is next weekend. Instead, I’ve been playing Diablo 4’s beta, closed to all except an elite cadre of press, pre-orderers, and, uh, chicken enthusiasts. And so, axe in hand, I set forth, confident that whoever I found myself temporarily adventuring with would at least be fortified with adequate protein to wield rippling gains against the lords of hell.


Mouse-clicking connoisseurs of a certain age may remember a time when the name Blizzard was synonymous with the most gorgeously impressive CGI cutscenes your tiny mind had ever been blown by, and while Diablo 4’s lengthy introduction comes at a time where there’s far too much widespread talent for any one studio to claim that crown, it is still a goshdarn treat to take in. Not just technically, either. This chronicle of a cursed expedition is a mission statement for Diablo’s new (old) tone, and it sets the scene for things to come spectacularly - even if that tone straddles the line between gripping and noticeably self-concious about past accusations of cartooniness.

I’m guessing playing as a bald half-head that’s been separated from every body part is pretty low on the list, but after seeing the trailer for Henry Halfhead, you’ll probably change your mind. Announced as part of the weekend’s MIX Showcase, Henry Halfhead is an upcoming indie where you take control of the titular half-head (the top half) and possess everyday items to solve puzzles. It’s aiming for a PC release next year, and it just looks delightful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a neat trick: if you want a high-end gaming laptop but don't want to pay over the odds for it, consider the Corsair Voyager A1600. If you buy it from Corsair's US web store, add a PC case like this one and then use code NEWBUILD, you can pick up the laptop and the case for significantly less than the cost of the laptop alone. 
In fact, this $1800 laptop that debuted in December last year for $2300, complete with Ryzen 9 CPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, 2TB of NVMe storage, a 16-in 2560x1600 (16:10) 240Hz display and Radeon RX 6800M graphics card, goes down to just $1536. And you get a free case, essentially, which you can resell later if you don't need it. Or keep it and build a PC in it, because these Corsair cases are actually really lovely!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We don't normally focus on gaming laptops when it comes to deals, as there's little you can upgrade in most machines. One thing that is usually possible is a RAM upgrade, and today we've discovered a good price on a 32GB kit of DDR4-3200 RAM from TeamGroup. Right now this Elite 2x16GB kit is available for £70, more than £30 less than its usual price. If you'd like your laptop to be equipped with 32GB of RAM for gaming or content creation, and you're currently on 16GB or less, this is a nice little upgrade for the money!

WWE 2K23 doesn’t break the mold from last year’s big re-debut, instead offering smaller improvements and additions to the elements that worked.The action feels similar but a little more polished, the modes have more features, and is a more solid package all around. Though there are still some kinks to work out, 2K23 stands as a respectable follow-up. 
Control-wise, 2K23 is identical to the previous game’s revamped setup, but is a bit smoother. Legacy issues remain, however, such as how finicky picking up weap…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Editor's Note: This article was updated on March 20 to include statements from Bungie, Guerrilla, and Lance Reddick's wife, Stephanie Reddick. 
Lance Reddick, perhaps best known for his role in HBO's "The Wire" has died. He was 60 years old. 
At the time of this writing, the cause of death is unknown but according to TMZ, "law enforcement sources say it appears to be natural." Deadline was also able to confirm, through the actor's public relations representative, that Reddick has died.
Beyond "The Wire," Reddick also had roles in other shows like "Fringe," "Lost," "Bosch," and even last year's "Resident Evil" series on Netflix. His movie credits include the "John Wick" franchise (he was promoting the latest, "John Wick 4," which hits theaters soon, just this week), "Godzilla Vs. Kong," and more. 
On the video game side of things, you might recognize him as the voice actor behind Destiny 2's Zavala. He also provided his voice and likeness to Sylens in PlayStation's Horizon series and Martin Hatch in Remedy's Quantum Break. 
Below are statements from Destiny 2 developer Bungie, Horizon Forbidden West developer Guerrilla, and Reddick's wife, Stephanie Reddick:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between The Last of Us, The Mandalorian, and a viral TikTok audio, Pedro Pascal has been on a roll this month. Now, he's branching out into something he's never done before: mobile game ads. Following in the footsteps of actress Kathy Bates, Pascal has recently appeared in a series of promotional shorts for a mobile game called Merge Mansion, and Game Informer can exclusively reveal the latest installment. Check it out below:


In this series, Pascal plays a detective named Tim Rockford, who's trying to figure out what exactly is going on with the mysterious grandma in Merge Mansion. It's an enigma so elusive that he never even says exactly what he is he's investigating, though from the collection of knives he has in his evidence room, it seems an act of violence was committed.
In a press release, Pascal had the following to say about this role.
What exactly is Tim Rockford investigating? What is grandma putting in her pies? Will Pedro Pascal become a playable character in-game? You'll have to play Merge Mansion, available on iOS and Android devices, to find out.
Which extremely high-profile actor do you think will appear in a Merge Mansion ad next? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strayed Lights is out next month on consoles and PC, but you can play it today via a new Steam demo. 
Developer Embers announced the news of this demo today during the Mix Direct Spring 2023 Showcase that aired today alongside a new trailer for the game. Strayed Lights continues to look great visually, and the action looks awesome. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Strayed Lights gameplay trailer below: 


"In Strayed Lights, you travel through otherworldly regions of misty woods, glowing ruins, and corrupted cities while pursued by eerie shadow creatures," a press release reads. "You also take on boss fights with colossal creatures wrought with unbridled emotion. Your tiny light will grow, picking up new abilities and increasing in size, before eventually evolving into a pseudo-mystical entity imbued with vivid powers. 
"Meanwhile, you'll get a glimpse at the mysteries of the surrounding world, whether through other strayed lights like yourself, or different creatures entirely. The game is set to an atmospheric soundtrack that reflects states of feeling in creatures you encounter, by Grammy-award-winning composer Austin Wintory – whose previous projects include Journey, Abzu, and The Banner Saga Series." 
As for the new Steam demo, Embers calls it a "limited time" experience so if you're interested in checking the game out, do it as soon as you can because there's no word on when the demo will no longer be available. 

"We are thrilled to be able to share our new gameplay trailer and demo with fans of Strayed Lights," Embers co-founder and creative director Alexandre Arramon writes in a press release. "We've been working hard to create a game that is both engaging and visually outstanding, and we can't wait for players to experience it for themselves." 
Strayed Lights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 25.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Layers Of Fear — recently quietly renamed from its working title Layers Of Fears — is a game that requires a bit of explanation. It shares its title with the 2016 game of the same name, and is being overseen by original developers Bloober Team. But it's neither a remake nor a reboot; although, in some ways, it's both of those things. It's more a "reimagining" of the whole Layers Of Fear series to date, as well as its apparent swansong. It incorporates ground-up remakes of the two-and-a-half existing games in the series in Unreal Engine 5, alongside a new gaiden chapter complementing the first game, and a brand-new framing narrative tying the whole lot together. 
I recently sat in on an early preview presentation of Layers Of Fear, chatting with creative director Damian Kocurek. Listeners to one very specific episode of the EWS podcast might recall that I'm something of a Layers Of Fear lore theorist, so of course I was delighted to nerd out over what this new(ish) game is all about. Similarly detail-oriented horror fans out there will hopefully share my excitement when I tell them that yes, the rats are back, and you can even catch a brief glimpse of the Rat Queen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last November, Game Freak released Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on Switch. The game quickly became one of the top-selling games in the history of the popular console, and now, it's time for the new generation to kick off within the popular Pokémon Trading Card Game. The inaugural Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion does more than just introduce the ninth generation of Pokémon into the TCG; it also implements a whole host of changes, not the least of which is a higher price tag for most items. 
However, along with that price increase come several benefits, including a new guarantee of three foil cards in every booster pack, plus the introduction of the silver border in the U.S. and other quality-of-life improvements with regards to the designs. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to crack open and see what we could pull. While I was less frequently blown away by the big cards I pulled, this is one of the most robust galleries of "the coolest cards" articles I've done in a great many expansions. Partially, that is due to me enjoying seeing some of the newer Pokémon from Gen IX getting their first cards, but I can't help but think the increase in foil cards was to thank.
In total, the Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion introduces more than 190 new cards, including more than 10 new Pokémon ex cards, more than 30 Trainer cards, new Tera Pokémon, and tons of special-illustration Pokémon and Trainer cards. You can see the coolest cards we pulled from this expansion in the gallery below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Perfect World and developer Black Wings have revealed Persona 5: The Phantom X, a new mobile spin-off game for iOS and Android devices. It will be free-to-play and feature in-game purchases. 
There's no release date for the game yet, but a playtest will begin March 29 in China, as reported by IGN. The visuals and gameplay look quite similar to Persona 5, which isn't surprising considering Atlus, the original makers of Persona 5, are supervising The Phantom X's development.
You can watch the game's reveal trailer below: 


IGN reports that the game focuses on the theme of "desire," and that much like in Persona 5, Phantom X members will be able to enjoy a day at school, take part in after-school activities, and of course, infiltrate various palaces by way of the Metaverse. 
Check out the Persona 5: The Phantom X gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailers above, Persona 5: The Phantom X is shaping up to be a pretty faithful spin-off to Persona 5. Here's hoping we all get to go hands-on with it soon. 

In the meantime, read Game Informer's Persona 5 review and then check out our review of Persona 5 Royal. Read our Persona 5 Strikers review after that.

There are two entirely different audiences for the Resident Evil 4 remake: those who have played the original game, perhaps multiple or even dozens of times over the last 18 years, and people who have never played it, but want to know what the fuss is all about. Let's start with the former: unequivocally, if you are a fan of Resident Evil 4, you must play the remake. It's not only one of the best action games in recent m…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Stars, Sabotage Studio’s promising retro-inspired RPG (and our cover story this month), is coming to Xbox consoles. Until now, the game was only slated for PlayStation, Switch, and PC. 
The RPG prequel to The Messenger arrives on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on August 29 alongside the other versions. The developer made the announcement on its Kickstarter page, writing, 
“Since the very beginning, we were secretly hoping to be able to cover all current and previous generation consoles. With production being a world of curve balls, we had to leave the messaging at 'PC and Consoles' to avoid having to walk some things back. With the big unknowns now in the rear view, we are delighted to finally confirm the addition of Xbox to the party!”
Additionally, Sabotage revealed that Sea of Stars’ playable demo, currently available only on Switch, will make its way to other platforms later this year.
You can learn more about Sea of Stars by checking out our cover story. Sea of Stars will also be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Dying Light 2 Stay Human studio, Techland, revealed the first look at its unannounced fantasy RPG that's now in development. Now, the studio has released another conceptual look at the game. 
Back when Techland revealed it was working on this game in May of last year, it referred to the unannounced game as a "AAA open-world action-RPG in a fantasy setting." Today's new concept art features some additional details, this time with more of a focus on how the game is a narrative-driven epic. 
"We never stop improving," Techland's tweet reads. "Our newest game is set to be a narrative-driven fantasy epic with an exotic open world ready to be explored. We strive to create a compelling story-focused AAA title that combines and refines the best aspects of gameplay that Techland is known for."

As you can see in the concept art above, this still-untitled game continues to look intriguing. Here's hoping we learn more soon!
While waiting to learn more, read our thoughts on Techland's latest in Game Informer's Dying Light 2 Stay Human review and then check out this other piece of concept art from Techland's in-development open-world fantasy RPG.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fireshine Games, the publisher behind titles like Lies of P and Dredge, has revealed Toads of the Bayou, a new turn-based tactical game coming to Early Access on PC next year. 
Toads of the Bayou is the first game from La Grange, a new studio based in France, and it brings roguelike deckbuilding, settlement-building elements, and more to the strategy genre. In the game, players will control a band of toads looking for a place to call home in the swamps of the deep south. However, in order to protect your settlement, you'll need to fend off the evil Baron Samedi. Along the way, you'll grow your toad family, create more powerful decks, build a settlement, and more across each run. 
Check out the action for yourself in the Toads of the Bayou teaser trailer below: 


"Toads of the Bayou is about combining southern gothic spookiness and the sweet taste of cartoon memories into our own take on the turn-based tactical genre," La Grange game designer Alexandre Clement writes in a press release. "The goal for us was to allow the player to establish their place in this cursed environment and make them appreciate how hard they fought and what they stood for. Nothing is ever granted in the Bayou, and thriving against the Baron's evil forces is a real achievement." 
Toads of the Bayou will hit Early Access via Steam on PC sometime in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Bethesda Softworks and developer Arkane Studios have released a new story trailer for Redfall, and it features four of the vampiric big bads we'll be battling in Massachusetts this May. 
Running nearly three and a half minutes long, this trailer shows off quite a bit of the quaint (and vampire-ridden) town of Redfall. We see our heroes in action, utilizing special abilities like invisibility, as well as a healthy dose of vampires. We also get an introduction to The Hollow Man, Bloody Tom, Miss Whisper, and the Black Sun, four vampires who appear to be at the top of the food (blood) chain in town. 
Check them out for yourself in the Redfall story trailer below: 


As you can see, this new story trailer details quite a lot about what's going on in Redfall. There are hints at the corporation behind it all, the types of vampires we'll be facing off against, many of the locales we'll be shooting our way through, and much more. 
For more about the game, check out the Redfall developer deep dive held back in January, and then watch this trailer from October that invites you to a bloody night on the town. After that, read our Redfall preview for details on how you and your friends will take back the city this summer. 
Redfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2, 2023.

However, when we'd all be able to play the game together remained an unknown – until today. 
Sumo Digital announced via an exclusive reveal with IGN that The Texas Chain Saw Massacre will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 18, 2023. The studio also announced that a technical test would be held on May 25, 2023, before the game's launch later this year.

        <updated>2023-03-16T13:06:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has revealed that it has acquired 12 classic arcade properties, including Berzerk and its sequel, Frenzy. 
Strangely, though, Atari did not reveal all 12 properties that it has acquired. In the press release announcing the news, the company only lists Berzerk and Frenzy. Atari simply says it has acquired a "dozen retro arcade games" so it's likely the other 10 properties are from the same era of arcade games as Berzerk and Frenzy. 
"Atari...announced today the acquisition of a dozen retro arcade games, including the '80s classics Berzerk and Frenzy," the press release reads. "Atari will seek to expand digital and physical distribution of the classic titles, create new games based on the IPs, and explore brand and merchandising collaborations."
Atari says Berzerk is "a top-down, multidirectional shooter designed by Alan McNeil that was released for arcades in 1980." It's perhaps best known for being the first arcade video game with speech synthesis. Following its arcade release, Berzerk was ported to the Atari 2600 and Atari 5200 by the console maker. Frenzy is actually a sequel to Berzerk first released in 1982. 
"Berzerk is one of those foundational games that so many people first encountered playing on an Atari console," Atari CEO Wade Rosen writes in the press release. "Berzerk, and the other titles included in this acquisition, are a perfect fit for our strategy of commercializing classic retro IP."
Who knows if we'll learn what the other 10 retro arcade properties Atari has acquired are – only time will tell. In the meantime, read Game Informer's review of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration.
