        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blackbird Interactive and Gearbox Publishing announced today that the third entry in the popular sci-fi RTS will be released on March 8, 2024. It will be a worldwide launch on PC on both Steam and the Epic Games Store. Homeworld 3 will be the first title in the Homeworld series in over two decades.





“The Homeworld community has waited actual decades for this launch. We’re thrilled that their wait will finally be rewarded this March as players will be able to command the Mothership and continue their adventures. We’re grateful to BBI for their incredible work, and to the players for communicating with us and ultimately trusting us with Homeworld’s legacy. Hopefully they feel that we’ve done it proper justice.” 
- Steve Gibson, President of Gearbox Publishing

Three special editions


Also revealed were four separate editions that will be available. First is the Standard Edition which comes with the base game for $59.99, as well as the Deluxe Edition which includes the base game and the Year One Pass for $79.99.


Those interested in playing early can pick up the Fleet Command Edition which grants access to the game 72 hours early as well as the Deluxe Edition of the game and some digital goodies including a soundtrack, ship decals, engine trail color, and more. Finally, those interested in physical collector items can go for the Collector's Edition which includes everything from the Fleet Command Edition as well as a WW2-Inspired Spotted Deck, a Homeworld 3 Logo Keychain, a Lithograph, and a true-to-scale Homeworld 3 ship.


I usually can't justify the price on physical collector's editions, but I have to admit, that ship looks pretty nifty.


Homeworld 3 releases on PC on March 8.

        <updated>2023-11-30T22:46:34.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grinding Gear Games revealed the details for the upcoming Path of Exile Affliction league. It looks like a pretty big league overall with a slew of new features, content, and updates. The Affliction League itself adds the new Virdian Wildwood, where players can work their way through a mysterious forest to hunt down the source of the Affliction.




The Viridian Wildwood


Players will encounter Sacred Wisps that beckon them into the overgrown passageways of the Viridian WIldwood. Over time the Wisps burn away the affliction that shrouds the forest, but the Wisps only have a limited amount of power. Once you return to Wraeclast, the Wisps you saved from the affliction will inhabit random monsters, increasing their power and rewards.


Overall this mechanic feels like a mix of Delve with Sentinel. You'll progress through the Wildwood in a Delve-like fashion, where it's sort of an infinitely generated map. Then, you will take the Wisps back with you to power up monsters for increased rewards, similar to how the Sentinels worked.


Wildwood Ascendancy Classes and return of Ultimatum mechanic


As you traverse the Wildwood you'll complete quests to unlock one of three new Wildwood Ascendancy classes. Your chosen ascendancy class is in addition to the regular ascendancy class, which is the first time this has happened in Path of Exile.


Also, the Ultimatum mechanic from the Ultimatum league is being added to the core game. The popular mechanic lets players undertake Vaal trials for the Trialmaster in exchange for rewards. If you defeat the trial, he gives you the option of doing double or nothing. It was honestly a very fun mechanic that I've missed, so I'm glad it's being added back in. Of course, the mechanic has been rebalanced as it was a pretty powerful way of obtaining rewards in its original form.


The Path of Exile Affliction league goes live on December 8 on PC and Mac, and on December 13 for PlayStation and Xbox.

        <updated>2023-11-30T22:17:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grinding Gear Games revealed a new class that will be available in Path of Exile 2, the Mercenary. The Mercenary class features shooter-like gameplay with the ability to swap crossbows and ammo types on the fly. Alongside the class reveal, GGG also revealed that WASD movement has been added as an option to PoE2.




The Mercenary is a brand new class that is coming to Path of Exile 2, and does not exist in the current version of PoE. Based on the gameplay video, it looks like a pretty fun class similar to Demon Hunter from Diablo mixed with say a Gunslinger from a game like Lost Ark.


Fans had started to theorize that WASD movement was being added to the game after the previous Druid reveal video showed some gameplay that looked like WASD movement. Now that Grinding Gear Games has confirmed its existence, we know that you will be able to move in a different direction than you aim and attack which is huge for an ARPG. According to the GGG, players will be able to switch between click-to-move and WASD at any time.


I'm excited to see what other classes and feature reveals we get as we get closer to the PoE 2 release. Path of Exile 2 enters closed beta on June 7, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am late to walk the Path of Exile. Very late: the evergreen free-to-play dark fantasy action-RPG launched literal generations ago in 2013, the heyday of Bioshock Infinite and GTA 5. (It's still arguably the heyday of GTA 5. Bioshock Infinite, not so much.) It's my understanding that New Zealand-based developer Grinding Gears have released approximately one bazillion Path of Exile updates and expansions in the decade since, the latest of which, Affliction, is briefly detailed in a boxout down the page. 


I am not your guy for blow-by-blow descriptions of what Affliction adds to Path of Exile. My cautious summary would be: lots of terrifying trees, and lots of modifiers. I am, however, your guy for a newcomer's snapshot verdict on the sequel ahead of the closed Path of Exile 2 beta on 7th June 2024. In a twist so far-fetched they might just pull it off, the new game is designed both for returning players and newcomers, and I think a lot of that is epitomised by the just-announced Mercenary class, which reflects game director Jonathan Rogers's desire to create combat mechanics that are at once more involved and more inviting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie is almost ready to bring Lightfall's long-awaited Fireteam Finder feature to Destiny 2. But players can get in on the action a little early, as stress tests have begun rolling out starting today. 


Players logging into Season 23 on November 30 were in for a treat. An in-game message informed Guardians they could participate in the day's Fireteam Finder stress test, as Bungie previously noted in a November 22 Dev Insights post.


Today is the only day confirmed for stress testing, but it's the first chance players have to try Fireteam Finder out. Players can jump into Fireteam Finder's first stress test between 9 AM and 5 PM PST (12 PM to 8 PM EST) on November 30.


The experience is limited to Raid content, and, per the in-game notice, Bungie already anticipates the test could lead to some hiccups with game performance. That said, the pop-up also provided a method for players to report any issues they came across.


Will there be another stress test?


Screenshot by Destructoid


Right now, the only announced stress test is happening on November 30. That said, Bungie has already gone on to outline the path ahead. Following today's stress test, a Beta period will begin in December. 


Bungie hasn't specified exact dates in December just yet, but that news will likely come after this first test concludes. Bungie did note in the Fireteam Finder Dev Insights post that the Beta's start would depend on how the stress test goes. 


Following the new year, Bungie estimates that Fireteam Finder will be ready for a full release in late January. This is, of course, if everything goes according to plan. And Bungie has promised to keep players updated on any timeline changes, should they develop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As if I really needed an excuse to play more Furi. But if you were looking for one, The Game Bakers have provided today. The developer has released Furi Demake - The Chain, a fully 2D recreation of the first boss battle, for free on Steam.


To reiterate, Furi Demake - The Chain is only comprised of the first boss battle against the eponymous 'The Chain', a jailer who acts as your first brick wall of many. The original game had 10 of said walls to smack your face into until their demise. Though, at least one kind of crumpled like a $5 camping chair.

Furi Demake is a bite-sized boss fight free on Steam


The Chain, however, did not crumple. Even though he was the "tutorial boss," it was a multi-stage fight against a monster who wanted you dead. He often …]]></summary>

One of them was Spine, an upcoming action game that asks the question: what if Sifu also had guns? The new gameplay trailer shows street artist heroine Redline punching, kicking and shooting her way through a cyberpunk-themed world of thugs and armoured guards, and her fancy footwork and the equally agile camera framing looks like it could be quite the combo when it eventually comes out in 2025. Alas, the trailer doesn't give away much else, but I spoke to developers Nekki ahead of tonight's showcase to find more about it, and how it's taking direct inspiration from Sifu and John Wick to become the next big cinematic beat 'em up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After suffering a delay to next year, we now know that the driving-focused roguelite survival game Pacific Drive is arriving on February 22.
The news comes courtesy of today's PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted. Pacific Drive is a first-person adventure that unfolds in a surreal version of the Pacific Northwest. Players drive a station wagon to explore a forest filled with supernatural threats related to a government agency’s experiments gone wrong. Check out a recent story trailer below.  


As a run-based game, the world shifts with every trip into the forest, and the only thing keeping you alive is your trusty vehicle, which you’ll repair, reinforce, and modify using materials found while exploring the unsettling landscapes. Your car will need to stay up to snuff in order to withstand dangers such as the Zone Storm, a recurring maelstrom that obliterates everything in its path, meaning players will have to outrun it to stay alive. 
Pacific Drive will be available on PlayStation 5 and PC. For more on the game, you can check out our extended preview of the game here.]]></summary>

You can't just shove any old Bokoblin-tracking canon in our faces and expect us to clap any more. Now, you have to go big. Something that really blows the lid off the potential of Ultrahand. Something like, we don't know, a fully-realised Godzilla movie created in-game...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The turn-based tactics and occult school life of Demonschool are taking a little extra time. Today, developer Necrosoft Games announced that Demonschool is moving to a Q2 2024 release window.


Previously set for 2023, the studio says it's taking more time to put everything together. "We're trying to make this thing as good as we possible can, and it needed a little more time in the oven," reads a statement from Necrosoft Games on Twitter. "But it'll be worth it! Please wishlist on steeeeeeam!"


The news arrives alongside a new trailer, shown at today's PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2023 showcase. The trailer features a good look at the mechanics of its turn-based tactics, as well as some glimpses of different characters that will be in your party.




School's out for demons


Demonschool is a pretty rad-looking tactics RPG, from the team behind games like Hyper Gunsport. It's been on our radar for some time, and made a strong impression when I got the chance to demo it at PAX East this year.


The story follows Faye, who's attending a university while also getting involved in a ton of occult and supernatural happenings. Between the turn-based battles, you can also wander around, pick up quests, and chat up other people.


It's really neat, and despite dashing my hopes for a last-second end-of-year surprise, I hope the extra time in the oven helps Demonschool shine. In an increasingly crowded 2024, this is still one of my more anticipated games. Definitely one for the indie and tactics crowds to keep an eye on.


Demonschool is currently planned for Q2 2024 on PC via Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer League of Geeks has revealed its Grand Strategy game Solium Infernum will be released on February 14. In Solium Infernum, players attempt to ascend the Dark Throne of Hell via strategy, intrigue, and betrayal. Solium Infernum is a reimaging of the cult-classic strategy game from 2009. We also got a look at exactly just how we'll be able to achieve that goal in a gameplay trailer.




A bit of betrayal


In Solium Inferum, players choose one of eight great Archfiends of Hell as they outwit and outmaneuver their opponents to claim the Infernal  Throne. Political and Military strategy will both be required as players bluff, backstab, and sow betrayal to climb the ranks of Hell.


Our very own Eric "The Tactician" Van Allen got a hands-on look at Solium Infernum last month and feels the multiplayer is where the real grand strategy elements will shine. 


Solium Infernum features 2-4 hour single-player matches as well as weeklong six-player multiplayer matches for those who only have a few minutes to play every day. The asynchrous multiplayer is popular among vast grand strategy titles like Solium Infernum, so I'm excited to see how well it works. A multiplayer playtest will kickoff early next year before release.


Solium Infernum launches on PC via Steam on February 14, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among Us is having a massive collaboration and players will get the chance to rock some brand new skins and other cosmetic items because of it. This collaboration includes seven popular indie games, including big names like Undertale and Castle Crashers.


Alongside those two, the other games involved in this crossover are Celeste, A Hat in Time, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Untitled Goose Game, and Alien Hominid Invasion. Innersloth, the developers of Among Us, announced this massive collaboration on November 28 and it is live now, until February 28, 2024.


There are a total of 25 hats, 18 skins, 12 nameplates, 9 visors, and 6 pets included in this crossover. With the in-game currency—beans—players can head over to the shop and purchase a Cosmicube. The Cosmicube allows players to have access to all cosmetics from each game for a mere price of 7,000 beans. Beans are earnable through gameplay, if you're finding yourself bean-less for this new cube.


Alongside this collaboration, Innersloth has also added in a number of different patches in order to improve Among Us. Since its release in 2018 and massive success it gained during the pandemic in 2020-2021, several updates have been released. The patch notes state that they’re falling behind because of all of the older versions of the game, so the team is removing older versions and encouraging players to update to newer versions for efficiency.


This collaboration will be the first update since The Fungle map was added to the game back in September of this year. The Fungle is the fifth map to be added to the game. It  features a fungus-infested jungle for crewmates and imposters to explore.

We're all having fun with Super Mario RPG on Switch, right? The return of this SNES classic has brought smiles to our faces with constant reminders of Nintendo at its weirdest, but, according to one Square developer who worked on the original title, it was almost a whole lot weirder.
In 1994, Jiro Mifune had just completed work on Live A Live (which also received a swanky Switch remaster last year) and was just about to get cracking on Chrono Trigger (which, unfortunately, did not) before he was brought onto Super Mario RPG. In the game's early development, Mifune sketched up several ideas for how the Nintendo mascot might transition into the world of an RPG and guess what, he's sharing those very sketches on Twitter!

Remnant: From the Ashes and Remnant 2 are available on both PC and Xbox starting today while the others will be spread out over the first couple weeks of December. Both Remnant games are a ton of fun, and I'd definitely recommend checking out if you have a Game Pass subscription.


SteamWorld Build which is a city-builder our very own Zoey "The Architect" Handley feels is worth trying will be released as a Day One on Game Pass title. Blacksmith simulator WHile the Iron's Hot is also coming Day One on Gmae Pass.


There's some other very solid titles being added throughout December including Spirit of the North, Rise of the Tomb Raider, World War Z: Aftermath, Against the Storm, and Far Cry 6.


Here are all the titles coming to Xbox Game Pass in the first two weeks of December:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 keeps adding reasons to get lost in Night City. Now that everyone’s had time to settle in with 2.0 and Phantom Liberty, a new Update 2.1 is going to add some new gameplay elements to Cyberpunk 2077 next week. 


Today CD Projekt Red announced that the free Update 2.1 for Cyberpunk 2077 will drop on Dec. 5, to align with the release of the Ultimate Edition on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. 


Ahead of the release, CDPR is hosting a REDstreams event on Twitch at 10a.m. EST on Dec. 1. The stream will feature members of the Cyberpunk 2077 team, including quest director Paweł Sasko and producer Monika Janowska, talking about new features coming to the game. In its event listing on Steam, the company wrote, “We have a few nice surprises in this patch so don’t miss it!”


It’s hard to say exactly what features we can expect to see in the update. Cyberpunk 2077 just recently got a slew of new content and features. The 2.0 update overhauled the game’s skill trees, changed police interactions, and added vehicle combat, and Phantom Liberty added a new district and story line. 


CDPR has previously stated those were “the last big updates” for the game, so whatever is coming probably won’t be too earth-shattering. Then again, adding onto the game is a great way to build excitement for the Ultimate Edition and future Cyberpunk projects like the live-action series and the inevitable sequel. Maybe we’ll luck out and those surprises will be bigger than we think.


We'll learn more when Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.1 drops on December 5.

        <updated>2023-11-30T17:04:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The surprise horror hit of the earlier parts of 2023, Sons of the Forest was released to critical acclaim. While the hype died down rather quickly, the game did sell two million copies in its first 24 hours. And now, Endnight's follow-up to The Forest will be coming out of early access soon.


In a post on Twitter/X, the developer said that Sons of the Forest will be getting its full version 1.0 release on February 22, 2024. This will mark one year since the game came out, so the timing is pretty gnarly.




An update on Steam says a patch will be rolling out soon (if it hasn't been done already), and the team will "continue to release hotfixes as needed." However, in the future, Endnight will be putting focus on the next stage of its survival horror sequel.


The studio is grateful for "everyone who joined" the early access


On top of that, the tweet goes on to say that Shawn Ashmore will be expanding his role as the voice of Timmy. Many of you will know him for his voiceover work on the likes of Quantum Break and The Dark Pictures: Man of Medan. Most recently, he played Tim Breaker in Alan Wake 2.


Quickly gaining popularity when it was released earlier this year, Sons of the Forest retained a high position on the Steam charts, even pushing some AAA titles to one side (Lethal Company, who?). 


With its cooperative gameplay, creepy atmosphere, and the real star of the show, Kelvin, SotF is one that many will be happy is getting its full release next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Daedalic Entertainment has revealed the Early Access release date for developer Core Engage's debut title New Cycle. Now scheduled to release on January 18, 2024, New Cycle tasks players with building a new bastion for humanity on a post-apocalyptic Earth ravaged by solar flares. 




An old new world


Players take on the role of leading a small group of settlers seeking refuge after a catastrophic solar flare decimated Earth. In the dieselpunk-inspired city-builder, players will start with a small basic settlement of a few hungry workers with many needs as they build up their outpost. Morale, disease outbreaks, power losses, and resource demands are the primary challenges players will have to navigate to keep their settlement going.


The Early Access version of New Cycle that launches in January will feature a campaign and and sandbox gameplay mode, three different biomes, 54 buildings, 47 producible resources, three classes of society and eight different stages of development.


New Cycle reminds me a lot of Frostpunk with perhaps a bit of Anno 1800 mixed in which I'm all for. In the trailer it looks like the city was built around a train network which hopefully adds some interesting logistical challenges as well. 


New Cycle launches into Early Access on Steam on January 18, 2024.

        <updated>2023-11-30T16:59:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the appeals of Stardew Valley is its chill soundtrack. Accompanying players while they farm crops, talk to neighbors, and go exploring, the musical score is such an integral part of the game that a Festival of Seasons tour was announced last month. However, demand has been so high that the developer has added in more dates.


In a recent post on the website-formerly-known-as-Twitter, Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has said the global orchestral tour has been expanded, adding new dates and locations.




Looking at the image, we can see additional shows have been added in Toronto, Los Angeles, Melbourne, London, and more. There are also now stops in New Zealand, Paris, Berlin, Manchester, Tokyo, and plenty of others. The tour will begin in Los Angeles on February 16. Tickets go on sale on December 1.


Might want to get yours in quick


The Stardew Valley tour is a celebration of the melodies that have become an iconic part of the farming simulator. The official website describes the upcoming event as an "intimate, immersive live concert featuring fresh arrangements of the most cherished songs from the game's mesmerizing soundtrack."


You may, however, need to get a move on if you do want tickets. Some of the major cities have already sold out, which is most likely what spurred the addition of extra days in these locations.


In other news, there's still no word on when the next major patch for Stardew Valley is inbound. Barone has said that update 1.6 is in development, but it will only be released when it's good and ready. And rightly so. The developer is also working on a new project, which we know next to nothing about other than it's called the Haunted Chocolatier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Turnip Boy is through evading taxes; now he's taking things to a new extreme. Turnip Boy Robs a Bank was originally slated to launch in 2023, but publisher Graffiti Games announced a delay that pushes the heist back ever so slightly to January 18, 2024. 


This time around, Turnip Boy has joined the Pickled Gang to commit a whopper of a crime. In the process of delving deeper into the titular bank, you'll steal valuables, tangle with cops, hassle hostages, and get in plenty of shootouts. You can see the particularly pungent pickle Turnip Boy has gotten into in the new trailer below. 




The first game from developer Snoozy Kazoo, Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion, was released in April 2021, sending players out on a quest to take down a corrupt mayor. The sequel keeps the top-down perspective intact with the same delightful pixel art and even more felonies to commit. Roguelite elements are back, as well, and the many collectables available range from wearable hats to cassettes full of fresh jams. There's also the promise of the "deeper history of Turnip Boy's world," so if you've been following a character called Turnip Boy for the lore, you're in luck. 


Back when Turnip Boy Robs a Bank was first being shown at events like the ID@Xbox Fall Showcase in 2022, it was planned for this year. When it drops in January it will be available on Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. Those who want to try their hand at violent, veggie-based bank robberies will also be able to do so on Xbox Game Pass.

It was Digital Eclipse’s first test run of the absolutely incredible foundation of the Golden Masters series that started with The Making of Karateka.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yet another Resident Evil VR title will be hitting the PS VR2 soon, as RE4 Remake's VR mode arrives on December 8. It's a free update if you've already purchased the base game, but there is a free standalone demo that'll be available on launch day if you want to try it before you buy it. 


The upcoming mode will allow you to play the remake's entire main story in VR. Several features have been included to help increase immersion. Haptic feedback has been used to allow all weapons to feel unique, and 3D audio will ensure you can never escape the horror even if you close your eyes. Commenting on the mode, director Keisuke Yamakawa states that it'll "allow players to truly become Leon and use a variety of weapons with their own hands to take on enemies which feel like they are standing right in front of you. This unique experience is only possible in VR."

Resident Evil 4 Remake VR mode has some big shoes to fill


Resident Evil 8 VR is one of the best games on the headset, and it's guaranteed to give you plenty of scares and tons of realistic gunplay. RE4 has the potential to be the superior VR game, as it has many more combat encounters, giving you even more opportunities to try out different weapons in virtual reality. 


A shooting range will be available, which you can also try out in the demo to get a feel of all the different weapons. As has been previously noted, the Separate Ways DLC and The Mercenaries will not be available in virtual reality. 




The mode will only be available for the PS VR2, though PC players aren't completely left in the cold, as a VR version of the original game is available on the Quest 2. RE4 Remake may be just what Sony's headset needs to boost sales during the festive season, as the VR2 has been experiencing a bit of a lull when it comes to system-seller titles.

Patch 5 is rolling out later today for Baldur's Gate 3 on PC and PlayStation 5. As Larian Studios has been teasing, it's a pretty big one. In fact, you'll want to clear out a hefty amount of space—130 GB to be exact—to download and install it, though the update only chalks up to 30 GB.


The most notable inclusion is a new epilogue. This playable section happens after the final fight of the game and before the credits. Any players who have already rolled credits should be able to load up a prior save and head there.

Things aren't looking great for Starfield - or at least, they're looking mixed, as in the Steam reviews, and verified but nameless devs are responding to negative reviews with comments that are basically like "no, our space game is fun and you're playing it wrong". We laugh about this (but also discuss the role of Steam reviews and devs replying to them). As well as that, the lads have been playing, well, the same sort of stuff this week, James brings us talk of mini PCs, and Nate makes us play Dracula or Russell Crowe. Extremely normal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When questing across the realm of Cyrodiil in Oblivion, it can be easy to forget that even the Hero of Kvatch might enjoy a snack. However, if you're sick of wheels of cheese and shiny, green apples, a couple of people have made it possible to eat something far more enjoyable.


If you've got that craving for some in-game pizza, hrodeberht1 and bella over on Nexus Mods may have just what you need. Their "Necro Pizza Cyrodiil" mod adds in a delivery service that gives you the option to order your character a hot, cheesy dish of the good stuff.




The above video shows how it works. Basically, it adds a pizza menu to your inventory where you get to pick from six different types of 'za (that's right, I said it). Upon placing the order, your food is sent to you by a Necromancer, where it's delivered by a skeleton who proclaims the delivery complete upon receiving it.


Shame it's not real


This is actually similar to another mod they did back in 2021 which allows the Dragonborn to order a pizza while roaming around in – you guessed it – Skyrim. There's also this one from a different modder that allows you to order a real pizza directly through Oblivion. So...pizza is very much something that's been missing in The Elder Scrolls this whole time.


While at this point many would now consider it quite an old game, The Elder Scrolls 4 is an absolute classic in Bethesda's long-running series.


However, if you want a way of playing a more up-to-date version of Oblivion, there is an unofficial remake called Skyblivion that's currently in the works. However, that's not due out until probably 2025, so you've definitely got time to grab some pizza while you wait.

Beyond the Avatar game the industry at large is settling down, as all of the gift cards and presents are lined up for the holidays. This week's big release is Batman: Arkham Trilogy, and your guess is as good as mine in terms of whether or not WB actually got this compilation up to code before launch. Given their track record, all signs point to "?" That's coming out on December 1, if you somehow haven't played this series at all yet. As a reminder, the trilogy comes with Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight - and the latter dropped in 2015. Yep, it's been a while since we've gotten a proper Arkham game.


The other main release this coming week is Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince, which is out on that same day.

We enjoy a little flippin' and tiltin' around these parts and November 30th, 2023 marks the 30th anniversary of HAL Laboratory's Game Boy Kirby spin-off, Kirby's Pinball Land. It was the developer's third pinball game for a Nintendo system following fellow Game Boy title Revenge of the 'Gator and the NES port of Rollerball, and its engine would go on to power Jupiter Corps' excellent Pokémon Pinball six years later.
Looking back, Nintendo has a surprisingly rich history of pinball-based games, having developed and/or published a total of 14 by our count — including a couple of curios that you may have forgotten had a direct Nintendo connection. As a loose tie-in to this Kirby anniversary, we're looking back at every Nintendo-published pinball game ever released — as ranked by you.

In the case of my multiplayer hands-on, that empire was the Ix'Idar, a race of burrowing insect critters with a unique resource - pheromones. Boldly disregarding the PR's gentle advice that I start with an easier-to-master race, I set out to swarm the galaxy and immediately found myself at the bottom of the victory or "Succession" point scoreboard, with one player picking off my planets by means of espionage, while others stomped my fleets of stargrubs flat in no-nonsense space combat. 


I did manage to briefly take possession of the titular Nexus, a throneworld which awards beaucoup Succession points to its owner, but it turns out fixating on the Nexus is a great way to set yourself up for a midgame dogpile - you pour resources into capturing it, sacrifice half your fleet to the first invader, then lose it all to the second. With my initially bountiful dominions rudely shrunk to a smattering of isolated planets, I took the coward's way out of the press event and said I had to be going because I had other work to attend to. I didn't at all! I just wanted to go and cry in the toilet. Alas for the Ix'Idar - not so much "lions led by donkeys" as an antfarm in the hands of a wilful toddler.

Back in the days before the Switch eShop was awash with cat-based indie games, there was Cattails. This feline RPG — where you play as an actual cat, we might add — provided us with a good way to while away the hours back in 2018 and we went on to reward it an 8/10 in our review. Well, the cat's out the bag now, as its sequel, Cattails: Wildwood Story has pounced its way onto the Switch eShop today!
Wildwood Story looks to carry on much of the same cat cuteness that we enjoyed in its predecessor. You once again play as a cat (shock) as you lead your colony into the mysterious forest where you will make new feline friends, forage for food, fight off foes and who knows... maybe even fall in love.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion was a pretty weird game when it came out in 2000, and it’s an equally strange pick for a remaster. But it had to be done. Nightdive knew this. They knew that the N64 trilogy (if you exclude the multiplayer-focused Turok: Rage Wars) had to be completed.


It couldn’t have been an easy task. While Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Turok 2: Seeds of Evil had PC versions they could pluck from, Turok 3 remained exclusive to the N64. Thankfully, Nightdive’s wizardry has only become more potent over the years, and because of their work porting other N64 games like Doom 64 and Quake 2 (64) to their proprietary KEX Engine, they were able to reverse engineer Turok 3 to save it from the suffocating tomb of the console that birthed it.


Still, it’s a damned weird game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dan Houser left an unerasable mark on gaming through his work at Rockstar, though he has since moved on to new projects. This includes two new IPs his entertainment company is working on. 


You shouldn't expect traditional gaming experiences from Absurd Ventures. The first IP, American Caper, focuses on two families facing a world of "corrupt business, inept politics and bungling crime." We'll explore this universe through a graphic novel illustrated by comic book artist Simon Bisley. The first story arrives in 2024. 


A Better Paradise is the second IP. It's an existential suspense thriller being made with help from Q-CODE Media. Interestingly, it'll take the form of a 12-episode audio fiction series. It also arrives in 2024.

Dan Houser and Absurd Ventures


Houser is a co-founder of Rockstar and has served as a writer for the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption franchises. He left the company in 2020 before starting Absurd Ventures in 2021. We haven't seen much from the business yet and the official site doesn't offer much guidance, featuring little but some cryptic images and many-sided dice with provocative terms on them. 


There are other projects in store from the entertainment company, as it intends to bring more stories from American Caper and A Better Paradise to a wide range of formats and platforms. Commenting on the IPs, Houser states that this is just the beginning, and the initial releases will allow them to introduce the two universes while "working on other iterations and expansions."


Though Houser may have left Rockstar, it seems crass humor and depictions of American society are a constant in everything he touches. I'm interested to see how Absurd Ventures will use varied mediums for creative storytelling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the end of 2023 just around the corner, I feel confident in saying that Monster Hunter Now is one of my biggest surprises of the year. It’s easily Niantic’s best game since Pokemon GO, and with the game’s first major update on the horizon, it’s looking like the title will stay relevant heading into 2024.


For those just tuning in, Monster Hunter Now is a GPS driven augmented-reality game based on Capcom’s Monster Hunter series. While this seems like an odd pitch, it’s an entertaining concept that stays remarkably true to its source material. Though the combat naturally makes concessions to play smoothly on touch screens, Niantic’s take on the formula does appear to have resonated with players since launch.



That said, there’s certainly room for improvement here in a lot of ways, wh…]]></summary>

Microsoft and Xbox have mentioned on a number of occasions how they want to make gaming more accessible than ever before, and during a recent appearance at the Wells Fargo TMT Summit earlier this week, Xbox CFO Tim Stuart reiterated this.
While he admits it's a "bit of a change of strategy" compared to Xbox's approach in the past and there's nothing seriously happening right now, the mission is to bring the company's "first-party experiences" as well as its subscription services to "every screen" that can play games. Here's what he had to say, courtesy of GameSpot:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We already knew a remaster of Sam & Max: The Devil’s Playhouse was on its way from Skunkape Games, but now we have a release window. It will arrive Spring 2024.


Technically, this is a delay, but the announcement of a 2023 timeframe never happened. It was just a shared hallucination.


Sam & Max: The Devil’s Playhouse was the last of Telltale’s revival of the Sam & Max license and also sort of the last traditional point-and-click adventure that they want you to remember before the formula changed with The Walking Dead. Jurassic Park: The Game never happened. It was just a folie à deux.


Skunkape has been going to work saving the three seasons of Sam & Max from being buried alongside Telltale. While those games were still technically available, they were from an uncomfortable period of PC…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier today we got an update on a bunch of Level-5 games during a livestream, including the next entry in the Professor Layton series. Professor Layton and the New World of Steam hits Nintendo Switch sometime in 2025, and a you can watch as Layton and Luke work out a puzzle in the latest trailer. 




As shown in the preview, Yo Oizumi is back leading the Japanese cast as Layton, with Mio Imada now voicing Luke Triton. Maki Horikita previously voiced Luke prior to retiring from the entertainment industry back in 2017 to focus on her family. 


The sample brainteaser has Layton and Luke attempting to find the entrance to the workshop of a genius inventor named Eggmuffin. Frankly, not working "Eggmuffin" somewhere into the title is the pinnacle of burying the lede. Eggmuffin's workshop is but one quirky building amidst the wider world of Steam Bison, an American town that advances as you continue to find and solve puzzles.


It's been a while since Layton and Luke went on a proper adventure together. At this point Luke has made somewhat of a name for himself as a detective, while puzzle master Layton continues working as Professor of Archeology at Gressenheller University. Their latest outing is officially underway when a "mysterious incident" occurs in Steam Bison. I'm just tickled at the way Steam Bison works as both a really cool town name and a scrapped Mega Man X boss. 


I'm already stumped


This time around, puzzle design duties fall to famed Japanese puzzle design team QuizKnock. As the official Layton site notes, the team that Takuji Izawa runs specializes in combining entertainment with knowledge. As of right now they have over 2 million subscribers to their YouTube channel. We'll have to wait until 2025 to see just how thoroughly they can twist our noggins like the pliable pretzels they are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After over 1,200 episodes and well over a dozen films, Ash Ketchum's Pokémon journey concluded earlier this year. But you'd be crazy if you thought that would be the end of the immensely successful anime series. Pokémon Horizons is on the way to pick up the mantle, with Netflix confirming in a new trailer that it will begin airing stateside early next year. 


Pokémon Horizons features a new duo of Liko and Roy, each with a starter from the Paldea region. Liko is paired with the grass-type Sprigatito, while Roy adventures around with the fire-type Fuecoco. The trailer introduces us to Liko and explains she has traveled to where it all began, the Kanto region, to enroll in the Indigo Academy. We also meet Roy, a young native of the Kanto region with a passion for becoming a Pokémon trainer. Sound familiar?




Liko and Roy both possess artifacts that the Explorers, the Team Rocket-like group of Horizons, are seeking to take. Liko has a mysterious pendant passed down to her from her grandmother. While Roy has an ancient-looking Poké Ball that raises questions of its own.


The duo isn't alone though, as a group known as the Rising Volt Tacklers come to their aid in the show. The group is headlined by its own duo of Friede and Captain Pikachu, with Friede riding atop a fierce-looking Charizard of his own. 


The series will start streaming on Netflix beginning February 23, 2024, which purposely coincides with the timing of Pokémon Day celebrations for 2024. 


Pokémon Horizons isn't the only Pokémon series Netflix has coming down the pipeline though, as the fantastic-looking stop-motion animated Pokémon Concierge begins streaming on December 28.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jusant is all about climbing a mountain, and Don’t Nod’s superb execution of this premise has propelled this small, meditative adventure to stand among the year’s finest titles. In my review, I wrote that the game’s “ingenious climbing system, beautiful art direction, and intriguing world-building, inching toward the top is worth the effort.” That effort can be attributed to Don’t Nod honing in on the game’s central mechanic, climbing, and building a fascinating world and lore around it. I spoke to the game’s lead designer, Sofiane Saheb, and art director, Edouard Caplain, to better understand how Don’t Nod spent over three years bringing Jusant to life. 
Caplain states Jusant’s development began after Don’t Nod finished work on Life is Strange 2. After releasing another narrative-heavy ex…]]></summary>

Well, geez, we're less than a month away from Christmas and the holiday season, and we're just over a month away from 2024. Guess it's time to look at the final month of 2023 and see what games are coming to the Switch.
This is by no means a definitive list of games coming to Nintendo Switch in December 2023, but these are the ones we're most excited to get our little mitts on. And yes, we know there are only 10 listed in the table below, but you can actually buy all three Batman games --Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight — separately. Good thing we're a few days ahead of the month, hey?

"To our loyal players, It is with deep regret that we inform you that Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia will end service on Feb. 29, 2024 UC," said Square Enix on the game's official Twitter page. "We would like to thank you for your many years of support, and hope you can enjoy playing for a little while longer."

There are still events coming up


Upcoming events are still occurring until that unfortunate date. The Cactuar Cacophony is still running from now until February 29. You'll also be getting the following:



Dare to Defy Astraeus (Now until February 29)


Dusk to Dawn: Evil Gazes at Dusk (Now until January 1)


Dare to Defy Nyx (January 1 to February 29)


Dusk to Dawn: Ogres Parade the Night (January 1 - February 1)


6th Anniversary Special 50+1 Draw (January 31 - February 29)


Dare to Defy Eos (February 1 -February 29)



Replies to this news are predictably disappointed in the closure. Several note how this was a well-received game, and still has potential for more.


This is part of a string of Final Fantasy titles that have been pulled down from mobile devices. Battle royale Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier is also shutting down in January 2023, only lasting just over a year. 


Square Enix also cancelled Mobius: Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy Record Keeper. With these closures, can't blame fans for considering stopping their investment in Square Enix mobile titles. 


Despite so many shutdowns, Square Enix still plans to release Kingdom Hearts: Missing Link in 2024. It's also still supporting Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis, a game with gacha elements that retells the storyline of the VII series and its spin-offs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We found out last August that Sonic the Hedgehog 3 was set to hit theaters on December 20, 2024, but a new teaser gave us another glimpse at its newest star: Shadow the Hedgehog.
I say “another” because Shadow briefly appears during Sonic the Hedgehog 2’s mid-credits scene, setting him up as presumably the antagonist of the third film. While we still don’t know his exact role or who will voice him, today’s image, posted above, provides a good look at Shadow below the neck (does he have a neck?), namely his signature air shoes.

November 29, 2023
Production on Sonic the Hedgehog 3 had stalled due to the SAG-AFTRA strikes, and today’s update confirms work has resumed following the strike's suspension. Jeff Fowler remains in the director’s chair, and the returning cast includes Ben Schwartz (Sonic), Colleen O'Shaughnessey (Tails), Idris Elba (Knuckles), and James Marsden (Tom Wachowski).
Whatever the third film entails, it has one heck of an act to follow. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was a box office smash, becoming the highest-grossing video game film of all time in the U.S. until The Super Mario Bros. Movie took that crown earlier this year. A live-action TV spin-off starring Knuckles is also in the works and slated to release early next year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans excited for Sonic the Hedgehog 3 got a nice little tease today. Jeff Fowler, director of both 2020's Sonic the Hedgehog and 2022's Sonic the Hedgehog 2, published a tweet today teasing the emergence of one of the blue blur's most iconic villains, Shadow the Hedgehog in next year's Sonic the Hedgehog 3.


The point of the tweet was twofold. Fowler shared an image teasing the lower half of Sonic's genetically engineered rival, but also confirmed that Sonic the Hedgehog 3 was "off and running" with development. 




Shadow the Hedgehog was revealed as a tease during the conclusion of Sonic the Hedgehog 2. While his team was searching for Dr. Robotnik, G.U.N. Commander Walters was informed that a 50-year-old file was found that contained coordinates to a secret site hosting something called "Project: Shadow". We then see the black hedgehog open his angry eyes within a containment cell. The background of the image Fowler posted today looks to be that very same site. 


Shadow the Hedgehog originally debuted as a foil to Sonic in the Sega Dreamcast's Sonic Adventure 2. Due to the character's popularity, he became a series mainstay, acting as an anti-hero of sorts who strives to do good but by any means necessary. 


Fowler also confirmed today that Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is on track for release in December of 2024. However, that won't be the next time you're able to jump back into this live-action Sonic world. Paramount confirmed in February 2022 that a live-action Knuckles series was in the works with Iris Elba returning. The studio also teased that they were planning to expand the Sonic live-action universe with several other projects as well.


The Knuckles live-action series is slated to arrive on Paramount+ early next year. Sonic the Hedgehog 3 races to theaters on December 20.

Updated with Football Manager 2024 Touch. Enjoy!

Football is the world's most popular sport, from the elite level of child-like millionaires with dazzling skills and impressive diving techniques, to actual children on playgrounds using jumpers for goalposts. Being a football / soccer fan that owns a Switch, however, can be slightly confusing. Nintendo's system somehow misses out on the 'Premier' games while getting bombarded with loads of smaller releases, and it can be hard to know which ones are worth a kickaround.

At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware.

I had expected both books to be in your hands already (and on the bestseller list), but now my publishers are concerned by that report declaring "the vast majority of NFTs are worthless". Well then! As we say on the Infobahn: when Turing closes a crypto exchange, he opens an ICO. So in the wake of Cyber Monday, I now present to you a sneak peek at my third Non-Fungible Future novel, a mint read I call 'Worthless'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition is arriving early next year. The news was accidentally posted early to the Xbox store and was even briefly available to play (albeit in unfinished form) on Ubisoft Plus. 
According to its now-deleted Xbox Store page (which was shared by Wario64 on X), the 2003 adventure will now feature 4K graphics and 60 FPS with improvements to controls and audio. It will also feature auto-save and cross-save functionality. Here’s the full blurb:
The store page also included a big batch of screenshots of the remaster, which can view in the gallery below.

According to Ubisoft’s statement to IGN. , the store listing went up early due to a “technical error” 
"As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of Beyond Good & Evil, we're excited to share that the official launch is set for early 2024, and we look forward to sharing more with you in the new year," Ubisoft wrote in the statement. 
Beyond Good & Evil originally launched for PlayStation 2, Xbox, PC, and GameCube in 2003. It stars Jade, a reporter and fighter who joins a resistance movement to uncover a conspiracy on an alien planet. Gameplay involves taking on enemies in martial arts melee combat while using Jade's camera to take photos of clues and evidence while solving puzzles. The cult classic received its first big remaster in 2011 in the form of an HD upgrade, while its long-lost sequel, Beyond Good and Evil 2, has seemingly been in development limbo since its formal reveal at E3 2017. 
Beyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition is expected to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Paramount Pictures has released a sneak peek at Shadow in the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog 3 movie, scheduled to release on December 20th, 2024.
Granted, we don't get to see much (they just had to cut off his head), but what we can see confirms that the character looks to be a pretty darn faithful recreation of the original design from Takashi Iizuka and Shiro Maekawa; albeit with maybe a few added bells and whistles on his shoes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom held a new showcase for Dragon’s Dogma 2, showing off more of the game’s fantastical action but giving fans the one thing they’ve wanted most: a release date. The hotly anticipated sequel is coming on March 22.
If that date looks familiar, that’s because it was accidentally leaked not once but twice. The first instance occurred earlier this month, thanks to a PEGI rating that revealed the March 22 date. The second leak occurred just hours before today’s presentation courtesy of the game’s Steam page. But if you missed both early reveals, today is probably a nice surprise. 
A new trailer shows off more of the game’s story while also offering up new gameplay footage. The trailer showcases the new Trickster Vocation alongside new enemies, such as the towering statue, mythical beasts, and, naturally, dragons. 


Dragon’s Dogma 2 is launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crossover skins are extremely commonplace for in-game stores in 2023, and Among Us is no different. Their latest collaborative effort introduces skins from a list of popular indie games; Undertale, Celeste, A Hat in Time, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Untitled Goose Game, Alien Hominid Invasion, and Castle Crashers. The cosmetics from all seven games will be included in a Cosmicube, which can be purchased with 7000 beans. The crossover includes 25 hats, 18 skins, 12 nameplates, 9 visors, and 6 pets. You can see a gallery of the featured skins below.

The update will also include a series of patches (which you can read right here) and will notably deprecate 2021 versions of the game, pushing players to use updated versions instead. "We’ve been supporting a lot of older versions of the game, and as it continues to grow and get new features, it gets harder to keep up," the patch notes read. "We have to remove older versions so we can focus on improving our system for everyone. Make sure you update your game and thanks for understanding!"
This is the first update to Among Us since they added The Fungle, a new map that takes place in a fungus-infested jungle. You can watch the launch trailer right here.
Are you planning on trying out the new cosmetics in Among Us? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, something odd happened in the streets of Gotham. With no prior announcement or fanfare, people booting up Batman: Arkham Knight were greeted with a skin from 2022's The Batman starring Robert Pattinson. But then, as quickly as it appeared, it was removed, all without comment from the developers. While we still don't know exactly why the skin was added accidentally, we know exactly why it was created: it's a timed-exclusive suit launching with the Batman: Arkham Trilogy on Switch.


The collection brings Rocksteady's beloved trio of Batman games to Nintendo's hybrid console, complete with all previously released DLC. The trilogy will also include the aforementioned suit from The Batman, but it won't be limited to the Switch forever – other platforms will get access to the suit "at a later date."
Game Informer, much like the rest of the gaming community, is a big fan of the trilogy, with all three games appearing on our list of best superhero games of all time. While it's been eight years since the last game, Rocksteady has been hard at work ever since working on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which is set to come out on February 2, 2024. If you want to stick to the classics, Batman: Arkham Trilogy launches this Friday, December 1.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only... compromise, calculation and license to misbehave. In Owlcat's forthcoming RPG Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, you play the free-wheeling head of an interstellar merchant's dynasty. Operating on the fringes of uncharted space, you're the owner of a Warrant of Trade that essentially lets you run your own miniature empire within the Imperium, deciding the fates of planets, amassing vast wealth and recruiting a motley crew of xenos, heretics and assorted weirdos. It's the kind of behaviour that'd get you vaporised if you were some run-of-the-mill Space Marine Chaplain, but out here on the frontier, you're allowed to act with impunity, providing you fulfil your overall mandate of adding to the God Emperor's glory and kicking the odd Eldar's head in.


Rogue Traders are arguably the only characters in Games Workshop's brutal and decrepit table-top setting that lend themselves to the role of CRPG protagonist, because they are the only characters in Warhammer 40K's Imperium who enjoy anything like the plot agency of a Commander Shepard. And with that, I think, comes an interesting transformation of the character alignment systems the game shares with other CRPGs such as Baldur's Gate 3.

The images showcase all the classic iconography you'd expect from the series, including vaults, ghouls, and power armor.
The Vanity Fair article goes on to give us the first concrete details of the show, thanks to an interview with co-creators Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan, who also created Westworld. The series will star Ella Purnell as Lucy, a "doe-eyed" woman who emerges from her vault with naivete and optimism but is forced to face the horrors of the wasteland. 
"Lucy is charming and plucky and strong," Nolan says. "And then you see she’s confronted with the reality of, hey, maybe the supposedly virtuous things you …]]></summary>

No, it's got nothing to do with teeth. According to Larian, the slowdowns are actually connected to the game's understanding of crime and morality: Patch 4 left it unable to "forget" player thefts and acts of vandalism that haven't been detected by NPCs, meaning that BG3 players who break the rules often and get away with it have been saddling their simulations with unfinished tasks. That's right, the game's latest technical crisis is in fact a crisis of conscience. Oh the  humanity!

        <updated>2023-11-27T21:59:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since premiering in late October, Five Nights at Freddy’s has become a big box-office success. It’s already the highest-grossing horror film of 2023, and it has now become horror production company Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film of all time.
The film adaptation of the popular 2014 horror game hit theaters on October 27, grossing a strong $80 million in its opening weekend, the best for any horror film this year. That’s even more impressive given that it premiered on the streaming service Peacock the same day it was released in theaters (becoming the most-watched title on Peacock during its first five days). 
Five Nights At Freddy’s has continued to gain traction over the past few weeks and has now grossed over $295 million ($136 million domestically, $160 million overseas) during the month it's been in theaters. That ranks it at the top of Blumhouse’s highest-performing films, a record previously held by M.Night Shyamalan’s Split, while also climbing over top performers such as Halloween (2018), Get Out, and Glass. 
FNAF is the BIGGEST @blumhouse film of ALL-TIME. Just passed SPLIT. thanks to Emma Tammi, Scott Cawthon, cast & the New Orleans crew, the Henson team, & our partners @universalpics & @peacock. @jhutch1992, @matthewlillard, @Piperrubios, @elizethdlail
November 27, 2023


First announced in 2015 (roughly a year after the first game’s release), Five Nights At Freddy’s stars Josh Hutcherson (The Hunger Games series) with actors such as Elizabeth Lail and Matthew Lillard in supporting roles. The film is directed by Emma Tammi and produced by Blumhouse. The film joins the ranks of other highly successful video game adaptations to release in 2023, such as the other box office juggernaut The Super Mario Bros. Movie and HBO's critically-acclaimed The Last of Us.

With the series’ action built around the incredible manoeuvrability and momentum of the Omni-Directional Mobility gear, the genuine unnerving threat of the titans, and the relatively fragility of its human heroes, it’s just primed to be mined for video game inspiration.

Originally slated to launch on February 27, The Final Shape now launches on June 4. In a blog post, Bungie states that the expansion “needs more time to become exactly what we want it to be”.
“The Final Shape is the culmination of the first ten years of Destiny storytelling and, for Guardians everywhere, countless hours spent together,” Bungie writes in the post. “We want to honor that journey, so we’re taking the time we need to deliver an even bigger and bolder vision, one that we hope will be remembered and treasured for years to come.”

One of those companies is Nuverse, a game publisher best known in the West for its work on Marvel Snap. Fans of the superhero card-battler had reason for concern this morning, as an article from Reuters reported that ByteDance had plans to leave the gaming space entirely, with intentions to "divest from titles already launched." This seemed to spell doom for Marvel Snap.
However, the official Marvel Snap X account issued a statement today that this would not be the case.
Dear SNAPPERS,
November 27, 2023
It's unclear exactly why the PC and mobile game will be exempt from any changes, but we're happy to hear that one of the best games from 2022 isn't going anywhere. However, the fates of the workers at Nuverse and the company's other games are unclear, as Reuters reports that "the decision is likely to impact hundreds of employees." The report states that ByteDance will announce this restructure sometime today.

With its 5120x1440 resolution, overclocked 170Hz refresh rate, and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro support, that’s £699 for specs that can very easily set you back over a grand. And, unlike buying the combined labours and livelihoods of the entire RPS team, there’s no months-long bidding process for this curved screen – you can just order it off Currys.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dredge was pretty weird to begin with. The indie hit somehow melded fishing with cosmic horror - seamlessly - to create an enthralling adventure where you can never be sure if what you're about to haul out of the depths will have a normal amount of eyes or tentacles. The new Pale Reach DLC gets even weirder, a masterpiece of show-don’t-tell horror that manages to evoke some of the more inspired Bloodborne monsters as well as some of icy, supernatural scares from The Terror. And it's all centred on a big whale. 


Spoilers ahead, friends, but in The Pale Reach, a massive icy landscape has suddenly appeared in the southern, well, reaches of Dredge's world, so naturally we’re off to see what that’s all about, ploughing along in our faithful fishing boat to the hostile new climate. Every path into the landmass is barricaded by imposing ice walls. It's a slog.


It’s also a great setup. We're made to instantly wonder what the hell hides in this treacherous ice field, and the answer is equally great: a massive corrupted narwhal with bulbous glowing eyes. The huge beast dwarfs your tiny ship, but mercifully it’s frozen solid in an even bigger chunk of ice, with only those very angry eyes poking out at us. Four angry eyes on one side of its head, to be very precise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a new Tribes FPS in development, eight years since the last Tribes game, Tribes: Ascend, went skeeting off into the no-further-updates hereafter. It's the work of former Hi-Rez subsidiary and nowadays independent studio Prophecy Games, and going by SteamDB listings, it's called Tribes 3: Rivals.
New to the Tribes series? It once went by the unofficial title of "the world's fastest shooter". On the one hand, I'm not sure that claim holds as true in the era of Titanfall 2 or DOOM Eternal or Hyper Demon or heck, even latter-day Fortnite with its rocket-powered rams. On the other hand, and to pick up the tune from Matt Cox's (RPS in peace) 2019 retrospective - WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Here's a compilation of footage from a recent playtest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloober Team has unexpectedly provided a light update on its upcoming remake of Silent Hill 2, ensuring fans that its development is “progressing smoothly”. You'll just have to wait for Konami to share more details. 
In an X post, the team behind The Medium and Layers of Fear asks for fans’ patience in regard to new information on the game while stating that development is going according to schedule. Konami announced the Silent Hill 2 remake last October with a lengthy trailer showcasing the 2001 classic’s updated presentation. The game currently has no release window but will launch on PlayStation 5 and PC. 


Here is Bloober Team’s full update: 
Silent Hil 2 remake was one of many new Silent Hill projects announced last October. The first one to arrive was Silent Hill Ascension, an interactive streaming series that premiered on Halloween. Other projects in the pipeline include Silent Hill f, a new mainline entry set in 1960s Japan, and Silent Hill Townfall, a mysterious title published by Annapurna Interactive and developed by No Code, the creators of Observation. A new live-action film called Return to Silent Hill is also in production by original Silent Hill director Christophe Gans.]]></summary>

Last Train Home has an intriguing premise: taking the Czechoslovak Legion home from the Eastern front via an armoured train directly through the chaos of the Russian Civil War. Its unusual mixture of survival sim, RPG, tactical skirmishes, and narrative history holds together, I think, precisely because your efforts to make it all work provide such a contrast to what an incredible mess the world around you is becoming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In another lifetime, SteamWorld Dig could have easily ended up as SteamWorld Build. When Image & Form first released their 2D digging platformer back in the depths of 2013, its moreish loop of carving out rocky chasms, finding gems and treasure, then upgrading your pickaxe and burgeoning township back on the surface was instantly captivating, and its 2017 sequel continues to be one of my favourite platformers of all time. Now, a decade later, SteamWorld Build has reimagined Dig's core ideas as a handsome citybuilder, placing equal focus on managing your rustbucket town up top, while plundering its depths via an abandoned mineshaft to find treasure, resources and (most importantly) rocket parts, so you can escape your crumbling planet and find a new homestead up in the stars.
Despite the threat of annihilation hanging over the horizon, however, SteamWorld Build is one of the most relaxed and easy-going building games I've ever played. This is a game that's more concerned with keeping your economy running like a well-oiled, uhh, machine than turning a profit, for example, and it merely dips its toe in the genre's wider, ongoing obsession with building up defences to fend off oncoming hordes of malicious town hall-eating nasties. If the scales do get thrown out of equilibrium, the worst that will happen is you get lots of angry little red robot faces appearing above your houses. You won't go bankrupt, you won't get turfed out for being incompetent, and you definitely won't see any kind of game over screen if the aforementioned nasties end up running amok in your mining levels. The stakes, then, are quite low, which is probably a good indication of whether you'll get on with SteamWorld Build, and how much you'll get out of it.

The most endearing aspect of the SteamWorld series is how each of its games relates to one another despite their disparate genres. From tower defense to turn-based RPG, each title offers a unique spin on a specific gameplay experience while adhering to a shared mythos, resulting in a fun collection of games that coalesce thematically. SteamWorld Build, Thunderful's city-builder/RTS hybrid, serves as the latest iteration of this formula. Sporting streamlined genre mechanics, intuitiv…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The best PC gaming monitors can run the gamut from ultrawide 8k screens curved like the spacetime around Jupiter, to bespoke esports monitors that refresh faster than the Ticketmaster page for a Taylor Swift concert. But if all you want is for your PC games to look nice while spending as little as humanly possible, here's a screen you can stick on your desk for less than £75 this Black Friday weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gaming laptops are a tougher proposition at a time when the Steam Deck offers portable PC gaming at a fraction of the cost. Yet while Valve's handheld is great for playing indie games and older AAA titles, there are some circumstances where it's simply not fit for purpose. It isn't really suited for twitchy multiplayer shooters, while glossy ray traced experiences are beyond its capabilities. So if you're after that kind of gaming on the go, a laptop remains ideal, and you can get a great portable gaming device for less than a grand this Black Friday weekend.

Now that journey seems to be an end. News of a patch and some DLC characters earlier this week came alongside the news that these updates would the game's last - meaning that an in-progress story mode will never be completed and certain crowdfunded rewards will never be delivered.

In a famous scripted sequence during which a long, green tentacle busts through a window and drags away a scientist, the scientist and the tentacle would be mis-aligned, making it look like the scientist floated out of the window of his own volition.

Not anymore. After over twenty years, Valve programmer Ben Burbank has fixed the bug - and explained how he did it.

I'm glad Pixar used computer animation to tell great stories, but in watching the 24-minute trailer for the technology underpinning Star Citizen, I have come to realise: swooping the camera through outerspace and up to a man's sweaty brow, at least, is actually pretty cool, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon doesn't specifically list this as a Black Friday deal. But it's certainly a bargain that you can take advantage of this Black Friday weekend. AMD's Ryzen 5 5600X processor is available for just either side of half-price, depending on which side of the pond you live on. Regardless, that's a big chunk off one of the best gaming CPUs around.


When Katharine reviewed the 5600X back in 2020, she called it "a stonkingly fast gaming CPU". It's a six-core, twelve thread processor, with each of its Vermeer processors providing speedy single-core performance, making it an ideal CPU for playing both modern multithreaded games, and older single-thread titles. There are of course plenty of faster CPUs around these days, but you'll pay significantly more for those, and it's only prudent to do so if you're looking to get the highest framerates at 1080p. If you're gaming at 4k, then it's your GPU that'll be doing most of the heavy lifting, and your funds are better spent there.


It's also worth noting that the 5600X is highly power efficient, with a TDP of just 65 watts. This makes it both more economical and more environmentally friendly that a lot of CPUs, an important consideration if your energy bills are making you wince.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RAM is rarely the first consideration when upgrading a PC, as it has a much smaller impact on performance compared to a better processor or a spanking new GPU. But you also won't get without far it, and we are slowly heading toward the point where more RAM is preferable. This year brought a scare when Star Wars: Jedi Survivor seemingly needed a minimum 32GB of RAM. Luckily that turned out to be an error in the system requirements, but as the size and detail of video game worlds exerts greater demand on load times, RAM will become more important. And if you want to get ahead of the game(s), you can get 32GB of rock solid ram for less than £50 this Black Friday weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's typical to think of external SSDs as a place to store the things you don't typically look at very often, like all those photos of your food you've taken. For goodness sake, just eat it. If a meal's worth remembering, then your brain will cling to the memories of those flavours for all they're worth. Anyway, external SSDs have other applications too. The right external drive can be a great place to store games, whether that's big games that you're not playing at the moment, or just as your standard install for smaller, lighter games. If that sounds useful to you, then you can currently get a discount on the best External SSD for gaming this Black Friday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re someone who struggles with desk space, a tenkeyless keyboard could be a useful way to maximise your desktop area. By slicing off the rarely used numpad keys, a TKL board gives you a little extra room to wiggle your mouse, or actually put a cup of coffee to one side rather than jamming it somewhere between your keyboard and your monitor. The only problem with TKL boards is they tend to be slightly more expensive than their bulkier counterparts, meaning you often end up paying extra money for less keyboard overall. But if you are in the market for a slimmer typing solution, then right now you can get £100 off one of the best TKL keyboards this Black Friday.

Since its official reveal in June 2021, Palworld has raised eyebrows with its vibrant, expansive world teeming with dozens of monsters ripe for catching but in greater fidelity than Pokémon’s recent entries. In addition to capturing them and harnessing their abilities in battle, you can also wield realistic firearms and other weapons to blast them apart or, more hilariously, arm your cuddly critters with some serious heat.
“Pokémon with guns” has become the shorthand description of Palworld, but the experience packs in survival mechanics, base-building, a central narrative, and other bells and whistles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Videogames are full of loops. Often, the loop isn't just a loop in space but a loop of labour, a loop in time. It's a repeated task with a touch of variation from cycle to cycle, typically associated with a character progression system of some kind. The classic one is the town-dungeon loop in an action-RPG such as Diablo 4. You sally forth into the depths with sword and shield, slaughter a bunch of blameless goblins, then orbit triumphantly back to the village square with its 24/7 forge and bustling adventurer's guild. Then off you go, once again, with a Sword +1 and a shield now bearing a Goblin Magnet. There are straightforward equivalents in multiplayer, especially in the wake of Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare - sign in, play a few matches, harvest some XP, unlock a new laser sight, equip it, play a few more matches with +5% to your aim.

Miles Morales is a comic book character created to represent people of color.
Leading up to the 2008 election, which resulted in the United States’ first African American president, Barack Obama, Marvel wanted to "take a good look" at one of their icons to reimagine as African American. A few years later, when an internet campaign pushed Community actor Donald Glover to play Spider-Man, the icon was chosen, and writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli created Miles. Every iteration of the character continues this legacy of representation, and Insomniac Games’ Spider-Man 2 is no different.

Little Goody Two Shoes is a life simulator adventure dating game hybrid full of secrets and mutually exclusive options that encourage replays. Going into it blind definitely heightened the sense of enjoyable confusion, and the joy of gradually going from "is... is this gay?" to "oh this is super gay" and "is this a game about hiding secret gay relationships from the backwards villagers" to "oh this is totally about being secretly gay and also automatically covering for a witch because these people can eat it".

Our predictions are in fact not as outlandish as you might think, although there are gorillas, obviously.


Alongside this we talk about the games we're playing right now (largely Darktide, it turns out), and dish up some recommendations. We also spent like a third of our recording time playing a deranged Age Of Empires 2-themed RPG using an abbreviated D20 system of Nate's devising, but don't worry, I edited it down quite a lot. Apologies for my poor mic quality!

You can listen above, or on on Spotify, iTunes, Stitcher, or Pocket Casts. You can find the RSS feed here, and you can discuss the episode on our Discord channel, which has a dedicated room for podcast chat.

Free-to-play games are not universally bad; plenty of brilliant design ideas, engaging stories, and fun mechanics can be found in games with no upfront admission fee. But once a game’s goal shifts from singular experience to long-term engagement, any excitement I may have folds in on itself and disappears like Pac-Man.
It all stems from my desire for experiences, not obligations.
In free-to-play and comparable models, success is marked by player engagement. The more rounds a player queues into and the longer they play, the more likely they are to engage with the monetized elements. And the best way to encourage that engagement is to incentivize players to return. Dai…]]></summary>

Black Friday now provides the chance to grab one for even less, with good-quality partner cards having fallen as low as £550 in the UK and $515 in the US.

No time like the present, then, to net yourself a top-quality storage extender for your Steam Deck or Steam Deck OLED.


It is of course possible to swap out the Deck’s internal SSD for something bigger, and if it were a desktop PC, normally that would be the way to go. But replacing components in a tightly-designed, hyper-compacted machine like Valve’s handheld is a far trickier business, and just doesn’t have the same appeal when a fast microSD like the Pro Plus is right there. Now, you can get plenty of extra space, an incomparably easier "installation," and performance that still comes remarkably close to NVMe SSD level, all for up to £38 off.

Fast Forward five years and BallisticNG has been regularly updated since that initial launch, and a new trailer to mark its release on GOG is keen to brag about

Every year around this time, a few friends and family members ask for game-buying advice. That’s great, as I love having the opportunity to help someone find gaming experiences that will lead to a great time. But it can be especially challenging if the giftee in question is a younger child who wants to play games, but is perhaps too young or inexperienced with the hobby to know what they might enjoy.

One of the most notable features is how RGG rethought its classic brawler combat. Protagonist Kazuma Kiryu now has two fighting stances, Yakuza and Agent, the latter of which comes with a host of new secret-agent tools, such as an exploding cigarette, a Spider-Man-like cable he can use to whip enemies around, and so on. 
We recently had a chat with RGG series chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto – who we spoke with last year about the future of the studio – to learn how Gaiden's new combat together, maintaining the series' identity despite how much has changed over the years, and why RGG doesn't look to…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cheap graphics cards are practically mythical these days, which is great news for gaming obsessed unicorns and centaurs, less so for us mere mortals trapped in boring old reality. But there is one last torchbearer of the budget GPU, and weirdly enough that's Intel. If you happen to live in the US, then you can get your hands on the best cheap 1080p  graphics card for a smidge more than $200 for Black Friday.


Now I know the idea of Intel making graphics cards sounds almost as preposterous as horses with horns, but they've been at it for a while. Granted, they've not been especially good at it for most of that time. The original launch of the Arc series was pretty disappointing. But Intel have worked to imrprove the performance of their GPUs, and now the Arc A750 is an excellent 1080p offering.


It's also a perfectly acceptable card for those looking to make their first-steps into the world of Ray-tracing. As James notes in his review "if you’re specifically looking to try ray tracing on the cheap, know that the Arc A750 turns the tables on the RX 6650 XT with these kinds of settings. Where the A750 produced 47fps in Hitman, the RX 6650 XT could only manage 29fps, an even steeper drop from its respective rasterised performance."

Charles Harte talks about Chants of Sennaar, a puzzle game about language, and Kyle Hilliard talks about Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, a game about beating up people on the streets of a fictional Japanese city. Kyle also touches on Assassin's Creed VR before the duo moves on to the main course: ranking fictional video game birds on criteria like how tasty do they look and how bad would we feel about eating them.

It's a time of year for gratitude, togetherness, repeatedly attempting to explain my job to older relatives, and most importantly, a time when a lot of people come together to eat one really big bird. But here's the thing. Why do we always eat the same kind of bird? I mean, turkey is fine and all, but why not branch out a bit? Why not chicken, or quail, or pheasant?
And that got me thinking – why limit my daydreaming to real-life birds when there's so much delicious-looking poultry in video games? Sure, not every video game bird would be tasty, but it's worth assessing in case I ever get Jumanji-ed into a game one day.
Here's my rating of video game birds based on how good they'd be for Thanksgiving dinner.

There’s a small handful of 13th-gen chips at good prices, but nothing on par with the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X or Ryzen 7800X3D that Will highlighted earlier this week.


I have, however, spotted a surprise £20 discount on the Intel Core i7-14700K, which just happens to be the only CPU in the new 14th-gen lineup that actually is worth buying. And so, just as it carried the Raptor Lake Refresh launch, so too must it redeem Intel’s Black Friday showing.

In my multiplayer review, I say that it preys on nostalgia, because it does! The game's multiplayer schtick is all about bringing back classic maps to act as a smokescreen for a lack of direction. At least, that's what I think.
I find all this nostalgia stuff interesting, mainly because it's coincided with three other events in my own personal timeline (Chapter 29 Season 11, you could say): A League Of Legends pro-player called Faker, the resurgence of a badminton star, and Fortnite's own OG event. The thing that separates them all from COD? A plan.

Developed by Polish team Frozen Way, whose other projects include, erm, Hairdresser Simulator, it casts you as Hennessy, a human xenobiologist who is starting afresh on the alien planet of Sota7.
As in Unknown Worlds’ survival sim, you’ll search various biomes for resources, build solar-powered habitats on stilts with nice, wide windows, and gradually amass a database of local animals and plants. Unlike in Subnautica, you won’t be constantly at risk of suffocation.

It might have more entries in it than any other series out there and it won’t be slowing down anytime soon.

As a result, ranking the Final Fantasy series can be highly contentious. Everyone has a lot of love for the first entry they played, and then there are heavy hitters like Final Fantasy X and VII, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Both the Steam Deck and Steam Deck OLED come bundled with cases – new and improved ones, if you get a 1TB OLED – so it wouldn’t initially make sense to invest in a third-party one. But Steam Deck accessories can take many forms, and I’ve been particularly convinced by the case style that combines a space-saving protective skin with a tougher removeable cover. Since the Dbrand Project Killswitch isn’t playing Black Friday ball, it falls to my other favourite, JSAUX’s ModCase, to provide the bargains.


It works thusly: instead of taking your Steam Deck in and out of a zip-up sarcophagus every time you want to play it on the move, you simply leave the handheld wrapped in the ModCase’s snug, rubbery skin, simultaneously protecting it and adding grip as you hold it. The front cover simply snaps on and off as needed. It’s a lighter, more compact alternative to a full case that, I can say from experience, absolutely shields the precious Deck effectively enough for everyday bag duty. As the name suggests, it’s modular as well, so you can mount other accessories (like kickstands, power banks and even a secondary cooling fan) to the back of the skin.


Just want the case? No bother, that’s down from $30 from $26. There’s no UK version of the JSAUX store, unfortunately, though JSAUX ships internationally. Just click through the link below, and select which kit you'd like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this is the second Crucial P5 Plus deal we’ve posted about in two days, but hey, it’s Black Friday week. ‘Tis the season. Besides, this time there’s something for us Britain-dwelling lot as well, as the 2TB P5 Plus’s price has been slashed 60% to £88 on Amazon UK – the lowest it’s ever been.


This is, to be clear, an almost mystifyingly small amount of money for a 2TB NVMe SSD that’s also capable of real high-end transfer speeds and game load times. Maybe not to the standards of its successor, the Crucial T500, but this is still a competitively quick-acting drive with oodles of space for game installations. The same goes for its heatsink-equipped edition, which also happens to be on sale in the US at $88, making it (currently) cheaper than the non-heatsink 2TB model. Good deals all round, then – told you ‘twas the season.

The project has weathered several storms over the years and thanks to Spanish football league, LaLiga, another one is brewing right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Made by solo dev Andy Brophy, Knuckle Sandwich is a turn-based RPG that's about guiding a bloke through an island paradise and eventually uncovering some weird mystery. Its main hook? Turn-based battles are filled with WarioWare-style minigames, many of which are unique to the kooky residents or rats you come up against. Unfortunately, I'd say its main hook is actually its most painful barb, and one you're barely able to extract by flicking some switches in the settings menu. A shame then, as exploring its strange world and absorbing its bonkers story beats is a wonderful thing marred by dire fights.

You might as well call Halo "GunMap: Alien Crowd Control", or Baldur's Gate 3 "TownDungeon: Party Enhancement Simulator". But the project beneath the moniker has something to it. Announced just today and created by small Brazilian team MadMozer, it's a first-person, multiplayer-focussed, Unreal Engine deathgame that traps you in a randomly generated mansion with a bunch of archetypal horror movie munsters - demon clowns, cursed puppets, toothy ghouls and hooded axe-murderers.

To gift to yourself? I believe so. This deal applies to six different DualSense colour options too, from PS5-standard white to a cool blue and a dubiously useful camo pattern.

This one from Monoprice doesn't cost a lot either, as it has been discounted from $10 to just $3 for Black Friday. 
It's a fast option too, sporting 10Gbps data transfers and rapid charging at up to three amps. In fact, it hits the USB 3.1 Gen 2 standard (what a great naming scheme) and it's a simple, pocketable one metre or 3.3 feet long.

Alongside animation studio Illumination, it had teamed up with Red Wing Shoes to make Mario’s shoes from the movie, not as a line of shoes for sale, but rather a hyper-realistic version of the boots – odd proportions and all – to be displayed at the official Nintendo Store in New York City.

The interest in Mario’s shoes began with the movie’s first teaser poster, where the fidelity of Mario’s footwear blew fans away. People wanted to know more about them, which led Nintendo and Illumination to contact Red Wing Shoes, a Minnesota company specializing in work boots, about making some. “We got the call, and naturally, we’re like, ‘Well, Mario is the world’…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online's highest tier, the expansion pack, have access to an ever-growing catalog of modern and classic games, including a small library of N64 games. In December, that expansion pack is expanding a little more, as Jet Force Gemini is coming to the service.
First released in 1999, Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter developed by Rare, the studio originally known for the Banjo-Kazooie games, but most recently known for Sea of Thieves. It's set on a sci-fi alien world, where players blast through hordes of insect-like creatures.
The most recent way players could experience the game on modern consoles was through Rare Replay, a compilation of classic Rare games released on the Xbox One in 2015.  For a refresher on the game, check out this 60-second rundown Rare put out a few years back.


The Switch Online currently includes 26 other N64 games, including the recently added Excitebike 64. It also includes Game Boy Advance games, Sega Genesis games, and DLC content for popular Switch titles, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the first ways Fortnite was able to prove its mainstream success was by introducing popular real-world people into the game. Whether it's Travis Scott, Lebron James, or Patrick Mahomes, it's become a sort of Hollywood Star of Fame to be featured in Epic Games' hit shooter. Today. Marshall Mathers joins the club – Eminem is coming to Fortnite. 
The Grammy winner will be added to the game's item shop on November 29. The image above shows the three versions of the rapper that will be available for purchase. From left to right, they're called Rap Boy, Slim Shady, and Marshall Never More. This release comes a few days ahead of Fortnite's Big Bang event, which is set to happen on December 2 at 2 PM Eastern. Alongside whatever world-altering event phenomena Epic plans to introduce, Eminem will be performing a live concert. Attendees will receive the Big Bang loading screen, featured at the head of this article.
Fortnite has been in gaming news a lot recently, thanks to the rollout of Fortnite OG, a record-setting new season that throws players back in time to the earliest maps in the game. It's also come under fire for new rules about which skins are allowed in certain creator-made worlds: you can see their response to this controversy here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After four seasons of brand new content, Epic Games injected a healthy dose of nostalgia into Fornite Chapter 4's fifth season, officially called Season OG, by bringing back the Chapter 1 map for players to experience once more. Season OG has included weekly updates to add items from Chapter 1's various seasons, too, making it a fun romp through what Fortnite was like years ago. However, Season OG ends on December 2, which is also when Fortnite's next live event, The Big Bang, goes live. 
The Big Bang begins on Saturday, December 2, at 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, and Epic says, "This event marks a new beginning for Fortnite." 
✅ Unforgettable event

November 21, 2023
Before the event begins, Epic says players will see The Big Bang in the Battle Royale tile in the Discover section of Fortnite 30 minutes prior to its start; that way, you can jump in before the event starts to link up with friends and get your cosmetics in order. And speaking of friends, The Big Bang will support parties of up to four players. 
The Big Bang will be available anywhere you play the most current build of Fortnite, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. If you won't be near a dedicated gaming device during the event, you can check it out using Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Amazon Luna services to play Fortnite via cloud streaming on your computer or mobile device. 
"To prepare for The Big Bang, Fortnite experiences made by Epic will be disable starting 12 p.m. ET on December 2," Epic writes in a blog post. "Creator-made experiences will remain enabled until downtime for Fortnite v28.00 starts at 11:30 p.m. ET."
While waiting for The Big Bang event, read up on everything you need to know about Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG, and then read about how Epic says it's aware it missed the mark with a recent cosmetic restriction update for Fortnite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt Red released Phantom Liberty, the first and last expansion for its 2020 RPG, Cyberpunk 2077, in September. We loved it – find out why in Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review here – and if you enjoyed the base game, it's not an expansion to miss. Currently, it's only available for purchase as an add-on to Cyberpunk 2077, but if you haven't yet picked it up, it might be worth waiting just a couple more weeks. That's because CDPR has revealed Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion in one single package.
Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 5, and will be released in both a digital format and physical. Check out the box art below: 
Big news… Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition arrives on December 5th in digital AND physical form for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC!
#Cyberpunk2077 story as well as a new spy-thriller adventure in the #PhantomLiberty expansion in one package. 🔥 pic.twitter.com/IOBPCdTXFU
November 21, 2023
All that CDPR has shared about this new edition is the tweet above so it remains to be seen if the Ultimate Edition includes any new goodies or enhancements. Given Phantom Liberty and the Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 update improved the game in big ways, reworking and revamping several of its mechanics in the process, it's unlikely the Ultimate Edition will include any changes in that vein. Only time will tell, though. 
For more, read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review and then read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review. After that, read about the things to remember and know before starting Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, and then check out this feature about how the team behind the expansion created its spy-thriller soundtrack. Read about this live-action Cyberpunk 2077 project that's now in the works, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yakuza: Like A Dragon was a very silly game in spite of its dramatic narrative, but its follow-up, Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, looks to give it a run for its money. Between letting Ichiban ride a dolphin and its Animal Crossing-style city-building mode, fans of the franchise’s goofball nature should be in for a treat, and a new batch of screenshots highlight this.
The images provide looks at Ichiban, Kiryu Joryu, and their returning friends, such as Nanba, Adachi, and Saeko, kicking butt in a variety of classes and looking absurd doing so. Other familiar faces will be playable party members for the first time, such as Seonhee, who is shown brutalizing opponents with a whip in the images. It's clear that Hawaii will never be the same once these guys are done with it. 


Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 26. You can learn more about the game and see it in action in this pair of trailers. Be sure to also read our review of its direct predecessor, Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, here.]]></summary>

The Talos Principle II often left me staring at my screen in awe. Sometimes, from sheer intimidation in the face of a seemingly formidable puzzle. Other times,  from my incredulous pride after unraveling said problem. But most of all, the experience regularly gave me pause as I pondered a philosophical idea or argument that challenged my viewpoints on the nature of existence and humanity’s place in the cosmos. These moments spurred me to solve the game’s 100+ puzzles in search of answers, and I’m largely satisfied with what I discovered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth arrives in February, which isn’t too far on the horizon, so Square Enix is getting players prepared with a cinematic refresher of its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake. The company pairs that with a batch of fresh screenshots and art, including the first glimpse of the Highwind airship. 
The video sees Red XIII narrate the broad strokes of the 2020 adventure. While it doesn’t touch on the finer details and background of the characters, it provides a decent summary that's perhaps better served as a reminder for fans who played Remake rather than someone coming into Rebirth completely fresh. Unfortunately, the recap doesn’t touch on the events of the Intermission expansion that introduces Yuffie, who joins the party in Rebirth, so unfamiliar players will have to do their own homework on that. 


Square has released some new images, including a piece of art depicting Aerith in front of the Highwind. The screenshots show off the town of Kalm, the summon Kujata, the abandoned Mythril Mine, and a few side characters. Oh, and Chadley is there too. 

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on February 29 for PlayStation 5. You can watch us play two demos of the game in this video and read our hands-on impressions here. You can also get the answers to some of Rebirth's burning questions in this interview with Square Enix.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 11/20/23:
Last week, developer Epic Games updated Fortnite to include a new rating restriction that applies to certain skins. Depending on a Fortnite skin, it might only be useable on a creative island with a T rating, meaning the Resident Evil Claire Redfield skin, which features a pistol in a holster on her thigh, can't be used on islands rated less than Teen. Players were upset with this change as it made skins they paid real money for (often $10 to $20 per skin) unusable in all the ways they might have previously been usable. 
Epic said only 7 percent of Fortnite skins are only usable on Teen-rated islands, at the time, but it's clear enough skins are affected to have the community unhappy with this update.
Over the weekend, Epic released a statement through the official Fortni…]]></summary>

Back in the '90s, Nintendo played faster and looser with its library of characters. Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Mario RPG, the original and the remake, is full of secrets, references to other video game franchises, and a whole lot more. Arguably the most interesting secret boss of the original game was Culex. He is not a Final Fantasy character, but he looks and feels like one and features Final Fantasy music and sound effects.
Culex appears in Super Mario RPG remake as he did in the original game, which is to say he is a pixelated, 2D creature. He also features the original throwback soundtrack and sound effects. You access him the same way, too – by buying fireworks and trading them with the little girl nearby in Moletown for a shiny stone. You then use that shiny stone in Monstro Town on the locked door.
However, upon defeat, Culex teases another encounter in the future, which is where thin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck OLED releases today, providing a new avenue for game players (especially those with big Steam libraries) to take their gaming experience on the go. The new OLED models (one at 512 GB and another at 1TB storage) effectively replace the original release as the new Steam Deck flagship hardware. The older 64 GB and 512 GB LCD models are being phased out, while the 256 GB LCD will remain available at a reduced price.
Steam Deck OLED is not a fundamentally new platform. In many ways that matter, our review of the original still stands, and snagging one of the older LCD screen models is now an even more substantial value at the lower price. However, several of the concerns that surfaced in that review have been remedied by the new model – enough that a new evaluation is warranted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month, we launched a documentary called "Violence Is Inevitable: The Making of Humanity." And then, in a bit of a meta twist, we hung out with Humanity co-developer and publisher Enhance and discussed how we made our making-of documentary. Even cooler, we made a Game Informer level within Humanity – and you can play it now.
All this happened on the "HUMANITY Hub Community Stream," where myself (Blake) and Alex Van Aken discussed why we decided to make a documentary on Humanity, how we crafted the video, and even cutting-room floor content that didn't make the final product. We closed the show by putting our collective brains together to make a level based on the GI logo.
You can check out an archived version of the stream below:


By no means is our Humanity level an official partnership between Enhance and GI, but it's certainly a fun way to end a project that was a months-long labor of love. To play for yourself, either search via the name "GAME INFORMER FUN!" in the game's User Stages options or the stage ID: 013-020-5453.

By any measure, the PlayStation Portal is a very targeted and specific-use product, and it’s worth clarifying out of the gate: This is not a standalone console in any way. Rather, the Portal allows you to connect to a PS5 you already have in your home over your Wi-Fi network (or any Wi-Fi network) and play the games you have downloaded on that PS5 from other places around your home. You can also connect the Portal to other Wi-Fi networks outside of your home, though our testing found inconsistent results when doing so. Regardless of where you connect f…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Put your sleuthing caps on, detectives—it’s time to solve some mysteries! We are proud to announce that a whole batch of HeR Interactive’s Nancy Drew games are now ready for public testing:
In Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. 
Nancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.
In Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.
And if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.
The games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!
Kingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. 
Escape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.
Both games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.
To play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!
