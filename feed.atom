For the month before the 3DS and Wii U eShops close for new purchases on 27th March, each day we're going to highlight a specific eShop game for one of those consoles and give a short pitch as to why we think it deserves your love and attention — before it's too late. The chance to add these to your library will be gone for good soon and, for one reason or another, these eShop-exclusives are close to our hearts.

Final Fantasy X-2 first hit the PlayStation 2 20 years ago in Japan, on March 13, 2003. It was a very unusual kind of game for Square to make, both in tone and it being a direct sequel to a previous Final Fantasy game. But 20 years later, I'd argue it's a stellar entry in the series, in ways well-exemplified by its dressphere system.
Spheres are the core of a lot of technology in Spira, throughout most of Final Fantasy X. After the events and revelations of FFX, though, Spheres suddenly become much more in-demand. Team YRP, or Yuna, Rikku, and Paine, form up as sphere hunters to try and track down lost, rare spheres for big rewards.

Back in January, we ran down every Zelda-themed Nintendo console out there in an attempt to find which one you lovely lot thought was the best. There were a lot of these Hylian designs, with the series clearly standing as one of Nintendo's most popular choices in the special edition design room, but these are dwarfed in number by the Pokémon designs, which require a Pokédex-length list all of their own.
Ok, that might be a bit of an over-exaggeration, but the point stands that throughout the history of Nintendo's special edition console releases, there have been a lot of Pokémon designs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The harvest won't happen this spring
It looks like giant robots and a quiet life on the farm will have to wait a bit longer to merge. Developer Frame Break has announced it's delaying the Early Access launch of its mech-centered farming adventure Lightyear Frontier.
The open-world farming sim was set to hit PC, Xbox One, and  Xbox Series X|S sometime in spring 2023, with Game Pass access in tow. Now, in a new post from the developers, it sounds like the game needs a bit more time. No launch window has been set, though Frame Break says it will communicate one as soon as it can.
"With Lightyear Frontier, we want to make sure that you feel powerful and engaged in the mech while starting your own homestead, constructing a variety of structures, farming exotic alien crops, and exploring on a vibrant and familiar world.
"Not only do we want to design the game to be fun, but also well-balance with each aspect of the game intertwining with one another, and we remain committed to building a thoughtfully-designed experience and continuing the conversation with our community in the process."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dzr7uSd-4Bc
A new frontier
I hadn't been following Lightyear Frontier until earlier this year, when it was part of an ID@Xbox spotlight. But the entire concept is really neat, and I do like that it accounts for co-op too. The plan, as detailed on the Lightyear Frontier Steam page, is to let up to three friends explore and farm with you.
Running around a new world, finding new resources, and cultivating them all within your very own mech sounds like a fantastic premise. While the delay's indefinite for now, here's hoping the extra time lets Frame Break get everything set in place for their futuristic farm.

I could look at Zelda: Breath of the Wild images and videos indefinitely. I mean, I certainly have for the past six years, and I don't see that trend stopping anytime soon. Nintendo's official "Hyrule Discovery" series, which presents regions from the game like a real-life travel video/magazine spread, is proof of that.
Incredibly, a ton of effort went into the project overall, with a full breakdown of many aspects of the Lanaryu region: including Zora's Domain, and swimming around the surrounding area. There's a short strategy guide on taking out Lynels, and an overview of most of the plants and animals found in the region. There's even an adorable "sponsored by" ad for the Seabed Inn.
Although the page is technically part of Nintendo of Japan's site, you can use in-browser translation tools to get the gist. Given that most of it is visual anyway, you don't need to comprehend all of the text to really get a lot out of perusing these. There are so many things that are going on in the background of Zelda: Breath of the Wild that you don't even notice until you see them right in front of you.
You can find a link to all of the current volumes below. So far, Nintendo has covered the Hebra, Eldin, and Lanaryu regions. That leaves the Akkala, Central Hyrule, Faron, Gerudo, and Necluda regions as potential follow-ups.
Zelda: Breath of the Wild Hyrule Discovery links (landing page):
Volume 1: Hebra region/Rito Village
Volume 2: Eldin region/Death Mountain
Volume 3: Lanaryu region/Zora's Domain

Next week, Atelier fans will be able to get their hands on Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End & the Secret Key, the latest game in the sprawling RPG series that's the scourge of concise headline writers across the gaming web. Originally scheduled for launch in February, this third entry with Ryza at the helm arrives on 24th March and will be the 15th(ish — it gets a little complicated due to delisted non-DX releases) game in the series to appear on Nintendo Switch.
That's a bumper set of quality RPG-ing from Gust and Koei Tecmo, and with compilation bundles available for a couple of the sub-series (the Dusk Trilogy and Mysterious Trilogy), it's likely that any Atelier fan with a passing interest has multiple entries sitting on their Switch. With Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist Of Salburg lined up for a July launch and bringing everything full circle with a remake of the first game in the series, there's plenty more alchemy in Switch gamers' futures, it seems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To track the public understanding of modern-day indie gaming is to look at the small-scale independent development scene through an Anglo-centric lens. While it would be unfair to ignore the hobbyists programming experiences in BASIC on their ZX Spectrum or similar, it’s commonly accepted that indie gaming as we recognise it today has its roots in the early days of the internet and the Y2K boom, when Flash, Gamemaker Studio and similar tools allowed things like Cave Story and N to grow. With online distribution further helping games like Bastion, Journey and World Of Goo to flourish, the definition of the indie game became: a title with big ambitions and creativity grown from small budgets and teams.


It's not entirely wrong, but it has obscured decades of hobby development that was once at the forefront - not just the stories of BBC Micro solo-development stars, but similar ones of hobby development from around the world. In Japan, the doujin markets of Comiket and beyond serve as a home for hobbyists to make, sell and share their creations. It is the doujin gaming scene that helped major studios like Fate/ studio Type-Moon, and franchises like 07th Expansion and Touhou Project, flourish in a way that would never be possible otherwise.

While the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom might just be the most highly-anticipated video game of all time, the announcement that the title would cost $70 on release opened up the conversation about how much we are all willing to pay for a game in 2023.
Doug Bowser, the head of Nintendo USA, has recently defended the price point of the Breath of the Wild follow-up in an interview with AP News, in which he reaffirmed the company's stance that this is not Nintendo's standard pricing going forward and all games will be judged on an individual basis.

Not content with having beaten its own concurrent player record just last month, Valve's tactical shooter Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) smashed its own numbers out of the sky this past weekend, with a staggering 1.4 million players simultaneously logged in on Steam on Saturday, March 11.
As noted by Eurogamer, this incredible feat was achieved, in part, by a Twitter campaign that saw the community come together to spotlight the live 'n' kicking nature of the legendary release, which is celebrating over a decade on the Steam platform. A peak player count of 1,470,183 was recorded on Saturday, beating out the previous record of 1,308,963, recorded back in February. The official CS:GO team took to Twitter to thank the community for showing out.
https://twitter.com/CSGO/status/1634576070770057221?s=20
Quote your Source
Another reason that CS:GO is seeing a record resurgence in its (already healthy) community is likely due to the recent rumors that the near 20-year-old shooter is potentially about to receive a major upgrade, with whispers on the web suggesting that a Source 2 edition is currently preparing to launch — And might even be with us as soon as the next few months, even weeks. The update, if it indeed exists, is expected to bolster CS:GO's connectivity, textures, visual support, and servers. It should be noted that developer Valve is yet to confirm that a CS:GO Source 2 upgrade is incoming.
Still, with such amazing numbers clearly still on deck, CS:GO has proven without a doubt that it has a community, healthier and arguably more dedicated, than many newer and more expensive shooter franchises. Much like Valve's own Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a title that appears set to just run, and run, and run. Here's to the next decade of twitchy, trigger-happy action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And we lived beneath the waves
After four years(!?) in Early Access, horrifying space-submarine simulator Barotrauma is finally getting its full release today. The 1.0 version comes with a number of additions and fixes to shore everything up and fill out the full package.
Barotrauma is the story of humanity trying to survive on Jupiter’s Moon, Europa. Because its surface is so badly irradiated, the only way to survive is beneath the waves in submarines. You’re tasked with building up your submarine and exploring the space-oceans. There are missions to run and alien ruins to delve into, all while enduring the terrors of the deep.

This is also a primarily multi-player experience. There are bots available if you want to play by yourself, but the experience is tailored to dragging your friends beneath the waves. You can cram up to 16 people into a single water-coffin and go exploring Davey Jones’ locker together.  There’s even a traitor option that randomly assigns a player to the role of saboteur, just in case you or any of your friends are feeling sus.
The final patch adjusts the faction and reputation system, and focuses on end-game campaign stuff. The patch notes can be found here.
At the time of writing, Barotrauma has enjoyed over 30,000 user reviews on Steam, with 93% of them being positive. While I haven’t personally delved the deep, I’ve heard a few indie devs speak highly of the title on social media.
Barotrauma is currently available on PC, with the full version coming sometime today.

To grab the TMP for yourself, just start the demo up like normal. Head to the lodge, through all the cutscenes and past the first enemy encounter. Then, when you're going to take the stairs up and out, open your case. Drop everything.

In addition to general maintenance, Nintendo is also still addressing Splatoon and Mario Kart 8 "vulnerabilities" on Wii U, which were reported earlier this month. That situation is still ongoing.

Speaking in an interview with Press Start, Hirabayashi Yoshiaki has stated that the divisive rain in the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake will be adjusted in a day one patch.
The rain has appeared in various trailers, depicting Leon Kennedy and Ashley Graham’s escape from the church. Numerous people on social media have pointed it out as overbearing and distracting. Essays were written, and videos were published. Discontent is a rarity in the community around our shared hobby of video games, but it seems that this was enough to stoke the quiet embers into a fiery vortex of anger.

Hopefully, the soothing words of producer Hirabayashi Yoshiaki will quell the hate-tempest. Speaking to James Berich at Press Start, he said, “We’ve seen everyone’s reaction to the rain effects, and we are working on a day-one patch to make adjustments.”
I don’t think it looks terrible, to begin with. Big fat droplets of sky-water. Have you seen the rain in some games? At the same time, there’s always room for improvement, so I’ll wait until I see what is changed in the final product before starting my rain-loving counter-movement.
Resident Evil 4 launches March 24 on PS4, PS5, PC, Xbox Series X|S. Right now, you can take its demo for a test drive, but you won’t see any rain.

Last week, I was given a preview build of the upcoming first-person zombie-smasher and played about the first five hours of it in single-player, taking in sights like a community of gated millionaire mansions, a slightly less palacious but still ridiculous neighbourhood, and an upmarket hotel styled after the famous Beverly Hills Hotel. They're all full of weird stuff.
There's a panic room where a guy turned into a zombie mid-demo tape recording. Actress Emma, who you're battening down the hatches with, has a truly awful full-length Burt Reynoldsian portrait of herself. A shared house called the GOAT PEN, where a team of influencers all live together, has a set for a video series called LIT OR SH!T, and a whiteboard with the script for an apology video. I ask the game director David Stenton if it's low hanging fruit, or if there's no such thing with Hollywood rich people. "Of course, it's low hanging fruit!" he says, laughing. "And also, there's no such thing."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Homicidal All-Stars, the turn-based strategy game set inside a dystopian, Running Man-style TV show, has both a new name and a final release date, publishers Good Shepherd Entertainment have announced today. Releasing on May 2nd, Homicidal All-Stars will now be known as Showgunners, and... I dig it. It's much snappier than Homicidal All-Stars, and feels more in keeping with its deadly reality game show setting. And to really hammer home its reality show audience vibes, developers Artificer have released a new Steam demo today with a dedicated Twitch mode, letting streaming audiences vote and meddle with the game's action in real-time.

The Pokémon Company International opened up a new job listing for a Corporate Development Principal a few days ago, and it looks like the position requires the candidate to have a grasp of Web3, including blockchain.
The listing was spotted on TPCi's Greenhouse page (via LinkedIn) where all of the company's job listings are posted, and caught the attention of many Pokémon fans online thanks to @pory_leaks on Twitter. Initially, the job description seems harmless, with the role specialising in corporate strategy, relations, and development and innovation. But in the 'What you'll bring' section, it seems one of the requirements is that the successful candidate is knowledgeable in the world of Web3.

The DLC for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe really hits its stride with Wave 3, dropping the best courses we’d seen in the Booster Course Pass. From the brilliantly simple reinvention of Boo Lake to the charming Christmas-themed jaunt that is Merry Mountain, it was going to be tough to surpass what Nintendo brought players in that wave.
Depending on who you ask, Booster Course Wave 4 might actually be the best set of tracks yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have at you!
Few games have enjoyed post-launch support as robust and high-quality as Dead Cells has received for the past six(!) years. Motion Twin has produced wave after wave of updates, some free and some paid, which have packed the already awesome base game with a dizzying amount of new biomes, weapons, cosmetics, and more. And all of it feels like it’s been leading up to the new Return to Castlevania DLC. Though this new update from partner developer Evil Empire — a studio made up of "ex-Motion Twin team members and new recruits" — technically only adds a few hours of additional content to the base Dead Cells experience, every inch of it is clearly crafted with love and care for Konami's spooky, vampire-slaying franchise.
You can interact with the new content right off the bat by simply talking to Richter Belmont in the Prisoner’s Quarters, and following the stairs to a new door that will take you to the outskirts of Dracula’s castle. Obviously, the goal here is to ascend the castle and defeat the freshly resurrected King of the Night himself, aided by allies like Maria Renard and Alucard. Still, Dracula has brought some friends, too, and you’ll have to battle through the likes of Medusa and Death itself to get your shot at taking on the ageless villain.

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe just got its fourth wave of DLC this week, and with it, patch notes! Don't worry, they're mostly good news.
In addition to adding support for the DLC, there's also a series of general improvements, as well as myriad issues that have been fixed. Thankfully, unlike many other first part Nintendo patch notes, those fixes are descriptive! If you've been having problems with items (like the Boo and lightning glitches), you're in luck. As for the general patch smoothing, there's "improved performance" of select characters and vehicle parts, and you can now utilize the rear view mirror in more cases (including spinning, crashing, and when you're morphing into a Bullet Bill).

Shigeru Miyamoto is a living legend, and has given myriad interviews throughout his rise to stardom. Thankfully, a new project is looking to fully chronicle his start, from start to (whenever he decides to) finish.
Spotted by Nintendo Life, Twitter user SpriteCell has collected a ton of grade A Miyamoto content. As you can see from the full site here, things are extremely comprehensive. You get a general overview of the major years of Miyamoto's career on the landing page, as well as breakdowns
Right now SpriteCell is "sitting at over 450 entries," with the aim of "collecting and summarizing every Shigeru Miyamoto interview, appearance, and writing." It's a gargantuan task given that Miyamoto is one of the longest-running and most storied figures in gaming, but this project is already a win in my book.
It's incredibly easy to just flip through and spend an entire evening on this site. For instance, I clicked on the 2010-2014 archive, and stumbled upon an Iwata Asks column about Steel Diver: an oddity I still think about from time to time. Miyamoto not only has a storied career in terms of his personal contributions to the medium; but he also rubbed elbows with some other titans of the industry. All of that is preserved here in SpriteCell's work! Now we wait for the tons of Tears of the Kingdom interviews to help fill out that 2020 to 2024 section.
If you want to contribute to this project, you can do so here, as per SpriteCell's landing page:
"If you find an interview, video, social media post, book passage or whatever else where Mr. Miyamoto speaks or writes that is not covered in the archive please contact me on twitter or e-mail me at thespritecell(at)gmail.com. Also feel free to contact me if you see a typo or if you spot some kind of formatting issue."

Speaking in an interview with GQ, (contains season one spoilers), game director Neil Druckmann and show writer/director Craig Mazin expressed their intentions for the grim tale to continue for at least two further seasons. The exceptionally dark events of video game sequel The Last of Us Part II are not expected to be encapsulated in the show's second season, with plans to expand the tale out into a third season, at the very least.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why, Why, Why, Delilah?
During this weekend's ARC World Tour festivities, developer Arc System Works took the time to reveal the next character headed to its gorgeous flagship fighter Guilty Gear Strive, and you best put on your PJs and say your prayers, as we're witnessing the return of former series antagonist, Bedman?
While the original Bedman met his end at the climax of previous release Guilty Gear Xrd - Revelator, the canny science lad has preprogrammed his psyche as an A.I. within the mechanized bed itself. And thus, piloted by his loving sister Delilah, Bedman is able to return to the ring under the amusing Pseudonym of Bedman? — which you should always pronounce in the form of a question for maximum fun effect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79fZGkcI4Yc&ab_channel=arcsystemworks
The bed itself has clearly seen better years, weathered with cracks and battle damage, but young Delilah seems to be maturing into a young woman, although one with the weight of the world, literally, on her back. It seems, from this short trailer, that Bedman? will operate independently of its sibling, who nervously follows it into battle, confused and unsure of her or her "brother's" destiny. It makes for an interesting character design, and one that, much like previous Bed...uhhh...Men, will be a confusing opponent with a somewhat vague hit/hurtbox.
I really like the design of both the Bed and Delilah herself however, I'm happy to see the Goths well-represented in the GG universe. Bedman? will join the battle on April 6, as the third character for Season Pass 2 — following Bridget and Sin Kiske. A fourth and final character will arrive in May. Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Poppin' wheelies AND heads
Bandai Namco has released a new character trailer for its visually stunning fighter Tekken 8, which remains in development for PC and Gen 9 consoles — This newest preview focuses on one of the long-running franchise's veteran fighters, Paul Phoenix, though perhaps not as we have seen him before.
While clearly the same hot-tempered, road-ripping biker of previous releases, Tekken 8's Paul seems to be leaning far more into his "nomadic drifter" status, trading in his tattered gi for a barely-held-together set of biker leathers, an unkempt, oily beard, and what appears to be a bit more bulk on his towering frame. Perhaps most notably of all, his famous stovepipe flattop has become little more than a floppy fringe, limply dangling over our boy's face. He looks a fucking mess, frankly, but I'm here for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCOWceM2nZo&ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica
Never judge a book by its cover, however, as the trailer still sees Mr. Phoenix laying down his wall-breaking, rib-crushing ways — still a master of incredibly powerful, single-strike punches and body checks. Phoenix also seems perhaps happier and more confident than he has in recent years, where the franchise has treated him as something of a joke character. Well, it looks like perhaps the comedy is over, and Paul has a punchline for you located right at the end of his balled-up fist.
Tekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch in 2023. Be sure to check out the previous trailers for Jin Kazama, Kazuya Mishima, and Nina Williams.

The Capcom Spotlight 2023 has come and gone, and the company's locked in what looks like the next few months of its publishing slate. From Resident Evil 4 to Mega Man and Ghost Trick, there were a lot of dates locked in for the next few months.
Today really seemed to focus on setting out a release calendar for Capcom heading into the summer. Some got new release dates, while others with known dates got a few new tidbits of information. There was nothing outright brand-new, but it was still solid to see the schedule rolled out for the next few months of Capcom titles. And honestly, they look pretty alright to me.

And once I reach this article, and see all of your lovely comments and interactions, I know that it's all been worthwhile. Thanks for coming!
This Saturday sees me getting all booked up for VS Fighting 2023, which is still months (and months) away, but the sooner I get it all sorted, the sooner I can just sit back and wait for the launch of Street Fighter 6 — A game that will very likely see me back out on the competitive scene, having not been utterly humiliated enough last time around. It's a kink of mine. As is Juri.

It’s amazing to think that developer Love-de-Lic only released three titles that stayed in their native homeland of Japan. Despite its flash of existence, the company’s design philosophy has long outlived it. Chulip, Chibi-Robo, and even Tingle’s Freshly Picked Rosy Rupeeland all subscribe to this philosophy of trying to solve people’s problems. Joy-makers, I call them, and there really isn’t enough of them in the world.
24 Killers wears its influence on its sleeve. Its deliberately uneven visual style even harkens back to Love-de-Lic’s first title, Moon: Remix RPG Adventure. That puts it in a tricky predicament because it invites direct comparisons. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone, but 24 Killers has been training hard and doing its squats.

Released to the arcade market in 1991, Turbo Force is the predecessor of smash release Sonic Wings, (better known in the west as Aero Fighters), and was a standout release for the shmup market, due to its support for up to three players over the typical genre standard of two. The "Turbo" of the title apparently refers to the player vessels, which are essentially flying sports cars packed out with powerful weaponry. Why, you ask? Frankly, it's hard to tell, as Turbo Force was developed as something of a mish-mash, a confusing project that shifted direction multiple times during its production period.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Paul Eales.

As such, while Turbo Force has a lot going for it — with fast action, cool pixel visuals, and an army of varied enemies and boss characters — the game is something of a tonal and directionless mess, lacking in story, purpose, or definitive theme. Regardless, lessons learned in the development of Turbo Force would lead to the inception of the Sonic Wings series, which would offer up a bounty of explosive hits both in the arcade and on home formats. Ultimately, Turbo Force was the "training wheels" for better things to come, and stands today as more of a shmup curio than anything else.
Turbo Force is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A legendary cast of characters
The best Kingdom Hearts characters have a ton of personality, have been through hardship, or simply have powerful and exciting abilities that dynamically elevate the series' battle scenes. A key element why Kingdom Hearts resonates with so many people is not just the non-stop action; but the passion behind the cast's motivations.
Characters like Sora and Roxas aren't afraid to express their emotions: to cry, to scream, to love, to smile. And many of the legendary series characters are more intriguing than the average RPG cast, and it's refreshing to see heroes, (or in some rare cases, villains), that we are able to relate to.
Warning: There are spoilers for Kingdom Hearts 3 and Kingdom Hearts 3: Remind in this list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Show me your (new) moves
These streets never sleep. Or at least, the Streets of Rage never do. Streets of Rage 4 just got a massive free update, adding a custom survival mode, new co-op moves, character balancing, and more.
Co-developers DotEmu, Lizardcube, and Guard Crush Games released the new update on Friday. In it, the crew says, are over 300 improvements to 2020's Streets of Rage 4. I've looked at the list, and it's massive, including character balancing changes across the cast of this beat 'em up.
One of the big bullet points is the new custom survival mode. This will let players tweak their survival mode experience to their liking, with slides and boxes for starting level, healing, weapons, hazards, enemy scaling, and more. You can get a glimpse of the options in this new trailer:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBCJUijhdM
Another big one is a new co-op attack, where you can pick up and throw your partner for a special strike. It's like a tag-team wrestling attack, only their fists are on fire. The update is live now for all Streets of Rage 4 owners.
Fists of fury
If you don't happen to own Streets of Rage 4 yet, this weekend may be a good time to address that. There's currently a sale across the Steam store, PlayStation Store, and Nintendo eShop. The Mr. X Nightmare DLC is also discounted too, and there's a bundle on Steam.
Basically, there's a lot of good reasons to play Streets of Rage 4. The most important one, though, is that it's a very, very good game. I have some fond memories running through this, both solo and co-op, and it's great to see this franchise revival still getting updates years later. Though there have been many other brawlers and beat 'em ups since, I always enjoy an excuse to jump back into Streets of Rage.

If someone told me they were creating a new OutRun with 3D graphics, I’d be extremely skeptical. OutRun was not merely a raster racer through and through, it’s the God-empress of raster racers. I would think that adding some depth to that would hurt the appeal. Not so, because OutRun 2006: Coast 2 Coast is about as faithful as I could imagine.
To be clear, OutRun 2006 is sort of the sequel to the sequel. OutRun 2 was released in arcades in 2003, and followed up with a port to Xbox in 2004. Afterwards, OutRun SP was released in 2004 as an upgrade to OutRun 2. OutRun 2006: Coast 2 Coast is a console (and PSP) combination of the two titles. It is the ultimate version, and I have no idea why it hasn’t been ported since. Probably the Ferrari license. It’s always licensing.

When my editor passed it over to me and asked if I’d be interested, I had trouble figuring out what it was supposed to be from the press materials, trailer, and even store pages that had sprung up. Square Enix is one of the few monolithic publishers that doesn’t shy away from mid-budget releases, but Paranormasight seems like such a small project that it’s surprising to see it outside of the indie sphere.
It's a visual novel. The staff on Paranormasight aren’t huge; not in the AAA industry, and not in terms of Square Enix veterans, at least. Most notably, the writer, Takanari Ishiyama, worked on the Tantei Kibukawa Ryōsuke Jikentan series, which remains Japan-only.
Whatever led to Paranormasi…]]></summary>

The past two decades might have seen pinball become something of a niche, rich folk's pastime, powered by a massively inflated collector's market and the increasing rarity of machine components, but for those of a certain age, there was, truly, a time where you couldn't enter a public building and not fall over a pinball machine or three. Arcades, bars, clubs, laundries, restaurants, theaters, corner stores, and gyms. If there was a five-foot footprint empty, then it had a pinball machine plonked on it.
There have been thousands of machines produced since the 1930s, from coin-operated bagatelle tables, through to the delightful electromagnetic (EM) machines of the '50s-'70s, these would give way to the Solid State (SS) machines of the '80s, pinball's golden renaissance in …]]></summary>

The glitches of Pokemon Scarlet & Violet fall into two distinct categories. On one hand, you have the silly bugs that blast you into space when you make a sandwich. On the other hand, Scarlet & Violet can reportedly delete your save file for committing the crime of purchasing their DLC. Thankfully, a solution is coming for one of the more serious issues in the latter category.
Announced via the official Japanese Pokemon Twitter account, a patch for Scarlet & Violet is scheduled to arrive in April. While we don’t know the full context of this patch, we do know it will address an issue affecting the Walking Wake and Iron Leaves event. If players engaged in these battles without updating their game first, they would catch a bad egg in the end instead of one of…]]></summary>

Lego hosted a special Super Mario presentation today for MAR10 (March 10) Day. Alongside a detailed look at an upcoming Bowser-centric set, Lego also teased that Donkey Kong will be making his Lego Super Mario debut this summer.
At the close of the stream, we get a good look at the Lego Donkey Kong build, which has a little spot for the Lego Super Mario figure to sit in. It's an interesting configuration, considering I don't remember Mario ever riding on Donkey Kong's back? Maybe I'm forgetting some weird outtake of the 1986 animation or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L8qJUwZ94A
We didn't get any more indication of what Lego Donkey Kong's set may entail. I'm personally hoping for some sort of chaotic mine cart course, and tons of little Lego bananas to scatter around.
Bowser's new brick castle
Today's spotlight also featured a good look at the Dry Bowser castle set, which is currently aimed for release on August 1 with a $109.99 price tag. I do like the Dry version of Bowser, but I love all the little details here. A bony Piranha Plant, the chain links and giant Bowser visage, and yes, even the Toad trapped in a cage.

The Lego Super Mario crossover has really taken off in the past few years, with tons of sets coming out of the partnership between Nintendo and Lego. Ranging from these playsets designed like game levels to the enormous, gorgeous Question Block set, it's pretty cool seeing the notorious plumber reimagined in brick form.
And if that doesn't satisfy your Mario craving, there's at least a feature film arriving soon to handle that too. The latest and final trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie premiered yesterday, strangely one day prior to March 10.

You'll probably start out Zellige thinking "oh, it's making some shapes and they turn into a pattern, whatever". But within ten minutes you'll be actively saying things like "does the empty space over here feel like purity or desolation" and "what does the contrasting colour of these triangles say about their relationship with the central star?".

It's been a while since I played a game about creating art that felt effortless even as I put in a lot of effort. Zellige: The Tilemaker Of Granada is humble but delightful. It's about designing tiles. And why something that straightforward is also rich and complicated.

Luckily, puzzle is a mainstay genre in video games, from classic point 'n' click adventures to weirdo physics puzzles and aliens in space. Puzzle games can also be RPGs or adventure games; they can have horror or hacking. There are so many, in fact, that curating a list of the best puzzle games is something of a puzzle in itself. But at RPS we like a challenge, so we've brought you a new and improved list of the 25 best puzzle games on PC that out there today, in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fan-favorite fighter Paul Phoenix has punched his ticket (among other things) for Tekken 8, and he’s so excited that he’s let his hair down for the first time in years. 
A new trailer shows off Paul’s new look and familiar offense of dishing out powerful, flame-licked punches. At one point, he flexes his bicep so hard that it makes the sleeve of his leather jacket explode off of his arm. He also rides his motorcycle into battle, which is pretty cool and reemphasizes that he is, in fact, a biker. Paul joins previously announced fighters such as Kazuya, Jin, Nina, and others. 


Tekken 8 doesn’t have a release date, but there’s a solid chance it’s arriving later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Until recently, the story of Intel’s Arc GPUs has been a litany of mild disappointments. After years of it being easier to buy an original O’Keefe than a reasonably priced graphics card, the Arc series brought hope that it might actually be possible to get a decent PC upgrade for less than £500. Then they were repeatedly delayed, confirmed to possess some unwelcome technical quirks (like wanting Resizable BAR on at all times), and ultimately released with merely decent-ish performance. Nothing awful, but nowhere near as special as they once seemed like they could be.
In 2023, however, Intel Arc may be on a redemption... arc. A series of driver updates, Intel claims, have improved average FPS performance by up to 87% since launch, with major gains in frame times (the time between each new rendered frame) as well. The specific model we have here, the Arc A750 Limited Edition, has also had its price cut from £330 / $289 to  £250 / $250. More power for less money? I’d say that’s worth a fresh evaluation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Outlast Trials, the third entry in the popular horror franchise, will welcome players into its twisted world when it enters PC Early Access on May 18. 
A new trailer reveals the news in a rather unique fashion, showcasing voice performers recording the horrific screams, yells, and grunts that will unnerve players in the game. The game was first announced in 2019, and developer Red Barrels gave players their first hands-on sample of the game via a closed beta last October. The ETA for the full release remains shrouded in mystery, however. 


The Outlast Trials mixes up the formula of the previous entries by letting you play alongside friends in four-player co-op (although you can still play solo). The game unfolds in a secret facility during the Cold War, with players controlling involuntary test subjects being tortured in gruesome experiments. Avoiding enemies instead of confronting them remains the key the survival, though you obtain and upgrade tools that can increase your odds at staying hidden or slowing foes down. 
You can check out The Outlast Trials in early access on Steam and The Epic Store.]]></summary>

I have no idea how old they are supposed to be and for some reason that’s not surprising.) survivors and a stalwart detective revisit the ruins of a hospital that was once home to a haunting ceremony. They all have amnesia, of course, because that’s a low-effort way to generate an air of mystery. Well, except the detective, who is just confused because he never really figured out what was going on in the first place. 
Overall, it’s a thoroughly okay game from 2008 that’s been papered over with some hazy lofi graphics to justify selling it at full price in 2023. It’s up to you if you think that’s worth it – I bought the Mass Effect remaster, so I’m hardly one to judge – but while the graphics have been thoroughly airbrushed, that’s no cure for Fatal Frame’s dated gameplay and undead pacing.

Capcom announced the news during their Spotlight livestream, where they showcased many upcoming games including Resident Evil 4’s remake and its brand-new demo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exoprimal reared its scaly head during today’s Capcom Spotlight, revealing a new trailer delving into the game’s bonkers plot and a reveal of a July 14 release date.
A new trailer reveals the game centers on a time-loop, as a team of soldiers travel to the past and find themselves reliving the same day. Dinosaurs have also begun appearing all over the globe through mysterious wormholes, so our heroes strap into their weaponized exosuits to deal with that very strange problem. 


As a cooperative team-based multiplayer game, Exoprimal is an always-online experience and will feature season passes with a number of unlockable rewards, such as cosmetics. Those itching to try the game early can jump into a free open beta that runs March 17 to 19, but you'll need to register for a Capcom ID to play. Exoprimal will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. It will also launch on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With less than a month to go until the theatrical release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Nintendo, Illumination, and Universal have released one final trailer to try and catch prospective audience members' attention. The final trailer came by way of a livestreamed Nintendo Direct featuring the main cast (including Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, Keegan Michael-Key, Seth Rogen, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Jack Black), as well as directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic.
The trailer gives us a more in-depth look at the Mario Kart sequences, which take place on the iconic Rainbow Road course. Along the way, we get Easter eggs, including side-scrolling sequences, shortcuts in Mario Kart courses, and even nods to Bob-omb Battlefield and Tostarena. To coincide with the release of this new trailer (which you can view below), we received a new synopsis of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.
Jurassic World and The LEGO Movie franchises) and brother Luigi (Charlie Day; It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia) are transported down a mysterious pipe and wander into a magical new world. But when the brothers are separated, Mario embarks on an epic quest to find Luigi.

Teen Titans Go!, Teen Titans Go! To the Movies) from a screenplay by Matthew Fogel (Minions: The Rise of Gru, The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Nacon Connect presentation, developer Teyon showed off new gameplay of the upcoming RoboCop: Rogue City. The game puts you in the metallic shoes of Alex Murphy as you explore Detroit in what appears to be a high-octane, technologically advanced first-person shooter.
RoboCop: Rogue City not only gives you the tech-enhanced combat capabilities of the eponymous protagonist but also gives you the ability to make dialogue choices as you meet new characters. This lets you decide how to fulfill your objectives, but as you might have guessed, the developers intend to throw various twists in a story about corruption and greed. Actor Peter Weller, who portrayed Murphy in the original films, is scheduled to reprise his role in the game.
You can see the action unfold for yourself below.


Developer Teyon was founded in 2006 and has released nearly 100 games since. Its most noteworthy releases include other licensed titles starring '80s action IP, including 2014's Rambo: The Video Game and 2019's Terminator: Resistance. RoboCop: Rogue City arrives in September for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really enjoyed the first Figment when it released back in 2017. An action-platformer with a musical theatre twist using the human mind as its stage? Very creative! Bedtime Studios’ follow-up Figment 2: Creed Valley keeps very close to the beat of the first one. You don’t need to have played Figment 1 to enjoy this sequel, but I almost feel like you’d be missing you if you didn’t (especially as it’s free on Steam right now, for today only).
Figment 2 has all the visual flair and catchy sing-songs of the first, but it feels weirdly smaller. Both games will run you about 5 hours each, but Figment 2 is a little less punchy, a little less diverse, and feels more like an encore rather than a dazzling comeback album. That’s not necessarily bad; I love an encore, and I enjoyed seeing more of Figment's surreal, subconscious mind-world. But, yeah, it’s very much the same as the first game, but with less scope and fewer fart clouds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of our Resident Evil 4 cover story last month, we showed off a slice of Chapter 5 gameplay in which some fans called out the heavy rain effects for being too intense and distracting. Capcom has heard those complaints and plans on changing the rain to make it more palatable. 
In an interview with Press Start Australia (thanks IGN), the outlet asked RE4 producer Hirabayashi Yoshiaki if the team was aware of the negative response to the rain, and he had this to say: 
“We’ve seen everyone’s reaction to the rain effects, and we are working on a day-one patch to make adjustments”
So there it is. It looks like “raingate” will soon be a thing of the past, and it’s nice that Capcom recognized the complaints ahead of Resident Evil 4’s release.  
Resident Evil 4 launches on March 24 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC. To learn more, be sure to visit our cover story hub for a month’s worth of exclusive features.

On Friday, the Deeply Volatile Kemono Set adds the Hellfire Laharback creature for players to hunt alongside an accompanying quest and a new skill. On March 23, the Subspecies Kemeno Pack goes live, which introduces the wolf-like Grimstalker plus a new quest and new weapon/armor model. This update also adds more higher-difficulty quests, three new emotes, and three chat stamps.
Koei Tecmo also confirmed in a Twitter thread that the first update includes unspecified technical fixes too, and plans to share more specifics tomorrow. A tease for April’s DLC offerings teases new Kemeno, Karakuri, and other updates.
Looks like Wild Hearts fans will have plenty to keep them busy in the immediate future, and the (hopefully) performance improvements, whatever they may be, are a welcomed bonus. To learn more about Wild Hearts, you can read our review here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Far be it from me to get excited about games that have just been announced, but the reveal trailer for Galacticare has slapped this management game right onto the old radar. An intergalactic radar, in fact, because this is a hospital management game - in spaaaaace! - coming later this year. It's from a Brighton-based indie studio called Brightrock Games, and it sort of looks like Theme Hospital with a space skin, or Startopia with a hospital sim. Neither option is a bad thing, in my opinion.

Besides the fact that it’s cheaper than buying an equivalent, prebuilt gaming rig, the DIY PC approach gives you more control over its components, teaches you skills you can later apply when upgrading or troubleshooting, and perhaps most importantly, isn’t anywhere near as difficult as it looks. Especially if you have a convenient, step-by-step guide to building a PC to hand. Incidentally…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clash: Artifacts Of Chaos is nails, mate. And that's coming from someone who recently reviewed Team Ninja's Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a game that's mighty good at grinding people into paste. I'm not trying brag; I'm being vulnerable with you. I have a case of the Ben Affleck blues, where most sessions of Clash's third-person action-adventuring have me veering from elation to being slumped against a wall with Affleck's signature grimace on my face.
Aside from being really difficult, I'm a bit undecided on how I feel about Clash in the portions I've played so far. It looks fantastic and puts some brilliant spins on combat, but levelling is a bore and exploration has a confusing edge. It's at once both a grand time and an annoying one. The surreal lands of Zenozoik, it turns out, aren't all sunshine and turkey men. There are a lot of turkey men, though.

That's because the SSD offers excellent performance while working within the confines of the SATA interface, with straightforward TLC NAND flash and a DRAM-equipped design that ensures strong sustained performance - something lacking in QLC DRAM-less designs. 
Today, the Crucial MX500 in its 2TB capacity is down to $102.99 at Amazon US, making it nearly 50% off its MSRP and the lowest price we've ever recorded.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new firmware update hitting the PlayStation 5 today will add Discord voice chat along with other fan-requested features.
The update allows users to link their Discord and PSN accounts to chat with friends through the app. Xbox received the same support last summer, so we’re happy to see it appear on another major platform. You can read more about how to get Discord up and running by visiting the PlayStation Blog. 
Additionally, the update introduces variable refresh rate support for 1440p, allowing smoother visuals for VRR-compatible HDMI 2.1 displays at 1440p resolution. The game library now filters PSVR and PSVR 2 titles. Data transfer between different PS5 consoles has also been added, and PS4-to-PS5 save data transfer has been significantly streamlined. Be sure to visit the PlayStation Blog for the complete rundown of what the update has to offer.

Although it was announced as part of a promo event for AMD’s Radeon RX 7000 GPUs, Infinite’s ray tracing works on any graphics card that can usually handle RT effects; all you need to do is download the update and flick it on in the display settings.
Granted, it’s not the most visually sumptuous form of ray tracing I’ve clapped a visor on. Reflections and global illumination are unchanged, as it’s only sun shadows – shadows cast using a simulated sun as the light source – that get the RT treatment.

In a new video hosted by game director Todd Howard, he states the Direct in June – which happens to be the weekend before E3 starts – will provide a "deep dive" into the game. He reiterates that Starfield is a unique experience that also has many of the hallmarks fans expect from a Bethesda title. We last saw Starfield during the Xbox Game Showcase last summer, where Bethesda revealed its extensive scope, including thousands of planets, spaceship construction, environmental scanning, and other features. 


Starfield was originally slated to launch on November 11, 2022, before getting delayed. It was later reconfirmed to launch within the first half of 2023, and though September sits on the second half of the calendar, we're happy to see the game get a concrete date again. 
Starfield will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will also launch day one on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Chucklefish announced Wargroove 2 today, a sequel to its well-received Advance Wars-inspired strategy RPG. 
Developed by Robotality, Wargroove 2 is set three years after the first game, with a new faction looking to use ancient technology to conquer the now-peaceful land of Aurenia. The main story unfolds across three interconnected campaigns set on land, the sea, and the sky and features a new cast of commanders. It also features a new roguelike campaign called Conquest that tasks players to complete a series of smaller battles while making permanent choices and relying on the same pool of units, health, and resources. 


Wargroove 2 features four-player co-op and versus battles (local and online) along with rule customization and asynchronous play. An in-game editor allows players to create custom maps, campaigns, and even cutscenes to share with other players. 
The first Wargroove was lauded as a fun throwback to Advance Wars when it launched in 2019, so we’re excited to see what Chucklefish has in store for the follow-up. Wargroove 2 doesn’t have a release window, but it’s slated to launch on Switch and PC. You can read out review of the first game here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Webbysoft, a one-man team, and publisher Armor Game Studios have announced that Bilkins' Folly will also release on some consoles alongside PC later this year. 
Originally, Bilkins' Folly was due out on just PC but Webbysoft has added PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch to its list of platforms. A release date has not yet been revealed but the game is due in "late 2023." In Bilkins' Folly, you play as treasure hunter Percival "Percy" Bilkins who, with his canine best friend Drayton, embarks on a quest to find their missing family that myseriously vanished years ago. On their journey, the duo will hop islands, solve puzzles, and more.

But it is real, and you can play it today. Following its closed alpha last September, the first-person shooter is now having a closed beta test for the next two weeks, and you can join the mayhem simply by requesting access on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Have a go of Sons Of The Forest," my compatriots at RPS told me. "It's a great new survival game, with cannibals who live on an island!" And I was like, "wait, so until you turned up to they just eat each other? How do they have a sustainable population? What's going on here?"
Thus, in a spirit of pure scientific enquiry, I booted up Sons Of The Forest and immediately discovered that everyone has been lying to me, because Sons Of The Forest is not a survival game. Sons Of The Forest is very clearly an early 00s b-movie action thriller. The script was left in a filing cabinet in Slough in an empty office until the office was repurposed into a call centre, at which point it was found by a middle-manager whose paintball team thought it was awesome, and somehow he sent it to a game developer by mistake. This is what happened, and you cannot convince me otherwise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wayfinder, an upcoming action RPG with light MMO touches, is being developed by Airship Syndicate, the folks behind Darksiders Genesis and Ruined King: A League Of Legends Story. I've spent some time with the closed beta, poking and prodding at the game's live service cogs to determine whether it's running a smooth operation or a clunky one that may not be worth your time.
And you know what? The game took me by surprise. So far, it's a decent time that's perhaps more along the lines of a Destiny, than say, World Of Warcraft. I genuinely believe it could garner a big community and have a bright future ahead of it - but when it comes to such a saturated space, I worry that Wayfinder may struggle to stand out, and won't attract players who are done with the usual rise 'n grind demands of these sorts of games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse originally released on the Nintendo Wii in 2008 exclusively in Japan. Until this week, it had never been localized for North America, but starting March 9, it will be available on just about every platform with improved visuals and a new photo mode. Fatal Frame is a game all about fighting ghosts in haunted locations with a magic camera, but this will be the first time you can pause the game and take pictures in the contemporary "photo mode" way we are all now familiar with.
This episode of New Gameplay Today ended up being a long one, making it feel a bit closer to our Super Replay series where Marcus Stewart and myself have been playing classic horror games like Dino Crisis and Silent Hill. I promise we do encounter some ghosts, though – you just need to be patient.

Take-Two later confirmed the news in a statement to PC Gamer, saying the layoffs would affect “corporate operations and label publishing.” Take-Two haven’t clarified the number of employees that have been laid off, but the cuts to development teams would be “minimal.”

The movie companies want Reddit to identify several users so they can provide evidence for a lawsuit against Internet provider RCN. Reddit refuses to do so, citing the right to anonymous speech, but the filmmakers suggest that's a disingenuous defense.

Anyone who makes or writes music knows that the path to a complete track isn’t a linear one. It’s a process where instruments weave in and out of the composition on the whim of the person making it. And even when the vision is clear, and you know exactly where you want to take the song, be it behind a drum set, a keyboard, a loop track, or even a computer, things can get in the way. Rytmos, developer Floppy Club’s first non-mobile game, nails that feeling. It uses puzzles to extract the joy, escalation, triumphs, and trials of making music, and it does so with g…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-03-07T18:56:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games announced last month that three League of Legends games would arrive this year, including The Mageseeker: A League of Legends story. Now, the company has announced that The Mageseeker will hit consoles and PC next month. 
More specifically, The Mageseeker will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 18. It will cost $29.99 on digital storefronts, and preorders include the Lost Silverwing in-game bonus. You can also purchase the Digital Deluxe Edition for $39.99, and it includes additional digital items like a Silverwing Supply Station Pack, Home Sweet Home cave decorations, exclusive spells, and Unchained skins. 
Check out the game in action in the new trailer below: 


"Developed by Digital Sun, creators of Moonlighter, the Mageseeker is a gritty 2D hi-bit pixel action RPG, set in Demacia, a mighty kingdom in the world of Runeterra that seeks to curtail what it deems as forbidden magic while wielding magic themselves to maintain order," a press release reads. "Play as Sylas, an escaped mage who joins a band of rebels in the deep forest. Their revolution will shatter Damcai's deceptive peace – a peace built with the blood and sweat of mages. The Mageseeker provides an action-packed fantasy gameplay experience for those looking to experience a story of power, identity, and justice." 
Riot Games also revealed today that it is selling a physical Collector's Edition of the game for $169.99. It includes a Sylas statue, an art book, a deluxe art print, the Lux Comic (special edition hardcover), Sylas & Lux enamel pins, and a vinyl soundtrack. All of this comes housed within an exclusive custom box. 

The Mageseeker follows the release of 2021's League of Legends Story game, Ruined King. Check out our thoughts on that in the Game Informer's Ruined King: A League of Legends Story review. The other two games Riot Games plans to release this year are Song of Nunu and Convergence.

Ridiculous, maybe, but these paranoid questions run through my head as Yu climbs a mountain. No safety gear. No helmet. Just his own hands, sneakers, and determination. I have to follow soon after, and though I’m undoubtedly scared, in the moment, I’m much more afraid of killing the creator of Spelunky than my own mortality. Though you could argue, in this hyper-specific example, the game should’ve been a cautionary tale. In Spelunky, you do die a lot. Nevertheless, I don’t want to be responsible for the death of one of the game industry’s most beloved indie developers.

But there is one bit of connective tissue, namely that charging into the fray is generally a bad idea. In the case of the game, that's because The Light Brigade is VR roguelike, one that blends Souls-like dark fantasy with World War II-era weaponry, with you playing a spiritually immortal but physically fragile warrior responsible for saving the world.

Valve’s handheld SteamOS games machine has successfully evaded hardware flop status, currently sitting fourth in Steam’s own top sellers list a full year after it began shipping. That’s well deserved, too: the Steam Deck was a fun little alternative way to play PC games when it released, and through a combination of added features, ongoing improvements to game compatibility, and simply a wider choice of great games, it’s a better device now than it’s ever been.


I was originally going to look back on the Steam Deck’s first 12 months with my eyes only, but what fun is a party of one? Thus I invited Valve designer Lawrence Yang and engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais for their takes on the Deck’s past, present, and future.

The Barcelona, Spain-based studio, which was founded in 2014, will end development on all of its projects as a result of closing its doors in April, as reported by Gematsu. The studio cites unfavorable "economic context" as the reason it's shutting down after nine years of development, primarily creating 2016's Aragami, its Nightfall DLC, and 2021's Aragami 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer The Outsiders has announced the first piece of premium DLC for its critically acclaimed rhythm-based shooter, Metal: Hellsinger. The game, which challenges you to blast the demons of Hell to the beat of an original soundtrack featuring some of the biggest names in metal, is adding two new original songs to the soundtrack through the first piece of downloadable content.
The DLC, Dream of the Beast, adds original songs from two singers who didn't appear on the main game's soundtrack. Cristina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil and Will Ramos from Lorna Shore join the cast of recognizable singers to contribute to the soundtrack. Dream of the Beast also adds The Red Right Hand, a new machine gun, and three new outfits, each of which provide unique gameplay modifiers.
These updates join the game as part of the Dream of the Beast DLC, but players who don't purchase the premium content also have something to be excited for. The same day the DLC arrives, players can expect a free title update for Metal Hellsinger. This free update adds a new song selection feature.
Both of these updates arrive on March 29 on all platforms. The game, which took home Game Informer's "Best Shooter" award for 2022, is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. For more on Metal: Hellsinger, check out our review here.

Despite my love for large-scale simulation games like Cities: Skylines as an adult, I was not a SimCity player growing up. Instead, I was pulled in the direction of the more manageable SimTown. The zoomed-in town management, where you can micromanage every aspect of your citizens' lives without the massive scope of SimCity, always appealed to me more. Perhaps that's why Outlanders, a simplistic yet challenging settlement builder, has now sunk its hooks into me on two occasions across both of its platforms.
In this small-scale managem…]]></summary>

We only have a very brief glimpse at Life By You, but developer Paradox Tectonic and former Sims boss Rod Humble are holding an announcement event on March 20th - so, we’ll see more of the life sim later this month.

Yes, this isn't the best gaming SSD in terms of raw speed, but its PCIe 4.0 design means that it uses less power and fewer lanes than PCIe 3.0 alternatives of the same speed, a nicety for desktop use and a big deal for laptops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cities: Skylines II was announced at today's Paradox Announcement Show, and it’s coming later this year.
This follow-up builds upon its 2015 predecessor with new features, such as fully-realized transportation and economy systems. Paradox didn’t reveal too many other specifics beyond stating in a press release that the game features “ a wealth of construction and customization options and advanced modding capabilities.” Cities: Skylines II is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC. Check out the teaser trailer below:


The original game was a big success, having sold over 12 million copies and filling the simulation gap left by SimCity's hiatus. Developer Colossal Order has supported it with multiple updates and expansions, including a VR port and a recent current-gen remaster. You can read our original reviews of Cities: Skylines on PC here and the console edition here.]]></summary>

The super auto-battler did eventually start making custom artwork for its later expansions, but much of the furious fauna was still emojis. That has now changed with today's patch, going back to replace all the old emojis with new animal pictures. Goodbye, old friends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Puma has unveiled a new shoe collection inspired by the popular MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV. 
The collaboration will consist of four shoes: two Puma Slipstream models and two RS-X models, as reported by Techraptor. For each model type, there's a (Warrior of) Light version and a Dark version, which basically equates to white and blue-green, and black and purple-pink. All four of the shoes look great but before you get too attached, these shoes are Japan-only for now. There's no word on if they'll come to the U.S. 
Check out the shoes in the gallery below: 

Each of these shoes will cost 17,050 yen, which is roughly $125, according to Techraptor. They will be released in Japan next week on March 15. 
Shoes inspired by video games have risen in popularity, with Converse releasing two sets of Pokémon-inspired shoes last year. Perhaps more than any other shoe maker, though, Puma has been steadily releasing video game shoes. In 2018, it released a pair of sneakers based on Sonic the Hedgehog's iconic red shoes and then in 2020, Puma released a line of Super Mario All-Stars shoes. Puma announced some NBA 2K21 shoes in 2021 and then just two months later, the company revealed an Animal Crossing: New Horizons line of sneakers. 
While waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I have complained about mightily in the past, I grew up somwhere that didn't have much in the way of entertainment, so me and my friends had to engage in the time honoured tradition of making our own fun. Once we reached about age 17 this included playing poker with a shared second-hand chip set, and trying to do beer centurions (the progress in the latter affecting our interest in the former). I was never any good at it because, though poker was a fixture for several years, I was never really able to learn the rules. What hand is good? Why has your hand beaten his hand? But the little pictures are the best, I don't understand! It's disappointing because understanding poker is a cool adult thing, plus not understanding it makes certain pivotal scenes in James Bond films quite hard to parse.
Last week we got an email (shout out Aidan) singing the praises of Aces And Adventures, and I do try to check out recommendations from readers, even if I don't have time to reply or to write about the games. In this case I've made a special because Aces And Adventures is a great game that is teaching me winning poker hands through the medium of a dwarven warrior smashing things.

What's especially notable about this trailer is the animation style, which is quite unique for both the TMNT franchise and animation in general. It's reminiscent of stop-motion mixed in with the comic-style vibes of Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse, although it's also very much its own thing.

Studio 3Division continue to say, “We realise that we underestimated the situation, and it quickly escalated to a point that posed a threat to our game.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Cells is one of the best roguelites I've ever played and was one of the standout games in the very crowded 2018. However, its success is only possible through standing on the shoulders of the giants that trailblazed the genre. Of all the franchises Dead Cells drew inspiration from, perhaps no series was as influential as Castlevania. Because of this, the crossover between the two, which comes in the form of premium DLC for Dead Cells called Return to Castlevania, is a natural fit that not only resurrects Konami's dormant franchise but gives a nostalgic shot in the arm to one of the best roguelites available today.
Diving back into Dead Cells for the first time in years, I couldn't help but effortlessly fall back into the hooks of the stellar gameplay loop. I love discovering secret ar…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has revealed a new Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi game. 
Yesterday, the publisher released a short teaser trailer for the game, running less than a minute, that highlights footage from previous Budokai Tenkaichi games before showcasing what appears to be the new one. In the footage of the new game, we see Goku powering up. And then the words, "Get Ready For Battle" and "A New Sparking Begins" appear on screen. 
Check it out in the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi teaser trailer for yourself below:

「ドラゴンボール Sparking！」シリーズ

March 5, 2023
As you can see, the game might be called, in some variation, Dragon Ball Sparking (that's what the tweet calls it if you use Twitter's built-in translate function, too). But regardless, the trailer ends with "A New Budokai Tenkaichi" begins, quelling any doubt that this is a new game in the series that has laid dormant for 16 years. Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 was released in 2007.  
The teaser trailer doesn't indicate if this is Budokai Tenkaichi 4 or something else but it's exciting nonetheless to see that Bandai Namco hasn't forgotten about the series. It is somewhat surprising to see this announcement, though, considering Dragon Ball FighterZ exists. Budokai Tenkaichi is a fighting game series as well but to see a new one before a sequel to FighterZ, which was released in 2018, is something I imagine not many people could have predicted. 
While waiting to learn more about this Budokai Tenkaichi game, read Game Informer's Dragon Ball FighterZ review.

But growing up, the Budokai Tenkaichi series were the Dragon Ball fighting games, and 16 years after the last entry Bandai Namco have announced a new Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi title.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Skyrim came out I was a student, and I worked in Gamestation (RIP) to help pay for chicken noodles. I remember the hype around it very clearly because Gamestation had a deal where you could buy it for like £22, and I had a sideline going when the stock was low to keep some back for my friends. Apols if you were caught in the crossfire for that, but dragon fever was running high off the back of a still very cool trailer, and shouting Fus Ro Dah was the only cure. 
In the years since, Skyrim has been released and re-released many times, on every conceivable platform. "Arrow to the knee" jokes became de rigueur and hacky almost overnight, and at this point might have horse-shoed back around to being funny again. There are many examples of unrelated games or videos that cut to black fading back up into the opening of Skyrim, in a kind of sub-genre of rickroll. Does it hold up now? Kind of. It's a really fun, ambitious RPG, with faults - but if the faults didn't exist maybe it wouldn't have been as popular as it was.

First off, our team developers have implemented a significant update to the file access system in order to use the Secure Access Framework (SAF) API for secure file access on external memory space, such as SD Cards or USB drives. This effectively should resolve a long-standing issue with modern Android devices, in particular those running Android 11 and above, whereby users could not properly access the game data folders or the save game files in the external storage.

This card normally retails closer to £50, with a stated UK RRP of £55, but it has dipped as low as £37.99 for a few days over the past year. 
Still, this is a very reasonable price for a memory card that's good for up to 130MB/s sequential reads and meets the A2 requirements for random performance.

This was obviously a real treat for me as RPS' resident Sims fanatic, but I'll admit I went in with my expectations parked in neutral. After all, the theme of this new-content duo is young families, and that just isn't part of the game I engage with too much these days.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/03/03/square-enix-president-yosuke-matsuda-is-stepping-down"/>
        <updated>2023-03-03T18:51:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yosuke Matsuda, president and representative director of Square Enix, is stepping down after 10 years in the position. 
The official announcement states that he’ll be replaced by the relatively new Takahashi Kiryu, a company director who joined Square in 2020, as part of an organizational restructuring. The proposed change will be voted for approval at the 43rd Annual Shareholder’s Meeting in June. Square Enix’s reason for the change is as follows:
Matsuda became president in 2013, succeeding Yoichi Wada as part of a massive restructuring. His time at the top could be viewed as a bit of a rollercoaster. He pushed for innovation in Square’s flagship franchise, Final Fantasy, and voiced commitment to remaking and re-releasing popular titles from Square’s back catalog, such as Final Fantasy VII. The MMO Final Fantasy XIV also became a global phenomenon under his watch, though the company as a whole has largely struggled to land a massive success outside of the franchise. In recent years, high-profile Square Enix-published titles such as Marvel’s Avengers and Babylon’s Fall had disappoitning releases, with the former ceasing development this year and the latter shutting down this week. 
Perhaps most infamously, Matsuda was also at the front of Square’s tumultuous relationships with its North American third-party publishers, namely Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal, whose titles such as the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy, Deus Ex, and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy were often deemed commercial disappointments. That came to a head last May, when Square Enix sold off these studios and their IPs to Embracer Group.
In recent times, Matsuda was also a vocal advocate for NFTs and blockchain gaming. In January, he published a letter detailing upcoming company initiatives, including making games that incorporate blockchain technology.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Leaks are the bane of every publisher's existence, forcing marketing plans to shift, change, or just get scrapped. But that's partly why I'm enjoying EA's approach for advertising the Skate. reboot. Footage from the open-world skateboarders’ playtest leaked last September, and EA have since responded by releasing their own janky videos. These clips give us a taste of the whacky ragdolling happening right now, and it's probably the most entertaining way of marketing a game while simultaneously sucking the air out of leaks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recommended a pretty wide variety of genres over the years, but I didn't expect a brick breaking game to surprise me like Destructure Colon Among Debris. It's not that I dislike them. They've just never really made much impression (possibly because I don't see all that many)
Destructure blends in a hint of shooting, resource management, and leans into the sheer fun of destruction, replacing bricks with "structures" that aren't meant to be anything specific, but give the whole feeling an impression of combat, an assault you're carrying out rather than a reacting, abstract geometry game.
Also it feels and sounds great to hit stuff. That's probably the bigger reason.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm going to Japan in a couple of weeks, and I am beyond excited. It's been 15 years since I last visited family in Yokohama, and my last memory is one where I'm miserable and I'm staring out of a cab window going back to the airport. I didn't want to leave. It sounds corny as heck, but I can't wait to sucker punch that memory with a swing that's been building for 5478 days, then jab it full of happy ones. Really, I imagine what will happen is I'll get weirdly emotional as the plane touches down and my mate Simon, who I'm going with, will be like, "Get a hold of yourself you buffoon".
I got LINE recently -  a Whatsapp equivalent that's big in Japan - to arrange some meetups with friends and family. Those arrangements have happened, which brings me great joy. But in a surprise plot twist, it meant I got back in touch with a guy called Sam. Now Sam, he's a good bud and we go a long way back. All the way back to the original Gears Of War days. And I think we've arranged, as is custom, to play Gears 6 whenever it arrives. Such is the bizarre way of things.

It was an insightful look at the nuts and bolts of game dev, so I’m glad Ninja Theory are returning to the concept for the spooky action sequel Hellblade 2: Senua’s Saga. The first episode takes a look at Iceland - the sequel's setting - and the team's painstaking commitment to recreating it as realistically as possible. The photogrammartry tech on display is seriously impressive, and following the team to Iceland feels like watching a British travel series, without the crude humour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed that Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers can jump into Metroid Fusion when the game is added to the NSO library on March 8. 
After surprise releasing Metroid Prime Remastered last month, Metroid fans have another game from the series' history to play through, this time in the Game Boy Advance game first released in 2002. Once Fusion is live with NSO, players can finally experience Samus Aran's full 2D series journey on the Nintendo Switch, starting with the original Metroid game all the way through Metroid Fusion and 2021's Metroid Dread. 
Check out the Metroid Fusion Nintendo Switch Online trailer announcing the news below: 


"In Metroid Fusion, interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran is attacked by an X parasite while exploring the mysterious planet SR388," Nintendo's description of the game reads. "This organism is not only deadly, but it can mimic the abilities of any creature it infects – including Samus herself! Saved from the brink thanks to an infusion of Metroid DNA, the X parasite's only natural predator, she soon discovers that the parasite has spread to the research station orbiting SR388. Weakened and out of options, Samus must do whatever it takes to destroy the X threat before it's too late." 
Nintendo says Metroid Fusion contains "a multitude of secrets" for players to experience that links Super Metroid to Metroid Dread. 
Speaking of Metroid Dread, read Game Informer's review of it to find out why it was one of our favorite games of 2021, and then read Game Informer's Metroid Prime Remastered review. Check out our list of every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Sega Genesis, and GBA game on Nintendo Switch Online after that. 
Metroid Fusion hits Nintendo Switch Online next week on March 8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon have quietly dipped their first toe into PC componentS, listing the Amazon Basics Computer Cooling Fan: a single-fan, RGB-lit air cooler. Judging from the manual it supports the very latest socket types for Intel and AMD’s gaming CPUs, and being under the Amazon Basics brand, it's dirt cheap at £21 / £27. 
It’s unlikely, though, that Bezos and the gang have been secretly funding R&D into an all-new line of PC gear. As Tom’s Hardware spotted, the Amazon Basics Computer Cooling Fan appears to simply be an existing budget cooler, the Cooler Master Hyper H410R, without the CM badge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The overlap of Powerwash Simulator fans and Final Fantasy VII diehards hits in full force today, thanks to the launch of a free DLC pack for the popular sim. You can use your high-pressure hose to blast dirt and grime off of popular locations in Midgar, and the best part is that the experience is totally free.
The Midgar Special Pack is available now for all versions of Powerwash Simulator. It adds five new levels, including Tifa’s Seventh Heaven bar and the Mako Energy Exhibit. Additionally, you’ll be cleaning up vehicles and mechs such as Cloud’s Hardy-Daytona motorcycle, Shinra Hauler, the Scorpion Sentinal, and the Airbuster. The pack also adds new dirt types, such as bio-residue. 


This DLC was created in collaboration with Square Enix, with Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura writing in a press release, 
“When I heard about the proposal for a collab, I was quite busy with various other collabs and reviews, but I was especially excited about this one. I had just been playing PowerWash Simulator and was daydreaming about cleaning things from my titles. My immediate response was, 'let’s wash the entire Shinra building.' Unfortunately, that seemed to be a bit difficult, but the final line-up is exciting, nonetheless. This is something I have been looking forward to a lot, and hope everyone has a great time!”
This pack follows a Tomb Raider-themed expansion that launched in January. This is a pretty neat trend, and see other video game properties added to the game that are in need of good clean-up. 
Powerwash Simulator is available now for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given that Dead Island 2 has been in development for the better part of a decade, it’s understandable to have some trepidation about its quality (and general existence). Developer Dambuster Studios hopes to convince players that Dead Island 2 is not only close to finished but is a worthy follow-up by releasing an extended gameplay walkthrough that provides the rawest look at its action. 
The guided demo follows Irish punk rocker Dani, one of the game's six playable characters, and shows off a lot of the moment-to-moment action across various locales. The gory F.L.E.S.H. system is on full display, as is the wacky makeshift weaponry, including electrified Wolverine-esque claws. We also get a look at the card-based perk system and one strange sidequest involving pizza. 


Dead Island is slated to launch on April 21 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. We recently featured the game on our cover and you check out a month’s worth of exclusive features by visiting our coverage hub.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Jedi: Survivor director Stig Asmussen of Respawn Entertainment wants the series to be a trilogy. 
This news comes from a new IGN Unfiltered interview with the director, which is where Asmussen revealed that even before the release of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in 2019, the team was already discussing sequel ideas. For Asmussen, Cal's story has always been a trilogy in his head. 
"We were already talking about the second game," said Asmussen. "I mean, frankly, we were talking beyond. And these are conversations that, when we're breaking this story with Lucasfilm, it's like: 'Well, where are we going with the second game?' I always wanted to see this as a trilogy. How can we take Cal and the crew to new places beyond what we were doing in the first game." 
Asmussen continues, stating that Respawn had a good idea of where Survivor, which is due out April 28, takes place in terms of the Star Wars timeline. The team also knew what the stakes were going to be, what the tone was going to be, what Cal was going to be up against, and how his crew was going to be factored into all of that. On top of that, Respawn thinks about the ideas "that we could do beyond that as well." 
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was originally due out March 17, but was delayed to April 28. While waiting to get your hands on the game, watch Game Informer's interview with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan, and then check out our exclusive preview of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor for new details about the story, exploration, and combat.

Its latest effort, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, is an unforgiving but deeply rewarding showcase of freneticism that lives up to this lineage. The smooth swordplay, brilliant boss fights, and novel systems further prove Team Ninja’s ability to craft unrelenting experiences.

        <updated>2023-03-01T20:44:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has announced a new collaborative initiative called PlayStation PlayMakers. The console giant will partner up with celebrity fans of the brand to “celebrate their passion for gaming and PlayStation” by creating unique experiences for players. One of those famous names is NBA superstar LeBron James, who helped design a limited-edition PlayStation 5 accessories.
The special console plates and DualSense 5 controller were co-designed by James and will release in select countries. The hardware is adorned with artistic elements (including obligatory crowns) and personal inspirational messages by LeBron. There’s no word yet on the prices, but you can only pre-order these items through direct.playstation.com. sometime this year. You can read LeBron's thoughts on the project by visiting the PlayStation Blog. 
Other big names involved with PlayStation PlayMakers include country music star Jimmie Allen, actor and comedian King Bach, and other professional athletes such as BMX’s Nigel Sylvester, WNBA All-Rookie NaLyssa Smith, NFL stars Ja’Marr Chase and CeeDee Lamb, French football freestyler Lisa Zimouche, and Belgian football star Romelu Lukaku. The initiative feels similar to McDonald's recent push of celebrity-branded menu items, so who knows what to expect from these names and others in the future.

Editors Note: a previous version of the article incorrectly stated that Sony revealed a LeBron James PS5 console instead of console accessories. We've updated the article with the correction.]]></summary>

Telltale released a brief message on Twitter announcing the delay, but CEO Jamie Ottilie shares more context with IGN. Ottilie discusses the challenges of relaunching the studio in 2019, which were then compounded when the COVID-19 pandemic began the following year. That includes announcing the game when the studio was still staffing up to help secure early funding. Despite those early hurdles, Ottilie states that development has been going well since then, but the team recently decided it wants to adopt Unreal 5 to take advantage of the engine’s new features. Unfortunately, that meant having to redo a lot of the work that had been created in Unreal 4.
With such a big change, Ottilie explains that the only way The Wolf Among Us 2 could still arrive this year would be either to launch it in a less-polished state (which the team wants to avoid given its high expectations) or to overwork the staff. Given that the old Telltale was infamous for crunch and burnout, Ottilie is adamant about avoiding the same practice with this iteration of the studio. 
"I've done [crunch], and I don't want to do it again, and it's not fair to ask it," Ottilie tells IGN. "You can't plan a business around it. So yeah, part of it is about maintaining a healthy work culture. We don't want to burn out our good people.”
The Wolf Among Us 2 was announced at the 2019 Game Awards and will be an episodic title like its predecessor. However, Telltale is developing each episode at the same time, so the entire series will be complete when the first installment launches. You can watch the first full trailer from last year here. The studio’s other project, The Expanse: A Telltale Series, is still slated for this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deck 13, makers of The Surge and Lords of the Fallen, have announced their next big action RPG, Atlas Fallen, launches in May. The game was revealed during last year’s Gamescom and centers on players manipulating sand to explore and survive in a fantastical desert world.  
The game supports single-player and two-player co-op and takes place in a massive sand-covered world filled with monsters and gods. You’ll take them down using shape-shifting weapons born out of the sand and other customizable magical abilities. You can check out the cinematic announcement trailer from Gamescom 2022, and a batch of new screenshots, below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Diablo IV, Blizzard aims to revamp the danger-infested hellscape of Sanctuary. The world’s five explorable regions – Kehjistan, Scosglen, Fractured Peaks, Dry Steppes, and Hawezar – offer their own flavors of topography, cultures, quests, and, of course, monsters. Blizzard is going to great lengths to ensure these regions are not only fun for players to explore, but feature more narrative cohesion and a stronger sense of place. 
Diablo veterans have explored regions of Sanctuary before, but this time they’re more than one-note areas highlighting a single climate or element, such as snow or desert. Each of them is biodiverse in its own right, with multiple biomes and threats exclusive to them. These realms also blend more naturally together; the lush green of one area gradually withers…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electronic Arts has reportedly laid off more than 200 quality assurance testers at its Baton Rouge office in Lousiana. 
This news comes by way of Kotaku, which reports that EA laid off these workers, who worked primarily on the publisher's battle royale Apex Legends, during a surprise Zoom call yesterday. The publication reports that its three sources were able to confirm the news, which began making rounds on Twitter when both current and former QA testers at the Lousiana office began to share what they had learned. 
EA just fired its entire Baton Rouge studio, which is essentially their entire Apex Legends QA staff.
February 28, 2023
Kotaku reports that around 8 a.m. CT, QA testers were invited to an unscheduled but mandatory Zoom call with Magnit Global, which is the contract agency that manages the workers. It was during this meeting that the entire QA team at the Lousiana office was "disbanded," according to Kotaku. 
The publication reached out to EA looking for a response to the mass layoffs, but the publisher opted not to directly address it, instead stating that as "part of its ongoing global strategy, we are expanding the distribution of our Apex Legends testing team and ending execution that's been concentrated in Baton Rouge, Lousiana, impacting services provided by our third-party provider." Be sure to check out Kotaku's write-up for the full statement from EA and additional context surrounding the layoffs, the Lousiana office, and more.

The intention of the program is to bring new contributors to open source projects, and the eligibility rules for participants are the same as last year, with both students and non-students welcome to participate. Check the  Google Summer of Code website for details of eligibility.
Participants can apply for either short tasks (about 175 hours) or long tasks (about 350 hours). The coding period typically runs from the start of June to the end of August, but there is some flexibility and the participants can opt to use a longer coding period if they are not available to work full time on the project during the summer.
ScummVM is looking for applicants! A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we’re open to your own ideas too. Please make sure you provide the required information in your application before submitting. We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, and get advice and help on getting started with the project and writing your application.
We have gathered some information to guide you, based on our previous 15 years of experience in the program. You may start your exploration from our Google Summer of Code miniportal.
We are looking forward to your application and participation!
