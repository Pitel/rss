        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Couch co-op games offer some of the best gaming experiences, especially in the competitive Fortnite Battle Royale. However, a system issue may disrupt these collaborative matches. Here's how to fix the split screen not working in Fortnite. 


Fortnite split screen not working solution


Epic Games has rolled out an update that is crucial for fixing the previous Fortnite split-screen issues. It's important that you install a new patch to ensure the game works correctly. Additionally, a game restart may be necessary for the update to take effect. The issue, which was initially linked to matchmaking problems, has been successfully resolved. This means any matchmaking issues you may have encountered should now be fixed as well.




The split-screen Fortnite issue has surfaced in the past, but a swift resolution has often accompanied a new update. Therefore, it's important to stay vigilant for new patches or stay informed through the Fortnite Status channel. If the problem persists even after an update, ensure your internet connection is stable. The official Epic Games website states that split-screen gameplay requires a stable internet connection. You may also need a quick restart of the game to get it working properly. 


The new Fortnite updates brought up some problems with consoles, which could be another reason why split screen may not have worked. In particular, Xbox Series X|S users have been experiencing crashes. However, Epic Games has provided more updates to help address these problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A good chunk of getting better at something is learning from others. Sure, it might not be as fun as playing, but spectating various players opens up many different aspects of a game and this is especially true in Fortnite. Learning how another player eliminated you or getting new inspirations for building will only elevate your game and make you a greater threat in the next Ranked match. Here's how to pop those peepers at other players.


Break out the binoculars and popcorn


How to spectate friends in Fortnite


Sometimes you've booted up the game, but aren't quite ready to actually play. Maybe you're folding that last basket of laundry or you have a delicious turkey club sandwich to finish. Either way, you can pop in Fortnite, join the voice chat, and watch your friends play while you tackle whatever it is you're doing.



Join a friend's lobby.


After joining the party, you'll need to wait 30 seconds due to a time limit in place from Epic Games.


Click your friend and select "Watch Game."






How to spectate others in Fortnite


Thanks to stream sniping and other generalized harassment, Epic Games removed the option to spectate random players. Now, the only way to spectate another player who isn't on your friend's list is to join a game and get eliminated.


Once you're down and out, you'll be able to spectate your killer. Should they be bumped off, you'll be switched to their killer's perspective. It's like watching a food chain chart be rendered in real-time. Though the desire to get into another match may be strong, it's worth spending some time watching others to learn new strategies that can better your gameplay.

This newest set, Temporal Forces, continues the Ancient and Future conventions introduced in Paradox Rift, giving players new strategies featuring a variety of easily playable Basic Pokémon. 
The Pokémon Company sent along a bunch of booster packs for us to open to see what we could pull. The set is one of the smaller recent expansions, but still large by the long-established standard of Pokémon TCG. Players picking up Temporal Forces can expect to pull from a pool of more than 160 cards. In addition to the additional Ancient and Future Pokémon, Temporal Forces reintroduces Ace Spec cards, first implemented during the Black & White series of cards. Those Ace Spec cards were some of the more unique cards I pulled, but the full-art Pokémon and ex cards most wowed me; I particularly love the Arbok and Minccio full-arts I grabbed. 
Check out my favorites I pulled from Pokémon Trading Card Game's Scarlet & Violet – Temporal Forces expansion below!

With Grounded spreading to other platforms like the fungus it showcases, players must wonder if the game has split-screen co-op or crossplay.


There's good news and bad news. The good news is that, yes, Grounded does support crossplay for all platforms. But sadly, the bad news is that the game is remaining online and there doesn't seem to be any indicator that will change soon.

Grounded supports crossplay for all platforms


Grounded is an online co-op game that allows you to play with up to three others on a four-player team. It supports crossplay for every platform, including PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch, with the latter two added to the list on April 16. PC players can experience the game on Steam or PC Game Pass. 


But like with most crossplay games, friends across platforms have extra hoops to jump through. Steam players must download the Xbox app and create a profile to play with Xbox players, for example. To play a game with others, a host can start a new game from the menu or choose a single-player world to open up for friends. Once the game loads, the host can invite players into the world.

Grounded does not support split-screen co-op


Sadly, for those wanting to play Grounded in split-screen co-op, the game doesn't include the feature. You can only play the game co-op online for the time being. It doesn't appear that developer Obsidian Games is planning on changing this in the near or distant future. Split-screen play requires a platform to render the game twice. And since Grounded is a fairly resource-heavy game, I'm not surprised that it doesn't have split-screen on offer.

You can tame pets in Grounded, and it's a good idea for the adventure ahead. Not only are they adorable (well...), but pets can also provide a buff or carry your stuff. 


To tame pets in Grounded, you first need to unlock a tool called the Grinder to make some bait. The Grinder is unlockable by analyzing Flower Petals, which you can locate early under the rose plants between the fence and koi pond next to the Oak Tree. 


With the Grinder blueprint, find a place for it and get to crafting. Once you do, you're part-way to owning a cute, little bug of your own. Or, you know, a mobile backpack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The newest Helldivers 2 Warbond launched yesterday to explosive results (unless you're trying to use the new Adjudicator DMR.. yeesh), but players were left scratching their heads regarding the coolest-looking new armor set. The CE-27 Ground Breaker, initially shown to have the Engineering Kit passive, launched with the comparatively lousy Servo-Assisted passive instead. 


A last minute change? Luckily for those of us who want to rock a sweet gas mask, no. A post to the official Discord by a developer clears the issue up:


Screenshot by Destructoid


For a quick comparison between these two armor passives:



Engineering Kit: Further educes recoil while crouching or prone by 30% and increases grenade inventory and holding capacity by 2


Servo-Assisted: Increases throwing range by 30% (think grenades and Stratagems) and provides 50% bonus to limb health



I'm quite happy this was a simple bug and not an intended change, as I'm far more interested in rocking two additional grenades and lowering my crouched recoil than throwing my Stratagems a little farther away. Some people swear that the 30% additional throwing range granted by Servo-Assisted armor is a lifesaver, but I swear it'll just cause me to miss my grenade throws when they matter most. The additional 50% limb health might have helped, though, on the rare occasion I'm not one-shot or burned alive in seconds.


All this discussion over armor passives and their immutable attachment to people's favorite-looking armor has lots of players hoping for a separation of looks and utility. I feel like we aren't a long ways off such a quality-of-life change, especially with so many shiny armors to unlock (and buy). Because why limit our democratic escapades to only a few outfits?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most Pokémon evolutions are relatively straightforward, typically only involving Candy consumption. However, creatures like Combee are much more complex due to their various requirements. Here's how to evolve Combee in Pokémon Go.


Pokémon Go Combee evolution, explained


Combee evolves with 50 Candies, and it must be female. Unfortunately, the males got the short end of the stick. They'll appear similar to female Combees, but the only difference is that they don't have a red triangle on their design.

When Combee evolves, it transforms into the unique Bug and Flying Type, Vespiquen. This evolution boasts impressive defensive stats, making it a formidable contender in Pokémon Go's various leagues. However, remember, you'll need to start with a female Combee to obtain this buzzing creature.


Where to find female Combees in Pokémon Go 


Female Combees are a rare sight, adding an exciting element to your Pokémon Go journey. I've often come across male-only creatures, who are much more common. But don't lose hope, as they can still be found during special events and Raids.
Events like the Bug Out celebration significantly increase Combees' spawn rate. While you'll likely encounter more males, there's always a glimmer of hope for a female Combee to appear, making your search all the more thrilling.


Combee Raid fights also feature female versions, depending on the Raid schedule. It all comes down to current events, or you could get lucky by finding it randomly in the wilds.

Maybe it's not over the top with graphics. And yes, some characters can be pretty one-dimensional, but it makes up for it with its entertaining gameplay and combat. 


Rise of Ronin happened to land on the same day as the Dragon's Dogma 2 release, and I couldn't help but make some comparisons. While Dragon's Dogma 2's gameplay was incredibly vague with details, Rise of the Ronin steers you in the right direction almost every time. That's not to say that one is better than the other; it's just that sometimes I don't feel like using that extra brain power for one measly mission.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The quest to catch them all never ends, especially in Pokémon Go, where Niantic has slowly been doling out Pokémon from past titles as time goes on. Pokémon from Gen 5's Unova region have been in the game for a while now, many with their own evolution techniques that are unique to Pokémon Go. The most common of these is evolution via the Unova Stone.


This guide will go over the best ways to get Unova Stones, as well as which Pokémon use them to evolve, so that players can know what exactly they need to do the catch them all.


How Do You Get Unova Stones in Pokémon Go?


Unova Stones can be collected in two ways:



Completing Research Breakthroughs


Defeating Team GO Rocket Leaders or Giovanni



Both methods give the player a very small chance, about 1%, to receive a Unova Stone as a reward. These methods take large amounts of time to complete as well, so players would be best to play continually and plan on gathering Unova stones over time, rather than trying to find a way to earn them quickly. By completing the daily research tasks and taking on Team GO Rocket balloons and PokéStops, players will eventually gather the necessary Unova Stones.


What Pokémon Need Unova Stones To Evolve?


There are seven Pokémon that need Unova Stones to Evolve, as listed below:



Eelektrik, evolving into Eelektross


Lampent, evolving into Chandelure


Minccino, evolving into Cinccino


Munna, evolving into Musharna


Panpour, evolving into Simipour


Pansage, evolving into Simisage


Pansear, evolving into Simisear



While it may seem disheartening to learn that the Unova Stone is so rare, players can at least take solace in knowing they will only need seven of them to complete the Pokédex. As long as players log in and play consistently, they will be sure to earn enough Unova Stones for all required evolutions.

Remembering the birthdays of friends is a pretty basic requirement of friendship, but with so many to remember it can be hard to keep track. While you can check the board outside Pierre’s General Store at any time, it’s still easy to miss a day while going about your daily farm life.

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

In the current version of Type Soul there are seven weapons total available to Quincy characters, with more coming in the future. This is all Quincy Weapons in Type Soul as well as how they play.

All Quincy Weapons


Out of all the Quincy Weapons in Type Soul, only a couple aren't that good at the moment. Each weapon has its own unique playstyle, so you may want to try each one out until you know which is best for you. Here are all Quincy Weapons in Type Soul:



Antithesis - Decent crit-weapon but with a lacking stun proc.


Cang Du Claws - Cang Du Claws is a strong weapon, but falls short of Warden.


Cutlass - The Cutlass is a solid fast-attack weapon, but not quite as good some other Quincy weapon choices.


Glock - This used to be one of the best weapons in Type Soul, but recent nerfs have made this gun not too practical for actual use.


Quilge - The Quilge weapon has some very powerful M1s, making it a solid choice for any Quincy.


Schwert - The Schwert is a ranged crit-based weapon.


Warden - This high-chaining weapon is arguably the best in Type Soul at the moment, and all Quincy players should probably be using it. Best Hakuda weapon in the game.



Type Soul Quincy Weapon Tier List


We've put together a Quincy Weapon Tier List for Type Soul to highlight the best weapon choices for Quincy characters. With this Tier List, you essentially want to focus on a weapon from the S Tier. While A Tier weapons are solid enough, they just don't reach the potential of S Tier. You should probably avoid both the B Tier and C Tier weapons for now, as they need some buffs to be viable.


S Tier



Cang Du Claws


Quilge


Warden



A Tier



Cutlass


Schwert



B Tier



Antithesis

SMGs must check off a few boxes to be considered worth using in Warzone. First and foremost, time-to-kill speed statistics separate the contenders from the pretenders. In close-range gunfights, speed is everything, and weapons have to be able to take down enemies quickly. Additionally, the best SMGs have large magazines, which make it easier to take on multiple enemies at once, and you don't want a weapon with too much recoil. We used that criteria to rank the best SMGs in the battle royale.

2024 is turning out to be a pretty good year for Prince of Persia. We got the excellent Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown in January, and then rumours of a new game from none other than Dead Cells devs Evil Empire proved to be true when The Rogue Prince of Persia was officially announced. And because of both of these things, it got us reminiscing about other entries in the long-running series.
Jordan Mechner's 1989 platformer built on the cinematic foundations of Karateka and started a franchise which has seen its share of ups (the Sands of Time reboot, the recent Lost Crown revival) and downs (the Sands of Time film, Prince of Persia 3D), but despite the occasional misfire or workaday entry, the series has endured for almost 35 years

In summary, AI must achieve the impossible, to benefit the few, or completely disconnect from the internet.

It is, as it appears, an unabashed homage to Castlevania, but with none of the -vania, making it much more like the original (or the game boy ones, and possibly a few others in the series I don't know about): a straightforward, linear platform game about whipping monsters and not stepping on spikes. Ten a penny, right? But CNSBL captures it so well that it had me looking up old game boy tunes it vaguely reminded me of.

Welcome back to Plundertales, a chronicling of my journey to best strategy game Total War: Warhammer 3 as vampire pirate Count Noctilus without ever touching grass. When we last saw Noctilus, he’d just received a challenge from his ancient rival Gentlemen Jenkins, crudely scrawled on the rear of a carrier pigeon (I had to google ‘do birds have buttocks?’ to write that.) I say ancient rival, it’s been about 15 turns, but Horace said the column needed more drama and that Noctilus’ ongoing battle with the weevils to reclaim his biscuit tin ‘wasn’t testing well’ with the Treehouse’ preview audience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch Online’s Super Nintendo catalog is three games larger today thanks to the additions of Super R-Type, Wrecking Crew ‘98, and Amazing Hebereke.


Super R-Type is a side-scrolling sci-fi shooter launched in 1991, and it’s essentially an enhanced port of the arcade game R-Type II. It includes elements from that game while featuring new stages and enemies of its own.  
Wrecking Crew ‘98 is the Japan-only sequel to the NES classic Wrecking Crew. First released in 1998 for Nintendo Power’s download service before getting its own cartridge, this marks the game’s first release in the West.
Amazing Hebereke is a 1994 fighting game by Sunsoft that pits up to four players battling to knock each other out. The game is a spin-off of the Hebereke series (known here as Uforia: The Saga, of which its long-awaited sequel recently launched).

        <updated>2024-04-12T14:48:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the Triple-i Initiative earlier this week, Gearbox Publishing and developer Wabisabi Games unveiled RKGK. Sporting an eye-popping art direction that blends anime and graffiti art influences, this promising-looking action platformer is coming this year.
RKGK (pronounced “Rakugaki”) unfolds in a Cap City, a futuristic metropolis caught in a vice grip by the oppressive B Corp led by the villainous Mr. Buff. The plot centers on rebellious graffiti artist Valah, who rages against this machine by using her art to bring life back to the city and inspire its citizens to stand up and rebel.


Valah gets around by using her graffiti paint to stylishly grind on rails while chaining jumps, dashes, and glides. She also has appears to have her own drone to soar across the cityscape. High-speed platforming is the name of the game, and maintaining a smooth flow state sends her into Defacer mode, transforming the world into a dreamy animated version of itself. Although the trailer doesn’t show off gameplay, it depicts Valah spraying paint to destroy B Corps’ robotic minions. You’ll also be able to create graffiti art using an array of paint and cosmetic tools. Check out the screenshots below for an in-game look at RKGK. 

RKGK is Wabisabi Games’ debut title and looks to follow in the graffiti-soaked dystopian future footsteps of games like Jet Set Radio and Marc Ecko’s Getting Up (remember that?). It’s coming to PC later this year.]]></summary>

Having dug into the latest build’s GPU performance and graphics settings, I have found a few loose strands of technical flax that Manor Lords could do with snipping away. Yet it’s generally in good shape, both for early access and a solo developer project, successfully balancing strong visuals with relatively light hardware demands that should help it run on older PCs (or handhelds like the Steam Deck). Several hours in, the ugliest things I’ve seen are my road layouts.

Thus, the purity of Bore Blasters. Some facts can be divined from the earth, though: you play a dwarf, piloting a small ship akin to Robotnik's flying hedghog killer, and are dropped off on a small, discrete, gem-bearing chunk of dirt. This you pulverise, in a downward direction, with the aim of finding a huge chest of gems at the bottom somewhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meet the competitors.
Following the cancellation of Nintendo Live 2024 in Tokyo, the world championships for both Splatoon 3 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe had to be rescheduled for a later date. Well, that date is now here as the events get underway today (or tomorrow, depending on your time zone).
The championships themselves will be taking place in Japan, though everything will be streamed on the Nintendo of America YouTube channel so nobody has to miss out on any of the action.

Not at present, according to Bethesda executive producer Todd Howard, and he says he'd "probably say no" if approached. Mind you, that was the stance he had until Fallout finally fell into place.

Withering Rooms is one of the latter: released out of early access last week, and noticed by me just yesterday, it's a haunted mansion metroidvania in which you are a small girl in a nightie who must use meat cleavers, pentagrams and spells of self-enlargement or possession or incineration to overcome various monsters of the Silently Hilly and/or Residentially Evil persuasion. No, none of the monsters are Golden Retrievers.

Dubbed The Forgotten Kingdom, it adds a new Invoker archetype, fleshes out an existing jungle biome, and introduces more gear, more monsters, and the like. Yes, count me in.

In a statement provided to The Verge, Discord said that there was a court ordered injunction for the takedown of such materials, suggesting that the action is directly linked to the previous legal issues surrounding the Switch emulator Yuzu.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently revealed the newest big cover story from Game Informer – our blowout look at Massive Entertainment’s Star Wars Outlaws. We were excited by the chance to visit the studio in Sweden to play the game and interview the team. We were especially thrilled at the gorgeous art from the game that we shared on the cover, where we see protagonists Kay Vess and Nix firmly ensconced in the scum and villainy of that fictional galaxy far, far away.
To celebrate the new cover, we’re giving away five numbered copies of this issue’s Game Informer Gold Edition. If you’re not in the know, our Gold issues are numbered limited editions of each issue, featuring top-quality paper and ink, thicker cover stock, and a gold foil Game Informer logo. We produce an extremely limited number of copies of each issue, which are not available for sale. A sweepstakes like this is one of the only ways to snag a copy.
Even better, you’ve got many chances to win. Every individual who signs up for our new print subscription program is automatically entered for one chance to win. Already signed up at subscription.gameinformer.com? Then we’ve got good news! You’re already in the running for one of these gold editions.

It’s anyone’s guess what Warhorse has in store, but there’s a solid chance the new game is a Kingdom Come sequel. Despite receiving mixed reviews at launch, it has gained a passionate following, and it was ported to Switch last month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sketchy Fables is a hand-drawn, first-person adventure created by solo developer Alle Jong using 10,000 drawings. And it's something you simply have to see, whether you're interested in first-person exploration games or not, because it's a sight to behold. 
As someone who cannot draw, I'm always fascinated (and impressed) with people who can. That Jong was able to create an entire game using 10,000 drawings is all the more fascinating, and if the trailer below is any indication, it's a game I can't wait to check out. 
Watch the Sketchy Fables gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


There's not much more information to find about the game. Its Steam description reads, "Sketchy Fables is a first-person exploration adventure." Diving into the details of the Steam listing, Jong says it plays like an interactive cartoon and features a diverse game environment to explore full of villages and rural landscapes. 
It's also "focused on personal exploration with many random encounters and discoveries," according to the page. 

As for when Sketchy Fables hits PC, that remains unknown, but it's a game we're keeping our eyes on so hopefully we'll have more to share sooner than later.

I’ve never had much of a green thumb. For years, I largely believed growing a plant required little more than burying a seed in the dirt, pouring water, and letting the sun handle the heavy lifting. Botany Manor asks players to perform those crucial first steps before challenging them to deduce the additional methods necessary to make their seedlings blossom.

From the very beginning, Nintendo handhelds have been a powerhouse in the puzzle genre, championing games that might have been lost in the bombastic, graphics-obsessed arena of home consoles. Switch’s bridging of the portable/home console divide means it upholds that proud puzzling tradition and gives on-the-go gamers a chance to dive deeper than ever before into the ever-addictive world of puzzlers.

Atlus has revealed a brand new trailer along with some fresh information for Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance ahead of its expected release on 14th June, 2024.
What's particularly drawn our eye is the brand new form for the game's protagonist, which is accessible via the new 'Canon of Veangeance' story path. For those not caught up yet, Vengeance will feature two story paths: Canon of Creation and Canon of Vengeance. The former is the original SMTV experience through and through, while the latter is unique to the new game and diverges drastically during the middle and later portions of the campaign.

That's partly because it's so easy to find a healthy one now, and there's a joy in shearing down multiple times and still finding material. You can start from "strategy games are in a good state" and go all the way down to "Turn-based strategy wargames that balance detailed simulation with accessibility and are set in World War 2" and still find several strong entries from the last few years.
But it's The Troop that grabbed me most. It's a little surprising, given its modest look, and the stiff competition. I think what clinched it is that The Troop has revealed to me something that I already sort of knew, but hadn't quite caught hold of: that a tank warfare game is all about the pause.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they've been chewing over. Today, Jim is finding 2024 to be a little more stacked than he expected...

2023 was a wild ride on Switch. In any given year, the likes of Fire Emblem Engage, Pikmin 4, Outer Wilds, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective (and probably another 10 games that are slipping my mind) would be in with a shout for GOTY. But no! Nintendo had to go and release perhaps my most-anticipated game ever in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and, selfishly, make it absolutely slap?! Honestly, where's the respect?

Picture it: the post-apocalyptic America of Fallout, radroaches and stimpacks and all, except that this being a TV adaptation, the first hour doesn't consist entirely of trying to persuade Bethesda's face editor not to make your character look like their soul has been sucked out. Instead, you can kick back with a can of Nuka Cola and watch flesh-and-blood stars Ella Purnell, Walton Goggins and Aaron Moten rove the wasteland. I caught the first couple of episodes last week, and while I find the show's aesthetics off-putting - it's kind of a Fallout themepark, rather than a convincing world - I do think there's the makings of a fun tale here.

When making the Myst-like adventure game The Last Express, he set his story on a train crossing Europe in 1914 - the same year Mechner’s own grandfather became a teenage refugee, his life in a Jewish enclave on the Austro-Hungarian border shattered.
“He was drafted as a soldier,” Mechner says. “So I’m sure that in the back of my mind, in creating The Last Express, I was thinking of the terrible impact that war had on Europe and my grandfather’s experience as well. What’s interesting to me is that a lot of these echoes are unconscious.”

In particular, the thorny issue of whether The Pirate Bay should be blocked in the Netherlands, dragged on for years. But now, as BREIN continues its battle against pirate IPTV providers, the ISPs' sales of bundled TV services are also feeling the squeeze. Suddenly, all three agree; something more substantial is required to counter the growth of pirate IPTV.

However, EA has denied Grubb's reporting, telling IGN, "We don't normally comment on rumors but there is no validity to this story." 
On Giant Bomb's Game Mess Mornings show, Grubb said, "They were working on it, they were working on Dead Space 2 and they are no longer working on it. It is on the shelf because the first game had lackluster sales, is how it was phrased to me."
He continues, adding, "As it stands right now, they were working on it; it was in the concepting phase...pre-production, and now that work has been put on the shelf."

Dubbed V Rising: Legacy of Castlevania, this DLC includes new cosmetics that allow you to take on the aesthetics of hair, clothing, and forms of Konami's Castlevania franchise, and it will give players the chance to fight Simon Belmont, too. 
As for what to expect, the Legacy of Castlevania Premium Pack will give players Alucard's Cloak, Alucard's Coat, Alucard's Leggings, Alucard's Gloves, and Alucard's Boots. "The complete set can be crafted in-game when you unlock the tailor bench," the DLC's Steam description reads. "It costs cloth and coarse thread to make and is purely cosmetic. Using the new armor customization feature, you can don the garb of the Vampire Prince at any level of your vampire journey." 
Check out the V Rising: Legacy of Castlevania Premium Pack DLC trailer for yourself below: 


We learned last month that V Rising is coming to PS5 later this year, and according to the trailer above, the Legacy of Castlevania DLC will be available on the platform when the base game launches on it. 
V Rising launches into 1.0 on PC on May 8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: EA have now denied Grubb's claims that the Dead Space 2 remake was in development before being effectively cancelled, telling IGN: "We don't normally comment on rumors but there is no validity to this story." That report adds that the sequel wasn't considered for development to begin with, despite the first remake having performed well in EA's eyes, according to a source.
Original story continues below
A remake of Dead Space 2 - following last year’s return of the original sci-fi survival-horror game - was reportedly in the works at EA, but has since been halted after the first game suffered underwhelming sales.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Pocketpair has revealed Palworld Arena, a new Arena mode coming to the popular "Pokémon With Guns" survival game sometime this year. Pocketpair briefly pulled back the curtains on Palworld Arena during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase, which is where we saw some of the gameplay from the arena in action. 
If the trailer is any indication, it appears to support splitscreen co-op and gives players the chance to fight head-to-head in an arena to see whose party of Pals is the strongest. 
Check it out for yourself in the Palworld Arena trailer below: 


"The Pal Arena makes its way to Palworld in 2024," the trailer's description reads. "Battle against other players, pitting both yourself and your pals against them. Train the strongest Pals and defeat all your rivals." 
That's all we know about the Palworld Arena, but since it's arriving this year, we might not have to wait too much longer to learn more. 
In the meantime, catch up on all things Palworld with Game Informer's Palworld primer, and then read about the latest update, which added the first Raid boss to the game alongside additional Pal and base changes, and more.

They showed off some brief snippets of its 33-player cooperative roguelike-ing, where you'd beat up hellish monsters in a miniature take on MMO raids. If you were intrigued by it back then, I have good news. The Triple-i Initiative gave us more of a glimpse at how the game would look in the hands, with precious UI markers and the promise we'll uncover new "Torture Chambers". Lovely. No seriously, it does look quite lovely, if a touch predictable.

When I had the chance to go hands-on with The Rogue: Prince of Persia, I had only watched the credits roll on Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown a few nights ago. Before that, the last time I watched credits roll on a new Prince of Persia game was in 2010 with The Forgotten Sands. I was surprised and happy to play a new excellent Prince of Persia game this year, but considering how long I had to wait for that one, I was not holding my breath for another – not even the Sands of Time remake I have been patiently waiting for.
Which is to say it was incredibly surprising when Ubisoft reached out about its new Prince of Persia rogue-lite. It’s not a mode in Lost Crown or a spinoff, as I initiall…]]></summary>

Called The Rogue Prince Of Persia, a name choice that makes it sound a bit like an illegal knockoff being sold out of the back of Evil Empire's Peugeot, I got to have a go of about 45 minutes of it last week. It's 2D, side on platforming, and super colourful. Think Dead Cells skinned as a kids cartoon with a branded cereal tie-in, extremely cool music, and an emphasis on wall running. It's mobile even by the standards of a platformer, in fact, and is entering Steam early access on May the 14th.

The excellent Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown released in January, and today we learn about The Rogue: Prince of Persia, which will be entering early access in May.
The game comes from developer Evil Empire, the co-developer of Dead Cells, and the lineage shows. The game is a 2D platformer roguelike that has a lot in common with Dead Cells, but after spending some hands-on time with the game, it also has its own identity. Join Marcus Stewart and me as I share details about my hands-on experience with the next Prince of Persia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Fumi Games and publisher PlaySide Publishing have released a new trailer for Mouse, the 1930s vintage cartoon-inspired FPS, and in it, we get gameplay featuring new traversal mechanics, power-ups, and more. Released during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase, this new Mouse gameplay trailer highlights the grappling hook, helicopter, and Spinach power-up. 
As you might expect, the grappling hook allows players to target designated points in a level for rapid movement and traversal. The helicopter adds vertical traversal to players' arsenal with reduced descent speed, and finally, the Spinach power-up augments and enhances melee combat (in a nod to Popeye). 
Check out the latest Mouse gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


"Mouse is incredibly important to all of us here at Fumi Games, and we're committed to making sure that it lives up to all of the expectations," Fumi Games CEO Mateusz Michalak writes in a press release. "Our goal has always been to create a game that combines our passion for animation with our passion for first-person shooters. We are genuinely committed to collaborating closely with the Mouse community to craft a game that truly resonates with players. 
"We'll aim to share more details – whenever possible – as development progresses. Our partnership with PlaySide and our dedicated and talented team is working hard to bring you the finest grandboomer cartoon shooter ever created." 
Here are some new screenshots from Mouse for your viewing: 

Mouse was revealed back in 2023; it's due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC in 2025.

Before that, though, Vampire Survivors will cross over with Contra in Operation Guns, a new DLC featuring characters, weapons, and more from the series, on May 9. 
This was revealed during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase with a new trailer highlighting what Contra in Vampire Survivors looks like, and perhaps to nobody's surprise, it looks awesome.

As you can see, Operation Guns looks like an exciting boost of weaponry, characters, enemies, and more to Vampire Survivors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlaySide Studios has revealed Kill Knight, a new Hades-inspired isometric arcade shooter coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC this year. Revealed with a gameplay trailer during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase, Kill Knight plunges players into an Eldritch abyss of horrors where waves of enemies stand in the way of their one goal: kill the last angel. 
"Once a loyal knight, betrayed, and banished to the Abyss," a press release for Kill Knight reads. "A desecrated corpse inside reanimated armor. You rise to an eternal death. Branded Kill Knight, you have one purpose – kill the last angel. Players must learn to exploit enemy weaknesses, enact brutal executions, and weave through the Knight's Arsenal to tactically manage resources as they dance with death in the Abyss and take the fight to global leaderboards against friends and foes alike." 
Check out the Kill Knight reveal trailer for yourself below: 


In Kill Knight, players are challenged to master the demon within as they descend through the voids of an eldritch arena and harness a devastating arsenal of armor and weapons against swarms of otherworldly horrors. As you can see in the trailer above, Kill Knight features fast and visceral top-down arcade-action combat with a disgustingly horrific otherworld to traverse through. There are five fatal layers to get through, each more deadly than the last, according to PlaySide Studios. 
As you survive waves of enemies, your Kill Power will increase, which in turn increases your speed and damage. Plus, there are plenty of challenges to unlock your Knight's Arsenal "and evolve your playstyle." In Master Mode, all five layers become one extended arena, and you can track your skill on a global leaderboard, too. 
Here are some Kill Knight screenshots for your viewing:

According to its Steam page, the game “tasks you with creating a new home for your people forced out of the lowlands.” There are both campaign and sandbox modes, where you’ll establish multiple towns on multiple mountains, each with its own traits. “All your towns co-exist in symbiosis,” it continues, “creating a trading network, which you can then adjust to your needs by revisiting already developed settlements.” Here are some more deets, via Steam.

I've always felt like last year's Darkest Dungeon 2 was secretly one of them. Rather than simply building on the previous game's premise of a Hamlet's worth of upgradeable, derangeable heroes venturing into tabletop RPG-style labyrinths, it stripped away Darkest Dungeon's skin and moved its bones and organs around to create a gruelling roguelike. Well, developers Red Hook appear to have done it again with Darkest Dungeon 2's free Kingdoms mode, out later this year, which slices open Darkest Dungeon 2's hide and recomposes it into a turn-based strategy boardgame, where you defend a world map against encroaching eldritch creatures.

You can do it right now, actually. It’s just gotten a free demo on Steam, alongside a proper release date of September 5th 2024. Don’t do it if you’re actually driving, though. That’d be lunacy. We only promote the fun kind of lunacy here, like the type shown off in What the Car?’s trailer at the Triple-i initiative.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mega Crit Studios has announced Slay The Spire II, a sequel to its mega-popular roguelike deckbuilder Slay The Spire released in 2019. Since that original release, the game has made its way to various other platforms beyond PC, including PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and even mobile devices. Now, players can expect the sequel to hit Early Access (presumably on PC) starting next year. 
This news was announced during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase with a quick cinematic trailer highlighting the game's beautiful animation. We see a few monstrous creatures and characters, presumably the ones we'll control, before "Slay The Spire II" flashes on-screen. 
Check it out for yourself in the Slay The Spire II reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, this Slay The Spire II reveal trailer doesn't contain any gameplay, but it does say the game hits Early Access in 2025. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Slay The Spire review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Danish developer Northplay and publisher Ghost Ship Publishing have revealed Dinolords, a medieval real-time strategy game where you fight Vikings and defend your lands alongside dinosaurs and more. In a new teaser trailer published during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase, we get glimpses of dino-powered armies, action RPG combat mixed with real-time strategy, and more. 
"We're honored to be showcasing our brand new trailer thanks to the Triple-i Initiative amongst so many incredible games and developers that make up the amazing indie corner of the games industry," Northplay CEO Michael Flarup writes in a press release. "We've poured a lot of love into Dinolords and we can't wait for players to get their hands on it when it launches into Early Access next year." 
Check out the new Dinolords reveal trailer for yourself below: 


Northplay says while mixing real-time strategy with action RPG gameplay, players will also have to gather resources, build cities, construct fortifications, and command units in widescale medieval warfare. 
Dinolords takes place in an alternate history in which the King of Denmark launches the first dinosaur-powered conflict with his invasion of England, according to a press release. Players take on the role of an English Lord, defending their land against the ferocious invaders and taming their own primeval beasts for battle.
Here are some Dinolords screenshots for your viewing: 

Dinolords is set to hit Early Access in 2025.

More specifically, we'll finally get a good look at the Shire in the new trailer on April 22. 
Attention, dear Hobbits! Mark your calendars for our #TalesoftheShire trailer on April 22! pic.twitter.com/aZXvmR8qUs
April 10, 2024
As for what to expect, Wētā Workshop has shared little about the game beyond its initial reveal teaser. We know the game promises to let players live their best cozy Hobbit lives, and that sounds great on its own, but we're excited to see what that entails from a gameplay perspective. If I had to guess, Tales of the Shire will fall somewhere between a life sim and a farming sim, akin to something like Animal Crossing but with Hobbits. 
Fortunately, we don't have to wait too long to find out because the first trailer for Tales of the Shire arrives on Monday, April 22.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s the birthday of the Triple-I Initiative, a 45-minute showcase of game announcements and trailers from the likes of Slay The Spire devs MegaCrit, Darkest Dungeon devs Red Hook and Dead Cells custodians Evil Empire. What makes a “triple-I” game a “triple-I” game, as opposed to (hawk, spit) a regular indie? I've given it some thought, and I think the answer is: "has more money and status than most indies, but not, like, Call of Duty levels, and also one of our partners is Gearbox Publishing, so this is perhaps ‘indie’ in the Geoff Keighley sense."
Don’t expect any of Keighley's beloved Kojima interludes or dance numbers in this one, however. The IIIIs are a leaner, quieter showcase with no host or advertising or celebrity drop-ins – you can read more about the thinking behind the event in my GDC interview with a few of the participating studios. Find the full stream below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year’s acclaimed Dave the Diver is coming to PlayStation next week on April 16. The scuba diving exploration/restaurant simulator has also been enhanced with a few Sony-exclusive perks.
Dave the Diver is also coming to PS4, but a new trailer shows off the PS5 version's DualSense-specific features. That includes using the controller's haptic feedback to "sense the movements of the deep sea." The adaptive triggers add a kick to firing Dave's speargun and a vibrating tension to the harpoon gun. Sound effects, such as phone call ringtones, are emitted through the controller speaker. 


Dave the Diver stars the titular diver as he explores undersea environments to locate and capture various marine species. After fishing, players then use these ingredients to operate a growing sushi restaurant.
As editor-in-chief Matt Miller wrote in his 8.75 out of 10 review, "You might question whether a sushi restaurant management sim crossed with underwater diving is your cup of tea, but that would be missing the point. Dave the Diver is a unique and memorable vacation away from expectations, and it's the very fact that you don't usually play games like this that makes it so satisfying."
Dave the Diver is already available on Switch and PC, and has a Godzilla-themed crossover coming in May.]]></summary>

In it, we get gameplay of the up-to-four-player mode that features 200 stages set across various different worlds, and it looks like a blast. 
Featuring both local and online four-player co-op, Adventure Mode will be available on day one when Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble launches on Switch on June 25. Optional assist features, like Rewind and Ghost Guide, allow players to customize how their monkey ball experience plays. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble: Adventure gameplay trailer below: 


"While visiting a tropical island, AiAi and the gang meet a girl named Palette, an adventurer searching for the Legendary Banana," a press release reads. "They agree to join her on her journey across wondrous worlds to collect special parts said to be the key to localizing this prized relic. Along the way, they'll meet new friends and encounter mysterious rivals."
Adventure Mode features 200 new stages set across different worlds, such as Banana Farm, Rose Garden, Floating City, Golden Temple, and Stone Valley. Each brings its own unique twist and challenge to the Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble experience. 
In Adventure Mode, players can utilize the Rewind feature to rewind to a previous point of a stage and re-attempt a particularly challenging section. The Ghost Guide option adds a transparent monkey alongside the player that demonstrates how to proceed, while the Route Guide will point you in the right direction if you're unsure of where to go. Plus, you can restart at any checkpoint within a stage at any time. 
Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble hits Switch on June 25.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Drop Bear Bytes, the studio behind post-apocalyptic RPG Broken Roads, are named after Australia’s deadliest creature. The Drop Bear might look like a normal koala, but they’re actually dangerous predators, fond of jumping from trees to maul unsuspecting chumps who forget to take adequate precautions, like urinating on themselves. Really, the story is a wind-up the aussies like to blag tourists with. If it looks like a koala, it’s just a koala. But it’s this sort of character, inspired by love for Australia’s unique landscape, culture and good-natured mick-taking, that forms the heart of the best bits in Broken Roads. I say ‘best bits’, but I should probably say ‘the only bits that I actually enjoyed’, unfortunately.
Bombs wiped out 80% of Australia’s population, and left the remaining nail-hard Nancys and tough Tobiases to fend for themselves in a world short of resources, but shockingly plentiful in both guns and pre-made Vegemite sarnies. You’ll pick one of four character classes - I went with ‘Jackaroo’ (cattle hand), because it was called ‘Jackaroo’ - before tackling a short tutorial section. You'll then be thrust into some events, where you’ll meet the rest of your starting party and kick off the game proper.

It's early days, but the show's first two episodes didn't make a massive impression on me, though I will concede that the sight of Amazon's branding on Fallout's infamous Please Stand By emergency broadcast titlecard makes a dangerous amount of sense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not a Fallout fan. I’ve always admired the games and dabbled with them for a few hours here and there, but it was never a series that inspired excitement in me. I am, however, a fan of the Fallout series executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. The two worked together on Westworld and though my fandom faded over time, I will always hold up the first season as some of my favorite television ever. I went into Amazon’s Fallout adaptation with unsure expectations. Video game movies and TV shows have improved in recent years, but I will always be hesitant. And time has frequently proven that one successful project from a creator (or a pair in this case) does not automatically equal success in another. Thankfully, however, the Fallout show is scary, violent, funny, weird, intriguing…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today marks two years since the official reveal of Kingdom Hearts IV, and while Square Enix hasn't shared any news about the game, fans of the series can celebrate with a new recording of the franchise's best song by Hikaru Utada. As pointed out on X (formerly Twitter) by Genki_JPN, Utada's new Science Fiction album, which they released yesterday, features a re-recording of "Hikari," the Japanese version of "Simple and Clean." 
If you're a Kingdom Hearts fan, you likely already know which song this is. However, if you haven't touched the series in a while, or if you've never played the beginning of Kingdom Hearts, it's the Japanese version of the song in this famous game opener below: 


As for the new recording of "Hikari," its place on Science Fiction makes sense because its Utada's first greatest hits album, if you will, meant to act as a compilation with new mixes of old songs, re-recordings of fan-favorite tracks, and more. You can listen to the album, which features 26 tracks, starting today. 
If you're interested in hearing the new recording of "Hikari," you can listen below: 


For more about Kingdom Hearts, watch the Kingdom Hearts IV trailer here, and then check out Game Informer's Kingdom Hearts III review. After that, read Game Informer's exclusive interview with Kingdom Hearts IV director Tetsuya Nomura for new details.

This trailer was part of a wider information blitz surrounding The Final Shape, which promises to conclude the decade-long War of Light and Darkness story arc, where we also learned more about The Witness and additional exotics. 
Unveiled last August and originally set to launch in February before getting delayed to June 4, The Final Shape is shaping up (pun intended) to be one of the biggest expansions for Destiny 2 yet. It's fitting, considering the story players have been enjoying for 10 years is set to wrap up in it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft Massive's open world action-adventure Star Wars Outlaws will release on 30th August 2024, according to a new story trailer which introduces us properly to "emerging scoundrel" Kay Vess, aka Hannah Solo. If you haven't had the pleasure, Kay is a budding crook on the run from her underworld boss, a journey that sees her tangling with several other Star Wars crime syndicates on various planets. It really feels like they're keeping a lot of the headline Star Wars stuff at a respectful distance for this one: yes, Jabba the Hutt makes an appearance, but there's nary a whiff of The Force, Jedi or Sith in the trailer and not once does anybody build a Death Star.

The game received a lot of hype when it was first revealed during last summer's Xbox Games Showcase and its subsequent gameplay footage during a Ubisoft Forward stream the next day. Today's story trailer not only gave us more to whet our appetite but also let us know when we'll finally be able to step into the role of Kay Vess as we navigate the Star Wars underworld.
Star Wars Outlaws puts you in the role of Kay Vess, a pickpocket turned thief who gets mixed up with Sliro, the leader of Zerek Besh, a new criminal syndicate.

Regardless of your history with the series, there's no denying the impact that Star Wars has had in the pop culture landscape. The Original Trilogy inspired countless other pieces of media and the subsequent releases have all been noteworthy for one reason or another. But it was the Original Trilogy that developer Massive Entertainment – the team behind games like The Division, The Division 2, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – chose to make its playground. We traveled to the coastal city of Malmö, Sweden, to learn all about the open-world scoundrel adventure set in a galaxy far, far away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motive Studio, the EA team behind last year's Dead Space remake and its in-development Iron Man game, has revealed it is forming a new internal team to support the Battlefield franchise. Motive will help develop future Battlefield experiences as it continues to work on its Iron Man game with Marvel, which it says has hit a "major internal milestone." 
This news comes from a new blog post by Motive's general manager, Patrick Klaus, where he also reveals the directors behind the studio's Dead Space remake – executive producer Philippe Ducharme and creative director Roman Campos-Oriola – will build a new team to work alongside EA's Battlefield studios. 


"Their proven expertise in storytelling, immersive battles, and developing on the Frostbite engine uniquely positions them to help advance the vision for Battlefield, led by Vince Zampella (EVP, group general manager for Respawn and Battlefield) and Byron Beede (SVP, general manager for Battlefield). 
"In parallel, development continues to move forward on our Iron Man project, led by Olivier Proulx (executive producer) and Ian Frazier (creative director). The team made excellent progress this year, hitting a major internal milestone and laying a robust foundation for the journey ahead. Iron Man is an important priority for Motive, and I'm very proud of the work we've accomplished so far." 
Motive will work with other EA studios like Criterion, DICE, and Ripple Effect to further expand the company's Battlefield franchise, which saw its last entry, Battlefield 2042, released in 2021. In 2022, we learned the next Battlefield game had entered pre-production with plans to take "valuable lessons" learned from Battlefield 2042 into the game's development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many ways Children Of The Sun is a highly relatable game. I do not have telekinetic powers that allow me to control the path of a bullet from a sniper rifle, and I was not part of a murderous cult that killed my father-figure. But if I did and I were, you can bet that I'd go on a rip-roaring rampage of revenge! Stepping into the be-grimed trainers and unwashed jacket of the protagonist - a misused girl whose vibe is that of a member of Gorillaz - you shoot a single bullet from your gun and control it in first-person as you zip it through the heads, hearts and hands of cultists placed around a level. It's a satisfying Sniper Elite meets Superhot puzzle of ultraviolence, and it's neat.

Yet the presser also says "no scares this time". I am confused, which is why it's probably good there's a demo on Steam to sort of give you a taster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ermac is the next fighter to join the Mortal Kombat 1 roster, and developer NetherRealm Studios has released a new gameplay trailer showcasing what players can expect of the shadowy warrior. The trailer also reveals Ermac hits Early Access on April 16 before his full release on April 23, and that Mavado will join the Kameo roster later next month. 
"Ermac is a collection of souls bound together by Quan Chi's dark magic that are intended to function as a group mind," a press release reads. "But that spell is temporarily undone when Ermac is defeated by Mileena and the mind of King Jerrod, deceased ruler of Outworld and one of the souls in Ermac's collection, takes control and rejoins the royal family, aiding Empress Mileena's reign. 
"Eventually, the amalgam of souls re-establishes control, and Ermac retreats to Outworld's shadows. No longer Quan Chi's slave, nor bound to the royal family, he must find a future worth fighting for."
Check out Ermac in the Mortal Kombat 1 gameplay trailer below: 


To get Ermac, purchase the Premium Edition of Mortal Kombat 1 or buy the Kombat Pack for your Standard Edition of the game. The Kombat Pack indudes a Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin for Johnny Cage (available now) and one-week early access to six playable DLC characters: Omni-Man (available now), Quan Chi (available now), Peacemaker (available now), Ermac (coming April 16), Homelander, and Takeda Takahashi. The Kombat Pack includes all five DLC Kameo fighters, too. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 1 review.

        <updated>2024-04-09T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In March 2023, Dredge became one of the most talked-about games of the year thanks to its combination of engaging fishing mechanics, an enthralling atmosphere, and a fun story involving sinister secrets buried at sea. Ahead of the BAFTA Awards on Thursday, at which Dredge is nominated for four awards, developer Black Salt Games has announced a collaboration with production company Story Kitchen to adapt the critically acclaimed title into a live-action feature film.
In the game, players explore a mysterious archipelago as a fishing boat captain. However, the longer you play, the more unsettling the water surrounding the collection of remote islands becomes. The press release pitches the Dredge live-action film, saying, "Think The Sixth Sense on the water. A grounded atmospheric cosmic horror blend of HP Lovecraft and Ernest Hemingway."
"We are excited to partner with such an experienced studio team to bring the world we created to live action and ignite the imagination of audiences across the globe," a joint statement from the Black Salt Games team said in that same press release.
Story Kitchen was founded in 2022 by Sonic the Hedgehog 2 producer Dmitri M. Johnson, former APA Agent Mike Goldberg, and their production and development executives Timothy I. Stevenson and Dan Jevons. "Dredge is a captivatingly eerie and profoundly rich story that had us completely hooked from the very beginning," a joint statement from Story Kitchen said in the press release.
Dredge currently has an 80 out of 100 rating on the reviews aggregate website Metacritic. If you missed it, it is currently available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Yesterday, players celebrated what they thought was the complete eradication of the Automaton Legion in Helldivers 2. The official Helldivers 2 X (formerly Twitter) account even tweeted about players' success in the galaxy. Now, roughly a day later, the Automatons have returned. 
"Somehow, the Automatons returned. As suspected all along, the previous Bot force was merely a vanguard. A massive fleet how now begun an assault on Cyberstan and the surrounding planets. Helldivers, hold back this unprovoked invasion. The fight continues!"
Somehow, the Automatons returned.

        <updated>2024-04-09T12:06:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Studios' Fallout TV series will premiere one day early, with all eight episodes now hitting Prime Video on April 10 at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET. The series was originally due out on April 12 but Amazon announced it had moved the launch day up to April 11 alongside a new look at the show. Now, Amazon has moved the date up one more day, meaning you can check out this live-action adaptation of the post-apocalyptic wasteland tomorrow. 
Walton Goggins, who plays The Ghoul, announced this news during a new Fallout commercial that aired last night (April 8) during the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Game. After the first episode airs at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET tomorrow, the other seven episodes will be available for viewing exclusively on Prime Video in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide. 
If you haven't yet seen it, check out the latest Fallout trailer for a new look at the show: 


"Based on one of the greatest video game series of all time, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there's almost nothing left to have," a press release reads. "Two hundred years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind – and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them." 
Amazon Studios, which is behind series like The Boys and Invincible, is producing Fallout alongside Kilter Films and executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. Nolan directed the first three episodes of Fallout. 
Fallout premieres on Prime Video on April 10. 
For more, check out the teaser trailer for Fallout released back in December. After that, read Game Informer's reviews of Fallout 4 and Fallout 76.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last summer, we sat down with Sonic Team Creative Officer Takashi Iizuka to discuss his multi-decade career at Sega. We learn about his childhood fascination with becoming a manga artist, the transition from college life to working at Sega, and his early career developing games like Devi and Pii, Golden Axe 3, and Sonic the Hedgehog 3. Iizuka remembers the excitement and challenge during the transition from the Sega Genesis (known as the Sega Mega Drive in Japan) to the Sega Saturn, which allowed the team progress from 2D pixel art to 3D polygonal modeling.
Notably, the Sonic the Hedgehog lead reflects on the early Dreamcast days, moving to the United States to better implement western culture into Sonic Adventure 2, and finally, describes his emotions after hearing Sega was exiting the hardware business and ending production of the Dreamcast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fallout, Amazon Prime’s TV adaptation of Bethesda’s popular RPG, is set to premiere this week on April 11. However, it looks like a second season is already in the works. 
Variety reports (thanks, Eurogamer) that The California Film Commission has awarded $152 million in tax incentives to a dozen TV shows across various studios to lure production of those series into the state. $25 million of these tax credits has been allocated to Fallout's second season, so production is now expected to take place in California. Fallout’s $153 million budget is the largest of any show on this list
Season 1 was largely filmed in New York, with some production in Utah. However, as Variety notes, receiving this tax credit does not guarantee Amazon will accept it and relocate Fallout's production to California for Season 2.


Fallout premieres on Amazon Prime Video on Thursday, April 11. The eight-episode series is directed by Westworld showrunners Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, with Bethesda head Todd Howard serving as executive producer. The cast includes Ella Purnell, Walton Goggins, Kyle MacLachlan, and Aaron Moten. The show’s synopsis reads

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s odd to think back on a time before Baldur’s Gate 3 - and even stranger to think that the sprawling Dungeons & Dragons RPG was actually kicking around for a long while before its 1.0 release blew up awards shows, social media feeds and fan-fiction hubs last summer. Putting the game out into early access at the end of 2020 - multiple years before it was ready for a full release - worked out very well for Larian though, so it’s maybe no surprise that they plan to do exactly the same with whatever comes next.

Sat across the table from a mysterious opponent clad in a deeply unnerving toothy mask, you pick up a shotgun loaded with shells. Then, you decide whether to point the gun at your opponent or yourself, and pull the trigger. Some of the shells are live, and others are blanks. Guess correctly, and you get to go again.

After over two years of near-silence, it now looks like it might finally be time for Sam to emerge out of the shadows.

I'm not sure it's possible to get a good dwarven bellow going when you're talking about cosmetic unlock progression, but by all means reorganise this article into some kind of drinking song.

I'm glad to hear that they're being tweaked in an upcoming patch, which you can now test in a public beta on Steam, and even the lowest difficulty setting will be tweaked. Other changes include improved (hopefully) Steam Deck performance, balance tweaks, and better Joker-related Tags.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bethesda was working out how to turn their popular Elder Scrolls RPGs into an online behemoth to rival World Of Warcraft back in the late 00s, the initial pitch was "Elder Scrolls with friends," creative director Rich Lambert tells me. A simple idea on paper, perhaps, but one that proved to be a lot more complicated in the realisation of it. Zenimax Online Studios was founded in 2007, a year after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion landed to universal critical praise, but it wasn't until seven years later that The Elder Scrolls Online finally released for PC in 2014. At launch "we were walking this weird line between 'online game' and 'Elder Scrolls game'," Lambert says. "We didn't do either of them particularly well."
Ten years later, though, The Elder Scrolls Online is thriving. At last count, the game has over 24 million players galloping about the plains of Tamriel, and later this June, it will receive its eighth major Chapter expansion, Gold Road, which adds Oblivion's West Weald to the game and wraps up the mystery of the new Daedric Prince that arrived at the end of the previous expansion, Necrom. But the path ESO has taken to get here hasn't been nearly as glittering, with its PC launch in particular generating "a lot of feedback", as studio director Matt Firor told press at the game's tenth anniversary event last week. In fact, it wasn't until ESO came to consoles in 2015 that the game really found its voice, says Lambert. "We had to really figure out what we wanted to be, and we chose 'Elder Scrolls'. As soon as we hit that core pillar of 'It's Elder Scrolls first, online second,' then it really just helped inform everything we've done since." Trouble is, when the thrust of ESO's development straddled the launch of two very different Elder Scrolls games, even nailing down that first part of the pillar proved to be more challenging than expected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Botany Manor is a game that seems calculated to make me sit up on alert like a meerkat, or crash through a wall yelling like that sentient jug mascot (I am not from America, I just know he exists). It's a puzzle game about growing plants. Holy Strange Horticulture, Batman! But Botany Manor is much less eldritch, and much more gentle historical feel-good movie starring Emma Thompson in the lead role. That role - which in this case is played by you in first person rather than La Thompson - is of Arabella Greene, a retired botanist who, thank God, is the childless inheritor of a huge manor and ancestral wealth, and so is able to spend the sunny days of 1890 pottering around the house and grounds researching weird, slightly fantastical plants almost wholly untroubled. So in this respect it is also a fantasy game. It's quite delightful, which is the sort of phrase I am confident Arabella would use.

An aquarist is someone who builds and manages aquariums, which is your principle task in the capital A Aquarist game. It recently left early access, which is sort of unbelievable because it's very janky in the most adorable way. You can tell it was made by someone who bloody loves aquariums, but taken at face value the career mode tells a strange tale indeed. For example, you have a very unsettling father.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to one unofficial tracker created by video game artist Farhan Noor, there have been 8000 layoffs in 2024 so far, following an estimated 10,500 layoffs in 2023. The leaders of Microsoft, Embracer Group, Epic and other industry giants have made swingeing cuts to their workforces. While larger companies have inevitably seen the largest reductions, many smaller developers and publishers have also cut staff or even closed their doors. Circumstances vary by company, of course, but as regards the biggest publishers, there are some broad overlapping causes: reckless or, if you prefer, "overambitious" expansion and overhiring during the pandemic lockdown gaming boom; lower-than-hoped returns on new technologies and business models such as NFTs; and rising global interest rates, which have scared away potential investors.
The carnage was uppermost in Larian CEO's Swen Vincke's mind when he accepted Baldur's Gate 3's Best Narrative gong at the GDC Awards last month. According to Vincke, the layoffs can be traced straightforwardly to a pattern of executive greed that sees company leadership betting the livelihoods and stability of their workers on whatever new idea seems capable of delivering instant growth for shareholders.

Details were practically non-existent at the time, but YouTuber Glitching Queen recently interviewed Gummelt about what the game could've become. Fun surprises: It would've been a free-to-play live service game featuring coliseum battles. Unsurprises: microtransactions, seasons, general background shenanigans between Treyarch and Raven.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Total Eclipse, a real-time, curse-breaking, 3D adventure (with a dash of Indiana Jones flair), is ready for public testing!
Originally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.
Step into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.
Embark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). 
Can you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?
Our modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wrestlemania 40 is nearly upon us, and if you’ve been following WWE for the past three years, the show, like nearly every story during this time, revolves around one family: the Bloodline. The massive family tree of Samoan wrestlers dates back decades and includes members such as current undisputed champion Roman Reigns, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Yokozuna, Rikishi, and so many others. In a business filled with famous families, the Bloodline is likely the biggest family dynasty in pro wrestling history. 
That got me thinking of similar family trees across all of video game fiction and if any of them could stand toe-to-toe against the Bloodline. I’ve gathered up a few worthy clans, and while we’ll never see them square off against Roman’s fam for dominance, we can at least hypothesize who w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Ubisoft and developer Massive Entertainment has revealed that a new Star Wars Outlaws story trailer will be released next week. We'll be seeing more of protagonist Kay Vess and her trusty (and adorably cute) companion Nix on Tuesday, April 9, at 9 a.m. PT/Noon ET. 
As for what to expect, Ubisoft hasn't shared anything in that regard. It simply says the story trailer is arriving next week and that it will be published on YouTube. 
Watch the World Premiere of the Star Wars Outlaws Story Trailer. Join us at 9AM PST / 6PM CET.
April 5, 2024
This story trailer is our next taste of Star Wars Outlaws, an open-world adventure set between Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. It was announced during an Xbox Games Showcase last June and further showcased with gameplay at a Ubisoft Forward the same month. You can read more about the game in our preview of it here, and you can read this exclusive interview with the game's narrative director about what to expect. 
Star Wars Outlaws is due out sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

Martin’s goal is to rescue his pet dog, which doesn’t sound like it’ll take too long – the “concise and delightful” story mode boasts just three bosses. But lurking behind that all-too-innocent story mode there is a Biblical terror in the shape of a 50-floor tower, made up of increasingly challenging trials. Link’s Awakening with a sort of Bloody Palace component? Yeah, I’ll take that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fulqrum Publishing have just released a story trailer for New Arc Line, a new steampunk fantasy RPG in which dragons rub shoulders with zeppelins, and dwarves are as abundant as air pollution. I hadn't heard of it before and am quite interested, partly because the game sports some wonderfully mangled and colourful dystopian maps, and partly because it's a story of immigrants trying to find their way to an inevitably deceptive "shining city of progress", rather than the typical Chosen One fare.
Your family specifically are afflicted by a fatal disease. Your initial and perhaps overall goal in New Arc Line is to find a cure, of course, but who knows, along the way you might have to "get your hands dirty", "rise from the bottom" and become some sort of absolute bastard.

They are sure to be swiftly rebuked by their fellows for playing dice with fate, those still of sound mind rightly afeared that the name may echo through the brine and tickle the ears of the dread captain himself. On the seas he calls kingdom, Noctilus is without equal, without mercy, and utterly without hesitation. For what has a dead man left to fear?
He has but one fatal flaw; he is deathly afraid of ever leaving his comfortable ship to touch ‘pon the verdant grass of land. I intend to honour this. Do you hear me, lubbers? I will show my strategy game mastery by conquering Total War: Warhammer 3’s world, and I will never touch grass.

Although faux-medieval games are common, there aren't all that many about regular people and regular concerns. Even LotR was increasingly about battles and armies as it went on, rather than the unique management parts.
But in Under The Yoke, you're just a serf. You want to make something of yourself, but it's about a regular person managing his life, not some unlikely "adventurer", whatever that means. So you'll mostly be toiling, and foraging, and genuinely having way more actual skills than us superior modern folk. And despite some UI issues and rough edges, it's weirdly compelling.

Developers Storm Trident and publishers Forever Entertainment have popped up a Steam demo for their Front Mission 2 remake. Tucked within its coils there are two whole levels, Rimian Base and Batari Forest, together with a Garage where you can customise your Wanzer and access to the in-game Network menu.


"Who are you calling a Wanzer?" you bellow. Calm down and stop waving that chair. A wanzer is a mech, in short. And Front Mission, by the way, is a 90s tactical RPG series from G-Craft and Square, both of which have since been assimilated into the terrifying robot octopus that is present-day Square Enix. Much as with Final Fantasy Tactics games, Front Mission games are stagey political thrillers about countries and corporations and other factions waging perpetual war upon each other, with players thrust into the mix as mech squad leaders.

Along with a microSD card (and possibly a better case), these stand/hub combos are definitely among the tools that any regular Steam Deck wielder should have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, if you can believe it, marked the tenth anniversary of The Elder Scrolls Online. That's a whole decade of tromping across Tamriel with your mates, and a whole decade in which I've watched tentatively from the sidelines, thinking about dipping my toes into the MMO pool, but never quite building up the courage (or lining the walls of my bank account) to fully take the plunge. I've heard all the horror stories about starting a new MMO from other members of the RPS Treehouse - particularly when it comes to the lore-laden shackles of World Of Warcraft and the bloated MMO-service-hybrid Destiny - and quite honestly, it's enough to put me off them all entirely. But The Elder Scrolls Online might just be the exception to the rule.
I spent a portion of the game's tenth birthday yesterday playing Gold Road, its upcoming eighth Chapter expansion. In it, you're whisked over to the West Weald, an autumnal, sun-dappled region whose main city hub, Skingrad, will no doubt feel familiar to seasoned Oblivionites. Seemingly overnight, a strange jungle has sprung up on the city's outskirts, uprooting the nearby villages of the neighbouring high elves and causing havoc as strange beasts pour out of its curling root beds. There are more mysteries to unravel here, too, including the emergence of the new Daedric Prince, Ithelia (revealed at the end of last year's Necrom Chapter), and much more besides - too much to realistically take in during a 90-minute preview session, or for this MMO newbie to fully comprehend the significance of. But there's something about Gold Road and its gnarled-up jungles, strange cults and fantastical beasts that's definitely made me want to make a return journey here when it launches on PC on June 3rd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As World Of Warcraft Classic - an MMORPG that is, confusingly, a new version of the old version of World Of Warcraft - enters phase 3 of its Season Of Discovery, PCGamer has an interview with some of the devs where they talk about the decision to not run Player Test Realms - servers where they roll out the new content to smaller numbers of players to road test it. This means that when they launch new stuff for Seasons Of Discovery it'll probably break more often, but it means players get to discover brand new things together. Which is great! And the developers think it's good too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-serving top producer of legendary RPG series Dragon Quest has stepped down from the role, according to sources that spoke to RPS Maw tribute site Bloomberg. Yu Miyake, who has been involved with numerous DQ games since he joined Enix in 1989 as marketer on DQ books, is moving on to head up Square Enix’s mobile games.
The change comes as part of shake-ups at Squeenix under new President and blockchain enjoyer Takashi Kiryu, who Bloomberg point out has committed to reverse SE’s flagging sales of both big releases (like Final Fantasy 16) and mobile titles (like Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis), possibly so he can profit handsomely enough to construct himself an arm-mounted Australian Shepherd launcher (like Final Fantasy 8.)

Update 1.2 will also tweak and fix and fiddle with heaps of other things. Our System Shock review called it "a breathtakingly beautiful and astonishingly faithful remake that proves the enduring power of Looking Glass design" when it launched last year, though I would say System Shock's final battle is one of the most dated parts, so I'm curious to see the new form.

So, if you don’t fancy shelling out the full £19.10 for all three factions, you can grab new bits for either Nurgle, the Empire, or the Dwarfs for £7.49. If you do buy just one to start off with - say, to get a feel for the quality of Thrones of Decay as a package - you’ll get a 15% discount on the remaining two packs in the future.

He registered the site's domain and in 2020 received almost $190,000 in cryptocurrency from sales. The case was backed by IP address evidence and a financial investigation, but things didn't go exactly to plan. A court of appeal decision handed down Thursday couldn't alleviate the disappointment.

Pirate IPTV services, web-based streaming portals, and streams on betting apps filled the void. HD presentations on the social networking site VK also hit the spot, complete with homegrown commentary teams and custom graphics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh MMy — a new ScummVM release!
Please welcome the first ScummVM release of the year: ScummVM 2.8.1.
ScummVM 2.8.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on fixing bugs that were uncovered since our last stable release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines: AGI, AGS, GRIM, SWORD2, MM (which is now enabled — yes, we really skipped it in 2.8.0 by accident), mTropolis, NANCY, SCUMM, TWINE, Ultima, and V-Cruise.
The Android, Atari and macOS ports received multiple bug fixes, mostly for improving overall stability and preventing some crashes we’ve seen under certain circumstances.
The detailed list of improvements is available here.
As always, you can find the latest release on our Downloads page.
Go grab it while it's hot — enjoy!
