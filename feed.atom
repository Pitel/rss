This is the first time that Cancelo has received a special card in this year's Ultimate Team. To play with the card, you'll have to complete all the tasks. Here is cheapest way to complete the challenge, and if it's worth completing at all.

In my book, this is the best-valued SBC that has been released so far during the TOTY promo. For 160,000 coins, you'll get an amazing card that can play at both RB and LB. He also has 5* Weak Foot, making him versatile on both flanks. 


He also has two great playstyle+ in the form of Rapid and Intercept, along with Whipped Cross, Technical, First Touch, and Block. If you want to play him as a wingback, he can be a great potential addition for your squad.

While it was possible for Guardians to create an Exotic Tonic before, there weren't recipes for the concoction until recently. Of course, as with many things in Destiny, players aren't just given the means to produce these valuable Tonics. First, Guardians must uncover the Tonic recipes for themselves; otherwise, strike it lucky on a never-ending treadmill of chance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As spotted by Eurogamer, Sega has just launched the "Sega Account," which links together all of Sega's games and services and adds some extra goodies for your convenience.


You can have this account even if you don't own anything by Sega yet, and it's free to use. "SEGA Account is a profile that lets you maximize SEGA's online services and offers a ton of benefits. Anyone can sign up, and it's free to use!" It also applies to Atlus titles, and it "gives you access to a host of benefits when playing Sega and Atlus titles and using their online services."


The service will also provide users with bonuses and news about Sega-related games, promotions, and events.


What is the Sega Super Game?


The most interesting part of the Sega Account, however, is that fans are positing it to be related to a bigger move by the company. Back in 2022, Sega's financial reports mentioned a mysterious "Super Game" project, which this could be related to. From Bloomberg's report from back in 2022, we learned that this super game was targeting a release date by March 2026, so the Sega Account could serve as a launching pad for this Super Game.


An alternative to this theory is that the "Super Game" is an access point to revived and improved versions of some of Sega's most beloved games from the company's golden past. 




Whatever the Super Game might be, it's clear Sega is making moves to somehow remind players of the place it once had in their hearts.


You can sign up for your Sega account right here. The first bonus will be a special Kazuma Kiriyu skin for Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. Linking accounts will grant you bonuses on Phantom Star Online New Genesis.

The Hello Kitty and Friends DLC by Razzleberries and Sanrio puts Hello Kitty into the blocky world of Minecraft, and she’s also dragged her friends along for the ride. While playing the DLC, you can meet and interact with characters such as:

I haven't taken a shower in days and a fly has gotten into the cab, buzzing around my ears, anticipating the feast that will come from my sweaty summer death. I just spent nearly an hour driving this tractor to the shop, buying car parts, and rumbling back in the dark. I took my eyes off the road for two seconds to turn on the headlights. It was a mistake. The road curved sharply and I went off a steep bank, tipping my tractor on its side. The door is stuck, the tractor's wheels spin helplessly. There is no recovering from this. I restart the game for the third or fourth time, not knowing whether to laugh or sob.
My Summer Car is as hardcore as they come. It does not simply throw you in at the deep end. It ties you up in a cloth sack with 50 kg of lug nuts and dumps you in the Baltic sea. "Sink or swim!" yells this game at you, but in Finnish, so even that you cannot understand. To a certain kind of person, this is an act of love.

All Will Fall is a deceptively not-depressing builder that puts that chocolate and peanut butter together. It’s like 1995’s Waterworld with Kevin Costner. Maybe! I haven’t seen it.


It’s also a bit like Timberborn with its emphasis on vertical engineering, but while Timberborn centered around clans of beavers because humans suck, All Will Fall thrives on humans because humans suck. It’s a weird mix, and you’re either going to need to try out the playtest yourself or just hear me out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TinyBuild and All Parts Connected have unveiled All Will Fall, which bills itself as a physics-based survival city builder and involves building a settlement atop the flooded ruins of human civilization. It’s planned to release in 2025, but an open playtest for it runs from now until January 31st.


Do you like Timberborn? If you answered “no,” you should probably play Timberborn. It’s great! All Will Fall is a bit like that but with fewer beavers. This would normally be seen as a net negative, but it makes up for the lack of Castoridae by sending you out to sea, where you construct penthouses on the tops of skyscrapers that jut out from the endless ocean.


Like many survival city builders, you’ll have to seek out scarce resources and harvest the bounties of the sea. It’s a good thing humans produce so much garbage because that’s the only source of building material. You have to build walkways to other buildings to access resources there, but be careful, because that’s where the “physics-based” side of things comes into play. Fly too close to the sun, and you may come crashing down, Icarus. Although the game warns you well in advance that your structure isn’t stable and gives you the opportunity to fix it, so you won’t find that the super-mall you worked so hard to build is sensitive to slight breezes only after you’ve completed it.


I got an early hands-on look at the playtest version, and you can read all my messy thoughts here. It’s fun! Still, a lot of screws to be tightened, but an enjoyable experience nonetheless. The Timberborn influence can be easily felt, but it’s very much its own unique experience. Maybe try it out.


The playtest for All Will Fall runs from now until January 31st on Steam. It will release sometime in 2025.

How to complete Poison the Roots in Diablo IV


This quest revolves around completing a certain magic ritual, which is all about lighting braziers in a very specific order and then using blood to draw a circle in front of it. This completes the quest and lets you access some new and tasty powers, such as being able to run around with a giant frog that spits poison at your opponents.

You'll see the Ice Staff at work towards the end of the trailer, presumably functioning the same way it always has from Origins as it freezes zombies into place. I remember the days of picking up the Ice Staff pieces in those snowy dirt piles, bringing back fond (and not-so-fond) memories of the Crazy Place. I'd be curious to know if BO6 Zombies' take on it would use a similar crafting route, but it may seem unlikely to have snow piles in the desert-like Tomb map.

But, of course, you will have to be prepared, finding the right spot and bait if you want to avoid wasting a lot of time. So, let's see how to catch the subspace fish mutation in Fisch and the basic info you need.


Where is the Subspace mutation in Fisch?


There is no specific place to find this kind of fish, as mutations in Fisch can indeed appear everywhere in the map. If you are looking to make this Subspace mutation quite more common, you will need to possess a specific exalted enchantment, the Quantum. Once it is applied to your rod, Subspace mutations will appear with around 25% probability.


But how can you get your hands on the Quantum mutation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flexing that backward compatibility.
Prior to the official reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2, one of the late-game leaks revealed that the Joy-Con controllers would now house an optical sensor on the side, leading many to theorise that the console would support mouse functionality.
Fast forward to the debut trailer, and yes, it seems that this may well be the case. Though not officially confirmed yet, the trailer featured both Joy-Con sliding across a surface dragging wristbands (which, in true Nintendo fashion, resembled mice tails), thus heavily implying that the rumours were true.

Much of it is broken still, and bugs rear up where you least expect them. Trees, for example, could straight-up slit your throat.


Please note that I am being very literal here: there was a non-zero chance for you to get sliced up into ribbons while exploring forests in Project Zomboid. It was every bit as hilarious as it was disturbing and painful to see, and it may or may not have happened to me while testing out Zomboid's new intercity wilderness systems. This problem has thankfully now been fixed as part of Build 42.1.0, which you can (and should) download at your earliest convenience.

When Astro Bot launched in September 2024 for the PS5, many lauded the game's quality and compared it favourably to some of Nintendo's very best 3D platformers.
During the recent New York Game Awards 2025 event, ex-president of Nintendo of America offered his own opinion on the game after it won the award for 'Best Kids Game', jokingly stating "I have to admit it, Astro Bot almost outdid Nintendo at its own game".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trading is one of the cooler experiences in SpongeBob Tower Defense, which has been introduced as part of Update 3.


Loads of Roblox titles have some form of trading system inside the game, but it acts slightly differently in the SpongeBob-inspired title. For starters, you can exchange units based on the battle valuation. The value of any unit entirely depends on the player base.


Let's take a look at how the system works inside the game.


Trading system in SpongeBob Tower Defense explained


To conduct a trade, go to the Flying Dutchman NPC in the main hub, which will allow you to initiate an exchange with another player. Do remember that the player you're trading with has to be present on the same server.


There is absolutely no restriction to what unit you want to trade. All trades …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unless there are major changes to the plans for Fisch's next update, we will be able to visit the island of Atlantis very soon.


When I say island, I base my information on the Northern Expedition Summit. This region was added during the Northern Expedition core update, which was pretty massive. Similarly, Atlantis will likely be the new region as part of the Atlantis update, and knowing its location will be important.


How to reach Atlantis location in Fisch


It's quite obvious that Atlantis Island isn't available in Fisch as of writing. If it's added to the game, it will be part of the next core update. However, we might already have an idea about where the region will be.


If you go to the following coordinates (X: -3,576, Y: 151, Z: 523), you'll find the Gates to Atlantis. This area can be found in the Grand Reef just behind the Forsaken Shores region. Of course, there's nothing else present, but the Gates to Atlantis could work in the same fashion as the Northern Summit Portal. Players must travel through this portal to reach the Northern Expedition Summit.


For now, the Gates to Atlantis is blocked by rocks, and you can't travel through it. Some reportedly have managed to glitch through it but haven't found anything (quite natural).




The Atlantis Core update is expected to go live on Saturday, January 25. It could include massive bits of content like a brand-new bestiary, rods, and more. We have already had three weeks of mini-updates in preparation for this update, so make sure to complete the Atlantean Storm bestiary in the meantime.


Once the core update is out on Saturday, we will update this piece with detailed information about how to get to the new location. We will also have detailed guides on completing the bestiary and finding new rods if they're added to Fisch.

I’m not saying I’m the bravest person in the world, but I am saying I have no shame.


One thing to note is that while I’ve played a staggeringly wide range of the NES library, I haven’t played everything. For example, I haven’t played Bases Loaded 3, and I’m open to the possibility that it’s the apogee of the NES library. This also isn’t about which games were most popular or influential. That’s another topic. These ones are the best for a myriad of other reasons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This review contains some story spoilers for the original FF7 and subsequently some elements of Rebirth, but doesn't spoil how Rebirth ultimately reinterprets these elements. 
I argued with myself for several weeks in university about whether to go to a seminar discussing T.S. Eliot's The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn't want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn't kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.
I now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It's all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It's a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like "it would be properly shit if I died right now because I'd really like to see how this pans out". A personal 'never kill yourself' moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.
An RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them? What a time to be alive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doom: The Dark Ages represents the third installment since the reboot of the iconic series back in 2016. I know, I know. Game #3 can be a tricky one to pull off. However, both Doom and Doom Eternal were pretty stonkin' shooters, breathing new life into id Software's classics while maintaining the original spirit.


Now, we know the new game is coming in 2025, at least according to the release info on Steam, but we have yet to have a full date. However, according to a recent leak, we could be seeing Doom: The Dark Ages melting our collective faces off come May 15.




The information has been shared by user Alexzan over on Resetera (also reported by Eurogamer), which comes from the French website Gamekult. The words used in the original article say the game "will decimate the infernal legions on May 15, 2025" (as translated Google).


Déchirez et déchirez!


It should be pointed out that the leaked release date, as noted by Gamekult, has since been taken down, but the screenshot Alexzan took remains. As such, we should temper expectations on what we've been presented with. However, it is interesting to note that the Doom reboot did launch in May of 2016, while Eternal was released in March of its respective year.


Also, this leaked information comes just one day before the Xbox Developer Direct showcase. The Microsoft-led event is set to take place tomorrow, January 23, at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm GMT. We also do know that of the games being featured, Doom: The Dark Ages will be one of them.


Does this mean Bethesda/id Software will officially tell us when we can expect it? It's a possibility. It also seems possible that Gamekult could be correct about the leaked information, whether it was intended or not. Sure enough, we'll know within the next 24 hours or so.

'Retro gaming company' Sjgam has just revealed its latest handheld, the 'M20 Pro', and while it appears to be far from the best emulation device money can buy, its design looks... familiar. Let's not beat about the bush here: it's a Switch (thanks for the heads up, Notebookcheck).
According to the Sjgam website, the M20 Pro boasts a seven-inch display (1024 x 600 pixels), runs on the Linux-based EmuELEC 4.3 operating system to support over 30 emulators and comes with a dock for TV output. Notebookcheck claims that while the handheld's Rockchip RK3566 CPU and Mali-G52 GPU make for a decent budget combination, the pairing may struggle with more intense emulators like PSP and N64 — sorry, Banjo.

On May Day - a festival of ancient origins that shares a date with International Workers' Day - the youths of the village garb themselves in daisies, erect huge candy-striped maypoles, and dance around them in an effort to get all entangled and possibly end up kissing. NO MORE. For May is now the month of DOOM. It marks the coming of a new Dark Age.
Which is to say, it's when we'll get to play id Software's cacodemon-booping FPS Doom: The Dark Ages, going by a leaked release date ahead of tomorrow's Xbox Developer Direct.

Where to find Gelena in Diablo 4


At the start of Diablo 4 Season 7 you can find Gelena in the town of Geakul located on the western side of the map in the region of Kehjistan. This is actually the port that you visit at the beginning of the Vessel of the Hatred expansion that takes you to the new region of Nahantu.


Gelena can be found by the docks of Geakul, close to the Waypoint for the area. Upon teleporting to the Waypoint, simply look to your left and you should find Geakul standing there wait…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lunar New Year event 2025 will go live in Adopt Me on January 24, and you can add a few reptilian friends to your collection.


While the event is live, you can collect up to four snakes as your new pets. Thankfully, we already have information about how to get them inside the game, which will help you to be on top when the event goes live soon.


How to get the Adopt Me Lunary New Year Event 2025 Snakes


There will be four snakes, one of which will be of Legendary rarity. Apart from that, you'll be able to obtain a new snake every week, and you can get all four by the time the event ends. You'll have to get an event currency called Shooting Stars to find a snake.


According to YouTuber Cookie Cutter, we can get Shooting Stars daily. They can be collected from the ground, and you can use them in the Lunar Vending Machine. You can always get more Shooting Stars with the help of microtransactions if you don't mind spending on Robux. I believe there will be more items in the Vending Machine, and getting a snake will boil down to your luck (this is my assumption, not verified information). 


Thanks to Cookie Cutter, we know that the first two snakes will be called Gilded Snake and Blossom Snake. Make sure to check out this weekly dev blog from Jessie to learn more about how to get all the snakes during the upcoming event.




It will be interesting to learn more about the events' other parts. We will update any additional farming methods for Shooting Stars if they exist during the event. Additionally, it will be interesting to get more details about the Legendary snake and how to obtain it in Adopt Me.


The Lunar New Year event will be available for four weeks, starting from January 24. While the three snakes will each be available for a week, the Legendary snake will be available during all four weeks. Make sure to get all of them before the event ends in February.

We're just one day away from the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 movie — which introduces Shadow the Hedgehog to the blockbuster franchise — hitting cinemas worldwide. But Variety is reporting that Paramount Pictures has already greenlighted a fourth film.
Shocked? Nope, not us. According to the report, the movie is aiming for a Spring 2027 release. We know nothing else yet, but given that director Jeff Fowler has stuck around for the first three movies, we wouldn't be surprised if he's also on board for a fourth run.

Citizen Sleeper was, coincidentally, one of 2022's sleeper hits. With its combination of top-tier writing and decision-based gameplay, this table-top-inspired RPG and space adventure pulled us into its airlock and wouldn't let us out until we had played through the emotional damage of witnessing every possible outcome (and yes, that includes the three DLC packs).
It will come as no surprise, then, that we were rather excited to see a sequel on the way. Announced in June 2023 and confirmed to be coming to Switch at the June 2024 PC Gaming Showcase, Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector promises more of the same deep space dilemmas, but with an expanded dice system, clean-cut job roles and multiple environments to explore, we were keen to learn more about its new recruits before liftoff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many moons ago in the Before Times, a mysterious cataclysm scattered a number of seasoned BioWare developers across the face of heaven. The developers fell upon the mortal planes like comets. Where each landed, a game development studio took root. Inflexion Games. Summerfall Studios. Humanoid Origin. Worlds Untold. Archetype Entertainment.
Summerfall appear to be prospering, but many of the studios founded by former BioWare devs have experienced hard times. In particular, Humanoid Origin and Worlds Untold have respectively closed and "paused operations" without releasing a single game. I'm raising a tentatively congratulatory glass, then, to Yellow Brick Games, a studio founded by former Dragon Age director Mike Laidlaw. The company's debut game Eternal Strands will release on 28th January, and there's now a PC demo.

Last week, Nintendo gave us our first official look at Switch 2 and threw in a '2025' release window for good measure. While the House of Mario is yet to be more specific with its release date, publisher and accessory manufacturer Nacon has shared some narrower expectations (thanks, VGC).
As noted on Twitter by industry analyst @MauroNL3, Nacon commented on the Switch 2 release date in its recent financial earnings report, noting that it expects Nintendo's next console to launch "in the first half of 2025/26" — or some point between April and September 2025, for those frantically trying to remember when the fiscal year starts (don't worry, we were too).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debate continues to rage on the internetworks about whether premium video games, and especially the ones with the largest budgets, need to have higher price tags. This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling State Of Videogaming 2025 report that "some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc."
Picked up by VGC, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the extremely polarised mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.

As reported by Nikkei (thanks, Automaton), in December 2024, a 90 million yen ($569,000) out-of-court settlement followed reports alleging that Nakai — also a former member of the hugely popular boy band SMAP — had sexually assaulted an unnamed woman in 2023 at a company-arranged dinner.

So it makes sense at least one other developer is looking to apply the same lo-fi principles to their own "hangout game".

It's still early in development, as you can tell from the trailer below. But you'll be able to embody penguins, frogs, and polar bears as they drink hot cocoa in log cabins and ragdoll into one another willy-nilly. Other cute animals are to be confirmed, but I am putting my money on an dopey-faced ermine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam are throwing a Real-Time Strategy Fest this week, encompassing discounts and demos, and people who like clicking on Orc-emitting huts are eating well. Of the new strategy game demos I've spotted so far, the one that interests me most is Calyx, in which you are at war with a mass of alien vegetation, which expands toward your base in a blossoming, suffocating avalanche of green moss and purple tendril. It seems a bit raw at the level of controls and performance, but the concept is very promising: basically, imagine if Creeper World 4 were a bit more like Ground Control. Here's a trailer.

Production on Nintendo and Sony's live-action Legend of Zelda film is presumably ticking away behind closed doors, but in the meantime, a group of fans are undertaking the challenge of bringing Hyrule to life themselves.
Above, you'll find the first teaser trailer for 'Lost in Hyrule', an upcoming live-action fan film which has just opened its doors to Rupee donations on Kickstarter (or other, non-Hylian currencies, if you'd rather). According to the campaign page, the story takes place after the events of Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, offering the filmmaker's take on "the untold conclusion to the Hero of Time’s saga".

To wit: why have a lantern, asks FPS Mohrta, when you can have a horrible vulture-esque creature called a lantern beast that lives on your head to light up the dark for you? "Found a good'un," I wrote in Slack shortly after playing Mohrta's Steam demo. "It's so rad and strange!". Well, that's the pitch, reader. It's a "nonlinear FPS game blending action, exploration, and light dungeon crawling". Very rad. Very strange. Nom nom.

My character never deigns to light a torch, however. Possibly this is because, no matter how many torches I loot or buy from the underworld's infrequent traders, my character page always tells me I have none. Is my character eating them? Are they too afraid to light them and expose what those dungeons contain? Do I need to read the manual properly? Or is it just a bug?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a lot you can do with a third dimension. Texture. Nativity dioramas. Spheres. Hyper Light Breaker, in expanding from the 2D action of Hyper Light Drifter, chooses to almost entirely remake itself as a free-roaming roguelike, trading post-apocalyptic pixel art for big proc-gen vistas and even more acrobatic swordplay.
Its technical ambition, sadly, ends up undermined by the emptiness of its world, the lack of exploratory pleasure that Drifter nurtured so well, and combat that’s more faithful to the original yet doesn’t quite adapt well enough to 3D. Not to mention it has more than its fair share of early access bugs and, especially in the early stages, balancing missteps.

Lots of howling round these parts. 


You play a mother, Ro, whose son has been claimed by the Grim Reaper, or whatever they had instead of the Grim Reaper back then - this was, I think, prior to the invention of scythes? And cards? Anyway, while searching for Ro's son, you'll take part in grid- and turn-based battles against a regular cauldron of unspeakables, including disembodied raven heads and what appears to be a huge pair of subterranean lungs. Here's a trailer.

The company have cancelled two online multiplayer games, including one based on God Of War, according to a report by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier. Two different Sony-owned studios were recently told to stop development on their projects. One of those studios is Bluepoint, known for their work on the Demon's Souls remake. They were making the unannounced live service God Of War game, according to Schreier. The other studio is Bend, developers of open world zombie 'em up Days Gone. We don't know what they were working on, aside from the fact it was also to have a live service business model. In any case, both have been canned.

If I hold my thumb down on the photo in my phone's gallery, it actually springs to life for a few seconds and rewinds time in the process. It shows me wobble the phone into position and take the snap: a giant crab clings to a restaurant, a lady totters towards us with a white plastic bag looped around her arm, colourful signs stacked like Legos jut out of grey, "The Body Shop" lies in the distance because of course it does.
It means a lot to me, this photo. It's the precise moment I felt excitement shoot through my chest, a pang of "I can't believe I'm back". Then the next morning, a jolt that, in hindsight, definitely altered my brain chemistry. A wave of, "I finally get to disconnect and in many ways, I get to reconnect, too".

Facebook owners Meta, Amazon, Walmart, McDonalds and others are reportedly scaling back their DEI initiatives to stave off backlash or litigation from conservative pundits and politicians, who regard DEI guidance about discrimination as a form of discrimination in itself. Following the election, I've also noticed a couple of video game company executives express misgivings about DEI - misgivings that, amongst other things, illustrate that "DEI" has come to mean a lot more than just annual training about micro-aggressions.

My mind had been changed long before I beat the final boss, by which point I thought it was good, but I still felt that all the people praising it at the end of 2024 were singing so loudly only because it was good and short and obscure, three things which in combination are easily mistaken for greatness.
Then I pushed past that final boss, mopping up the remainder of the map, and in that last 25% I think I fell in love. Minishoot' Adventures is straightforward in concept, but its execution is a masterclass of craftsmanship.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In what has become fine tradition, I have learned of an amazing mod on the same day I have learned that the mod has been kiboshed by publishers. The mod in question is the GTA 5 Liberty City Preservation Project, a six year project that rebuilds GTA 4's Liberty City in GTA 5's world. It launched earlier this month - and now it is no more, for Rockstar have descended like briefcase-wielding peregrine falcons and performed what is being called a "friendly takedown" on modding team World Travel. My brother did a "friendly takedown" on me once, and my elbow still doesn't bend the right way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The world looked upon the Nintendo Switch 2, and saw that it was good. Or is it? Observe its enlarged, bezel-shaved screen. Its all-black colour scheme. Its redesigned, more sculpted controllers. Clearly, this is a naked attempt at ripping off and cashing in on the real best gaming handheld of 2025, the Steam Deck.
I, for one, won’t stand for it. Here are five reasons why everyone excited about the Switch 2 is wrong, and should buy a Steam Deck instead. Or maybe the Steam Deck OLED, that one’s better.

The Federal Trade Commission are sending out cheques as we speak. I don't know if I should be glad that a trading standards agency has done its job, or depressed that over 6,700 people thought this mask looked good enough to buy in the first place.

The game is available across various platforms, including the Google Play Store, where copyright-infringing versions are also available. Despite several complaints, Google allegedly failed to remove these unauthorized apps, which prompted the game developers to take legal action.

Animal Well, which turned damn near every games journalist into a tiresome obsessive? Not nominated for anything. UFO 50, an impressive, important, big boy achievement snubbed by our own 2024 list? It did get a Grand Prize nomination. 

I don't disagree with any of the nominees or absences in this year's Independent Games Festival Awards, so I don't mention any of the above to stir up trouble. Instead I look at this list and think: wow, video games are more varied than ever, so much so that there's no longer a dominant cultural narrative even within the specific niche of indie gaming.

It was conceived of by the creator of Coffee Talk, another beloved game, for another. 

It's now got a release date: February 14th.

On the one hand, as a fan of weird forests, which is to say all forests, I'm keen on the prospect of an FPS set in a post-apocalyptic Paris that has been overrun by sentient, pissed-off trees. It's from a team led by a former S.T.A.L.K.E.R. developer, too, and those S.T.A.L.K.E.R. alumni certainly know how to post a good apocalypse. On the other hand, the announcement video suggests a game in which you will mostly treat the frenzied flora as a source of "emergent" cover and terrain traps. Have a look.

It's a smaller-scale, squad-managerial affair reminiscent of the ancient Myth: Fallen Lords, though the "painterly" art direction reminds me more of the impressionistic World War 1 fable 11-11: Memories Retold.

The other developer, Arachne, recently left game development after recovering from a mishandled surgical procedure last year. According to Dizzie, her departure doesn't have anything to do with the aforesaid violent crime, which pre-dates their relationship.

That's plenty to get your head around, and the roster is expanding rapidly. NetEase have announced that they plan to introduce a new hero approximately every six weeks - in other words, twice per three-month season. I wonder how long it'll take them to probe beyond the obvious Marvel headliners and start seriously abrading the bottom of the Connected Universe barrel. Nagneto, for example. Or how about J. Pennington Pennypacker, who shoots coins out of his wrists?

OK, how about when you were a kid and you lifted up a nice, round stone and the damp, fertile soil beneath writhed away from you in a fervent knotting of pellucid, boneless bodies and the tickling of a thousand little legs? Right. Anoxia Station is that and also, a turn-based strategy game about drilling for oil. The recently released Itch.io demo is rough around the edges, but I do adore the vibe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent spate of forced password resets in Action RPG Path Of Exile 2 was acknowledged by developer Grinding Gear Games on Sunday, after a hacker gained access to an administrative account. As reported by 404 Media, this follows several reports on the game's forums and social media from players who'd had their inventories emptied of rare items.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new report has thrown fuel on the fire labelled "Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake". Don't ask me why people have started labelling fires. It's probably a rite to summon a Daedra, or something. Anyway, a new version of Bethesda's somewhat scorned 2006 RPG is allegedly in the works at Singapore-based Virtuos. If rumour speak true, it's being made in Unreal Engine 5, and will feature changes to core systems like blocking, stamina, and sneaking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Coming off Turbo Overkill has been great," Trigger Happy's Sam Prebble tells me over call. "That game's development... I mean, it worked out. But it was very messy because it was my first game and I didn't know what the hell I was doing. So I found myself, when it came to pumping content out, I was like: oh, shit. This code base is fucking awful. Like, I can't put stuff together easily. I'm running into bugs everywhere. But now shit just works!"
You might know Sam Prebble as Trigger Happy Interactive, the solo developer behind frenetic FPS Turbo Overkill. Before that he went by a different name, attached to a very different project. Total Chaos, first released in 2018 under the moniker Wadaholic, is a total conversion mod for Doom 2. With its focus on a thick survival horror atmosphere of tension and disempowerment, it's about as far removed from Turbo Overkill's manic, Doom Eternal-inspired action as a game can get. As Prebble puts it, the only thing the two projects have in common is the first person perspective. Even so, he found himself returning to Total Chaos after wrapping development on Turbo Overkill, resulting in the standalone remake.

In her review, Alice Bee (RPS in peace) said that it was such a large thing it ultimately felt "small, cold and unlived in". I remember thinking the same. Would I have thought differently if it had copious amounts of gore? No. But would I have had a better time? Probably yes. Well, a former senior artist at Bethesda has revealed in an interview with Kiwi Talkz podcast (cheers VGC for the spot) that they'd originally planned for it to have decapitations but decided against them in the end.

The mention comes after the IPTV provider, which is mainly popular in Latin America, boldly applied for a U.S. trademark. This trademark is unlikely to be granted without protest, but that doesn't seem to be a major issue; the service has already rebranded itself as FlujoTV.

But 'tis the start of the year and I felt like I had a duty to give some of them a proper whirl and see what's what. Thus I was lured once again into the roguelike genre, for which I am an eternal sucker.
Developed by Wave Game, Magicraft sees you play as a kid who's isekai'd into another dimension (or at least, I think he is, because I chose the option to "skip the story" when I selected new game and only later deduced the situation) and tasked to mince all the demons within it. It's typical fantasy fare with an interesting twist: you can combine any number of spells within your inventory, which made me feel very clever, even if I had no idea what I was doing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like it or not, horror gaming is often built on jump scares. Deriding a good cheap scare ignores the endorphin rush that draws so many players to the genre, in the same way that the "elevated horror" trend forfeits some of the soul of schlocky slasher flicks and ghost movies. Don’t get me wrong, Silent Hill and Alan Wake deserve their flowers - but even those games would wither on the screen if Pyramid Head didn’t bust through a wall from time to time.
One unsung jump scare game in particular pioneered horror in the internet age, blazing everywhere from nascent social media to major television networks. In fact, if you had an internet connection circa 2005, there’s a good chance you played it. Alas, it was too ahead of its time, too successful at leveraging virality before viral horror was sought after. Next time you see a streamer throw their headphones across the room in fright, beware: the spirit of Scary Maze Game is right behind you.

Unsurprisingly, in retrospect, the trailer also has big The Witcher vibes. The stringy orchestral music? The dramatic monologues? The horrible things happening to armoured grunts? This thing’s really playing the Polish fantasy hits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The "spance" of Annihilate The Spance is apparently “an ancient, roiling storm of matter and energy” that harbours both “extreme and inexplicable phenomena” and “unfathomable riches”. I’m happy to discover this explanation, because at first I thought that “spance” was just a litigation-avoiding, supermarket rebrand of “space”. I was bracing to send the good news to developers Skyglow Softworks that, so far, nobody has managed to copyright “space”, though I’m sure somebody’s tried. Maybe, um, God? 


It’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game Obliterate Everything by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL. Anyway, here’s a trailer.

In the process, you explored a beautiful, Orientalist world map of faded mosaic tiles and dusty gold fittings. 
In Airborne Empire, out in early access today, you do much the same again, but this time the world is trying to murder you. A bit. You are no longer alone in the skies: there are merchant dirigibles you can barter with, and pirate airships who'll strafe your suburbs and set your bazaars on fire. As such, the sequel's new city technologies include a choice of offensive and defensive weapons. Here's a launch trailer.

It's a great premise, honestly. The slate wiped clean, what if you got to be mates with everyone from all sides in this grand ensemble tale of warring states? A battle might take eight minutes. The three consecutive bonding cutscenes before the next might take ten. Origins is just as much about fighting thousands at a time as it is about eating lunch with Zhang Fei or discussing the meaning of heroism with Zhou Yu. There's a parallel story about your character and his role in a magical order of destiny godlings I didn't find the least bit interesting, but the rest is thrilling because Romance is already thrilling. The parts that Origins bogs down with its wordier take on already wordy source material are enlivened again by anime vibrance, hijinks, and melodrama.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With billions of annual visits, MissAV ranks among the 60 most-visited websites on the internet. The porn site mostly caters to an Asian audience where rightsholders see the 'pirate' site as a major threat to their business. Through a legal procedure, adult entertainment company FANZA 'confiscated' the MissAV.com domain, as well as ThisAV.com. However, MissAV swiftly bounced back on a new domain.

I once read in a book that you shouldn't really believe anything you read in a book until you've checked at least two other books. Unfortunately, those two books both said the same thing, meaning I had to check four more. If anyone knows what every book ever written says on the subject, do let me know. I'm trapped now.

Very little, I suspect. We here are like the chalk cliffs of the South Downs: bright and imposing and subject to inevitable but slow erosion by the sea. Or put another way: I'm thinking about bringing back the bulletpoints to separate different links. How are you?

Felipe Pepe wrote about the gentrification of video game history, arguing that American video game history overwrites more local experiences. "We’re not all suburban kids who got a Nintendo 64 for Christmas."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pure Rock Crawling is about steering off road vehicles across rocky terrain. It's about pumping the gas pedal and wrenching the steering wheel just so, such that you lurch forward and over the obstacles, rather than tumbling backwards. It's MudRunner without the mud, with a knockabout simplicity presumably as a result of its apparently one-man development team. It launched last October but I hadn't heard of it until today, when a new map was added, and now I want to play it.

I played it for three hours today and, among the many build challenges and adventures, a small story formed around a baby pig. We named him Porky, we caged him as our pet, and in an unfortunate accident, we watched as he fell to his death from the sky island that was our home. RPS in peace, Porky.

How many befriended pigs like Porky have there been across the last several hundred hours of play? I'm not sure - dozens, hundreds - but soon such pigs might have a new form. After 15 years, Mojang are adding new types of pig to Minecraft.

The other was Warren Spector back in November, who not only gave me the longest and most detailed reply I'd had before or since, but also followed up several times to add more books to the list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One or two lumps of annoyance in your morning coffee? Okay, here's one. You'll need to link to a PlayStation Network account to play The Last Of Us Part II on PC, say Sony. The requirement was reported by Video Games Chronicle, and sure enough, the Steam page for the "Remastered" version of the third-person fungus fighter includes a footnote in the game description that confirms it in plain language - "Account for PlayStation Network required". For a lot of people this is a minor nuisance, for others it more likely means that the game won't be on sale in your country at all. Sony's reasons for enforcing the requirement remain obscure.

The French publisher are pushing back release of the new samurai-era open worlder from 14th February to 20th March 2025 while they look into "various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders", with news of a possible major "transaction" to follow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I died in Beyond Citadel, the game treated to me a close-up shot of my character's scantily clad, bisected body lying in a pool of guts and ripped underwear. It turns out you can turn off a lot of the gore and nudity. You can also swaddle yourself in some nice, sturdy, PG-13 body armor. But you're seemingly stuck with a certain base percentage of bulging, softcore gratuitousness in both the character portrait on bottom left, and in the mildly boobulent background art of the world. I'm not sure I can put up with all that, which is a shame, because Beyond Citadel is otherwise a promising, eerie FPS that mixes ideas from 90s shooters in pretty appealing ways.

"The specific thing that made me make Liyla And The Shadows Of War is the attacks on Gaza in 2014, and the specific thing that made me make Dreams On A Pillow is the attacks on Gaza in 2023."
Dreams On A Pillow is a stealth adventure that tells the story of a young mother during the Nakba - the 1948 ethnic cleansing, displacement, and cultural suppression of Palestinian Arabs by Israel. As its funding campaign puts it, it’s a game about "a land full of people being made into a people without land."

Now, though, I am going through a different phase. A less blessed phase. One where I watched the popular streamer and influencer Ludwig attempt to climb to Platinum rank in League Of Legends, all because he wanted to prove another popular streamer, who thought he couldn't do it, wrong. I know I've already put you off, so I don't blame you if you stop reading. Just know that I couldn't stop watching his streams, even as it conjured up terrible memories of a time spent doing the exact same thing at uni.

Currently on show at CES 2025, it’s a prototype desktop build that uses clever geometry and an unconventional motherboard I/O layout to hide practically every single wire in the joint, for a clean design that's housed for your viewing pleasure within a four-sided glass chamber. It’s the closest PCs have come to the simple Victorian pleasures of a nice terrarium, and honestly, good on it.
The problem is that if Project Zero X’s components ever actually go on sale, there becomes a non-zero percent chance that I will come into possession of that see-through case. And there is a one hundred percent chance I will ruin it.

Announced over the winter, it’s a spruced-up reimagining of your scientifically determined 22nd favourite space game - the hectic Second Coming of a simulation we’ve devoted 14 whole-ass features to since 2013, including a seven-part diary series featuring many a starfaring Vengabus or Wild Wild Westerly giant robot spider.
It really is high time we gave the new game some attention, then. The very first alpha launches into Steam early access on January 27th. Here’s what’s in store.
