        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been playing Destiny 2 for long enough, you'll know that not all armors are created equally. While all armor tends to have random rolls for its stat distribution, specific armors can have additional bonuses. 


For Episode: Revenant, a new set of armor is mentioned in the seasonal artifact but isn't properly explained. Here's what Shadestalker armor is in Destiny 2.


Where to get Shadestalker armor in Destiny 2

Shadestalker armor is one of two sets of armor added with Episode: Revenant. This armor is acquired through completing Episode: Revenant activities, opening Revenant Engrams, and through later levels in the Season Pass (for those who purchase the Season Pass). While activities and the Season Pass rewards are straightforward, Revenant Engrams are earned through ranking up with the Apothecary Eido seasonal vendor and as a reward through Episode: Revenant activities.


Shadestalker Armor plays into two separate seasonal artifact mods, Fell the Revenant and Total Carnage. With Fell the Revenant, each piece of armor increases the amount of damage you'll do to Scorn enemies. Otherwise, Total Carnage grants damage resistance and health on finishers if you're wearing at least two pieces of Shadestalker armor. 


Is Shadestalker armor worth using?

Shadestalker armor is well worth using this season. Beyond those two artifact mods mentioned above, this armor also sports the Eido's Apprentice armor perk. This grants one point of Apothecary Eido vendor reputation for each Reclaimed Vitality earned. For each piece of Shadestalker armor equipped, you get up to a maximum of four points per Reclaimed Vitality earned. This is a huge bonus for working toward completing the season, so slap this armor on when you get the chance.

For starters, you can unlock every character by just playing the game. While some of the characters are unlocked quite easily, getting access to the other ones might be harder. That said, the grind is certainly worth it if you want to have as many options as possible.

While the HELM is out of orbit, however, it is still accessible through the new Last City...with a little work. Here's how to access the HELM in Destiny 2 Episode: Revenant.


How to get to the HELM in Destiny 2 Episode: Revenant

If you're starting with Episode: Revenant and are in the Last City, you might've thought to open the map, and then click on the fast travel point for the HELM. However, this takes you right to the Last City fast travel point. This can be confusing, but you can thankfully still access the HELM without it. When loading into the Last City, turn immediately right and you'll see a large blue portal like the one pictured above. Head into it, and you'll be teleported to the lower stairs of the HELM.


Within the newly crashed HELM, you have access to all the kiosks you had before. You can still access the Vault, speak with the Postmaster, and talk to Failsafe through the central kiosk. You can even pet Captain Jacobson or the birds you collected, provided you did that content in the Episode: Echoes storyline. If you open the map, you can even access the Battlegrounds, Enigma Protocol, and Breach Executable from last season. The only thing you can't do is continue the Episode: Echoes storyline, as that disappeared with the launch of the newest Episode.

Chocolate Waffles Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients


To create Chocolate Waffles in Disney Dreamlight Valley, you'll need these ingredients:



Wheat


Eggs


Milk


Cocoa Bean



Most of these ingredients are easy to find. Eggs and Milk can be purchased from Chez Remy after completing the Ratatouille realm in the castle and getting Remy into your valley. They will cost you 450 Star Coins altogether. Wheat seeds can be bought from Goofy's Stall in the Peaceful Meadow for 1 Star Coin. You might as well buy the ingredient itself if it's available, however, as it's very slightly more expensive at 2 Star Coins. It will only take one minute to grow once planted and watered. 


Cocoa Beans are slightly trickier to find. They grow on trees within the Sunlit Plateau or the Glade of Trust every 30 minutes. You can also buy them from Goofy's Stall in the Sunlit Plateau for 75 Star Coins. 


Another dessert you can make


Have plenty of Cocoa Beans left? If that's the case, Hot Cocoa might be the way to go. You can form that with a Cocoa Bean, Milk, and Sugarcane. You can get Sugarcane (or its seeds) from Goofy's Stall in Dazzle Beach. Another dessert you can make without Cocoa Beans is Berry Salad. A Mint Sorbet is another way to go.

Sadly, we won't see the fruits of the collaboration until next year. Their game, Hotel Barcelona, has been quietly delayed until "early 2025." 


Swery revealed the news in an interview with Gamereactor. Hotel Barcelona was originally planned to launch in 2021 but got pushed to late 2024. Delays in game development aren't uncommon (we've seen a fair number over the years), so hearing that it's getting held back just a bit longer shouldn't be shocking. According to Swery, the move was made to give the game a bit more touching up.

        <updated>2024-10-08T19:24:52.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sonic Sway move has been a part of many Dragon Ball iterations, whether from the anime or its video game collection. It's a powerful defensive tool that can be used to avoid rapid attacks, making it an essential skill for any fighter.


We'll show you how to perform the Sonic Sway in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, furthering your defensive strategies.


How to consistently perform a Sonic Sway in Dragon Ball:  Sparking Zero


You can perform the Sonic Sway by holding your guard and pressing the Perception/Ki Blast button when an enemy attacks. Since there are two controller styles, the interaction for this will vary. To cover all the bases, here's how to perform Sonic Sway in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero's Classic and Standard controller styles.



Standard:

PlayStation: R1 (Guard) + Circle (Perception)


Xbox: RB (Guard) + B (Perception)




Classic:

PlayStation: Circle (Guard) + Triangle (Ki Blast/Rush Chain)


Xbox: B (Guard) + Y (Ki Blast/Rush Chain)





Before the enemy approaches, start holding the guard interaction. Then, once they start attacking, use Perception/Ki Blast. You'll need to time it right by hitting the second button before the opponent strikes. Or, you can make it a bit easier by holding your guard up and spamming Perception/Ki Blast. This tactic has helped me land Sonic Sways consistently without worrying about the timing.

When you've executed the Sonic Sway, a unique sound effect will confirm its success. Time will slow down, setting the stage for a sequence of multiple attacks. As your character gracefully dodges each one, you'll be treated to a thrilling experience reminiscent of the epic showdowns in the Dragon Ball series.


Take advantage of this dodging tactic in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero's World Tournament, Character Episodes, or online PvP. I suggest practicing it first in the training rounds to at least get the hang of it.

The Bayern star becomes the latest entrant to the promo, and all you have to do is to complete the challenge and its tasks. The SBC is relatively beginner-friendly, and completing it shouldn't be an issue for any player. Let's take a look at how you can unlock the card, and if you should invest your resources. 


EA FC 25 Giulia Gwinn RTTK SBC tasks


The Giulia Gwinn RTTK SBC has two tasks, and here are their conditions. 


Task 1 - FC Bayern Munchen



Min. 1 Players from: FC Bayern München


Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week

Task 2 - Germany



Min. 1 Players from: Germany


Min. Team Rating: 86

I like the look of this new RTTK card, and with attacking wingback++, she can be a great choice in 5 back formations. Unfortunately, the SBC is extremely expensive, and the cost of completion should have been lower than what it is. To justify the price, Bayern will have to have a great run in UWCL, so that Gwinn receives all three upgrades.

In a recent episode of IGN Arcade, IGN asked Haley Joel Osment about the potential conclusion of the series after telling him about Nomura's statement.

You'll be on the edge of your seat as you face Vegeta's most formidable form yet. Here's how to defeat the Great Ape Vegeta in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero.


How to beat Great Ape Vegeta in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero


The Vegeta's Secret Manuever quest opens with a special attack from the Great Ape, forcing you to either dodge or block the strike. He'll do this several times throughout the battle, so try to get used to this overwhelming strike. If you're too close to Vegeta's attacks, use your blocks as much as possible. The damage won't be as bad through this method, and it works better than dodging (his targeting system's pretty OP).

Back in the summer of 2022, the world of Crayon Shin-chan collided with Millennium Kitchen's My Summer Vacation series in a delightful, beautiful game with an unnecessarily long name. Shin chan: Me and the Professor on Summer Vacation -The Endless Seven-Day Journey- brought Kay Ayabe's long-running game series into contact with the celebrated manga and anime property starring the precocious five-year-old Shinnosuke "Shin" Nohara, creating a crossover that felt so right that it's amazing it didn't happen sooner.
The upcoming sequel, Shin chan: Shiro and the Coal Town, is a stunning-looking game that builds on the first's foundations and takes the titular rascal into an imaginary world for this summer holiday. It launched in Japan in February and recently won an Excellence Award for Visual Arts at CEDEC 2024.

The announcement came not long after creator Ville Kallio declared on Twitter that he was considering March 31 as his deadline, adding, “I need to release something, or I’ll completely destroy my mental health.” Yeah, that sounds like the creative process I’m familiar with. However, he’s now made it official and stamped it on the Steam store page.


Cruelty Squad is a tough act to follow. It reached the illusive peak of meaningful jank-pop, striking a chord with many despite its ironic aesthetic dissonance. It is just weird, depicting a horrible corporatocracy where you act as a hitman. The graphics…]]></summary>

How to complete Chase Change challenge in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero


As you progress through the Battle Training's Intermediate hub, you'll encounter the Chase Change maneuver. This technique requires you to switch your attacker mid-way through Team Battle, then let the switched-in character continue the assault. It's a challenging move, but with determination and practice, you can master it. Here's how to perform it:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After 14 years, Rockstar has confirmed that Red Dead Redemption will finally arrive on PC on October 29, alongside its only major expansion, Undead Nightmare.


Back in August, a PSN blunder leaked the existence of Red Dead Redemption on PC, but it's good to get official confirmation that it's on the way. Rockstar has a history of staggered releases on PC, with its titles usually taking at least a year to land on the platform. Still, a 14-year wait isn't exactly par for the course.

Red Dead Redemption is finally coming to PC


Rockstar confirmed Red Dead Redemption's PC release date of October 29 with an epic trailer, capturing plenty of action from the classic Western title in stunning 4K.


The game will arrive alongside Undead Nightmare, both of which have tons of PC-specific improvements. Rockstar has worked alongside British studio Double Eleven to bring native 4K and 144hz enhancements to the game, as well as monitor support for Ultrawide (21:9) and Super Ultrawide (32:9) setups. That's not to mention support for HDR10, NVIDIA DLSS 3.7, and AMD FSR 3.0. 




The news ends years of speculation, allowing PC players to finally experience the conclusion of John Marston's story without resorting to half-baked emulated versions of Red Dead Redemption. Unfortunately, this new version will not have multiplayer support like the original game, but we can't win every battle.


Pre-orders are not yet available for Red Dead Redemption on PC, although Rockstar claims in its announcement that more news on this is coming "later this week." Pricing details for the game are not yet available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The hit historical anime The Elusive Samurai wrapped up its first season in Japan, but the fun isn't over just yet. The Elusive Samurai Season 2 is officially coming, though an official release date and synopsis are still under wraps. 


The announcement came in the form of an elegant calligraphy piece by artist Kamari Maeda.




For those unfamiliar, The Elusive Samurai is based on Yusei Matsui’s manga. The manga runs in Shueisha’s Weekly Shonen Jump and is available in English through Viz Media and MANGA Plus. The anime tells the tale of Hojo Tokiyuki, a young noble on the run after the Kamakura shogunate collapses in 1333. Betrayed by Ashikaga Takauji, one of his most trusted vassals, Tokiyuki escapes the bloodshed. With the help of Suwa Yorishige, a wise Shinto priest and lord of Suwa Province, he sets out to reclaim what’s rightfully his using his elusive ways.


CloverWorks produced the first season of the anime, and Aniplex of America licensed the series for North America. Yuta Yamazaki leads the production team as the director, while Yoriko Tomita manages the series composition. Yasushi Nishiya is responsible for the character designs, while Akiyuki Tateyama and GEMBI are behind the captivating soundtrack that brings the world of medieval Japan to life.


The Elusive Samurai's first season can be streamed via Crunchyroll, Disney+, and Netflix, though availability varies per region.

While digging through the files of the recent 1.5.0 update, dataminer 'LuigiBlood' uncovered references to a Mario vs. Donkey Kong Festival Event — something that might appear a little late, but could just as easily tie in with the platformer's first anniversary in February 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive have not had a rosy couple of years. While the company's core business in grand strategy remains prosperous, their approach to games outside this niche has been mired by delays, cancelations, closures and layoffs. Let's run through the big setbacks: The Lamplighters League, which we overall liked, was a $22 million financial flop - Paradox have now parted ways with creators Harebrained Studios. Cities Skylines 2 should have been a victory lap, after the success of the first game, but it launched with severe bugs and performance issues. Prison Architect 2, another follow-up to a hit game, has been delayed indefinitely, and Paradox have split from developers Double Eleven. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is borderline vapourware: originally announced in 2019 with Hardsuit Labs at the helm, it's currently in the hands of The Chinese Room, and was recently delayed for the umpteenth time into 2025.
And then there's the abrupt cancellation of Life By You, a life management sim designed to compete directly with The Sims 4, and the closure of its creators Paradox Tectonic. Writing-down the development of Life By You cost Paradox around 208 million krona, or $19.2 million. It was the primary contributor to a 90% decrease in the company's operating profit for the second quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023.

Remember earlier this year when SEGA announced the strangely Fall Guys-esque free-to-play mobile game Sonic Rumble?

That is according to Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka and the game's director Makoto Tase who, in a recent interview with Automaton, explained how the team opted against the mechanics due to how poorly received they tend to be in the West.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Traveller's Hymn is a top-down, grid-based, open-world adventure game (and breathe), set in a dark fantasy land. The tileset is lovely, as are the little dialogue boxes and menus and the gentle bob of your backpack-ridden character as they walk. Basically, it looks like it's worth everyone's time, particularly because there's one big twist here - it's entirely free.

As there currently is, with Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days having returned to town. But don’t let my complete lack of original thinking overshadow two simple facts: one, this is still the best microSD card for the Steam Deck, and two, the 512GB model very nearly half price on both sides of the Atlantic. That’s £38 (down from £74) in the UK, and $40 (down from $76) in the US.

We have highlighted the wonderful scanning work of @KeshiCorner a couple of times now on Nintendo Life. This is the retro enthusiast who managed to preserve classic Zelda and Mario rubber "Keshi" figurines through the magic of 3D scanning and now they are back with a new collection.
It's a 1993 range of Super Mario Bros. 2 figures that are stealing the spotlight this time, with five new designs featuring Birdo, Shy Guy, Ninji, Mouser and Wart. As was the case with Keshi Corner's previous collections, these figures would be a difficult find today, but their 3D scans are now available on the Internet Archive for home printing or more general preservation.

A company dissolution notice was published in Japan's government gazette yesterday, with the Gematsu translation reading as follows: "Dissolution Notice:  has been dissolved, so if you have any claims against our company, please submit your claims within two months from the day this notice is published".

Cookie Crisp tastes like like someone poured Splenda on a packing peanut fished out from a puddle. Combo Critters, though? Pretty tasty, and also free from Itch here.

You would have to ask him or the psychiatrist he badly requires. And it's unlikely he'd explain himself. This isn't the type of story in which the protagonist has difficulty accepting the existence of horrors, nor struggles with the surreality of what he needs to do to get through a locked door. In the opening minutes, James finds a well with a glowing red square floating inside, stares into it (it saves your game), then makes a calm remark about the odd sensation he feels, and moves on. The human corpses that pepper the town of Silent Hill are noticeably that of James himself, his head bludgeoned and bloodied beyond recognition but his jacket and boots unmistakable. He makes no remark on this. It's probably nothing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Silent Hill 2 remake is only out today, but it’s been nearly two years since the first system requirements appeared, immediately distressing our PCs so badly that they started having their own nightmares of fog-smothered towns and James Sunderland in an uncomfortably high-poly nurse outfit. Those requirements have since lowered and risen, and now we know for sure that nu-Silent Hill 2 is one tough customer for performance – albeit one that benefits greatly from just one or two key settings tweaks.

The latest UK Charts data is in, and there's practically no difference for the top performers this week as both EA Sports FC 25 and The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom solidify their positions at 1 and 2 respectively.
SpongeBob SquarePants: The Patrick Star Game makes its debut this week, but perhaps not in the way Outright Games was hoping for - the licensed title comes in right near the bottom at number 39. The PS5's remaster of Until Dawn performed a bit better, however, and managed to nab the 14th spot in its debut week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graham asked me if I'd discovered what the metaphor in Metaphor: ReFantazio might be, and I replied, "I don't know haha", or something along those lines. Having given it more thought, I think there are two metaphors: 1) It plays quite like Persona. 2) Its story is like a commentary on our society… or something to that effect.
Metaphors aside, though, the game is a gigantic fantasy RPG that's technically better than Persona 5 in a lot of ways. Structurally, it feels less repetitive. It has more animated cutscenes that elevate those key story moments. You can brush aside weaker enemies in real-time combat, rather than face them in tiresome turn-based tangoes. And overall, I think it's the best game Persona or Persona-like Atlus have put out - it really is brilliant. But there's a part of me that feels like it's missing something that'll leave it less ingrained in the memory than Persona 5 once its final chapter has closed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a genre of lesser fun that only makes itself known to me once I’ve completely given up on enjoying a game in any traditional sense, lurking under the surface like a silly icon on a losing scratchcard. I’ll call it ‘system tourism’ in lieu of something better. It’s not like the actually fulfilling virtual tourism you might do in something like Yakuza’s Kamurocho, where you’re scarfing down deep fried whiskeys, entranced by the lights. It’s more like doing a Google street view tour of Venice’s canals to see if you can spot someone taking a leak off the side of a gondola - hunting for anarchic anomalies because, honestly, the sights just aren’t grabbing you.
At the risk of sounding like some sort of horrible joy-mathematician: My experience with open world zombie survival game Dread Dawn involved precisely two and half discrete instances of fun, plus some additional appreciation for a few genuinely good ambient bits I’ll get into shortly. With a significant overhaul of basically every player interaction Dread Dawn offers - from the abysmally tedious looting to the rusty combat -  it might some day be worth your time. It harbours some incredible ambition, though it’s surrounded by murk and detritus, like a dictatorial rat in a toilet bowl. Mostly, though, I can only give you advance warning to avoid it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My default movement mode in horror games that actually scare me is: meandering. I seek to approach without approaching, scooting back and forth across the path like a stray hamster, worrying at the corners and avoiding clear perspectives of the route ahead, while keeping the route behind me in my peripheral vision. I have been trained to do this especially by Amnesia, where tilting your gaze too decisively at anything nasty drives your character nuts.
Lurks Within Walls has no time for my hamstery antics. Developed by Here Be Monsters, it's a grid- and turn-based first-person dungeon crawler - a long-lost cousin of Etrian Odyssey that has wound up in an asylum jammed with internet cryptids, reminiscent in cinematic texture of F.E.A.R. In keeping with other grid-based dungeon crawlers, it only lets you turn the view by 90 degree angles and travel in straight lines. Going by the demo, it's a promising restraint for a horror game, though they really do need to expand on the combat, which is currently a slight waste of some terrific creature art.

Its visuals are stark and foreboding, its dialogue delivered in riddles, and its haunting choral music sounds like it's been recorded in a wind tunnel. It’s a point-and-click that calls back to early 90’s Lucas Arts adventure games, and while it shares the same frustrations, the presentation makes it feel entirely contemporary. What begins as a standard detective game - chatting to strangers, rummaging through junk, finding addresses found on the net - soon spirals into something else entirely. I’ve finished it twice and I’m still not sure I totally understand what it all means.

Back in July, Nintendo filed a lawsuit against Modded Hardware — an online store which, as you might expect, sells modded Switch consoles and chips — in its continued attempt to clamp down on piracy. Three months on, the alleged owner of the store, Ryan Daly, has filed his answer to the complaints where he denies any wrongdoing (thanks, TorrentFreak).
According to the complaints, Nintendo and Daly reached an agreement in March 2024 where the latter would stop selling modded consoles and MIG Switches (a card that plays pirated games on un-modded hardware). The agreement was obviously not upheld, leading Nintendo to submit a complaint to a Seattle federal court where Daly is accused of six different charges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Italian ISPs are required to work with AGCOM and rightsholders to ensure the Piracy Shield blocking system operates as intended. It's a burden that only benefits rightsholders, but the ISPs are expected to cover their own costs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Turn-based" games are, as we know, all derived from Turn, the strategy game about a dog digging for coins released for the BBC Micro in 1987. Prior to this, all actions in games simply took place simultaenously, as fast as the player or players could make them. 

Fast forward to today and many games are now "turn-based", from Tactics Ogre Reborn to Age Of Wonders 4 to chess. In celebration of their orderliness, Steam is currently running a turn-based RPG fest featuring discounts and demos for "turn-based games where you grow stronger with every battle".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Valve dropped a Steam client beta update focused largely on Game Recording – the beta version’s recently added clip-capturing utility. It’s a pretty wide-spanning array of improvements, adding support for ultrawide monitor resolutions up to 32:9, the high-quality H.265 (HEVC) video codec – on Windows only for now, apologies to the Steam Deck – and the option to "record a specified game indefinitely with no specified time limit."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out 17th October on Steam, Mask Quest is a platform game in which you hold and release a button to refill your character's lungs while dodging police batons, bullets, gas grenades and drones. Neglect to do so, and you'll pop your clogs. It's the kind of mechanical tomfoolery you'd associate with Peter Molydeux, but in this case, it's all the fine work of Stephen's Sausage Roll developer increpare and Quadrant developer undef. The developers have somehow gotten 50 levels out of this meme-ish premise, and it looks like quite an elaborate hop-and-bopper with some less-cheerful political overtones. Here's the trailer.

Knowing Brendy, he'll be sauntering down Neely Street like a gentleman dandy from 1920s Oxford, throwing out his cuffs and elbows and winking merrily at all the shambling depression metaphors who are trying to chew his legs off. While we await his verdict, here's another excerpt from a chat with Bloober earlier this summer, in which I pop the extremely imaginative question of what they'll do after remaking Silent Hill 2. The answer, in brief, is more games with a manual third-person view that rely on ambience, suspense and the thrill of the unknown, rather than monsters going "boo!"

I think the curse has evolved then, as we hadn't even discussed 11 bit's upcoming third-person management adventure The Alters… but Edwin had played it at this year's Geoffcom. And yes, it has been delayed.

That’s mainly down the multiplayer Operations mode. It isn’t quite as deep as Darktide, but it feels like much less work, and I’m starting to realise just how phenomenal the little details in the animation and sound are. Saber seem to agree they’ve got a winner on their hands, too. As per yesterday’s community update, they’re not wasting any time spilling the details on the game’s next co-op mission.

Most of the audience for that screening rocked up fully equipped with suspenders, feather boas, extravagant lipstick, and a cherished selection of deliberately unfunny heckler's lines to deploy at key moments in the movie.
Have you not seen the Rocky Horror Show? It's a wildly camp musical and B-movie homage for stage and screen, in which two homely, heteronormative Americans seek shelter in a castle run by Tim Curry's high-kicking mad scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter. I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer.

Despite the fantasy MMORPG having worked fine on the Deck in previous betas, a celebrating Amazon employee must have drunkenly nudged the 'Break game on Linux' lever at the office launch party, as reports began trickling in of handheld players being kicked from servers. The cause: Easy Anti-Cheat, Throne and Liberty’s hacker thwarter of choice, declaring an error.
Fortunately, as of right now (October 2nd), all seems well again – I’ve got Throne and Liberty running on a Steam Deck OLED as I type this, and can mosey around next to fellow online players without issues. A lot of them are turning into wolves. Most of them, in fact. Maybe too many.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We pitch our tents outside Constantinople and crack open the ale. In the light of the campfire I examine my travel companions as they party. There's an Ashkenazi rabbi, a Saxon serf, some French knights, a Czech spy, a German dwarf, and a pair of inseparable Italian peasants. This rowdy band of roustabouts I've collected in the Crusader Kings 3's Roads To Power expansion has the feeling of a found family, each fellow wanderer sporting their own ambitions and quirks. They won't all make it. Many of the people I'm looking at in the glow of these embers will fall on the road, victims of robbery, landslides, and animal attacks. One of them will sacrifice their life to save the rest of us. All will bring me a step closer to my goal: I am walking from Ireland to China.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite just releasing yesterday, Amazon and NCSOFT’s massively mate-filled RPG Throne And Liberty has already shot right up Steam’s most played charts. It's sitting just behind Black Myth: Wukong at number six at time of writing, which is sort of like getting the wobbly chair at a lavish dinner party. Sure, you’re 5% certain you’re going to break your neck at some point, but you’re still eating smoked salmon and chortling, so it’s a good evening. It had a beta earlier this year, which looks like it’s gone some way to drum up serious interest. It’s still not quite on Banana's level, mind.

Having basically sold both of my best standing legs to buy more Kingdom Death Monster expansions, I can’t bemoan anyone spending silly amounts of money on whatever plastic tat makes them happy. But I love Baldur’s Gate 3, and it makes me sad to see all the wonderful art, writing, and acting that went into its characters reduced to $6 miniatures that look like their limbs would melt if I rubbed them between my thumb and forefinger.
As spotted by PC Gamer, WizKids have recently opened pre-orders for a set of greasy pre-painted fetishes based on Larian’s RPG. WizKids, of course, being the maker of supermarket-discount-aisle-ass toys but, ah, they’ve got a base on them so we can pretend they’re proper models and charge you accordingly. Moaning about toys now, are we Nic? Is this what the profession has been reduced to? And to that I say: videogames are toys anyway, they’re just slightly better at hiding it. Also, several of them are worth owning.

Will it build on the exciting innovations of Lords Of The Fallen, or will it seek to recapture the nostalgic charms of Lords Of The Fallen? Perhaps in ten years time we'll do a list feature, "Lords Of The Fallen Games Ranked", with just one entry. I'm pretty sure that in 10 years time, generative AI plagiarism will have rendered everything interchangeable anyway.

And yet, living in Wales for the last decade must have rubbed off. The sweet sheep, they sing to me. The relative rarity of stop motion and other practical effects in horror media is surely one of the greater tragedies of our age, although not too surprising given the incredible amount of work it takes. Flock toward the trailer below, and I’ll see you on the other side of the pasture, hopefully as deeply altered by the experience as I was.

At its heart are a couple of interesting ideas undermined by its own determination to put the wrong thing on centre stage. Make a rich and elaborate resource management game with an unorthodox research system, but then spend so much time on a simultaneous turn system and detailed animations that you're left with a cumbersome interface and lifeless AI, and you too might wind up making Ara.
There's an almost great game here, but it's all neglected and bruised from being shoved into the packaging of a lacklustre 4X.

"Jiný člověk" je ale "tlumenější" a první půlhodinu vypadá skoro jako normální film, který možná není úplně podařeně natočený. Teprve pak to začne být opravdu divné a vyjde najevo, že to od počátku všechno byl sofistikovaný plán filmařů a že tím asi chtěli něco říct. (Ilča 70 %)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wild-eyed stickman brawler Judero appears to have kicked off a small wave of pagan-themed games - or rather, it has recalibrated my brain to be more aware of pagan-themed games. The latest to catch my fancy is party-based RPG Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. 


Specifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a "cursed" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.

"[They] weren't very open to the idea," added game designer Michael Murray, who sat in on the interview. "[Colonel Sanders] appeared in games after that. So maybe it was just him fighting against someone [that] was posing a problem for them."
Never mind, Harada. Here's a few other corporate characters you could try to squeeze into Tekken 8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something feels off. I’ve brought an utterly improbable Champions League title to Aston Villa, built an enviable Ultimate Team and developed a formation that keeps at least outright humiliation at bay in online matches… And yet, my heart isn’t bursting with the joy of joga bonito. This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first.
That is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.

To my shame, I’ve never gotten around to the social tensions and magic-meets-technology world of Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura. A newer, shinier journey to a similar setting sounded like just the ticket. After spending a few hours with the preview build, I do have at least one bit of very positive news to share: I’m definitely going to play Arcanum now, because despite some fetching environments and potentially interesting social systems, New Arc Line just isn’t doing it for me.

In fact, the game’s demo managed to make me go “oooh” then “ah!” in three different ways before I’d even exited the starting elevator. It also made me go “ugh” once, because I opted against tank controls, despite the suggestion to use them with mouse and keyboard. I come to you as disembodied voice, trapped between the worlds of video game inputs, with a dire plea: don’t do that. Just use tank controls. I’d restart but I’m already in too deep.

According to a report, former StarCraft 2 production director Tim Morten and unnamed accomplices pitched several RTS projects to higher-ups at Activision-Blizzard, before Morten jumped ship to co-found Stormgate creators Frost Giant in 2020. These pitches included WarCraft 4, as you'd expect, and also a Call Of Duty RTS, as you'd probably also expect, though seemingly no new StarCraft.

Would Scorsese release eight minutes of a film chopped up into two minute chunks on Xitter, to be experienced fractured and contextless to anyone who didn’t tune into the Tokyo Game Show? Would Scorsese have the chutzpah to call a character Head Viceman or Tempted Christman? I doubt it. Irishman doesn’t count. It’s Dollman’s time now anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I must confess, it was not till this very hour that I envisaged the possibility of an RPG party consisting exclusively of clowns. There's a fine tradition of clown characters in RPGs - Sylvando from Dragon Quest XI, Harle from Chrono Cross, the Jester in Darkest Dungeon - but a whole party's worth? The full big top? The maximum cabaret? Madness! Delightful madness! Here's the trailer for Clowned King, the next game from Moonana, developer of the colourful and melodious Keylocker. I like it better than a custard pie full of razorblades. I like most things better than a custard pie full of razorblades, but this comes reasonably high up that list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The beauty of cards is that they can be anything. You can slap together a working game with them in a couple of minutes. Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. 


Conversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve known for years that consoles have simply become preboxed PCs, and now look: we’re getting into their controllers as well. The Razer Wolverine V3 Pro (and its wired cousin, the Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition) has looked to desktop peripherals in search of superior button-bashing, cannibalising the rather good Razer Viper gaming mouse series for its switches. The result is a high-performing, satisfyingly clicky pad that, yes, works wonderfully on PC – albeit one that rinses you for four times(!) as much as a standard Xbox controller.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As befits the “very normal gardening game” that puzzly mystery box Grunn winkingly bills itself as, the first tool I obtained was a pair of shears. The second tool I obtained was a trumpet. It doesn’t really work like a trumpet, and it does things no regular trumpet could or should do. I got a trowel next. Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects.
I go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably. They should get it replaced. What good is a mirror you can’t see anything in?

So I tried out the demo for its sequel, System Purge: Hollow Point, and can confirm that the witch still has a nice hop. I'm thankful for this, because if the witch did not have a nice hop, the game would be maddening in a bad way. Don't get me wrong, it's still maddening. Just in a good way. The hop is good.

Speaking as both a news editor and a former paperboy, who broke his mind and body hauling obese Sunday editions to the millionaire houses at the top of the valley, Paperboy is my role model. Or he would be if my role model weren't actually Steven Spielberg's Freakazoid. Paperboy's heyday has long since passed into history, however, and the business of journalism has changed beyond recognition. People don't read newspapers anymore, they just eat pizza. This, at least, is the condensed analysis offered by Food Boy, which launched this week on Steam.

Alice B (RPS in peace) dedicated an article series to it back in 2019, summarising it as "a sad, quiet, meditative game about breathing and loneliness and drawing pictures in the stars". Stone's forthcoming Known Mysteries is a ritual of the sun, I guess. Slated for launch on 23rd October, it's the first of several, creatively low-carbon projects that will run off a custom, solar-powered server Stone has set up on her apartment balcony in Calgary, Canada.

For those who don't know the game, this third-person helljaunt sees its players wandering through the battlefields of an endless conflict between three major world powers. Mechs stomp past you, ignoring you in favour of decimating enemy soldiers. Bug-like drones hover overhead, scanning for prey. And horrifying mommy harvesters scavenge bodies from the debris. As a collection of imagery, it's powerful stuff. As a game that you can play (with up to three pals) it is very rough, and not just around the edges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bravely he stood, alone on his hill, unwavering in the face of backlash: Chrono Trigger should have just let Frog be a talking frog instead of being a knight turned into a frog. So, trash game. Fortunately, I can finally experience what it’s like to actually enjoy Chrono Trigger - Canadian Studio Riyo Games are making what they describe as a "spiritual successor". It’s called Threads Of Time, it’s "aided by legendary developers and composers from Japan who have helped define Xenoblade Chronicles, the Mana series and more," and it looks beautiful. Hop on over to the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indie developers love making retro-styled games that look like PlayStation games you rented from Blockbuster and blitzed through in a feverish winter weekend. I'm glad, so here's another. Cold And Afraid is a murder mystery that aims to channel the 1990s with chunky characters and lots of lovely dithering. You play a detective out to stop a serial killer with a grisly pattern who's preying on the young women of an unnamed US city. On top of the obligatory tank controls, it aims to have "consequential dialogue choices" and a "Time Event system where you must meet certain people at specific times to forward different story threads".

For instance, I can recall that time I read Stoner on a backpacking trip through Italy and realising that I particularly like sad books. I can also recall the delicious taste of a Mars Delight chocolate bar. But my short term memory, whew. Yeah it's not so good. And the demo for Disposition, a liminal escape room game where you've got to remember how things are arranged in rooms, has hammered this point home.

Like a very loud sticker on a very large bag of crisps, it promises to have “roughly 35%” more stuff in it. It’s a great game, and this sounds like the perfect time to pick it up, especially if you previously pirated it after the devs said they didn’t mind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skoro dokonalý horor. Nepředvídatelný, ale přesto celkem logický děj. Hutná atmosféra, tvořená novými permutacemi starých klišé, bez nutnosti uchylovat se k lekačkám a stříkající krvi. Nepotřebuji to vidět znovu, ale dlouho jsem něco tak kvalitního neviděl a nevšiml jsem si mnoha věcí, které by se daly zlepšit. (Ilča 80 %)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Velmi příjemné překvapení. Dobře napsané i zahrané scény mezi lidmi, kterým poněkud nefunguje komunikace a navzájem si připadají "trochu divní". Fungovalo by to dobře jako normální (nehororové) současné drama. Ke konci se to trochu zvrhne do standardní vyvražďovačky, ale pořád výrazný nadprůměr s několika výbornými scenáristickými nápady. Neviděl jsem dánský originál. (Ilča 60 %)]]></summary>
