        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A perfect timeline for Atlus.
Since Nintendo announced it would be closing the 3DS eShop earlier this year, we've been keeping our beady eyes on the little handheld so we can complete our digital libraries before the Big N pulls the plug.
If you've been following along with us, you know Sega / Atlus has been discounting their 3DS catalogue pretty generously in the US. This sale has caused a big kerfuffle in the 3DS eShop chart. Last month's reigning champion Pokémon Crystal has been knocked off the top spot Radiant Historia: Perfect Chronology, Atlus' fantastic time travelling turn-based RPG.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FixFox came out a couple of weeks back, and I am in the process of reviewing it. This process is, currently, one in suspended animation, and has been for longer than I anticipated. I moved just before the release and my PC is still somewhere in or about the Irish Sea. Luckily I can link this to FixFox thematically, as a big exciting incident for the story involves waking up a man who was stuck in a cryopod. Around that, you, a fox called Vix, fix things in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi future where your tools are bananas and stamps.
I was several hours into FixFox before I left it, and discovered it was much larger than I expected. It's paradoxically cosy and friendly even as its world is vast and strange. I had some minor annoyances with this - you do a lot of travelling around, and in the early stages of the game there aren't many fast travel options to mitigate this. But now I've been without it for two weeks, I've found myself missing the big spaces and warm welcomes of that world.

When Pokémon Unite was originally revealed in June 2020, it didn't go down well with the Pokémon community at the time. The reveal trailer generated 150,000 dislikes in less than 24 hours and even managed to outdo the reveal of Metroid Prime: Federation Force, which had over 90k dislikes in less than a day.
Fast forward to April 2022, and it's a completely different situation for the free-to-play MOBA-style Pokémon game. It's safe to say Unite is big, like really big - with the latest announcement from The Pokémon Company revealing combined Nintendo Switch and mobile downloads have now exceeded 70 million worldwide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Niantic Labs is no stranger to cute creatures featured in AR mobile games; it popularized the genre with games like Pokémon Go and Pikmin Bloom. But now, Niantic is betting on its own IP with the new AR experience called Peridot. 
The game is named after the critters at the center of the game. Peridots, or Dots as Niantic also calls them, are to be raised from birth to adulthood and can be bred to create new variations of Peridots. Because it's an AR game like Pokémon Go, you'll be able to travel with your Dots, who will help you find items in the world or can be used for a photo-op at a local landmark. 
Click here to watch embedded media
Lifting some features from the Tamogachi or Nintendogs crazes (or, you know, real pets), you'll be spending time with your Dots by teaching them tricks, feeding them, and, yes, you can pet the Peridots. When breeding the Dots, you can mix and match them with your friends' creatures with different characteristics to create entirely new creature archetypes and combinations to diversify the species further.

Niantic is looking to soft-launch Peridot in select territories and countries soon, although no exact locations or release dates have been specified yet. You can pre-register for Peridot on the game's website to get updates on when it'll be available. Expect the game to launch on iOS and Android devices when it becomes available.
Are you excited for this breeding twist on the creature collection genre? Let us know if you're going to be playing Peridot in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New episodes of Moon Knight debut on Disney+ every Wednesday, and tell the story of Steven Grant's transformation into one of Marvel's wildest characters. Wait... Is it Steven Grant or Marc Spector? On third thought, is it Marc Spector or someone else? Regardless of who is in control at the moment, Moon Knight punishes evildoers and looks darn good doing it.
You will soon be able to add Steven and Marc's versions of this character to your Funko Pop and Marvel Legends action figure collections. Funko recently announced a handful of Pops based on this new show. The line consists of Moon Knight in his traditional garb (as Marc sees it), Moon Knight in a nice suit (as Steven sees it), and a comic book version of him that comes with a comic cover background. The wave also includes a Pop of Arthur Harrow, who may or may not be evil. Time will tell. You can see all of the Pops in the gallery below.

Hasbro is releasing two different Legends Moon Knight action figures, again showing off Marc and Steven's ideas of the character on the show. Both figures come with the appropriate weapons, along with a build-a-figure component.
Now we just need Khonshu action figures. Are you watching Moon Knight? How do you think it stacks up to other Marvel shows? Let us know in the comments section below!]]></summary>

Taking on four players by yourself can be quite a task, but you have a plethora of wicked tools at your disposal. With traps, Deadites, and even possessing survivors, you can attempt to isolate and destroy your targets with precision. Each different Demon comes with a special kit that syncs up with various playstyles, so let’s take a look at the three core Demon templates you’ll have available to play with at launch. …]]></summary>

That's £20 cheaper than the current Amazon price, and a massive drop from the £430+ going rate at the beginning of the year.
*OK, the Ryzen 9 5950X is technically faster, but it costs way more and the difference in gaming performance is miniscule. The Ryzen 7 5800X3D also looks promising, but hasn't yet been released and will likely cost more than this 5900X while packing fewer cores.

CD Projekt Red has announced it will be delaying the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt as it brings the remainder of the porting in-house.
We have decided to have our in-house development team conduct the remaining work on the next-gen version of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. We are currently evaluating the scope of work to be done and thus have to postpone Q2 release until further notice. 1/2
April 13, 2022
The change in development teams on the new-generation upgrades was revealed through a tweet on The Witcher series Twitter account. "We have decided to have our in-house development team conduct the remaining work on the next-gen version of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt," reads the tweet. "We are currently evaluating the scope of work to be done and thus have to postpone Q2 release until further notice." A follow-up message says, "We'll update you as soon as we can. Thank you for your understanding."
Saber Interactive was the company working on the ports of Witcher 3 to the new consoles from Sony and Microsoft and had previously partnered with CD Projekt on the Switch port of the same game. No reason was given as to why Saber will no longer be involved, nor is there a timeline on the new expected release window. 
In recent months, CD Projekt has had its hands full with the new-gen ports of Cyberpunk 2077 released in February and is still planning to expand the game with new content. The studio also announced a new chapter in The Witcher franchise is coming and will be running on Unreal Engine 5 instead of the in-house developed REDengine.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo: The Best Generation.
Looking back over nearly four decades of video game output from Nintendo in both hardware and software form, it's easy to pick out highlights, both historical and personal. Super Mario Bros. was a seminal release in the history of the medium; A Link To The Past codified the design template that the Zelda series would use for the next two decades; GoldenEye 007 helped birth the competitive multiplayer shooter genre that would go on to dominate gaming for multiple generations; and so on and so forth.
It's also easy to pick out times when Nintendo dropped the ball. The N64 years saw the ascendance of Sony's PlayStation and marked a decline in Nintendo's cultural cachet. The Wii U, much as we love it, took all the success and mainstream momentum of Wii and squandered it in a matter of months. However, even those eras produced incredible genre-defining games: Super Mario 64, Ocarina of Time and the aforementioned GoldenEye were all N64 titles. And where do you think Switch has been cribbing all those incredibly polished first-party ports from?

It was way back in August 2020(!) that the intriguing Card Shark was revealed for the Switch in an Indie World showcase, with developer Nerial teaming up with publishing powerhouse Devolver Digital for the release. The concept is that you fleece and cheat your way to the top of 18th century French society, all through playing cards and tricking the other players in various ways.
There's now a developer walkthrough video available (above), which is useful for seeing how the game will actually work. It's not just about playing cards, but working with your accomplice in different ways - sneaking cards into or out of their pocket while pouring them a drink, or finding a reason to leave the room and 'mark' cards in the deck so you can manipulate the game.

MLB The Show 22 is a savvy veteran, a game that continues to perform well on the field, despite some modes feeling like they are falling behind the times. Developer Sony San Diego once again finds new ways to capture the realism of the sport and add even more excitement to the already fantastic batting and pitching battle. Given just how much content is here, not every mode received the attention we want, but Sony makes up for them with excellent new experiences.

It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on "violations of the state's civil rights and equal pay laws," specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

Blizzard has released a new video shedding light on the origin story of Overwatch 2's new hero, Sojourn. 
A trailer sheds light on Sojourn's background as a former Canadian special forces captain who worked alongside Overwatch during its peak. We still don't know much about her combat abilities beyond the fact that she's a damage-focused hero, but players will find out when Sojourn becomes playable in the game's upcoming PvP beta for PC.

Speaking of that beta, it's set to go live sometime this month after Blizzard announced it was detaching PvP modes from PvE to get the former content out the door faster. Overwatch 2 still doesn't have a release window, and its development has been affected by factors such as Activision Blizzard's ongoing sexual harassment lawsuits, staff departures, and the publisher's impending acquisition by Microsoft.

Game publisher Aspyr has announced that it will be acquiring development studio Beamdog. The news was revealed in a tweet this morning, one day after the two companies announced a new game together, MythForce.
We're excited to welcome the talented team at @BeamdogInc to the Aspyr family!

The tweet reads, "We're excited to welcome the talented team at Beamdog to the Aspyr family!" Other than giving a link to the MythForce website, no other information on the purchase is given. 
Outside of the new IP that is MythForce, Beamdog has specialized in remastering classic Dungeons and Dragons-related RPGs. The studio has previously released Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, and Planescape: Torment. Most recently, Beamdog developed an online edition of the strategy board game Axis and Allies 1942.
Aspyr also has its hands in remastering and releasing games. The developer/publisher has been bringing back Star Wars games from the recently bygone eras, such as Star Wars: Episode I – Racer, Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, and the upcoming port of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed on Switch. While most of these games are straightforward ports, Aspyr is developing a from-the-ground-up remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, which was announced at The Game Awards last year.
MythForce, the project tying these studios together before the acquisition, is a four-player first-person fantasy roguelite with art designed to resemble a Saturday morning cartoon. Check out the trailer for it in our story from its announcement yesterday. Mythforce enters Early Access exclusively on the Epic Games Store on April 20.]]></summary>

Killer robots that resemble glowing chunks of Toblerone. That's the less good part. Still, survive the mechanical menace and you'll earn plenty of new goodies for your dwarven bod.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on in-person events for a couple of years now. Although infection numbers have generally fallen in recent months, many companies continue to exercise caution when it comes to organizing public gatherings and Quakecon is one of them. The show's organizers have announced that for the third year in a row, Quakecon 2022 will be a digital-only event.
In a post to Twitter, the organizers revealed that Quakecon will take place August 18-20 with more details to come in June. They explain that the constant uncertainty around holding large gatherings this year made it hard to commit to putting a show together in the time required. Quakecon will return to its normal in-person state in 2023, however. You can read the full statement below:
Quakecon was a digital event in 2020 and 2021, with last year’s show being free to attend. This news isn't far removed from E3 2022's outright cancellation last month due to similar concerns, though this month's PAX East has committed to being a physical convention. Every company has their own comfort-level for dealing with the pandemic and while the situation has improved, we likely won't see every event back in full from until at least 2023 and maybe beyond.]]></summary>

Playstige Interactive has announced that its new first-person puzzle game NeonLore is coming to Switch on 20th April. Set in the distant future, NeonLore sees you solving puzzles and talking to people to try and figure out what has happened to the human race.
The game will let you explore the streets at your own pace, and it's entirely free-form too, meaning you can do many of NeonLore's puzzles in any order, and check out areas in the city as and when you want. There are also audiobooks to collect in-game which have been written by sci-fi authors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cowabunga!
Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness starts as it means to go on — with a warm-hearted parody of something only gamers of a certain age are likely to remember. Ancient's logo appears and then… nothing happens — not until you hammer the 'A' button on the side of the screen as though your Switch is a temperamental CRT TV that's seen better days. This sequence is left entirely unexplained; you're expected to simply be the sort of person who understands the reference immediately.
The same can be said of so many other fourth wall breaking nods to RF switches, age ratings, and hundreds of stat-boosting carts with IP-dodging names like Illinois James: Temple of Gloom. Much of this love for a bygone era naturally comes from Ancient themselves, the developer with a heritage that stretches all the way back to 8-bit hardware. But credit must also be given to the translators over at 8-4, too: The text always feels lively, the jokes regularly hit their mark, and there are some excellent lines that involve threatening to squash someone flatter than 2D or "rolling along faster than a hedgehog on blast processing!" along the way.

In Evil Dead, playing as a survivor means you’re going to be taking on a ton of Deadites, regardless of what your favorite specializations or weapons are. While survivors are placed into basic buckets that dictate areas that they’re better at, you’re inevitably going to be doing plenty of shooting, stabbing, and decapitating as you move through a level. So don’t think that by playing support you’re going to be sitting in the back throwing heals and watching fear meters – every class is going to be in the thick of it…]]></summary>

Certain Affinity, a studio that's helped develop most mainline Halo games since the days of Halo 2, has revealed that it will now work even closer with 343 Industries and Xbox on Halo Infinite. 
This news comes by way of a tweet posted by the Certain Affinity account, which states that after more than 15 years of working on the Halo series, the studio is "deepening" its relationship with Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a CMA investigation.
Okay, how many of us have fallen victim to this: saying we're going to cancel our subscriptions, forgetting, and then being charged a hefty sum of money for a year's more. It's a vicious cycle that, unless you remember to cancel or take your card details off, would leave you with lighter pockets.
Auto-renewal has long been criticised across the industry, and back in 2019, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched an investigation into Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo's online subscription services. Auto-renewal was part of this, but its concerns also included cancellation and refund policies, terms and conditions, and price increases.

MLB The Show 22 has been out for a little over a week (slightly longer if you paid for the Digital Deluxe Edition) and has had consistent content updates and tweaks. Developer Sony San Diego Studio has now, however, rolled out the first major update since the day one patch; it tackles some issues (like repeating tutorials) while adding 'new player images' throughout the game.
We had to trigger the update manually on Switch (press '+' on the game's HOME screen window, then 'Software Update' and 'Via the Internet'), and it'll likely roll out automatically soon. Below are the full patch notes (which is version 1.0.3 for the Switch version).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More PC Engine arcade goodness.
Valkyrie no Densetsu is the latest game coming to the Switch via Arcade Archives. This cult classic action RPG launched in Japan in 1989 but didn't see a western release until Namco Museum Vol. 5, where it was titled The Legend of Valkyrie.
Developed by Namco, Valkyrie no Densetsu was greatly inspired by the Vikings and middle ages of Europe. As Valkyrie, you explore the world of Marvel from a top-down perspective as you hack and slash at enemies. You have a time limit to beat each of the eight levels, so it's very different from many other action RPGs from the time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming to Switch this year.
Thunderful Games has revealed a new game coming to Switch and other consoles this year — Paper Cut Mansion. Coming from UK-based Space Lizard Studio, the game is described as a roguelite horror and sees you navigate your way through a cardboard mansion as police detective Toby, solving escape room-style puzzles and scaling the building floor by floor, run by procedurally-generated run.
The developer says that the game "draws inspiration from the classic 80s and 90s works of Tim Burton and Jim Henson", and from the trailer above it looks a little like Double Fine were given the keys to a Paper Mario X Luigi's Mansion mash up... which actually sounds like a truly excellent idea now we've typed it out.

Vanillaware's latest title, 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, finally landed on Switch yesterday, letting you bring the mystery-laden, mecha-battling, mind-bending story on the go with you. But if you have a physical release of the game, it seems like the surprises start even before you get a chance to boot up the game.
A few days ago, Twitter user @5wayshot got a boxed version of the game ahead of time. When they open the box, it looks like it's just plain and white inside, which is a little bit boring! Dig a bit deeper, and remove the cartridge, and there's something waiting for you:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even with PC hardware orthodoxy supporting SSD replacement, I’m convinced that getting one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck is the wiser method of expanding its storage. It’s technically possible to swap in a bigger SSD, sure, but compatible M.2 2230 drives are much harder to find than the standard 2280 drives on our best gaming SSDs list – and based on my testing, a good microSD card can be just about as fast as the Deck’s preinstalled SSD.


That’s on top of microSD cards being cheaper, easier to install, easier to remove, and available with much more choice than Steam Deck-compatible SSDs. That’s not to say that any old card will work – Valve’s handheld PC specifically supports UHS-1 microSD cards – but I’ve found and tested a few that will do the job, and do it well.

Put him in human clothes, obviously.
It's the good ol' gag, isn't it? Seen in countless media and video games over the years. Of course, all it ends up doing to us is make us laugh and maybe get a few "awwws" from us too. But the only way to make this more adorable is by making it into a toy, right!?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A return to horror's roots.
"This game contains scenes of explicit violence and gore."
It's a phrase so familiar to fans of classic survival horror games that its appearance at the start of Tormented Souls almost feels comforting. Since the mid '00s, the genre has been bent and twisted to keep up with the changing times and the growing fatigue around overused mechanics in franchises like Resident Evil and Alone in the Dark. The classic survival horror tropes of the '90s — fixed camera angles, stationary aiming, and careful item management — have become all but extinct. Tormented Souls is a love letter to the classic horror games of the '90s; a true homage that embraces the genre's origins. It's a shame, then, that it largely struggles to measure up to such a high benchmark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Platform:
        PlayStation 4
				
Publisher:
      Sony Interactive Entertainment
			
Developer:
      Sucker Punch Productions
      
Release:
                      	July 17, 2020
			
            
The upcoming Ghost of Tsushima film will have its screenplay written by Takashi Doscher, Deadline reports. 
Doscher’s writing credits include writing and directing 2019’s sci-fi romance Only, the Hulu exclusive film Still, and the ESPN documentary A Fighting Chance. Now he’ll be penning the screenplay for Ghost of Tsushima’s big-screen adaptation, which is helmed by John Wick director Chad Stahelski. Alex Young and Jason Spitz of 87Eleven Entertainment serve as producers with PlayStation Productions overseeing the entire project. 
The Ghost of Tsushima film is in very early development, with Stahlski saying in December that he intends to take his time with the movie in order to “do it right.” The film crew is said to be working closely with the game’s developer, Sucker Punch. Stahlski is a fan of Ghost and was inspired to make the movie after playing the game “many times.”
We still don’t know anything in regards to casting (though the voice actor for protagonist Jin Sakai raised his hand in humorous fashion) and it will likely be a while before we see anything substantial from the project. But it’s nice to see the pieces slowly fall into place. Video game movies have generally improved over the last few years, so we hope that Ghost of Tsushima continues the trend when it is eventually released.

Point-and-click games cemented the vast potential of interactive narrative at the turn of the century, employing innovative environmental/dialogue puzzles with evocative pixel art and chiptune music. Nowadays, we lose ourselves in impossibly large sandboxes with equally extensive choice-driven plotlines. It’s fitting, then, that Norco feels like a precious relic from the Sierra-led Golden Age of digital adventures. Geography of Robots’ debut title ponders unchecked capitalism and classism at the heart of America’s oft-neglected Deep South. Moreover, Norco’s retrofuturistic and net.art aesthetic is …]]></summary>

Hell is Us represents a big step for Montréal-based studio Rogue Factor and creative director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête.

Before reading anything more about MythForce, you should absolutely watch the MythForce intro trailer because it rips – it’s perfectly ‘80s, and the MythForce theme song will stay in your head for the rest of the day. You can watch it below:

That's still about £70 to £100 over the base RRP, but it's a big improvement over the situation for the past year where we often saw these cards retailing - and selling - for over £500, £600 and even £700.

As the Demon in Evil Dead: The Game, you have a lot of work to do – after all, you have to beat 4 other players! However, you have a rather nasty toolbox at your command, full of traps, possessions, and even the ability to summon horrific boss monsters that will destroy your prey. Of course, the first challenge is simply to find them, a task that can be daunting given how big the map is. Survivors can do things that give away their position too like riding in cars, so it’s important to pay close attention to the minimap.

Early on you wander along, collecting infernal energy, setting up traps, and accumulating power so that when you do face your well-armed opponents you’ll be ready to crush them. You can take a peek at all the demonic action in this exclusive gameplay video!]]></summary>

Want to see how everything works in Evil Dead: The Game? As a survivor, you’ll have to loot up and complete objectives before taking the battle to The Dark Ones themselves. To do this, you have to gear up and take advantage of numerous caches of loot scattered across the vast map.

You might even want to use a car to help get around the field much fast, but be aware that the Demon can possess cars too, turning them into deadly weapons in a flash. Be on the lookout for signs like traps that the Demon might be close to discovering your presence – even though the map is huge, they can find you early! Check out some exclusive gameplay and commentary in this video focused on the survivor perspective!]]></summary>

This year, Elden Ring has already shown up as a big contender for Game of the Year – so what better way to check it out than with a spicy crew and even spicier wings? Game Informer is teaming up with Wingstop to deliver some incredibly high stakes and hot action, where each death in-game brings the threat of hot wings. We'll be keeping count and raising the temperature levels as each episode goes on! 
Will the group be able to endure the wings getting hotter and hotter as the stream goes on? Will the game break the team as the fire rises? You'll have to tune in to find out. The first episode of Elden Wing kicks off this Friday (April 15) at 2 PM CT, only on the Game Informer Twitch Channel. Come for the wings, come for the game, come for the zany commentary – it's going to get hot!]]></summary>

There's plenty of action RPG for fans of the genre, but Steelrising hopes to rise above the usual high octane fun. Join us for a special episode of New Gameplay Today as we give you a look at what to expect from developer Spiders' upcoming title.
Click here to watch embedded media
To make this NGT even more exciting, the team behind Steelrising is here. Jehanne Rousseau (CEO, co-founder, and lead writer), Sébastien Di Ruzza (design director), and Ciaran Cresswell (localization lead) gave us the deets ahead of the game's September 8 release.
But what can players expect from the unique new title? Steelrising takes place during a fictionalized and sci-fi version of the French Revolution. You play as protagonist Aegis as they take on the treacherous automata army to liberate the people of France. Given such a unique mesh of period and theme, the developers got the unique chance of merging the beautiful styles of the past with a dark and unsettling layer of robotic terror to create a truly unique art style.
On top of its creative visuals, Steelrising will feel right at home for fans of action RPGs. The game features plenty of upgrades, weapons, and armor to collect and an exciting story set in this fascinating vision of a fictional past. Another big emphasis for the team was making sure that the routine enemy encounters/boss battles were memorable and enjoyable. Did they accomplish such a feat? You'll have to watch today's NGT to find out!
Are you excited for more from Steelrising? Spiders' new game launches later this year on September 8 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a years-long wait, Stranger Things’ penultimate fourth season kicks off this summer. Releasing in two parts, the season's first full-length trailer sets the table for dangers new and old the heroes of Hawkins must contend with. 
The story picks up several months after the events of 2019's Season 3. A powerless Eleven and the Byers family have moved to California. Hopper is being held captive in Russia. Our remaining friends must pick up the pieces while starting high school. Naturally, the ongoing supernatural menace and the sinister government conspiracy attached to it continue to haunt the world’s unluckiest small town. Per a warning to Eleven in the trailer: “a war is coming. Your friends in Hawkins are very much in the eye of a storm.”

Stranger Things 4 consists of nine episodes, each with a runtime twice as long as before. Because the episodes are supersized, they’ll be divided and released in two batches that are five weeks apart. Volume 1 premieres on May 27, and Volume 2 arrives on July 1. It's unknown how many episodes are in each volume, but one would imagine it's a clean split, so four/five each. 
Earlier this year, Netflix renewed Stranger Things for a 5th and final season. The last season currently has no premiere date. For more on Stranger Things, you can read about its recent crossovers with Far Cry 6 and Magic: The Gathering.]]></summary>

A new update for Halo: The Master Chief Collection is now live and it includes a number of bug fixes and improvements for the overall experience.

Clocking in at roughly 22 gigabytes on Xbox consoles, this update is one of the biggest in recent memory for MCC, especially as much of 343 Industries continues its focus on the latest Halo game, Halo Infinite. Here’s what’s …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BIOTA (or, technically, B.I.O.T.A.) is Metroidvania 'em up with a hot-swappable retro sheen. And it's pretty fun! Not, like, groundbreaking or anything, but hey, not everything needs to be. BIOTA has some platforming, some shooting, some bits where you drive mechs and submarines. It keeps things simple and it largely works, making for a game that's an inoffensive 8-bit-style romp with flashes of greatness.

Nintendo has released a new Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes trailer that showcases the “mysterious mercenary” players will control when the musou hits Switch on June 24. 
Aptly titled the “Mysterious Mercenary Trailer,” it begins with a spar or all-out fight between the female version of Byleth and a purple-haired male warrior. Byleth clearly has the advantage here and later in the trailer, it’s revealed they’re the Ashen Demon, presumably helping the game’s main antagonist, the Ashen Dragon. However, before that reveal, we learn that the purple-haired warrior is Shez, the protagonist players will control in Three Hopes. Like Fire E…]]></summary>

One thing I've been playing recently is Ghostwire: Tokyo, a ghost huntin' action game that's a bit less weird and a bit more "kind of like an Ubisoft game" than I was expecting. But I like Ubisoft games just fine, so I'm having a blast - plus there are still some clutch ghost fights to be hand when I run out of finger-ammo for my magic hands.
I am extra delighted by the animals, though. For whatever reason, they are unaffected by the evil fog that has swept through Tokyo and turned everyone into spirits, so there are a few dogs and cats just sitting around and (and this is the good bit) you can read their thoughts.

All of that initial benchmarking as usual was done using the default GCC system compiler across all tested AMD/Intel processors. Of course, there also exists AMD's Optimizing C/C++ Compiler (AOCC) as a downstream of LLVM/Clang with various Zen optimization patches applied. Curious about the AOCC impact for Milan-X, here are some benchmarks looking at the EPYC 7773X 2P performance across AOCC, GCC, and LLVM Clang.]]></summary>

Annihilation is a good mood to channel. I hope the third-person explore-o-melee game does turn out a bit like that when it arrives in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Nacon has announced Rogue Factor's newest title in the works is called Hell is Us, with former Eidos Montreal Art Director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête on the project as creative director. Jacques-Belletête has previously worked on games such as Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Mankind Divided and worked on concepts for Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy before transitioning over to Rogue Factor. The debut teaser trailer for Hell is Us can be seen below.
Hell is Us is described as an action-adventure set inside a country in the midst of a civil war where the main character will fight against creatures caused by a mysterious event the locals call "the Calamity." He'll have to use special weapons and equipment to take on these monsters that resemble monuments scattered across the nation in order to survive and learn more about his history in this land.

"Our goal with Hell is Us is to bring back true adventure and exploration," says Jacques-Belletête in a press release provided to Game Informer. "There's no need for a detailed quest log or precise waypoint on the map: we want players to feel the thrill of adventure, guided by their feelings and instincts."
 The first game from Rogue Factor since we acquired it is also one of our most ambitious projects, and we can't wait to reveal more about it in the coming months."
We'll have more on Hell is Us soon, including an exclusive preview where we speak with Jonathan Jacques-Belletête about his vision for the project. Hell is Us is being developed using Unreal Engine 5 and is planned for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2023.]]></summary>

I've become a big fan of it in that time - it's spacious, easy to build in, cool and clean - and the only real downside is the price.
The case debuted late last year for a princely £240, expensive even for a large form factor case, but now it's down to £175 - a more reasonable ask given its full tower size and laundry list of features, which I'll tell you about presently.

To the delight of many a fan, Square Enix announced Kingdom Hearts IV yesterday. The tantalizing cinematic trailer showed off a more mature-looking Sora exploring a realistic human city invaded by Heartless. Naturally, the video raised countless questions, but it also led us to gush about the things we want to see in the hotly-anticipated sequel.
That’s why we, the Kingdom Hearts fans in the Game Informer office, couldn’t help but share our personal hopes and dreams for the next game. Let us know what you think of our wishlists, and be sure to share your own desires and expectations down in the comments!

2017's Hello Neighbor gained a bit of a cult following thanks to its popularity in streaming and on YouTube, and since then, fans have been clamoring for a sequel. With that sequel now announced and a release date in sight – December 6 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC – developer tinyBuild has released a beta to tide fans over until later this year.

Anyone can access the beta, so long as they preorder the game, and what you'll find is not a look at the final version of Hello Neighbor 2 but instead a look at what the game is shaping up to be. tinyBuild has promised that the beta is spoiler-free and does not contain story elements from the final game. It's more like a scenario meant to showcase what the game looks like today, what some of its mechanics feel like, who some of the people in Raven Brooks are, and more. Game Informer editor Wesley LeBlanc went hands-on with this demo, and today, he's joined by fellow associate editor John Carson to discuss the first 11 minutes of it. 
For more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for early looks at Cult of the Lamb, Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers, Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong, Forspoken, and so much more! Thanks for watching today's video.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake processors are among the best gaming CPUs you can buy, but certain owners have noticed a seemingly worrisome trend: their LGA 1700 motherboard socket puts so much pressure on the chip that its IHS (integrated heat spreader, the big grey bit on top) starts to bend. This isn’t so much a concern for the CPU’s structural integrity as it is a cooling issue, as a non-flat IHS will struggle to transfer heat to the CPU cooler plate as effectivity.


In a statement to Tom’s Hardware, however, an Intel spokesperson has essentially said it’s not as bad as it sounds. The statement does acknowledge the warping (or “deflection”, to use Intel’s more engineer-y term), but says there’s no evidence thus far to suggest it drives load temperatures up to unsafe levels.

Kingdom Hearts 4 was surprise-revealed yesterday during a 20th Anniversary announcement trailer for the series, which is where Square Enix also revealed that it was developing Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link, a new mobile game for the franchise. 
The reveal of Kingdom Hearts was quite extensive and you can read Game Informer’s full breakdown of it here, but one thing that couldn’t go unnoticed was the new visual style. Featuring a much more realistic look, especially compared to the cartoony nature of previous Kingdom Hearts games, this new sequel looks beautiful.

Wii Sports solidified the power of motion-control gameplay and catapulted Nintendo’s seventh-generation home console to immediate superstardom (it’s no wonder the cartoony sports simulator cracked our Top 25 Wii Games).

Now that fans have had a days’ time to pour over every shot in the Kingdom Hearts 4 trailer and speculate on what this or that means, some people are beginning to think the Forest Moon of Endor, the fan-favorite Star Wars location from Episode VI, is teased in it. If you recall, the Kingdom Hearts 4 reveal showcases some beautiful shots of nature – lots of green foliage, a small creek, perhaps some Redwood trees. That description sounds a lot like Endor, right? That’s probably not enough to call the shot, though, but some fan…]]></summary>

I am mildly distressed to see KH4 lean towards a 'realistic' art style in parts, though I would be curious to see a Kingdom Hearts Mickey Mouse that's just a wee mouse wrapped in leather, plaid, buckles, and zips. While KH4 is largely a mystery for now, eagle-eyed viewers think the announcement trailer hints at a crossover with the Disney Princess world of Star Wars.

Kerbal Space Program 2 wants to up the ante somewhat by upping the scale and allowing for interstellar travel. 

A new 15-minute video from its developers talks about the challenges of simulating interstellar travel - from the engine changes required to support such vast scale, to the reasons for even wanting to.

Now that Season 3 of Video Gameography is complete, and the Uncharted series has been, well...charted, we're diving below the depths and soaring above the clouds to spotlight the Bioshock series in Season 4. This week we welcome our guest Bryan Vore back on the show as we take to the skies and explore the last game in this unfortunately short trilogy, Bioshock Infinite.
Bioshock Infinite started pre-production around the same time as Bioshock 2, but while 2K Marin was exploring the depths of the seas once again, Ken Levine and his team at 2K Boston/Irrational Games had their heads in the clouds. Focusing on American exceptionalism, Bioshock Infinite introduces players to the floating city of Columbia, an engineering feat inspired by the World's Fair attractions of yesteryear. We discuss the troubling development that miraculously came together late in the process as well as the main characters, Booker DeWitt and Bioshock's first constant companion in Elizabeth. And listen until the end as we reveal what's in store for the next season of Video Gameography!
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), and former Game Informer Editor Bryan Vore (@Bryan_Vore) as we unpack the history and narrative of the final Bioshock released to date!
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

The Quarry is an upcoming game from Supermassive Games, and it’s a spiritual successor to 2015’s Until Dawn. Unlike Until Dawn, which puts players in the roles of multiple characters stuck in a winter mountain cabin, The Quarry is riffing on the classic “teenagers without supervision at summer camp” trope. 
It’s doing it with an impressive voice cast, too, including the likes of David Arquette (the Scream series), Lin Shaye (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Insidious), Ted Raimi (the Evil Dead Series, Candyman, The Grudge), Ariel Winter (Modern Family),…]]></summary>

A few weeks ago, spring's annual crack of the bat was in question as MLB's lockout dragged on. The players and league eventually came to an agreement, and the season was delayed slightly, but no games will be lost. As of this writing, we are just a week away from the first pitch being thrown on April 7. Sony's MLB The Show series usually hits a few weeks in advance of the MLB season starting, but this year's installment hits the streets just two days before it on April 5 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation …]]></summary>

It took almost 70 levels for Reiterate to do that. That's a recommendation.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 and AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT both launched in recent weeks with the aim of reasserting some sanity, and to an extent, they have: while they’re not immune to bonkers inflation, they’re still relatively affordable, with unusually plentiful stock available.


Which, though, is the better buy? Both are 1080p-focused cards on sale for £300 or less, both sit at the bottom of their respective GPU hierarchies (the RTX 30 series and Radeon RX 6000 series), and both support ray tracing, so let’s break out the bar chart app and do some comparisons.

It’s not out in full just yet, but its demo got a substantial update this week, adding more levels and a bunch of game-changing cards to the mix that are well worth making a return trip for if you’ve only ever played the original half-hour version from 2020.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we were putting together our most anticipated games of 2022 list back in January, there was one game I knew had to be on it: Mojiken Studio’s A Space For The Unbound. It’s a slice of life adventure about two Indonesian high school students set in the late 90s, and the demo (which has recently been expanded to include the first chapter in addition to its short prologue) instantly captivated me when I first played it a couple of years ago. There are some light supernatural elements that will be instantly familiar to anyone who’s watched the films of Japanese anime directors Makoto Shinkai and Mamoru Hosoda (including a giant, ominous Your Name-style comet, no less), but for the most part this is a much more grounded game than Mojiken have made in the past, such as the fantastical point and click puzzlers She And The Light Bearer and When The Past Was Around. 
Indeed, the only game in their back catalogue that has a recognisable, real-life setting is their short, free browser game Banyu Lintar Angin. Born out of an internal game jam project in 2017, Banyu Lintar Angin once again draws inspiration from the studio’s home country of Indonesia. It only takes a couple of minutes to play, but speaking with its creator Dimas Novan, it was vital in sowing the seeds for what A Space For The Unbound would eventually become.

This process is now even simpler with the launch of Puck, a game-making AI you can download right now and set to work designing brand new video games for you to play.

Therefore, it's extremely exciting to see the RTX 3080 available at Laptops Direct for a recent low price of £860, some £100 below the cheapest RTX 3080 card on Amazon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You’d be forgiven for getting excited about the AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT. A brand new RDNA 2 graphics card, with ray tracing support, that’s both easy to find in stock and available at a comparatively approachable £200 / $230? In the midst of a years-long components shortage, exacerbated by all manner of price-gouging bollocks, it’d be entirely understandable if upgrade-starved PC owners went for this like my cat goes for unattended crisp packets. Especially if they’re happy to stick to playing at 1080p.


Alas, the RX 6500 XT isn’t just an inferior low-end option to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 (one of the best graphics cards, and perhaps the outright best for budget builds right now). It’s an offputtingly slow, sometimes bizarrely-designed GPU in general; instead of providing long-overdue relief to a truly fudged hardware market, it ends up feeling like more an attempt to just sell any old second-rate kit to an audience that’s been left desperate for something, anything that’s new and somewhat affordable.

Today, Scan's selling both models at RRP, with the 3080 Ti costing £1049 and the 3090 Ti costing a cool £830 more than that. These are both high-end cards with a price tag to match, but the Founders Edition models are generally the cheapest you'll find - so we thought you should know about this unprecedented stock situation!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've ever played 2019's My Time At Portia (and given that game's popularity, statistics suggest a bunch of you have) you'll know the appeal. It's a life sim set in a post apocalyptic world where, instead of punk metal bikinis and murder, the vibe is regrowth and bright colours; a sort of juicy 3D Stardew Valley with an emphasis on crafting. 
But now the sequel My Time At Sandrock is launching into early access on May 26th, bringing a whole new region to restore. Sandrock may look more traditionally post-apocalyptic, being as it is a sandy outback populated by cowboys, but it's still got a helping-hands community feel at its core, plus an interesting eco-friendly angle and an all-new multiplayer mode. But its origins were much more modest. As Pathea Games' executive producer Zifei Wu tells me, Sandrock originally began life as a My Time At Portia DLC pack.

This move has now happened, but if you were hoping for an update on how I am getting on with a massive virtual jigsaw, you will be disappointed. Everything I own (bar the suitcase of clothes Mr. Ryanair allowed on the plane) has been held by customs. More monstrous is that my stuff actually cleared customs, but some absolute head-melter unrelated to me or my boxes of pens - and who, I am choosing to assume, tried to ship a load of high grade cocaine into Ireland - got the entire container stopped in Dublin.
This means that I have been without any TV for two weeks. Nor any books, video games, or even my big bag of crochet. We didn't get internet until two days ago. It is only by the grace of a technician looking at an HDMI cable stuck in our wall jack, stroking his chin, and then yanking the cable really hard that I'm talking to you now. In those two weeks, I discovered I am weak. But by a stroke of complete luck the new flat faces an busy shipping lane in an estuary. So I have also discovered a deep love for big boats and VesselFinder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Corsair's shiny Dominator Platinum DDR4 RAM looks great - and today, we found a 16GB kit that's 22% off over at Ebuyer in the UK. It hits the sweet spot spec of 3200MHz CL16 too, which I've personally found the best bang for your buck in terms of actual in-game performance. Of course, you're paying a little more here for the RGB lighting and the trendy white colour scheme, but there's no harm in choosing components for their aesthetics too.

Half-Life Alyx: Levitation is exciting to me, then. It's a mod for Half-Life: Alyx which is promising a 4-5 hour campaign, and it looks excellent in its first trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam Deck makers Valve are looking to avoid any further delays in getting their portable PC to the waiting hands of reserve order holders.  The Deck, which launched in February after missing a planned release in December 2021, has only just finished its first round of shipments; now it’s moving into the Q2 2022 phase, Valve are “ramping up shipments” to make sure everybody gets theirs within their current order availability estimate.


That’s according to the Steam Deck Twitter account, from which Valve also announced that they’re clarifying what these availability estimates actually are. So far these have been given purely as Q2 2022, Q3 2022 and so on, but the Deck’s Steam store page will now list the actual months in that quarter – including your personal delivery estimate, if you’ve already got a reservation waiting. This change won’t affect when the handhelds are ready, it just saves a Google search for anyone less familiar with the business-speak of quarterly codes.

        <updated>2022-04-05T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chrono Cross was one of those Square JRPGs that never made its way to Europe at its original time of release. Heck, the first time I got to play time-travel classic Chrono Trigger was when the Nintendo DS version came out in 2009, almost 15 years after it first came out on the SNES. Chrono Cross, its semi-related but not direct sequel, has taken even longer to get here. First releasing on the original PlayStation in 1999 in Japan (and 2000 in the US), it's finally arriving on PC and modern consoles on April 7th as Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, which bundles the original game with its accompanying text-based side story Radical Dreamers that only ever released on the ill-fated Satellaview. The latter's original 4:3 pixel art looks mildly ropey blown up on today's screens, but the main game has received all the modern conveniences you've come to expect from Square Enix's recent run of retro PC ports: new HD character models, re-orchestrated music, multiple font options, and the holy grail: a fast-forward button.
I'm nowhere near the end yet, but from what I've played so far, Chrono Cross is a rollicking good time. There are dozens of characters to meet and recruit to your party that can tangibly change your path through the story, the turn-based battle system offers oodles of depth and variety, and Yasunori Mitsuda's revamped score is right up there with the Final Fantasy greats. For all its buff and polish, though, Chrono Cross has, sadly, also been struck by the same curse as other Square Enix PC ports. The lack of settings options makes it hard to pin down exactly what the problem is, but there's something about the performance and inconsistent frame rate of my review build that's so fundamentally borked that it's like those 22 years haven't even happened. If you, too, have been looking forward to Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, I'd strongly advise waiting for a few patches to arrive before dipping your toes in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo Infinite officially launched last December, receiving rave reviews from critics and fans - including Brendan’s review here at RPS. It peaked with over 200k viewers on Twitch. And for many content creators like Kevin Lynch, aka KevinKoolx, December marked their best month ever in terms of engagement on YouTube and Twitch. Halo, after a decade of somewhat divisive releases, was back. It’s hard to overstate how impressive a feat this was, since the Halo fanbase is almost as divided as the Star Wars one - a seemingly trivial topic like the inclusion of sprint is just one of many decade-long points of contention. But somehow with Halo Infinite 343 Industries created an experience that almost every type of Halo fan could rally behind. But now, just four months after launch, Infinite is struggling to retain its playerbase.

 Now the Twitch peaks are below 10k and dropping, with the averages even lower. Lynch says February was his worst month views-wise in over a year. You'd expect some tail off after launch for any game, but every content creator I’ve spoken to echoes this sentiment: engagement for Infinite is abnormally low for a live service-game at the beginning of its multi-year journey, especially for a franchise as big as this. The game plays great, so what’s the problem? I spoke to a number of different streamers and content creators to get their point of view.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My brain is slightly breaking with the news that: 1) a new Monkey Island game is coming; 2) it's led by Ron Gilbert, the designer of the first two piratical comedy adventure games; and 3) it's a direct sequel to Monkey Island 2, a game which already has a sequel. Remarkable news. Come watch the trailer announcing Return To Monkey Island.

I'm all for other people making their own original spin on that monster-taming formula. Coromon, out now on Steam, looks like it might be less a spin on those older 2D Pokémon games than a straight homage, however.

Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Sheldon Whitehouse, and Cory Booke raised this in a joint letter to the FTC chair yesterday. Considering that Actiblizz are facing many, many, many accusations of discriminatory and abusive working conditions, and that the CEO who reportedly intervened to protect one alleged harasser is still happily with the company, they're worried that the merger might make things worse.

There’s nothing particularly remarkable about that - I’ve encountered the same thing dozens of times in games - but what comes after is a real doozy.
Not content simply with nudging the fella into giving in to his worst impulses, I then proceeded to persuade him to wipe the very memory of his nemesis from the galaxy, up to and including hunting down his friends and family members. Bastilla Shan, noted Jedi do-gooder, pointed out that neither she nor the Jedi council would approve. I was giggling like a schoolgirl.

By comparison, April 2022 almost seems a little light when it comes to new PC releases. Only one AAA blockbuster launching this month? How quaint. 


Still, this relatively quiet period finally gives indie games a chance to breathe again. There are a ton of super interesting, smaller titles launching on PC this month that I’m excited to share with you all today. From epic turn-based RPGs based on English mythology to offbeat walking simulators about free will, there’s something for everyone launching on PC this month.
