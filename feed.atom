        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[But it got people looking.
We know everyone is desperate for news on Nintendo's next hardware, but an audio company that's creating the AI-enhanced successor to GameShark (yes, really) company claiming to be releasing a product alongside the Switch 2's launch was not on our bingo cards this morning.
As noted in a press release sent out earlier today, and spotted by DigitalTrends, audio electronics company Altec Lansing bolding claimed that it would be officially launching Ai Shark, which is purported to be an AI-based version of those old cheat cartridges we all had back in the day, alongside the Nintendo Switch 2's launch in September 2024. The product was announced at CES 2024.

I’m just learning this now, but Felix the Cat is turning 105 this year. The character got his start in the golden age of animation back in 1919, starring in some silent shorts. Like most popular characters from the time period, he kept coming back repeatedly for new TV series and movies, even if he wasn’t as high profile as Looney Tunes (Merry Melodies) and Mickey Mouse. Limited Run Games’ collection contains the 1992 NES title by Hudson Soft, and the 1993 Game Boy port.

This informal moniker has become one of the biggest question marks dangling over 2024.


Days into the new year, and even before the calendar flipped over, headlines with rumors, speculation, and discussion popped up everywhere. Where is the Nintendo Switch 2? What is it? When could it arrive?


It's really hard not to feel like we've been here before. I, myself, have done my fair share of reporting on and speculating about a new Switch. Before it was Switch 2, it was a Switch Pro. We're closing in on seven years of the Nintendo Switch, and fans are wondering where its successor is.

The news, tweeted by Max and Naughty Dog, is the third casting for the new season in the past few days. The first was Booksmart’s Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, and soon after, Beef's Young Mazino as Jesse.




Creators Neil Druckmann and showrunner/director Craig Mazin talked about Merced and Dina with Variety, saying "Dina is warm, brilliant, wild, funny, moral, dangerous, and instantly lovable. You can search forever for an actor who effortlessly embodies all of those things, or you can find Isabela Merced right away. We couldn’t be prouder to have her join our family."

Now, Ubisoft released frame rate and resolution details for the game last week, so the question was really going to be whether the finished project actually lived up to the promise. According to DF, it does.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are few things the internet is hungrier for than news about the Switch successor. With relative silence from Nintendo, folks have been left to grasp at straws and theorize what it will look like, how it will be played, and when it will be released. Today, thanks to Digital Trends, we might have an answer to that last question, and it came from a rather odd place.
Back in the day, GameShark was known for making cheat code cartridges in video games. You could plug it into your system, download cheat codes, and use them to become the master of games on your N64, PlayStation, or Game Boy. However, in recent years, the company has decided to take a turn in the direction of the company. Renamed "AI Shark," it's now a software-agnostic program designed to provide "personalized hints and assistance that keep up with fast-paced, competitive gaming." What does any of this have to do with the Switch 2? It's all in one sentence at the end of the first paragraph of their press release. 
"The official launch is planned to coincide with the Nintendo Switch 2 in September 2024."
To be clear, Nintendo has offered no official confirmation that this is an accurate launch window, and there are myriad reasons to doubt the validity of the claim. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reports that AI Shark is simply guessing at the Switch console's release date. Regardless, it is an odd statement to make in an official press release, and it will be very interesting to see Nintendo's response, assuming it issues one.

According to Gematsu, publisher Cygames and developer Cygames Osaka announced that a demo will be coming to both platforms tomorrow, January 12. In areas where it is already January 12, like New Zealand, the demo is available now.

3 Modes and a launch version reward


The demo will feature three different modes: Tutorial, Story, and Quest modes. In tutorial mode, players will be able to practice the basic controls of the game to get comfortable with Granblue Fantasy: Relink's ARPG combat system. Story mode will feature a brief section from the introduction part of Relink, showcasing a bit of the story. Last is Quest Mode, which includes three different quests. The quests are multiplayer-compatible allowing players to team up with 1-3 friends or AI-controlled allies in more challenging battles.


Alongside the three modes, the demo will also feature the ability to customize gear load-outs across 11 different playable characters.


Those who complete the Story and Quest modes of the demo will get some small bonuses in the release version at launch. It's always great when a demo adds some sort of bonus for playing it or even a save that carries over. It makes me much more interested in giving it a whirl when I know there's something to gain from doing so or that I won't have to do everything again.


Granblue Fantasy: Relink launches on January 31, 2024 on PC, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

The Prince of Persia series has a long and storied history going back decades, and I know none of it.

The Lost Crown uses exhilarating platforming, a deep combat loop, and more to create a new Metroidvania classic.

After both considering my time with this game and the rich history the series has enjoyed until now, I had to remind myself why that is.


Jordan Mechner's original Prince of Persia pioneered the cinematic platformer genre back in 1989, and Ubisoft's Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time was a critical darling back in 2003. There's so much potential to draw from between those entries, yet regardless, the series floundered. The last entry in the series, The Forgotten Sands, didn't exactly light the world on fire. And while the Sands of Time movie was well received at the time (except by Destructoid), it didn't seem to have any cultura…]]></summary>

It's less great news for the millions hankering for the slightest whisper of new information about Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We see you, Halo. Season 2 of Paramount Plus' video game adaptation received its official trailer today and looks, dare I say, promising.




Earlier in December, Halo season 2 got a small teaser, which uses some of the shots in the trailer. Alongside the reveal was its release date, February 8th, and a YouTube release of the first season. 


According to the YouTube description, in Halo season 2, "Master Chief John-117 leads his team of elite Spartans against the alien threat known as the Covenant. As humanity’s best hope for winning the war, John-117 discovers his deep connection to a mysterious alien structure that holds the key to humankind’s salvation, or its destruction — the Halo."


Hello Halo, it's good to see you again

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a shame Arkane Studios' Ravenholm was cancelled. That would have definitely filled the large Half-Life hole us fans have felt for some time. However, a modding team has been on the case with a custom story that lets us experience the creepy mining town some more.


From the people that brought us the Raising the Bar project – an overhaul of Half-Life 2 that breathes new life into the iconic FPS – comes Raising the Bar: Salvation. In this mod, we fill the shoes of Father Grigori, the pastor of Ravenholm who watches over Gordon Freeman in the official game, as he continues his story.




We get to trek back through the abandoned location, in which the devout man intends to burn the entire place down. You can download the mod here. The above video says you'll also need to install the Division 2.1 file from the Raising the Bar: Redux mod in order for Salvation to work.


The holiest shotgun-wielder around


What makes this slightly intriguing is its approach to combat. The team has said that resources are a bit more scarce, and players will only have a limited amount of supplies. With just a shotgun, custom mines, and a Duke Nukem-style kick, it becomes more about picking one's battles.


Father Grigori was definitely one of the most interesting characters in Half-Life 2. While only in the one section of the game, and not always visible on-screen, his presence is often felt by the player, as gunfire and manic laughs are heard in the distance.


He's part of what makes the Ravenholm chapter such a standout. While we may never know what happens to Gordon Freeman in any future Half-Life installments, Salvation at least fills in some of the side narrative. And isn't that just as important?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you miss the days of physical magazines packed with demo discs? Would you like to see it perverted in sinister ways? PC Cursed 98 will give you the whole experience you’ve been looking for, it's free, and it’s available for PC now.


PC Cursed 98 is a compilation of short indie games in the framework of the sort of demo disc that came with magazines in the '90s and '00s. This makes it adjacent to Haunted PS1 and its variety of PS1-styled cursed demo discs. What makes PC Cursed 98 a bit different is that it comes packed with an actual magazine. I’m not even talking about a short pamphlet, either. It’s 52 pages of articles and twisted advertisements. That’s commitment. It’s even set up in such a way that you can have it professionally printed out. On top of that, there are even covers for a CD case for the demo disc.




The (free) demo disc contains 21-ish shortform horror games from a slew of creators. From the list, I only really recognize Jacob Jazz, who made the Baobabs Mausoleum games. But that’s kind of the point of these compilations: you get a glimpse into the minds of a variety of small, indie developers. Maybe you’ll like what you see and will form a brand-new parasocial relationship with them!


The games are supposedly all horror-themed, but their style runs the gamut between lo-fi, jank pop, and retro-inspired. Typically, for these jams, a lot of the included games are very experimental. As such, some of them fail. Others might make you wish you could unsee them. But a few may echo in the darkest recesses of your soul. It’s worth a look. Jam games, I guess you could call them.


PC Cursed 98 is now available for PC through itch.io. It’s free, so it probably doesn’t hurt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Nvidia and AMD duke it out to be supreme GPU champion in the PC gaming world, Intel is also here. Just smiling and waving. The chip firm entered the GPU arena back in 2022, and now it's a little closer to completing the next iteration of its Arc brand.


In an interview with PC World (as spotted by PC Gamer) at CES 2024, Intel Fellow Tom Petersen said that Arc Battlemage (the follow-up to Alchemist) "is coming." Around 30% of engineers are working on the GPU right now, "mostly on the software side." Ideally, this all wraps up before CES in January 2025.




On top of this, the hardware portion of the team is now moving onto Celestial, the next graphics card from Intel. Petersen says Battlemage has "already had its first silicon in the lab," and "more good news is coming."


A story arc that perhaps needs to pick up


As for when we can expect the next line of Arc GPUs, Petersen is unable – or unwilling – to go into details, but is hopeful we may get to see something at next year's CES event. That's not a given, but it might give some indication of perhaps when it could be released. That's all just pure speculation, for now.


Intel doesn't seem to have quite found its feet in the dedicated graphics card industry. With Nvidia and AMD flexing every muscle they have, Team Blue seems to be trailing behind. This could be because the Alchemist experienced delays, but it could be because the other two have just been in the game for much longer.


However, the upcoming Claw device from MSI is being powered by Intel hardware, including an Arch chip, so that's something. This time next year, things might be different, but it sounds like progress on Battlemage is coming along.

You can read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review by following the link, but that review pertains to the console version of the game and does not address a question many players have: how is Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown on Switch?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Fresh Prince returns.
Way back in 1989, Jordan Mechner's original Prince of Persia represented one of the first and best examples of what's become known as the 'cinematic platformer'. It's a traditionally challenging genre, one that combines strong art, fun storylines, and fluidly animated protagonists to bring us adventures that test reflexes and puzzling abilities to their limits. You know the sort of thing, stuff like Flashback and Another World; y'know, the classics.
Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is the latest rebirth of sorts for the franchise — following on from The Sands of Time and 2008's Prince of Persia revamp — one that takes the established lore of past entries and ditches them in favour of a tangentially-related new lead character, and a bit of role-switching fun. Yes, this brand-new tale sees you play as Sargon, a member of The Immortals (crime-fighting hero types), and a man who meets all the criteria required of a bonafide action hero.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Prince Of Persia subtitles go, The Lost Crown is certainly an evocative one. It conjures up images of forgotten pasts being rediscovered, of wrongs being righted, and power being restored to its rightful balance. They're all promises that Ubisoft Montpellier capably deliver on over the course of its neatly plotted story, and often in more ways than one. But after flinging its hero warrior Sargon around the monster-filled streets of its Mount Qaf citadel for the better part of 20 hours, I'd also like to proffer the following alternatives: Pit Of A Thousand Spikes; The Eternal Death Wheels Of Spinning Blades; or maybe just simply Traps: The Game. These are perhaps more accurate descriptions of the challenges you'll face in The Lost Crown, as Mount Qaf is not a place you're allowed to tread lightly. Death stalks every corner, but that's precisely what makes this dextrously designed Metroid-like such a thrilling platformer. Put away your prejudices, because this is easily the equal of both Moon Studios' pair of Ori games, Hollow Knight and its Metroid genre namesakes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paramount+ released the first season of its live-action Halo series back in 2022 and while the initial premiere showed promise, the show was ultimately a letdown, both as the Chief's first foray into the live-action television space and as a Halo story. Now, the subscription streaming service has released the official trailer for Season 2 of Halo: The Series and it promises the fall of Reach, plenty of Covenant and Energy Swords, and more of Master Chief without his helmet on for some reason. 
I'm not completely sold on returning to this series – I didn't even finish the first season – but I'd be lying if I said this trailer didn't pique my interest. Perhaps I'm a sucker for the staples of Halo and the story of Reach, or maybe I have a terrible memory; perhaps it's a combination of both. 
Check out the Season 2 trailer for Halo: The Series for yourself below: 


Paramount+ renewed Halo: The Series for a second season early in the show's first season, so it's clear the streamer is committed to this property for now. Here's hoping the second season fairs better than the first. 
For more, read about Halo: The Series' showrunner's decision to show Master Chief's face in the show, and then read Game Informer's Halo Infinite review. After that, check out this story about how Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries will develop Halo games "now and in the future" even after layoffs that happened at the studio last year.

That’s if a Canadian store listing is to be believed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I reached the Elden Ring exhaustion point a couple of years ago… and I still don't think I've climbed out of my slump. Yes, I gave the game a Bestest Best badge that I stand by, but I also think it's one of FromSoftware's most taxing soulslike creations. It's so colossal that, by the end of my adventure, I'd had enough of the umpteenth boss. I wanted rid.
With talk of Elden Ring's Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC spinning up as 2024 begins, I've assessed my feelings and come to the conclusion that I'm not as excited as I would've been had the game and its DLC somehow existed a few years ago. To be honest with you, part of me hopes it just ends up being a roguelike. That way I might actually get into it.

Following its initial announcment in 2023, Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal has been confirmed to launch on Nintendo Switch later this month on January 25th, 2024.
The revamped re-release came to mobile platforms in November 2023 and boasted new features such as a mini-map and tailored touchscreen controls. The biggest addition came with Instinct Mode, an ability featured in later entries that would allow the player to seamlessly highlight targets, enemies, and points of interest. New features present in the Switch release can be toggled off if you want to experience Blood Money in its original form.

The weird bit, though, is that there's an unmentioned third weapon being shown off, too.


The weapon in question is relatively easy to spot in the official announcement's featured image; in fact, though it's easy to overlook it when it's being held by a character clad in neon purple. Specifically, it's FN Herstal's classic bullpup assault rifle: the F2000. This wouldn't necessarily be worth mentioning, had F2000 been referenced in the body of the text at all. Instead, the two newly confirmed weapons coming as part of January 17's Season 1 Reloaded patch are the HRM-9 SMG and the TAQ Evolvere LMG (Beretta PMX and FN Evol…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having sold millions of copies of the Phantom Liberty DLC since it was released in September, Cyberpunk 2077 is on a roll. Well, not quite, as developer CD Projekt Red is now turning its attention to the follow-up, with the game's narrative director eager to get started.


According to a recent Twitter post from CDPR's own Igor Sarzyński, Cyberpunk 2077 was "just a warm-up," and the studio is now preparing to "officially kick-start our Orion journey." Orion is the working title for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel.




The team working on the next entry began its first day in the new Boston office earlier this week. Sarzyński has said they're "excited for this project," while one person (who weirdly dubs themselves Abraham Lincoln on Twitter) asks whether they've been practicing their Boston access. Sarzyński replies: "I'm trying!"


Imagine Cyberpunk and Good Will Hunting in one


Towards the end of last year, CD Projekt Red unleashed one last big update for Cyberpunk 2077. For real, this time. The developer is now seemingly leaping into 2024 with hopes for the future.


We don't really know anything about the upcoming game, but it's fair to say the studio will have learned some much-needed lessons from when the current game dropped like a hot mess back at the tail end of 2020.


Things have certainly improved since then – to the point where it was one of the top-grossing Steam releases of 2023 – but it's a memory that burns deep for some. As CDPR begins to make progress on the follow-up, we can only hope Sarzyński and the rest of the team knock this one out of the park the first time around.

The post Cyberpunk 2077 was ‘just a warm-up’ CDPR says, as work begins on sequel appeared first on Destructoid.]]></summary>

"When a local farm in Patchwork, MT is attacked by a group of notorious bandits, Sheriff Sam Judge sets out to bring them to justice by any means necessary and save the hostage they have taken," the teaser's YouTube description reads. "But on his journey, through the mysterious motives of those he pursues, Sam finds himself transported to another world overrun with prehistoric creatures and dinosaurs and must fight for his life to make it back to earth."

Oh gosh, talk around the 'Switch 2' is really starting to gain momentum now. It's only natural that so-called leaks and whispers will increase rapidly as we inch to an inevitable official announcement from Nintendo, whenever that will be. It can be tough to determine what's legitimate and what's not, and for every story we run here on NL concerning credible hardware rumours, there are five others we sidestep due to chronic eye-roll and big hmm.
A recent report from a Taiwanese Economic Forum (via Reddit) has suggested that the Switch 2 will come boasting a 120hz screen, NVIDIA’s T239 processor, and improved battery life. On the flip side, it also states that the console's RAM will be limited to 8GB, while the internal storage will only be a meagre 64GB.

Categories that Insomniac's superhero game is in include Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievement in Animation, and Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design, to name a few. Alan Wake 2 trails not too far behind with eight nominations.


Remedy's survival horror has managed to catch the eyes of critics thanks to its metastory, use of music, and phenomenal ensemble of characters. It has been nominated for Game of the Year as well, but it also picks up nominations in the Outstanding Achievement in Story category and Outstanding Achievement in Character category which gives Saga Anderson a nod.

Unlike The Game Awards, which are hosted and produced by Geoff Keighley, with votes from media outlets and the public in some instances, the D.I.C.E Awards are voted on exclusively by game developers. 
Basically, it's the awards show where the people who made the games you played last year determine their favorite games of last year. It's an awards show of The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, with D.I.C.E standing for Design, Innovate, Communicate, and Entertain, and amongst the awards, the academy typically inducts someone into the Academy of Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame – we spoke to Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon about it in 2022.

        <updated>2024-01-11T13:01:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A retailer listing of a "V2 DualSense" controller for the PlayStation 5 has been spotted online, and it boasts an "exceptional" 12-hour battery life. That's a much longer battery life than the standard version of the DualSense controller, which averages between 6 to 10 hours (and many players would argue less). 
More specifically, players spotted a Best Buy Canada retail listing for a "PlayStation 5 V2 DualSense Wireless Controller – White," as reported by Eurogamer. Curiously, this V2 DualSense controller looks identical to the white ones that launched with the PS5. But in the "About This Product" section of the controller, you'll find, "Exceptional 12-hour battery life, on a full charge, supports long gaming sessions." This section also states the controller includes a DualSense charging station that "offers easy click-in charging." 
Game Informer has reached out to PlayStation to ask about this controller and whether or not it's real, and will update this story if it learns more. 
If you're interested in a controller upgrade you can make right now, check out the PS5 DualSense Edge. And if you've ever wondered what it might be like to have a DualSense controller cut in half with a screen placed between the two halves, check out the PlayStation Portal.

Netflix is cranking out new seasons of Sonic Prime seemingly faster than the 'Blue Blur' himself, with Season 3 now available to watch in its entirety.
It doesn't seem that long that we were first reporting on the animated show and speculating what it would all be about, but now the story is kicking into high gear with Sonic going head-to-head against an alternate reality version of Tails called 'Nine'. In fact, he even brings on some unlikely alliances in this new series to ensure the protection of the 'Shatterverse'.

If you're a fan of classic survival horror, then you're in luck. Publisher Top Hat Studios, Inc., and developer Casper Croes have announced that Alisa Developer's Cut will be making its way to the Nintendo Switch on February 6th, 2024.
Originally released on Steam back in 2021, the game is an homage to retro survival horror games like Alone in the Dark and Resident Evil, showcasing pre-rendered backgrounds, fixed camera angles, and tank controls (though this new release will let you toggle to a modern control scheme, if you wish). The visuals are presented in authentic 480p resolution with the ability to render in 240p currently being investigated.

It was a fizzing neon labyrinth that was both home to various evil snakes and sort of made of snakes in probably-Freudian ways.
Fortunately, I had a lucid dreaming strategy for escaping from Snake World: relax all my limbs as much as I could, then flail around violently to wake myself up. It doesn't look like this will be an effective gambit in Digested, a bodycam horror game about being stuck on a barren, thinly forested and possibly irradiated island with a giant snake. Your tactical options seem to consist mostly here of running away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shmup fans are gonna be eating good this year, because Red Art Games kicked off its first Shmup Week event with two announcements. Both Bullet Hell Collection: Volume 1 and Jets'n'Guns Complete Collection are set to launch on Switch sometime in Q3 2024.


Bullet Hell Collection: Volume 1 includes Void Gore, Project Starship, and Z-WARP, all of which are on screen-filling display in the announcement trailer below.




In addition to the standard physical release, the first Bullet Hell Collection will be available in a Deluxe Edition that packs the games with one of three keychains, a poster, and reversible cover art. 




True to its title, Jets'n'Guns Complete Collection includes both Jets'n'Guns games by developer Rake in Grass (Rampage Knights, Silent Sector). Those who opt for all the bonuses will get the game along with a keychain, reversible cover, and a CD containing Machinae Supremacy's original soundtrack. Like the standard versions, the Deluxe Editions of both games are priced at €39.99, but these are exclusively up for pre-order at the Red Art Games website. 


Here's a look at both games in action:




Beyond that, it sounds like Shmup Week has some more surprises waiting in the wings. Red Art Games teased an announcement "coming straight from Japan" for Thursday, January 11 at 5:00 p.m. CET. There's also the previously-delayed Shinorubi, which finally locked in a January 12 launch date from Red Art Games last month. That's right around the corner digitally with a physical Switch release to follow at a later date.

Sony is highlighting Tiny Tina's Wonderlands as a stand-out this month. It's a spin-off from Gearbox's renowned Borderlands series. This time around, the looter-shooter leans into the tabletop inspirations set forth by past content like Borderlands 2's Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep. Chris Carter reviewed it at launch in March of 2022 and considered it "great". 




Resident Evil 2 (also coming to Game Pass) is the second headliner this month. Capcom's "superb" remake of the iconic horror sequel wow-ed when it was released in 2019. I'd strongly recommend it if you've yet …]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/portal-64-and-team-fortress-source-2-fan-projects-shut-down-after-valve-dmca/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=portal-64-and-team-fortress-source-2-fan-projects-shut-down-after-valve-dmca"/>
        <updated>2024-01-10T20:09:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amper Software, the team behind Team Fortress: Source 2, and James Lambert, the dev working on Portal 64, have stated that they’re ending development of their fan projects following cease and desist demands from Valve.


Team Fortress: Source 2 was a fan project aiming to port Valve’s 2007 multiplayer shooter, Team Fortress 2, over to the newer Source 2 engine. While the team had paused development in September, they were hoping to resume at some point, but the DMCA has made that pause permanent.


Meanwhile, Portal 64 is a project intended to demake 2007’s Portal to run on the Nintendo 64 hardware. Just a few days ago, the developer was celebrating the release of the game’s “First Slice,” which demonstrated the game's progress.


The Team Fortress: Source 2 takedown seems rather understandable since Valve still supports Team Fortress 2 and may one day want to port it or create a sequel themselves. The DMCA posted on the public GitHub page cites that their reasons are due to Valve’s own assets being used in a project, though that hasn’t stopped some other fan games based on their properties from being published and even sold on Steam.


Meanwhile, James Lambert says that Valve has stated that they’ve requested Portal 64 to be taken down because “the project depends on Nintendo’s proprietary libraries.”


This is somewhat surprising since Valve has long supported fan endeavors based on their games, going as far as allowing them to be sold as retail products on Steam. Either this demonstrates a shift in the company’s policy toward such projects, or they actually have reasonable concerns toward these particular projects. Either way, it’s not a great look directly after their announced shift on their storefront policies in regards to AI.

The latest Suika-like is stepping things up another level by taking its chill combo-a-thon to a galactic scale with colliding planets and suns.

While that release date certainly fits with the quarterly seasons Blizzard wants to stick to with Diablo 4 , we've still yet to get many details for a season that's just around the corner.

What we know about Diablo 4 Season 3


A few days ago Diablo Community Developer Director Adam Fletcher indicated on Twitter that a new details on Season 3 will be shared in an upcoming Campfire Chat. Usually by now we at least know the overall theme and title of the season, such as Season of the Malignant or Season of Blood. But for now, all we know are a few new features coming to Season 3.


Since the release of Diablo 4, Season 3 has been the goal for when Leaderboards would be added to the ARPG. At BlizzCon 2023 a couple of months ago, Blizzard confirmed they would still be coming in Season 3. Other features teased at BlizzCon included a weekly challenge dungeon called The Gauntlet and something called the Hall of Ancients.


However, we've got absolutely no new information regarding the theme of Season 3 or its new mechanics, which is often what a new season is all about. Leaderboards will be great but more importantly, the season has to introduce some new features and mechanics that will convince me to go through the time-consuming process of leveling a character for the fourth time. With the new season coming in less than two weeks, surely we can expect more details soon.


Diablo 4 Season 3 starts on January 23.

        <updated>2024-01-10T18:19:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Naughty Dog and HBO have cast Young Mazino as Jesse for The Last of Us' second season. This follows yesterday's news that Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart, No One Will Save You) will play Abby in the show's second season. 
For the uninitiated, Jesse is one of the characters that Ellie calls a friend in The Last of Us Part II and without spoiling anything, his character goes on quite the journey in the name of friendship. Manzino starred in Netflix's Beef series that aired last year, and he was featured in the music video for "Snooze" by SZA. Other credits include Prodigal Son, Drama High, Trinity's Triump, and Good Boy. 
We're so excited for Young Mazino to step into the shoes of Jesse in @TheLastOfUsHBO Season 2. 🎉 https://t.co/GurthEHRZU
January 10, 2024
Fans of Naughty Dog's Last of Us series on PlayStation eagerly await the second season of HBO's The Last of Us. The first season debuted in January of last year, covering the events of the first game and its Left Behind DLC. HBO quickly confirmed the show would be getting a second season, which is set to premiere next year.
We loved the first season and can't wait to see how it adapts The Last of Us Part II, which is getting remastered later this month. It seems we aren't alone either – The Last of Us' premiere was HBO's second-largest debut since 2010, and viewers stuck around for the entire season. 
The first season of The Last of Us has already won eight Emmy awards, and there are still other Emmys the series is up for when the last night of the awards show airs next week. For more, read Game Informer's review of The Last of Us and then read Game Informer's review of The Last of Us Part II.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The graphics card wars seem to be kicking off again. Not only is AMD releasing the Radeon RX 7600 XT, but Nvidia recently announced three RTX 4000 series SUPER GPUs. Now, Team Green is trying to gain a slight advantage by offering a chance to win one of said cards.


You all know how this works by now. As outlined in a recent post on Twitter, if you want to be in with a chance of getting hold of an RTX 4080 SUPER (the Founder Edition specifically), you'll need to comment with the relevant hashtag and like the Nvidia post.




Oh, also, it's been signed by company CEO Jensen Huang. So...that's a little something extra, I guess? The actual graphics card itself is due to release January 31, so Nvidia is evidently drumming up interest in this new variant of one of its most powerful Ada Lovelace products.


Or alternatively...


This competition comes as part of the tech giant's appearance at CES 2024. As a result, if you happen to be at the event, you'll have an additional chance at winning the new 4080. A post on the Nvidia website says the winner of the signed GPU will also receive $500 in Steam gift cards.


The sweepstakes runs between now and 5 pm PT on January 12, so you only have a couple of days to enter. Remember, if you're at CES 2024, you can enter via Twitter and by visiting one of the event's select booths.


The winners will be announced on February 29. Check the official rules for more details on how to enter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 1992 Alone in the Dark served as major inspiration to the original Resident Evil, which received a sequel, which was successfully remade as a third-person shooter 20 years later, which in turn has presumably inspired Alone in the Dark's upcoming remake, which is releasing March 2024. It's a complicated ouroboros, but the good news is it gives us a chance to revisit arguably the original survival horror game in a brand new light with the aid of Hollywood actors.
Join Wesley LeBlanc and me as we play though an early portion of the game and share their thoughts on how this could finally represent Alone in the Dark's chance to shine. For more on the Alone in the Dark remake, head here for a big preview.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans with fond memories of gaming in the '90s (i.e. me) rejoice, as soon you'll be able to play classic Sega Genesis games on the go. If you always wondered what it would be like to play Cool Spot on a train or ToeJam & Earl while in a post office queue, well wonder no more.


As reported by The Verge, a company called Hyperkin – a specialist in console hardware and accessories – is working on a portable Sega Genesis device. Dubbed the Mega 95, the system is said to be compatible with the original cartridges.


Image via The Verge.


The report goes on to say that it'll feature a five-inch screen, the ability to switch between 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios, up to 10 hours of battery life, and there's even a USB-C dock so it can be hooked up to a TV.


Or Sonic the Hedgehog on an actual green hill


Taking a look at the images, we can see the Mega 95 dock has two controller ports, which resemble the serial connections from the OG Genesis (which we called the Mega Drive, here in the UK).


The fact that it's meant to support the official cartridges will be a huge selling point from a nostalgia point of view. This means it's probably not going to be using emulation, so you'll get to relive the classics as they were intended, such as Streets of Rage 2, which we all know is the greatest game ever made (I will fight you over this).


At the moment, there's no release date for the device. Nor is there a price. However, it is another means by which we can play our games on the go. Especially for those of us who miss the glory days of Sega, iconic Saturday morning cartoons, and highly flammable shell suits. God, I hate being old.

Mojang has announced that support for Minecraft Legends, the RTS spin-off of the open-world block-building phenomenon, is ending after less than a year.
In a post shared on the official Minecraft website, senior creative writer Cristina Anderca shares details on the now "final" Lost Legends update, Snow vs Snouts. But later on in the post, the writer details just what's happening with Minecraft Legends in the future, stating that the team at Blackbird Interactive is going to be taking "a step back from development."

Developer Turn 10 has since pulled up its sleeves in the interim, delivering a series of solid updates over the last few months, but the best is yet to come.


At the very least, that's what Turn 10 itself claims in its latest development roundup. The studio is planning major revisions to three areas of Forza Motorsport's gameplay: the car progression system, AI, and race regulations. These should be getting revamped "in the coming months," though the extent of the changes isn't clear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Turning 20 this year, Half-Life 2 is held aloft as one of the greatest first-person shooters ever made. While the 2004 game still holds up visually, a team of modders has been hard at work giving Valve's classic a bit of a spit-shine.


At CES 2024, the Half-Life 2 RTX Remix project released a new trailer, showing the work that's so far gone into the Nvidia-powered graphical improvement. In this instance, we get to see what Ravenholm looks like in all its shiny glory.




It's an impressive mod, with the comparisons in the video showing the difference between the OG game and the RTX remix. We get a glimpse of all that lovely ray tracing, DLSS 3.5 image upscaling, and remastered assets. Ooh...ahh, etc.


Such moody lighting


Ravenholm is one of the most notorious sections in Half-Life 2. Something of a gear shift, this part of the story turns the game into a creepy horror that takes place in an abandoned mining town. It's where we meet Father Grigori and also get to see the destructive power of the gravity gun when you add in a rusty saw blade.


As for when the RTX project will be available, there doesn't seem to be a release date yet. However, according to the Nvidia website, the open beta for the RTX Remix toolkit begins January 22. Maybe that's when we'll get to play it, or at least get an update on when this boosted version of HL2 will be available.


In the meantime, there's Portal RTX to check out if you want to go "ooh" and "ahh" at a different Valve game for a bit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a nasty 2023 for games industry labor, 2024 is off to a similar start. We already saw significant layoffs at Twitch last year, and now there's even more grim news ahead, as the Amazon-owned platform is letting 35% of its staff go.



A recent report from Bloomberg says Twitch is due to lose around 500 of its workforce. This news was originally sourced from people who are "familiar with the plans."


Since this report, the company has issued a statement about the layoffs. A recent blog post acknowledges the "difficult decision" Twitch had to make, in which there will be a reduction in the "size of our workforce." It also confirms the number of job losses will be 500.


Adding to this, CEO Dan Clancy says there will be a livestream going ahead on Thursday, January 11 at 1 pm PT for those who have questions. There's also a section that addresses those who feel the decision will affect their role. Those who are not affected will still be sent an email from Clancy.




When will it end?


This also comes just shortly after Unity announced it was laying off 25% of its staff, which accounts for around 1,800 jobs. Indeed, this latest developer from Twitch could set another precedent – carrying on from 2023 – in terms of job uncertainty in the video game and adjacent industries.


We already experienced a ton of job losses last year, with thousands of employees being let go from otherwise lucrative development houses and publishers. Worse still, entire studios – such as TimeSplitters outlet Free Radical Design – had their doors closed for good.



We're only into the second week of the new year, and things are not looking good for those employed in video games. This is all in spite of the fact that the industry at large saw rising profits in 2023, according to data from Statista. 


Hopefully, there'll be something on the horizon quickly for the hundreds at Twitch that are affected by the decision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super... duper... erm...
For a while now, we (and, we presume, many of you) have been referring to Nintendo’s inevitable Switch successor as the ‘Switch 2.’ It makes sense for now, right? After all, rumours, speculation, and educated guesses are all loosely pointing to the new console being an iterative evolution of the hybrid concept that we’ve all come to know and love. If Nintendo were likely to deviate (and make no mistake, there’s no telling exactly what the firm is truly up to), we’d likely just stick with ‘the new console’ or ‘Nintendo’s next-gen system.’ For simplicity, and until we know otherwise, 'Switch 2' will do.
Assuming that it will be the iterative evolution that we’re all hoping for, though, what will it actually be called? As a brand, the Switch is undoubtedly one of the most instantly recognised and understood names in the company's history (certainly more so than ‘Wii U’, anyway), so it’s reasonable to assume that Nintendo probably won’t ditch the Switch branding.

A cooperative objective-based shooter with a legacy to die for, Helldivers 2 won't even be all that hard on our PCs, according to Sony.


As per Sony's latest Helldivers 2 blog post, the game should be relatively easy to run on a very wide range of PC hardware. Thanks to its multiplayer focus and potentially some live-service leanings, Helldivers 2 will be released on PC and PS5 simultaneously with full cross-play support. Since Sony will be trying to build as big of a Helldivers 2 community as possible on February 8, the day of its release, it does make sense that the game wouldn't target excessively strong hardware to begin with.

Unity is expected to lay off 1800 people by the end of March and once complete, it will be the company's largest round of layoffs ever. It will be its fourth round of layoffs since July 2022, as noted by Yahoo! Finance. The job cuts are expected to affect all departments at Unity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the festively grim universe of Warhammer 40,000, space is sometimes racked by Warp storms – terrible cyclones of Chaos energy that have a catastrophic effect on imperial communications. One such storm hits the Koronus Expanse during the events of Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, erasing starcharts and obliging your character - a newly minted Rogue Trader, aka High Gothic Commander Shepard - to re-discover the systems and planets that make up your predecessor Theodora’s dominions, while gathering an entourage of indecently customisable warriors, and hunting down a series of badniks that include a mysterious Chaos cult. 


Warp storms sometimes have relativistic consequences. Voidship crews may be stranded for decades in transit: you will meet characters in this vast, brooding RPG who arrived at their destinations to find the battles they were sent to fight already passed into legend, the people they were sent to meet long since dead or departed. Something similar has happened to this review, which was supposed to be published in early December. Did I dramatically underestimate the amount of playtime involved, despite being told months in advance by developers Owlcat that Rogue Trader is well over 100 hours long? Nonsense. It’s all because of those pesky Chaos disruptions, you see. It’s Chaos that’s to blame.

Unfortunately, it seems this heartbreaking trend is continuing into this new year as yesterday, Bloomberg reported that Amazon-owned streaming company Twitch is set to lay off 500 employees, or about 35 percent of its staff. 
These layoffs follow two rounds of layoffs Twitch experienced last year. Bloomberg expects the layoffs to be announced today. As for why, the publication says running Twitch is extremely expensive and the company has struggled to financially get on top of the cost to support billions of hours of livestreamed content.

Reasons why included a desire for better wages, increased safety precautions, and protections around exploitative uses of artificial intelligence. Now, just a few months later, SAG-AFTRA has signed an agreement with Replica Studios, an A.I. voice technology company, to allow game developers to use A.I. voices, as reported by Game Developer. 
Various video game voice actors, like Yong Yea, the new English voice of Kazuma Kiryu in the Like a Dragon series, have publicly stated that they and other actors they know were not aware of this. "Every voice actor I know not only didn't approve this," Yea writes in a tweet. "[They] pretty much heard about this for the first time today on Twitter."

The game's user reviews are Mostly Negative, three months after release, with complaints covering a wide gamut: the online being full of cheaters, the single player being boring, and the game being poorly optimised for PC.

Here's a little fact that made us choke on our Cornflakes this morning, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D is old. Okay, maybe not old-old, but older than the original N64 release was back in 2011.
Yes, the time between today (10th January 2024) and the release of OOT 3D (16th June 2011) is now one day longer than the time between the N64 original (21st November 1998 in Japan) and the 3DS remake. Or, as @SapphireSenatrx nicely worded it on Twitter, "Ocarina of Time 3D is now as old as Ocarina of Time was when they made Ocarina of Time 3D".

Nintendo shares have hit a record high of 7,823 yen (roughly $54.14) as of Wednesday, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.
While increasing steadily over the last year or so, shares have recently spiked with WSJ citing 'solid earnings' and the expectation of new hardware from the firm to succeed the current Nintendo Switch. It's no secret that fans have been clamouring for what we're affectionately referring to as the 'Switch 2', and the general expectation is that Nintendo will finally reveal its upcoming plans at some point this year.

Players of the action-RPG/management hybrid on social media quickly did what people on social media do: demanded that they add sex. 

Its developers said they would and now we get to see what that means when the update launches on January 16th.

        <updated>2024-01-09T21:45:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Portal 2 was released in 2011 to widespread acclaim. Now, 22 years later, there’s a free fan-made mod called Portal: Revolution that perfectly re-captures the joy of the game, albeit with the sad omission of a much-loved character.


Released on January 6 2024, Portal: Revolution—developed by Second Face Software—has received positive reviews on Steam. Over 3,000 people have reviewed the mod at the time of this writing, and 94% of those are positive. 


One of the reviewers on Steam likened it to the scene in Ratatouille where the chef eats something made by the rat and has a flashback to a heartwarming childhood memory. They’re right, too.

The game add-on offers eight hours of exclusive gameplay, voice acting that perfectly captures the humor of the original game and challenging levels to work through. Promising to pick up in terms of difficulty where the original Portal 2 left off, there really is some challenge to work through.


Sadly, the add-on takes place after the demise of GLaDOS, so we’re without her dark sense of humor. But with so much on offer, we can’t hold that against the developers. 


As well as taking the difficulty of puzzles up a notch, the developers have also introduced some new elements to gameplay. There’s a new variant of laser cube and field that cleanses gel. Second Face Software have also resurrected a feature that was removed during development of the original Portal 2: "Pneumatic Diversity Vents."

Portal: Revolution is available now on Steam for free and you can play it as long as you have a copy of Portal 2 downloaded to your steam account.

        <updated>2024-01-09T20:30:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced at CES, Hyperkin has revealed the next in their line of retro Xbox controllers for modern hardware. This time around they’ll be recreating the form factor of the Xbox Controller S, which was the revision of the original Xbox’s rather beefy handpiece.


The original controller that shipped with the OG Xbox was rather divisive. It was rather bulky and rather unwieldy, even if you had big hands. This was apparently due to difficulties with the manufacturer of the controller’s PCB, but most players at the time only saw a giant controller where most of the facial real estate was taken up by a humungous logo. The controller was nicknamed “The Duke” (I actually remember hearing this moniker during the console’s lifespan) and was eventually replaced by the less massive Controller S. Apparently, some people have some love for the original monstrosity since Hyperkin recreated that one first, followed by the Xbox 360's controller.


Hyperkin’s new creation, cleverly named DuchesS, is made to work with PC and Xbox Series X|S. It has modern features like a share button and a headphone jack. Perhaps most importantly, it uses Hall Effect joysticks and analog triggers. The early images shared by Hyperkin show off white and black variations. Unfortunately, there hasn’t yet been a translucent “crystal” version announced.


I don’t have a tremendous amount of nostalgia for the Controller S, but I always love seeing retro controller recreations. I’ve certainly got enough based on the SNES and Genesis/Mega Drive lying around. I think if I had one wish for the controller, it would be that it could work with the OG Xbox. I always appreciate fancier controllers for old hardware.


There is no release date or price stated for the Hyperkin DuchesS.

What's so special about Brian Cox narrating Tekken?


Any recap would be more than welcome at this point. Some Tekken fans weren't even alive when the OG Tekken came out, and the plotline gets highly convoluted sometimes, but the extra layer of awesome here is the presence of Brian Cox.


So what about it? You might think this is yet another out-of-touch promo by a Hollywood actor whose only knowledge of the game comes from the teleprompter sitting right in front of him. Half of that is likely true, as I doubt Brian Cox knows what a Korean Backdash is, but he has a surprising …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 owners are one of the few who have yet to be able to get their hands on Sam Barlow's interactive movie title, Immortality. But their wait is finally over, as Immortality splices onto PS5 on January 23.


The news came within an announcement trailer from Barlow's Half Mermaid Productions. The trailer gives a brief idea of how the game's unique "match cut" feature works and teases the project's supernatural story.




Initially released for PC and Xbox Series X|S in August 2022, Immortality was met with glowing reviews from many outlets. Destructoid's Eric Van Allen classified it as "superb" in our review. 


Immortality's story revolves around the actress Marissa Marcel and the three films she starred in but were never released. The player uses behind-the-scene footage to jump between movies, matching shots of faces or objects to jump to a similar take in a different film. The more you interact with the game's clips, the more you begin to unravel and understand the title's dark and mysterious plot.


Outside of reviews, Immortality also cleaned up during award season. The project was nominated across numerous outlets for Best Performance, Best Story, Best Game Direction, and Best Game. Manon Gage, the lead actress who portrayed Marissa Marcel, came home with hardware at the 2022 Golden Joystick Awards for Best Performer. Gage also won the 2022 New York Game Award for Best Acting in a Game.


PlayStation 5 owners should be excited to have such a unique title become part of the console's catalog when Immortality launches on PlayStation 5 on January 23. Immortality is currently playable on PC, Xbox Series X|S, mobile, and Mac.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the Ryzen 9 5950X debuted in 2020, it was a staggeringly strong productivity and gaming CPU, with 16 cores and 32 threads of Zen 3 power for a princely £750. A little over three years later and next-gen Zen 4 CPUs are firmly here, but the 5950X remains the most powerful productivity CPU for the venerable AM4 platform. 
That makes the 5950X a tempting upgrade option for anyone using an older Ryzen processor that wants to keep using their existing motherboard and RAM, and today this CPU has breached a new low-water mark: £360 on Amazon UK, 52% off its original recommended retail price. (It's also a nearly-as-good 50% off at the US.)

Remedy's Alan Wake is joining Behaviour Interactive's Dead By Daylight as a playable Survivor, having been conjured from his writing desk by the latter game's villainous Entity.
Mind you, I'm a little unclear on the causality here. The press release includes a cheeky quote from a lost Alan Wake manuscript in which the perennially troubled horror author suggests that he is the creator of Dead By Daylight's universe, not Behaviour Interactive. "As I searched for a way out, memories of a script I wrote for Night Springs about a fog-engulfed place flooded back," it reads. "Surrounded by the same fog, I became a pawn - trapped. I must find a way out. Rewriting that script is key." Oh Alan. Have you tried laying off the coffee and going for a stroll, now and then?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kaitlyn Dever has been officially announced as The Last of Us TV adaptation's Abby. Kaitlyn Dever is perhaps best known for her role in 2019's Booksmart, but video game fans may know her best as the voice of Cassie Drake, seen at the end of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. Dever was also an early fan cast for the role of Ellie when casting rumors for The Last of Us TV show first began swirling. She also reportedly read for the role of Ellie before it ultimately went to Bella Ramsey.
We're thrilled that Kaitlyn Dever is joining @TheLastOfUsHBO Season 2 as Abby!
https://t.co/BZRimbXww6
January 9, 2024
Abby is a crucial character from The Last of Us Part II, but to say much more than that would spoil major elements of the plot that it's fair to assume many TV viewers are not yet aware of. How Dever will differentiate from the video game version of Abby, performed by Laura Bailey (who had a cameo in the first season of the show as a nurse), remains to be seen.
Despite the second season of the show likely not airing until 2025, The Last of Us has already had a strong 2024, raking in eight Emmy awards. For more, read Game Informer's review of The Last of Us and then read Game Informer's review of The Last of Us Part II.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has announced the return of its Xbox Developer Direct next Thursday, January 18. The presentation will provide updates on several of its most anticipated upcoming games.
The Developer Direct will air at 12 p.m. Pacific/3 p.m. Eastern. It will spotlight a few of Microsoft’s various first-party studios, which will provide an “in-depth look” at their games. Specifically, the Xbox Wire post lists Indiana Jones by Machine Games, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II by Ninja Theory, Avowed by Obsidian, and Ara: History Untold by Oxide Games as the highlighted projects. 
Indiana Jones will receive its first gameplay trailer and feature 10 minutes of gameplay with developer commentary revealing the game's story and setting. Avowed and Ara: History Untold will receive a deep dive into their gameplay as well. For Hellblade II, Xbox is touting a behind-the-scenes look at Ninja Theory's Cambridge studio where the team will provide insight into how its bringing the sequel to life. It's unclear if this will include any new gameplay footage.
Microsoft also states that Direct will not include any updates on games from Activision Blizzard but to expect more news from those teams later this year. Microsoft officially completed its acquisition of Activision last year. 
The Direct will run for one hour. Shortly after it concludes, ZeniMax Online will host The Elder Scrolls Online Global Reveal at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET.
Xbox has several big projects we haven’t seen in a while, so it’ll be nice to learn more about even some of them. Indiana Jones was announced in 2021 with only a teaser video and we’ve yet to see gameplay. Avowed, Obsidian’s first-person fantasy RPG, was revealed in 2020 and is slated to launch this year. The game’s latest trailer premiered at last year’s Game Awards. 
Ara: History Untold is a turn-based strategy RPG that debuted during a 2022 Xbox Showcase. Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II was the first Xbox Series X/S game announced back in 2019 and most recently popped up during the last Game Awards.]]></summary>

You, quite literally, need to plunge yourself into an entire city within a city to get from one place to another.
Surface from the chaos, though, and it can feel like quite the achievement. Small horror game The Exit 8 captures this sense of elation perfectly, as well as all the subtleties that come from navigating a crash of noise. I'd say it will make for an initially cursed start to your 2024 endeavours, with the promise of a big reward at the end if you can stomach it.

It used to be just those old-timey theatre productions that had them, but as in many other respects, videogames have nipped through a stage exit and stolen theatre's underpants. One act isn't the same as another, however: take the third act of Baldur's Gate 3, which many players feel isn't a patch, or indeed a hotfix changelog, on the thunderously well-received RPG's first two acts. According to senior RPG designer Anna Guxens, Larian have been following the reaction and are thinking about how they can handle the third act's "drastic" tone shift better in future releases. It's a timely observation, because in separate news, Larian's CEO Swen Vincke has posted that he's "figured out" the first act of Larian's next unannounced project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sam Barlow’s acclaimed interactive cinematic mystery game Immortality is making its way to PlayStation 5 on January 23. The game first arrived on Xbox Series X/S and PC in August 2022.
Like Barlow’s previous works, Her Story and Telling Lies, Immortality sees players interacting with live-action footage to solve the mystery behind the disappearance of fictional actress Marissa Marcel (Manon Gage). Once a promising young star, Marcel only made three movies – none of which were ever released – before she vanished. 
Learning what happened to Marcel involves searching out dozens of clips of each film’s behind-the-scenes footage, scrubbing them for clues, and finding related videos using the ability to “match cut.” This mechanic allows players to click on elements within a scene (like a person or object) to uncover new clips featuring that selected element. The PS5 version enhances these mechanics with new haptic feedback and controller speaker features.


Immortality’s unsettling atmosphere, inventive mechanics, and strong storytelling earned it a place on Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2022. Immortality is also available now on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and mobile devices via Netflix.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a good handful of years for fans of secret-ridden games. The sort of secrets that make the game world feel huge and unknowable and transform the post-game into a scavenger hunt more akin to ARGs than classic secret endings. After 2021’s meta deckbuilder Inscryption, and enigmatic Zeldalike Tunic a year later, 2023 brought us Cocoon. Set in a cryptic world of insect-like aliens and their impossible machines, Cocoon is a puzzle game all about mystery.
What best sells the mystery is a minority of puzzles that are so well-hidden, that a lot players might never know they exist. Those are the optional challenges that guard the way to Cocoon's secret ending. Any given player might stumble on one or two clues for those puzzles, before shrugging and finding their way back to the main story. But as the game goes on and the clues remain unresolved, those players will wonder what other secrets are hidden around them. I talked to Jeppe Carlsen and Edwin Kho from developer Geometric Interactive, to learn why those puzzles were made, and how it feels to watch a community track them down in real time.

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League exists at a strange intersection of gaming hype. On the one hand, obviously, we are and should be excited for Rocksteady's return to the Arkham Universe that it popularized through some of the greatest superhero games of all time. Obviously. But on the other hand, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League deviates from so many of the conventions that made Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight so beloved. And so many of those conventions that Kill the Justice League embraces – such as a team-based, co-op inf…]]></summary>

New open world RPG Archaelund, which launched in early access this week, and was brought to my attention by RPS supporter cpt_freakout, has something of that curious enchantment to it.
You'll explore its landscape in first-person, roving sandy plateaus and frontier towns that remind me of Morrowind, at times. Bump into a foe, however, and your first-person perspective undergoes a fission reaction, splitting into a full group of warriors who are controlled in top down.

In his time since serving as character designer and visual director on Final Fantasy VII, his legend has grown substantially. In addition to working on nearly every acclaimed Final Fantasy game since Nomura also helped create the Kingdom Hearts series and has become a figurehead and luminary within the stacked ranks of Square Enix's stable of developers. But this 2015 trip to Los Angeles, California, was different.
PlayStation's E3 2015 livestream had just revealed a teaser trailer featuring the iconic Final Fantasy VII protagonist, Cloud Strife, walking through Midgar in glorious, modern, HD graphics. The dream of so many – a remake of the classic RPG – was finally realized. The fans weren't the only ones feeling the weight …]]></summary>

It has maintained the top position almost every month for best-selling games in the U.S., too. Thanks to a new interview at Variety with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment president David Haddad, we now know Hogwarts Legacy has surpassed 22 million copies sold and it did so in less than a year. 
Haddad told Variety that Hogwarts Legacy crossed the 22 million mark at the end of 2023, picking up 2 million alone in December. He says it's the best-selling game of the year "in the entire industry worldwide." Typically, that title goes to a Call of Duty or other triple-A release.

Even Sony's PlayStation VR2 launch last year seemed to come and go with little fanfare (and even less support for the platform nearly a year later). However, tech giant Apple is making its own case for VR and it's doing so with the $3,500 Vision Pro headset launching next month. 
While we've known about the headset and its, frankly, absurd price since last year, today, the company announced that preorders for it will begin on Friday, January 19, with a launch on February 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the weekend, Square Enix revealed new information about Dawntrail, Final Fantasy XIV’s upcoming fifth expansion, during a fan event for the popular MMO. In addition to unveiling a lengthy cinematic trailer, fans got a look at one of the game’s two new jobs and its new playable race.
Meet the Pictomancer, a new class described as a “magical ranged DPS job that works in the medium of mixed aether, wielding a specialized brush to render their imaginings reality.” Basically, the Pictomancer is a painter wielding a giant magical brush that conjures spells using paint. Check it out in action in the trailer below:


A new cat-like race called the Hrothgar was also revealed in the form of a female variant. The trailer below provides a glimpse of the race out in the wild.


Lastly, the big video is a 5+ minute cinematic trailer showing off Dawntrail’s vibrant tropical setting, tone, and plenty of beautifully rendered action. 


Last year, Square Enix announced that Final Fantasy XIV is finally coming to Xbox Series X/S this spring. During the event, the studio revealed that an open beta test of the Xbox version begins sometime in February, giving players their first taste of the game before its arrival.
Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail is slated to launch later this summer. For more info, check out this primer breaking down everything you need to know about the expansion.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even with the rising power of integrated graphics, the prospects of getting high-quality, high-rez gaming capability in a laptop of ultrabook proportions is still years from becoming a feasible reality. Until then, slimmer gaming laptops like the HP Omen Transcend 16 remain the closest approximation of that dream, cramming discrete GPUs – the Nvidia Geforce RTX 4060, in this case – into lighter, narrower chassis designs.
The usual catch with such devices, sadly, is an overeagerness to appear aspirational. Which is, to be clear, the nicest thing I can say about a Razer Blade 16 costing £2500 for its own RTX 4060 model. Despite the name, however, the Omen Transcend 16 is much more down to earth – it still offers enough premium trappings to feel like a step up from chunkier laptops, but at its current pricing of £1199 / $1429, it’s a fair trade as well. And it supports Nvidia DLSS 3, dash of futureproofing tech that might just soothe any worries about buying a 2023-spec PC in 2024.

The transition from pixel art to fully animated computer graphics was a massive enough leap ahead, but the beauty of this classic title was much more than skin deep. Final Fantasy VII features an incredible cast of characters, an outstanding battle system, and a story that evokes joy, awe, anger, and grief. Final Fantasy VII is well-established as one of the most iconic and beloved video games of all time, but for Square Enix, the legacy is somewhat more important. 
For the team behind the Final Fantasy franchise, Final Fantasy VII was the entry that made the developers realize they needed to adapt to the times. "Even within the mainline Final Fantasy titles as a series, we can co…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the Christmas holidays, I had very good intentions to finally tackle some of the big games from 2023. I still haven't played Resident Evil 4, System Shock, very much of Baldur's Gate 3 or Assassin's Creed Mirage, and I really wanted to play a bit of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora. You know, just for a little look after the quite interesting preview I did back in October. Admittedly, I wasn't anywhere near my PC for at least one of the two weeks I had off, as I was away doing the inevitable family roulette of Christmas visiting. I also knew that, even if I had spent the whole time at home, there would be no way I'd finish or get through all of them. I knew I was sort of setting myself up to fail, but as I said. Good intentions. I did have my Steam Deck with me, after all, and even went to the trouble of loading it up with around 50 games, including some of those biggies that I have on Steam. 
What did I actually end up playing though? Teeny games. Six of 'em, which were all four to six hours long. And some of them I didn't even enjoy very much! Why? Why do I do this? In some respects I'm pleased I managed to clear a bit more of my backlog, but man alive, I always fall into exactly the same trap. I play the shorties, and always leave the biggies, like I'm allergic to anything over four hours - and I don't like it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has released the first teaser trailer for season 2 of its hit animated series, Arcane. The next chapter of the League of Legends adaptation is scheduled to premiere this November. 
Since it’s a teaser, the trailer doesn’t reveal much about what’s in store other than an ominous look at a sinister laboratory cooking up experiments that will likely pose a threat to Jinx and Co. We're curious to see how the series follows up Season 1's dramatic conclusion. Season 2's cast includes returning stars Hailee Steinfeld, Ella Purnell, Kevin Alejandro, and Katie Leung. Check out the teaser below:


Arcane has been critically acclaimed by both League of Legends fans and general viewers. Here’s hoping Netflix can keep that momentum rolling into Season 2 this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This past Christmas marked the anniversary of me playing Overwatch 2. 7 years of my partner and I swearing at seemingly impenetrable enemy teams, then whooping in victory when we finally pull together a plan that cracks them apart - or just as our chill W+M1 game while we chat about our days.
For the uninitiated, Overwatch is a bright, colorful, and very funny team v team FPS that ditches the dour gunmen for a cast that doesn’t all require raw aim skill. Spider-themed snipers and six-gun slinging cowboys share space with winged angelic healers and a talking gorilla with a Tesla cannon -  characters who reward positioning and timely ability usage just as much as one’s ability to click on heads. When the game went free to play and slapped a 2 on the end in 2022, it got a more muted reception, but the dev team have displayed a great willingness to experiment. In fact, there's never been a better time to give Overwatch 2 a go.

Microsoft have announced their plans to introduce a dedicated AI button to keyboards for Windows PCs, the first major change to their keyboards since the Windows key was added nearly 30 years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did we put the Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater and Silent Hill 2 remakes on that list of our most anticipated games of 2024? The article is so voluminous I’m not sure I have the energy to check. I get halfway down the page and feel like I need to pitch camp below one of the paragraph breaks, like a mountaineer sleeping beneath a crag in one of those dangling tents. Assuming we didn’t, both have been slated for 2024 release by the PlayStation blog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first week of January is always one of my favourite times of the year. It's a time for making plans, setting goals, thinking about all the cool new games I'll be playing over the next 12 months (while also looking nervously at the pile of games I missed over the last 12 months and placing them very, very gingerly on the teetering and totteringly tall pile of my backlog). And, of course, making some new year's resolutions. Traditionally, I don't often set myself too many resolutions - I always give myself a reading goal (35 books is what I'm aiming for this year), for example, but the rest I usually play pretty fast and loose with - more 'nice to haves' rather than 'musts', I'd say. 
This year, though, I do have a few gaming-related resolutions on my list, and in discussing them with the rest of the RPS Treehouse, it turns out we all have some games-themed goals this year. So I thought it would be fun to share them with you all below. And if you've also made some gaming resolutions for 2024, tell us about them in the comments. We can hold ourselves accountable together, like that big curtain of eldritch eyeballs up there in the header from good game Norco.

Happily, I was wrong: it did fine. Happilyer still, Mind Over Magic is here (though in early access) to provide a somewhat more traditional design, and it's already compelling enough to turn my quick test into a seven hour delve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I watched Studio Ghibli's latest film The Boy And The Heron the other day, having gone in basically blind. I knew it would be the case, but I left the cinema and said to my mate, "I don't really know what just happened but what happened was great". It was a lot of things! A visual feast. Surprisingly goofy. Unsettling. But above all, a challenge. We walked back to our cars and tried - my mate was thrilled to have identified who Dave Bautista likely voiced in the dub (we watched sub) - to unpack what we saw.
Since then, we've listened to podcasts, read interviews, and engaged in some back and forth. It's all brought me back to my uni days, where Dark Souls made me get my shovel out for the first time and mine the internet for meaning. Much like Souls, Ghibli's latest only expands as you reflect on it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Persona 3 Reload is right around the corner – it hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on February 2. If you've ever played a Persona game, you're likely familiar with the "opening movie," which is the awesome animated opening to the game set to what is typically the main theme song. Ahead of Persona 3 Reload's release next month, Atlus has released its opening movie, debuting a brand new track called "Full Moon Full Life." 
In it, we get a look at the main character and the rest of the cast, as well as Persona, Igor, and more. As you might expect, the opening movie retains the flashy and stylish animation Persona has become known for over the years, and no surprise, it looks great. Atlus notes the trailer contains violent and sensitive content, however, so be wary of that before pressing play. 
Check out the Persona 3 Reload opening movie for yourself below: 


For more about the game, check out Game Informer's hands-on preview of Persona 3 Reload and then read Game Informer's list of all upcoming video game remakes. After that, watch the newest episode of The Game Informer Show to find out why Persona 3 Reload is one of our most anticipated games of 2024.

        <updated>2024-01-05T10:51:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hideo Kojima's new Xbox Game Studios project OD is a horror game that is "also a movie, and at the same time a new form of media" and who knows, perhaps it also runs on solar power. That's the extremely direct and literal reading of Kojima's latest social media tease, in which he compares his latest endeavour to Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, an isometric vampire-hunting game for Game Boy Advance, which Kojima worked on while at Konami in the early noughties. Boktai stands apart to this day for making use of solar energy. There's a sun sensor built into the cartridge, which allows you to re-energise your weapon by using the console in sunlight, though this isn't outright necessary to prevail.
I doubt OD employs a similar peripheral, though a Steam Deck verified horror game that can only be played outdoors in pleasant weather would be an... interestingly contrary experience. But it's an opportunity, at least, to jump aboard one of my personal hobby horses and give you a scrappy rundown of older and recent games that employ similar functionality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Outcast was a PC-exclusive, 3D open-world action game that predated Grand Theft Auto III by two years. It was an innovative, well-regarded, but underplayed game about landing on an alien planet and trying to survive in the face of its dangerous fauna. A remake of that game, called Outcast: Second Contact, was released in 2017, but Outcast: A New Beginning is the long overdue, proper sequel to the cult classic.
Join Marcus Stewart and me as we check out what the game has to offer, which is primarily impressive jetpack mechanics that let you literally fly around the alien world at high speeds. Outcast: A New Beginning is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 15.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super-powered MMO City Of Heroes closed down in November 2012, but in recent years it has been revived by industrious fans via privately-hosted servers. While those servers allowed caped crusaders to continue roleplaying, the caveat was that they could be shut down at any moment by the most dastardly supervillains of all: lawyers.

That should be less of an issue in future. One of those community-hosted servers, Homecoming, has been granted an official license to operate by City Of Heroes' IP owners NCSoft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an effort to tackle online piracy, Lithuania has started issuing fines to online pirates. Thus far, fifty people have been handed a €140 fine, mostly for sharing pirated movies on the private torrent tracker Linkomanija. According to a local lawyer, these measures will reduce piracy, but traffic to the country's largest torrent site seems unaffected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has released a promotional video highlighting some of the biggest games coming to its console this year. The video hypes both first and third-party releases, many of which already had release dates/windows, but it also casually confirms 2024 launches for two previously un-dated projects.
Specifically, the video labels Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill 2 as 2024 games. Both games, each a remake of their respective titles, had no launch window prior to today. But the video and the accompanying PlayStation Blog post confirm as much, which is a little surprising to see happen with relatively limited fanfare instead of Konami rolling out individual red carpets for each game's launch update. But if you're looking forward to playing either title, this is welcomed news nonetheless.


Silent Hill 2 was announced in 2022 as a remake of the 2001 classic and is being developed by Bloober Team. The studio recently shared that work on the game was “progressing smoothly”, and it is a PlayStation 5 console exclusive (but will also launch on PC). 
Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a Unreal Engine 5 remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. It was announced during a PlayStation Showcase last May, and Konami released its first in-engine gameplay footage last October. Despite its inclusion in today’s PlayStation video, Snake Eater is also coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC.]]></summary>

Apex Legends is the latest live service game to take the plunge with its first crossover event. It's with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and it'll bring the Buster Sword, Aerith, and other elements from the JRPG to the battle royale on January 9th.

Feast your eyes on the officially licensed Series S toaster, which is on sale now at Walmart. The novelty appliance boasts a wide slot to toast thick slices of bread, bagels, waffles, English muffins, and probably most PlayStation discs for the truly devoted. In a neat twist, the oven roasts the Xbox logo on the food itself to add a flavorful touch of corporate branding to your carb intake. 

The toaster also sports a digital LED countdown timer, a six-setting shade selector dial for browning customization, a removable crumb tray, automatic temperature control, and a cool-touch exterior, among other perks. Though a cool appliance, I can’t help but wonder how many people will request a Series S as a gift from friends/family and receive this elaborately disguised kitchen accessory instead. 
Those interested can purchase the Xbox Series S toaster for $39.99.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been bouncing off Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, partly because the new protagonist design leaves me cold, and partly because it being a 2D affair has me yearning for something closer to the 1989 Apple II original, with its finicky platforming and sword-fighting. Katharine says it's decent, however, and the latest trailers are intriguing. One is an overview of the new metroidvania's locations, of which you can read much more in Katharine's last preview. The other is a quick dive into the game's approach to accessibility, which appears to be a lot more holistic than you'll find in many games.

A grizzled mafioso whose cheeks glitter with fragments of other people's teeth has as much chance of winning Russian Roulette as a sleepy five-year-old in SpongeBob pyjamas. But take Russian Roulette, swap the revolver for a pump-action shotgun, mix up live and dud rounds, and add Inscryption-esque items which let you change the rules, and now you have a more skillful game. That's Buckshot Roulette, the latest from Mike Klubnika, the dev behind those excellent horror games about operating machinery. Great weird machines here too.

The good news is that everyone seems to be taking a bit of a breather in 2024, because (at time of writing at least) the official "big'uns" calendar is looking remarkably slim at the moment. There are still some heavy-hitters coming our way this year, such as , Star Wars Outlaws and Path Of Exile 2, but 2024 looks like another year where it will be the smaller, independent games that shine the brightest. They certainly make up the bulk of our most anticipated games list for 2024, which the RPS Treehouse has been feverishly putting together over the last few days. The bad news is that there are still loads of great games coming out. So come, join us, and see what's on our personal wishlists for 2024.

The idea is less to take advantage of UE5's various whizbangs and bellwhistles, like the new Nanite geometry system, than to grease the launch chutes for future Everspace 2 updates and expansions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was 13 years old, I struggled to beat Cynthia, the Pokémon League champion in Pokémon Platinum. U.S.-based 13-year-old Willis Gibson just beat an unbeatable Tetris game that players have been attempting to complete since its release on the NES in 1989. 
On January 1, Gibson reached level 157 of Tetris, a feat previously thought impossible. New techniques, like the "hypertapping" one discovered in 2010 by Thor Aackerlund (thanks, BBC), and "rolling," discovered in 2021 according to IGN, allowed players to reach never before seen levels. Before that, getting past the thirties was all but impossible and now, Gibson has made it to level 157. As you can see in the video below, upon reaching that level, Tetris serves Gibson a kill screen – meaning it has crashed – ending his impossible run. 


It took Gibson, who goes by Blue Scuti on YouTube, 38 minutes to reach this new kill screen. BBC reports that Gibson has been playing Tetris for about two years, or since he was 11. Alongside his achievement of reaching level 157, Gibson also obtained the new highest score for Tetris. 
IGN writes that players can theoretically make it to level 255, and players are already trying; they just have to get lucky and avoid the crash points from level 157 onward. Upon beating level 255, players are brought back to the first level. 
For more, be sure to watch Gibson beat the record here, and then read about these Game Informer editors who beat six gaming world records.

I was previously a snob about the Nancy Drew point and click puzzle games, and then came to regret it when a fan of them (very nicely) emailed me explaining they're actually really good. We're going to find out for ourselves by playing them. There are north of 30 in total, and I will update the rankings at the end of each article.
The first is 1998's Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill, in which Nancy solves the murder of a Floridian highschooler named Jake Roberts, and there's a lot to love about it right away. There's a restrained cast, three locations in total, and the school sports team is called the Fighting Manatees. Thus the icon for the game is a lil' cartoon manatee - and to be absolutely accurate, this is the remastered version of the game from 2010, not the original 90s version. I'm as disappointed as you.

A complaint filed in December 2023 by the Italian Publishers Association, which represents publishers of books, scientific journals, and digital content, paints a somewhat different picture. As a result, telecoms regulator AGCOM has issued immediate blocking instructions to ISPs.

That comes from a new interview with the studio’s CEO, Adam Kiciński, who discusses acquisition possibilities while providing small updates on the studio’s litany of upcoming projects.
Speaking to the Polish outlet Parkiet, Kiciński was asked about rumors regarding the studio being a target of a takeover. He states via translation, “We are not interested in being included in any larger entity. We have worked our whole lives to get to the position we have now. And we believe that in a few years we will be even bigger and stronger. We have ambitious plans and we are passionate about what we do. We value independence.”

Final Fantasy VII Remake gave fans of the original game quite a shock as Cloud and the party exited Midgar. Zack, the protagonist of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII and a key figure in Cloud, Aerith, and Sephiroth's past, appears to be alive, and helped an injured Cloud reach Midgar. This stands in stark contrast to his fate in the original continuity, where he was killed and his Buster Sword was handed over to Cloud. 
Zack's changed fate is emblematic of how the Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth teams approached the source material. "If we trace the original and stay exactly loyal to it a…]]></summary>

In this case, it’s a video game.
It’s called Infestation: Origins, and it’s the debut title by Nightmare Forge Games. The game is an episodic four-player co-op survival adventure in which players control exterminators tasked with killing mutated vermin – and one of them happens to be a terrifying, person-sized monster modeled after Mickey.

Last year I complained about Puzzmo's crossword clues being very US-centric and Excors commented that US and UK puzzles seem very different, both in their form and in the fact that UK crosswords are often crytpic. Which is true! Often if you see a "quick crossword" in a UK paper that means "crossword with clues that are general knowledge questions and not an archaic set of riddles - you know, for if you're waiting for the kettle to boil, or are an idiot". So I decided to look into how you actually do cryptics. It's way harder than I thought, but at the same time I did not realise it's just smug puns.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jack Black has joined the cast of the in-development live-action Minecraft movie. Rumors about this casting popped up yesterday, January 2, with Deadline reporting that Black would play Steve (the Minecraft guy with the teal shirt and blue pants). Notably, Black starred as the villainous Bowser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie last year, giving us the instant-classic "Peaches," too. 
Following that report, other outlets, like Variety, further confirmed that Black would be starring in Minecraft alongside previously announced cast members like Jason Momoa (Aquaman, Game of Thrones), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), and Emma Myers (Wednesday). Black himself even nodded to the news in an Instagram post that showed him reading a Minecraft Basics for Dummies book. However, neither he nor the fi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I greet news of the completion of a Unity remaster for The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall with equal parts excitement and horror. Excitement because I have never played Daggerfall and it is one of the weirder, more fantastical Elder Scrolls RPGs - the one with multiple endings which sequels have explained away as somehow all being canon thanks to a metaphysical event called a Dragon Break, whereby timelines branch and reconnect. And horror because I have never played Daggerfall, which is said to be 620,000 square miles in size, and I'm getting to that point in life where I seriously ask myself whether I can finish certain games before I perish.
Still the journey is more important than reaching the destination, right? Perhaps I can treat it like an occasional walking sim.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dave the Diver has surpassed 3 million units sold, developer Mintrocket has revealed. The studio announced this achievement on X today, alongside some new art from the game to celebrate the milestone. Selling 3 million units is no small feat, especially considering Dave the Diver is Mintrocket's first game. 
In Dave the Diver, players control Dave as he dives during the day to find treasure, fish, complete quests, and more. At night, Dave runs a sushi restaurant, and the game mixes its adventure gameplay with its simulation gameplay really well – read more about that in Game Informer's Dave the Diver review.

Dave the Diver received great word-of-mouth at the time of its PC release in June, bolstered further by a Switch release later in October. It also crossed over with indie hit Dredge last month. Shortly before that crossover, Dave the Diver picked up a nomination for Best Independent Game at The Game Awards 2023.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/01/02/ubisoft-corrects-star-wars-outlaws-releasing-in-late-2024-back-to-general-2024"/>
        <updated>2024-01-02T22:38:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Earlier today, a Disney Parks blog pointed to Star Wars Outlaws releasing in late 2024, but the term "late" has now been removed from the post so that is now reads just 2024. Ubisoft also confirmed to Kotaku that, "the timing was incorrect and has since been amended." So, Star Wars Outlaws' release window has moved from late 2024 back to some general time this year.
Original story:
Star Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft's upcoming open-world Star Wars game, has enjoyed a vague 2024 release window since it was revealed at an Xbox Showcase last year. However, a recent post on Disney's official park blog has given the game a more specific window. According to the blog, Star Wars Outlaws is releasing late 2024. The blog post, which is a collection of 24 exciting Disney-things happening in 2024 reads, "And for Star Wars fans – Star Wars Outlaws, the open-world Star Wars game is set to release late this year."
Star Wars Outlaws follows an original Star Wars character named Kay Vess and seeks to explore a character archetype of the Star Wars universe we haven't spent much time with in video games: the Han Solo-inspired scoundrel. In the game, Vess (who has no Jedi abilities as far as we know) must survive by her wits and her ability to talk (or blast) her way through difficult situations.
For more on Star Wars Outlaws, you can read our interview with the game's narrative director, Navid Khavari, where we covered topics like whether or not the game will have an overlap with Shadows of the Empire and if the team has been communicating with Respawn regarding its Jedi series of games. The game is planned for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frogwares is "now the sole publisher of The Sinking City on all platforms", says the developer. This brings to an end several years of uncertainty and litigation, which saw the Lovecraftian RPG delisted from Steam several times and at one point restored by its publisher via an allegedly pirated version of the game. 

The downside is that an updated version of the game is coming to all storefronts in the coming weeks and it won't be compatible with old save files.

Its first two titles, Detention and Devotion, impressed and terrified fans with frighteningly strong horror chops, but the team is leaving that behind to tackle something completely different in Nine Sols.

This significant step forward affords an opportunity to look back on the studio’s young history, so we spoke with co-founder Vincent Yang to learn about how a small band of gamers in Taiwan formed one of the industry’s most promising – and, at one time, controversial – indie studios.

The 2008 Prince of Persia reboot didn’t reignite the series as Ubisoft had hoped, and 2010’s Forgotten Sands felt closer to a movie tie-in than a new, proper entry.
That game’s subtitle would end up being a portend of the future as the series seemed inexplicably lost to time. Though not completely ignored, thanks to the occasional cameo in other Ubisoft games and underplayed mobile releases, w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tim Cain wrote what is perhaps gaming’s most famous and influential monologue: the introduction to Fallout. “War never changes,” he says. “People loved it. I’m like, ‘I must be a writer.’” Yet much more recently, when Cain sat down to write his memoirs, nobody really liked what came out on the page. “I was really, really bad at it,” he says. “I had half a dozen people read it, and they all pretty much said that the stories were good, but my writing wasn’t.”


Cain’s writing strengths, as fellow Fallout originator Leonard Boyarsky has suggested, lie in shortform. Which was bad news for anyone who wanted to read the definitive account of his four decades at the heart of Interplay, Troika and Obsidian, three of the most important RPG studios of all time. Thankfully, though, it turns out Cain is a natural raconteur. The same anecdotes that appeared flat and toneless in his memoirs go down a storm on YouTube. There, for the past seven months, Cain has been delivering his stories straight to camera, as if at a dinner party with 73,500 other people. “When I started the channel, I would effectively just look at something in the book and be like, ‘I’ll tell that story today,’” he says. “Now I spend as much time answering questions and doing videos based on things people ask about.”

Announced via a Disney Parks blog post of all things, Star Wars Outlaws ranks as the No.22 most "Ooooh-Worthy Thing" out of the 2024 Disney Experiences line-up - which, considering the list only stretches to 24 entries is a bit of an unfair burn on the game, if you ask me, especially when No.21 is... *checks notes* new Disney Eats and Stitch clothes collections.

The Mexica journey to central Mexico; Moses leading the Jewish people across the desert; the founding of Rome – as told by Virgil – by those that fled the fall of Troy. Unsurprisingly, then, video games also tell stories of migration. On August 8, 2013, game designer Lucas Pope, the man behind the studio 3909, released Papers, Please, a game about managing migration.
Papers, Please, subtitled “A Dystopian Document Thriller,” was for some the first time they played a game whose core design ethos challenged their worldviews and understanding. Other games have placed the topic of migration front and center. Path Out (Causa Creations, 2014), an adventure game that retells the journe…]]></summary>

It's Makoto Wakaido's Case Files Trilogy Deluxe - a collection of not three, but four detective stories in which you go about solving grizzly murders across different towns and villages in Japan. In short: if you like the investigation bits of Ace Attorney and need something to whet your appetite before the Apollo Justice Trilogy comes out on January 25th, this will be 100% up your street.

The topline: they want to do more with generative "AI" machine learning tools,  and they're still dead keen on metaversy VR/AR stuff. The blockchain remains a "focus", too, though it gets much less of a billing than in 2023's new year letter from Square Enix’s previous president Yosuke Matsuda.

Final Fantasy VII is full of iconic scenes. Whether you're talking about the well-known sequences already depicted in Remake or the upcoming gut-punch at the Forgotten Capital, the Remake trilogy allows fans to experience these moments in their most fully realized forms. While this middle portion of Final Fantasy VII, which Rebirth depicts, focuses on Aerith and the looming specter of Sephiroth, so much of Rebirth's depiction emphasizes the deepening of relationships.
This is true with how the developers approached both the main story and side content in Rebirth, and it's sure to make it so …]]></summary>

At least, that’s what it feels like the game industry is increasingly saying I should do. A number of recently revealed titles have been slapped with 2025 release windows, so I can’t help but wonder how next year will shape up and, most importantly, what the awards seasons will look like.  
There are still hundreds of games yet to fill the 2025 release calendar, but let’s pretend they won’t exist. Let’s say 95% of the game industry collectively decided to take a year off. Making games is obscenely hard, and to avoid crunch, everyone decided to take some well-deserved (and well-compensated) R&R, so these seven titles are the only ones to launch in 2025.

Store shelves were crowded with poorly made games, and consumer interest waned substantially. Developers that ushered in the “golden age” of arcades and the first two generations of home consoles began to crash and burn at an alarming pace. In no time, the once billion-dollar industry was reduced to rubble.
In the summer of that same year, in Japan, gaming giant Nintendo released its first-ever home console with swappable cartridges. With its striking red and gold design, the Family Computer, better known as the Famicom, brought arcade hits like Donkey Kong and Mario Bros. into Japanese homes.
While the Famicom would go on to revitalize the North American gaming market as the VHS-inspired Nintendo Entertainme…]]></summary>

It's literally my job to play video games and I bet someone could fill a reasonable top ten this year of titles I didn't even get time to touch. But even as it's a universal, undeniable truth, the revelation that you missed out on something popular is always met with the same incredulous statement.
“You've never played this?”
I understand the impulse. For instance, Baldur's Gate 3 took up so many hours of my 2023 that it's hard to fathom what the year would be like without it. This sentiment extends well beyond GOTY talks, though – some games are so fundamental to our taste or upbringing that it can be hard to process that peop…]]></summary>
