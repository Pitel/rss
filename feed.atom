        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghouls 'n Ghosts and more!
Nintendo has just added four more games to the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive app for the Switch Online Expansion Pack service. The latest editions include The Revenge of Shinobi, Ghouls 'n Ghosts, Landstalker and Crusader of Centy.

The Revenge of Shinobi is nothing to take lightly, especially when this ninja packs a brutal arsenal of shurikens and ninjitsu skills. A sequel to SEGA’s classic arcade game, this action side-scroller plunges you into the role of Joe Musashi as he stalks and attempts to annihilate – if you’re up to the task – the evil Neo Zeed criminal network. Have faith: The power of the ninja is strong.
Ghouls ’n Ghosts besets you with marauding demons: scythe-wielding skeletons, sickle weasels and evil princes that crawl from beneath the mud. You must fend them all off to defend the kingdom and manage to do it without losing your shirt in the process … or in Arthur’s case – his suit of armor. Plus, keep your eyes peeled for the tough-as-nails enemy that also stars in Gargoyle’s Quest, the spin-off tale playable in the Game Boy™ – Nintendo Switch Online library!
Landstalker is the name, and lighthearted treasure hunting’s the game. Nigel the Forest Elf faces more delightful puzzles in this action-adventure than you can shake a custom-forged broadsword at. Journey through a fantastical realm while navigating intricate isometric mazes that bring you ever closer to the secret of King Nole’s riches.
Crusader of Centy tasks you with launching your razor-sharp weapon like a blazing boomerang. SLICE! Take down those invading monsters with a perfectly timed swing in this sweeping action-RPG featuring fierce enemies, a variety of towering bosses, animal companions with special abilities, time travel and a world of sorcery and intrigue to explore.

To play these games on your Switch, you'll need to have a Nintendo Switch Online membership and a subscription to the higher-priced Expansion Pack tier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know, the fans who enjoy "Mario and Zelda".
As part of the Activision Blizzard acquisition, Microsoft's aim is to bring Call of Duty to as many platforms as possible. This includes Nintendo's devices, with a 10-year legal agreement already penned.
The only thing Xbox has got to overcome first is the FTC and Sony's attempts at blocking the deal. The pair are still trying to argue Nintendo is not a direct competitor in the main console market and therefore would not be affected by this acquisition in the same way as PlayStation.

Let's assume you didn't watch that, though. Let's assume that you, like me, were by that point too exhausted from 90 second trailers to tune in. Let's instead watch these videos now, since they've just been uploaded as separate videos, to learn more about Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty's new district, Dogtown.

Remakes and remasters are more common than ever in 2023. What's most interesting is seeing how these new versions handle the issue of completely rebuilding versus simply making modern visual improvements. Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life is a remake of Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life that straddles the line between these two philosophies fairly evenly but still delivers an outdated experience in various aspects.
Releasing on modern consoles, Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life initially looks like nothing more…]]></summary>

BattleBit Remastered is not something I would've normally leapt into, at first blush. The low-poly, almost Roblox-like character models made me think that its sudden popularity on the Steam charts might be a flash in the pan. But overlooking BattleBit on aesthetics alone would've meant missing out on rediscovering a piece of the FPS landscape I'd thought lost.
I loved old Battlefield. The World War II iterations were my first introduction, but there are few shooters I've put as much time into as my family did on Battelfield 2. It was the perfect mix of progression, variety, strategy, and shooting. I mention this to underscore the praise I'm giving BattleBit Remastered when I say it reminds me of Battlefield 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of people will be Street Fighting
The latest Street Fighter has been out for just shy of a month now, and it sure seems like it's caught on. The current number of Evo registrants seems to back up this popularity too, as the tournament organizer confirms Street Fighter 6 is breaking both franchise and all-time Evo player count records.
Shared on social media, the Evolution Championship Series says Street Fighter 6 has officially broken both a franchise and all-time Evo record for competitors.
https://twitter.com/EVO/status/1673466628636561408
Evo doesn't share how many players that is. But if we're judging by the previous record count of Street Fighter V at Evo 2016, that's over 5,000 registrants.
Sign-ups for Evo 2023 are still live for a little less than two weeks. Evo 2023 is set to run August 4 through 6 in Las Vegas, NV.
Back in the saddle again
I have to admit, it's nice to see Street Fighter thriving like this. Sure, Street Fighter V delivered some pretty great sets over the years. But it always felt like SFV couldn't get out from under its launch state.
Meanwhile, Street Fighter 6 has been an absolute grand slam. As Moyse put it so well, Street Fighter 6 is "a title that radiates excellence." And the players have been showing up, too. Alongside the big Evo numbers, this last week's CEO—where MenaRD took the top spot with both Luke and Blanka—also tallied up a ton of entrants.
Safe to say that Street Fighter 6 has made its impact on the scene. I'm curious to see what these numbers look like moving forward, after the launch year luster wars off. But this year's Evo debut for SF6 promises to be a big one.

CBS Eye Animation Productions has partnered with Innersloth, the studio behind Among Us, to create an animated TV Series based on everyone's favorite pandemic-era pastime.
According to a report by Variety, Among Us will put Owen Dennis of Infinity Train fame in the creator's seat. He'll also serve as co-executive producer alongside Chris Prynoski, Shannon Prynoski, and Antonio Canobbio of Innersloth. The series won't stray from the game's basic premise.
“Members of your crew have been replaced by an alien shapeshifter intent on causing confusion, sabotaging the ship, and killing everyone," reads the show's official logline. "Root out the ‘Impostor’ or fall victim to its murderous designs.”
[caption id="attachment_347219" align="alignnone" width="1200"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
Titmouse, the studio behind Big Mouth and, more appropriately, Star Trek: Lower Decks, will be in charge of animation. Ben Kalina from Titmouse will also have a role as co-executive producer.
We're yet to hear about networks or streaming platforms interested in the project, but we doubt that'll take long. This is a big property, and the show has The Animation Guild behind it, not the WGA. Its production likely won't slow down due to the WGA strike.
Anyone who wants to know more about what the Among Us show might have in store should check out Infinity Train. It's a marvelously heartwarming animated show that tells the story of a bunch of great characters until the moment they all die via the scythe of unfair cancellation. Just kidding. Though the cancellation did happen and was absolutely unfair, none of Infinity Train's stories ended on cliffhangers. You should totally check it out.
Video game adaptations have finally begun to get things right with Arcane and The Last of Us. Here's hoping CBS continues the trend with its take on Among Us.

Publisher Koei Tecmo and developer Gust have just announced another milestone for the Atelier Ryza series. Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout, Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy, and Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End & the Secret Key have surpassed a total of two million units shipped.
The last report came on March 17, announcing that the series had shipped 1.6 million units. This means that the Atelier Ryza series has moved over 400,000 more units in a period filled with massive attention-stealers such as Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, Street Fighter VI, and Diablo IV. Now that's quite the feat.
[caption id="attachment_365614" align="alignnone" width="1200"] Image via Koei Tecmo[/caption]
To celebrate the series' success, Koei Tecmo has announced that they're willing to give out some goodies to fans; too bad that only applies to fans living in Japan.
Are you just hearing about the Atelier series for the first time? Then you'll probably be surprised to learn that this series has existed since '97. (That's older than Metal Gear Solid.) Atelier is a popular RPG series that began on Sony consoles, then gradually made its way to most other platforms. The Ryza games in the series follow Reisalin "Ryza" Stout. Ryza is an adventurer who travels the world looking for recipes to further her studies in the field of alchemy.
You can play either of the three newest games in the series on PS5, Xbox X|S, Switch, and Steam. The success of Atelier Ryza will likely not slow down anytime soon either, as an anime TV adaptation will come out this summer.

Retro-Bit has announced that they’re bringing the rather obscure titles – Sol-Deace and El Viento – back to the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive this year. Pre-orders are now open.
Sol-Deace was originally released exclusively in Japan in 1990 on the Sharp X68000 as Sol-Feace. It would then receive a port to the Sega CD worldwide and the Genesis in North America. I have no idea why the Sega CD version is called Sol-Feace and the Genesis version is known as Sol-Deace. To my knowledge, neither “Feace” nor “Deace” are actually words. Hold on, let me look that up.
No, the dictionary thinks I mean “feces” and “deuce,” respectively, which is actually pretty amusing but not helpful.
Anyway, Sol-Deace/Feace is a horizontal shoot-’em-up. Developed by Wolf Team, the word I’ve seen most ap…]]></summary>

The age of reboots and remakes is par for the course nowadays. So when a trailer for a Perfect Dark reboot came out in 2020, it seemed like a good time to revisit the N64 FPS. At least, that was the plan, but the project appears to have suffered from development hell for some time. In fact, it could still be years away from completion.
A recent (and insightful) report from IGN gives the skinny on what's been happening with the reboot of Rare's legendary follow-up to GoldenEye. Beginning life in 2018, The Initiative, a studio set up internally at Microsoft, got the ball rolling on bringing Perfect Dark to the modern gaming world.
However, conflicts rose between the studio and Certain Affinity, who came onboard in 2019. This slowed development,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here we go again...
About this time last year, Sega released Sonic Origins—a compilation release that aimed to collate the first four (five if we count Sonic & Knuckles as a totally separate game) Mega Drive/Genesis Sonic games in one ultimate package with a bunch of extras thrown in. Though it wasn’t without its issues, Sega more or less managed to do what it set out to do, but there was a lingering sentiment amongst fans that it could’ve done much more. Now, a year later, Sega has decided to release a ‘Plus’ update — available as a DLC expansion or in physical form — that throws in a dozen new games and some other additional features to make the collection all the sweeter. Unfortunately, Sonic Origins still feels somewhat incomplete even after this update, but this new expansion is just about worth the money.
First, a brief overview of what’s been added. The headlining new addition here is the inclusion of 12 8-bit Sonic games made for the Sega Game Gear, the colour handheld which once upon a time directly competed with Nintendo’s first Game Boy. Elsewhere, Amy has been added as a playable character in the headlining four games for this collection, and Knuckles has been added as a playable character to Sonic CD after his rather odd exclusion in last year’s release. On top of that, Plus throws in all the previously released DLC with the additional missions to tackle, and content for the museum. Check out our review of the base game if you want to hear about the base offering:

I've been playing Quantum Break since it arrived on PC Game Pass, and I'm finding their oft-forgotten time-bending shooter is yet another modern Remedy game full of boring gunfights even as it gives you supernatural powers that could replace guns. Their apparent disinterest in gunfights is especially felt in a game so into telling a story that it ends chapters with TV-length live-action episodes starring actual Lance Reddick. Looking back over their past games, agh, as much as I want spooky investigations, I can't get excited about their next, Alan Wake 2.

Thankfully, the game is in a much better state these days, but the studio's own VP of PR and Communication, Michał Platkow-Gilewski, has said that the initial launch was "way better" than the reception. That's according to a recent interview with Gamesindustry.biz.
"I actually believe Cyberpunk on launch was way better than it was received, and even the first reviews were positive," Platkow-Gilewski said. "Then it became a cool thing not to like it. We went from hero …]]></summary>

In 2022, renowned creator and industry figure Yu Suzuki revealed that his development studio Ys Net was creating an arcade-style shooter exclusively for Apple Arcade. Now, publisher ININ Games has revealed that the very game — which is a love letter and spiritual successor to Suzuki's Space Harrier — is coming to consoles, including Switch, on 10th November. (Thanks, Gematsu!)
Air Twister is a pretty interesting-looking shooter and was the first game released by Ys Net following Shenmue III. It caught our attention last year because of its similarities to Space Harrier, and Suzuki has also cited numerous influences from Sega rail shooters such as Panzer Dragoon and Rez. Instead of piloting a spaceship, you're a princess who rides a swan all while over-the-top music complete with choir singing (from Dutch composer Valensia) blast out of the speakers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flight from mobile
ININ has announced that they’ll be bringing YSNET’s absolutely bizarre shoot-’em-up, Air Twister, to consoles and PC. Previously, this was an Apple Arcade exclusive. It will be arriving on November 10, 2023.
Do you not even have phone? I do, but I rarely play phone. So, typically, when something like Air Twister gets announced, the news just bounces off of me and gets filed away in the trash compactor of my mind. So, when I got the PR for this, I was like, “I’ve seen this before,” but I couldn’t place it. I had to look up news of it, and thankfully, CJ plays phone and had written about it previously.
So, there’s this trailer, and I really can’t tell what the hell is going on, so I’m just going to quote what the press release tells me, “In Air Twister, embark on an epic quest with Princess Arch as she fights to save her planet from imminent destruction.”
https://youtu.be/-eUpnDtU274
Okay, cool, now explain the winged elephant to me.
Yu Suzuki is the mind behind Space Harrier, After Burner, Out Run, and Shenmue. One of those games is among my favorite titles ever, and it’s probably not the one that you’re thinking of.
I can’t find a lot on Air Twister in terms of reviews, but the ones I do find are kind of lukewarm. However, CJ says it got much better after a few updates. I’d be willing to try it out myself once it’s off of phone. It looks absolutely insane. Like someone dropped a whole bunch of unrelated assets into a blender and hit “frappe.” I like insane.
Air Twister is coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC on November 10, 2023. PlayStation and Switch platforms will be getting a physical release, as well.

While Mimimi's previous games took place in mostly grounded historical settings, Shadow Gambit is about magical undead pirates hunting for mysterious booty and fighting a persecutive Inquisition. This shift into the supernatural is quite the change for Mimimi, which creative director Dominik Abé tells me was partly to challenge themselves as designers, but also so players could have a bit more fun with how they approached its plentiful stealth encounters.
"One thing we wanted for sure was that we had something that's not grounded in a realistic setting," Abé tells me. "That was a requirement for all the pitches we did internally, and that's because we wanted to improve on the gameplay. We were restricted by realism, so that was a core pillar. It had to be something fantasy, or sci-fi or something non-realistic."

While worldbuilding can be as simple as creating fictional characters and cities, some creators dive in deeply, crafting pantheons of gods, hundreds of years of wars and conflict, and even entire languages. While it makes the world more believable, it can be incredibly disorienting for an audience to be thrust headfirst into a sea of unfamiliar proper nouns, especially before they have a chance to get to know the world's characters. Lucky for me, the developers behind Final Fantasy XVI completely anticipated this and introduced a solution: the Active Time Lore mechanic.

When it comes to Nintendo, you never know if its consoles and handhelds will go out with a bang or with a whimper. The GameCube, for instance, went out with an absolute whimper, as new releases had all but dried up by the time the Wii arrived. Yes, it got Twilight Princess in the end, but it was pretty sparse otherwise. The Nintendo DS, on the other hand, went out with one hell of an explosion. In the months leading up to the release of the 3DS, publishers dropped an assortment of gems for the platform, including Okamiden, Radiant Historia, Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation, and Pokémon Black & White in North America and Europe. And that was just in the first three months of 2011 before the 3DS hit.

Is there such a thing as a perfect game? Yes, and it's this one. Listen, you are going to get to the end of this review and think to yourself, "Isn't a 10/10 score, like, Zelda: Breath of the Wild? How can this 12-15 hour game that doesn't even have Hestu in it possibly match up?" You are thinking that because you have not played Ghost Trick. Your life is about to change.
First up, a bit of background. Ghost Trick is a one-off, standalone game from the man behind Ace Attorney, Shu Takumi. Originally released on the DS in 2010, it received a fair amount of praise from critics, but never went on to become a bestseller. Instead, it lodged deep in the hearts of everyone who did play it, becoming a cult favourite amongst those in the know, alongside other, similar(ly underappreciated) games from the same era like Hotel Dusk, The World Ends With You, and Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the ambitious follow-up to 2017’s Breath of the Wild, finally hit Switch last month. We’ve now learned, thanks to video game analyst group Circana, that it was, unsurprisingly, the best selling game of the month. However, it’s also already the second best selling game of 2023, behind Hogwarts Legacy. 
What’s even more impressive is that Circana’s Tears of the Kingdom numbers do not include digital sales for the game – only physical, according to Circana executive director Mat Piscatella. That it’s the second best selling game of 2023 on just its physical numbers alone means this game sold exceptionally well. And there’s a good chance it might be the year’s best selling game if digital numbers are one day added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Dear Villagers and developer Fallen Leaf Studios have released a new trailer on IGN for Fort Solis, the upcoming sci-fi horror game starring Roger Clark and Troy Baker. 
This trailer starts with Baker discussing how he came to be involved with Fort Solis and why he’s excited about the game before he reveals it hits PlayStation 5 and PC on August 22. The trailer then cuts to new footage of the game, which you can check out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Baker says he joined Fort Solis because it allowed him to work alongside Clark (whom you might recognize as Arthur Morgan from Red Dead Redemption 2) and because he liked the story as well. As for the new Fort Solis footage, it shows more of the spooky Martian horror featured in the game. In it, Clark’s character, Jack Leary, tries to survive “through one long and terrifying night on Mars.” Leary appears to be guided, in some way, by Baker’s Wyatt Taylor and Julia Brown’s character, Jessica Appleton. 
Fort Solis hits PlayStation 5 and PC on August 22.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Could this be related to Separate Ways?
The hype for the remake of Resident Evil 4 may have died down, but it's still out there as one of the best horror games of the year. Upon release back in March, it sold millions in quick succession, showing Capcom was onto another winner.
In the interim, a lot of you have been waiting for the game's first major DLC, Separate Ways, which would be a remake of the content from the original RE4. We don't yet know when it's coming out, but eagle-eyed gamers think the developer is preparing for its launch.
Over on SteamDB (as spotted by Twitter user and known leaker Wario64), a website that tracks all things related to Steam, it looks as though Resident Evil 4 is getting seven new achievements added to the game. There are no details on what these achievements actually are as they're marked as hidden, but some speculate they could be related to the DLC.
https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1673334239352311814
Other theories suggest it could be in relation to the VR version of the Resident Evil 4 remake. All of these are, of course, speculations. Hopefully, Capcom will give further details at some point. In any case, it's something to keep a close eye on. It looks as though RE4 is preparing for a new patch, but we can't be sure of the details at this stage. We know Separate Ways is inbound, but these new Steam achievements suggest that it could be arriving sooner than anticipated.

A sequel to the Switch launch title, 1-2-Switch, might not have made it onto our bingo cards for Nintendo's post-Tears of the Kingdom 2023, but the rumours have been around for so long that we shouldn't have been all the surprised when Everybody 1-2-Switch! was announced with little fanfare in the early hours on a Friday morning. Except we were.
The first game delivered some harmless fun when the Switch was all fresh and new. It showcased some of the cool features that the console promised and filled a gap when there weren't all that many games available. But now, six years on and with enough games available to keep us going until the end of time, we couldn't help but wonder: do we really need a sequel any more?

Humble Games announced today that their battle focused Temtem: Showdown is now available to download for free on Steam. The game is essentially a standalone variant of the Pokémon-like Temtem that released out of early access last year. You do not need to purchase the previous Temtem game in order to access Temtem: Showdown.

Gotta battle em' all!
Temtem: Showdown takes out the taming and leveling from the base game, and focuses purely on the combat. Dubbed a "free multiplayer battle simulator", players can build a team in seconds and dash into ranked matches with players from all over the world. At its core, Temtem's battle system features action-packed 2v2 battles. It'll feel familiar to anyone who's played a bit of doubles in online Pokémon matches.
Competitive play seems to be a huge part of the game, featuring a climbable ranked ladder system. Furthermore, the game will have community-run tournaments as well as an official esports circuit called TemCS. According to to the Steam page, the circuit will reward huge prizes.
Seasons will also be a thing in Temtem: Showdown. There will be a new season every few months, changing up the meta and introducing new combinations to play with when doing battle.
I haven't got a chance to play Temtem yet, though it's in my backlog to play on PS5. I have heard great things about its battle system though, so this seems like the right idea to make it accessible to more players. While Temtem is available on PC, Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, it looks like Temtem: Showdown is only available via Steam for now.
If you want to give the game a try, you can check out Temtem: Showdown now for free on Steam.

We'd previously covered reports from eagle-eyed fans who claimed Barbie's cars would be making their way into Forza Horizon 5. His assessment was correct. Microsoft has just added both the Chevrolet Corvette that Barbie drives in the movie, as well as Ken's GMC HUMMER EV Pickup to Forza Horizon 5's drivable roster.
Microsoft has said that to get them both, all players have to do is check their Forza Horizon 5 message center. Everything for free, no paid DLC. Just get the cars and let's go party.
https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1673360575706066945
Some could have jumped at the opportunity to complain that they wanted *insert name of edgy, bat-themed vehicle here* and not this. But the Chevrolet is no slouch.

And it looks pretty damn good in photo mode.
https://twitter.com/JewelsVEVO/status/1673361123352129536?s=20
Anyone who's not into giving Barbie's preferred ride a chance can go with the much more aggressive HUMMER Pickup.

As the unexpectedly great box-office war of Barbie vs Oppenheimer draws ever nearer, Barbie reveals she has no trouble fighting on the most unexpected of fronts. Is this how Greta Gerwig's live-action take on the popular doll will take down Christopher Nolan's three-hour-long wartime drama? Will Fortnite soon host an event showing the horrendous effects of nuclear weapons as Nolan tries to win the gamer populace back? Only time will tell. Oppenheimer opens in theatres on July 20. Barbie catches up to him in her Chevy just one day later, on July 21.
As for the Forza Horizon 5 cars, you can download those right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HDMI 2.1 monitors were the new hotness back when the new generation of games consoles arrived in 2020 and 2021, with these models offering 4K 120Hz HDR gaming without the need for chroma subsampling. Unsurprisingly, these monitors also cost a huge amount of money, with even lower-end options in the £600+ range and higher-end examples in the quadruple figures. 
Two or three years on, things have settled down and these HDMI 2.1 monitors are now much more affordable - if not yet exactly cheap. One such example is the Acer Nitro XV282KKV, a 28-inch monitor with a 4K 144Hz refresh rate on PC, that's down to £409.98 plus £5 shipping at Ebuyer. That's nearly £200 off its UK RRP and an awesome deal for a monitor with these specs.

Woody Woodpecker is how the Gods of Animation punished humankind for creating anime. I will never understand the appeal of centering an entire property around a character deliberately created to be annoying. He’s like Bugs Bunny, except you never feel the need to root for him. No, he’s more like Batman’s Joker, but you replace all the charisma with just a second heaping of insane malice. I hate him so much.
So, I bought a game that headlines him. It’s 2000’s Woody Woodpecker Racing for PS1 and Windows. I bought this specifically so I could remind my brain that it’s trapped here in this hell with me. However, it kind of seems like the developers weren’t exactly fans either, since that blasted Woodpecker isn’t my biggest complaint with the game.

Sand Land is an odd situation. Announced during the Summer Game Fest 2023 live show, Sand Land is an interesting pick for an ILCA-developed, Bandai Namco-published action-RPG adaptation.
While many in the west are familiar with Akira Toriyama's work, Sand Land isn't quite as popular as, say, Dragon Ball. But that relative disparity is what made Sand Land interesting to me. I've seen tons of Dragon Ball. I don't know much about Sand Land. And after playing a little bit of the latter at Summer Game Fest 2023, I'm curious to see even more of its Mad Max-like arid wastes.
For those unfamiliar, Sand Land is a single-volume manga from Toriyama set in a world with little water. After years of disasters and war have ravaged the land, a single king lords over the water supply. The e…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The quick brown deer jumped over the lazy owl.
Some people can't help but translate things. We see languages, and we want to decipher them, like the people who climb Mount Everest just because it's there. The languages in games like FEZ, Titan Souls, Heaven's Vault, 7 Days To End With You, and Noita, invite the player to try to crack them to reveal more of the game's lore, and players are often rewarded for doing so, even if it's usually just extra story. Translating the Fez language was literally the first thing I did, and it basically revealed the whole plot of the game before I'd even started. Oops!
But those game examples are all made on indie budgets. What happens when a gigantic, multi-billion-dollar company like Nintendo makes its own language? The answer is that we get THREE languages. The Zelda series has Hylian, Sheikah, and as of Tears of the Kingdom, Zonai — three languages that look very different and were designed to represent the culture of each of their races.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI is in some ways a radical departure from the hit Square Enix RPG series’ past and in other ways pulls from its rich history to create a very old-school-feeling adventure. So where does it fall in the pantheon of Final Fantasy game lengths? The answer is somewhere in the middle.

Mario is following in the footsteps of Pokémon, as Nintendo has teamed up with snack company Mondelez International to create some official Super Mario Bros. Oreos.
Launching in North America on 10th July, these limited edition packs of cookies (or biscuits, depending on where you're from in the world) can contain 16 different kinds of designs, featuring characters such as Mario, Luigi, Toad, Yoshi, and Bowser, to a Super Star, Bloopers, Spiny, and — of course — a power mushroom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So they’ll be… fresher?
Nintendo and Oreo have revealed that Luigi and the rest of the Super Mario gang are going to be crossing over into the world of cookies. Pre-orders are now open for limited edition Oreo x Super Mario cookies. And I don’t know how I can remain shocked that this is where the FOMO market has gotten us.
A pack of Orea x Super Mario includes 12 cookies, and there are 16 designs in all. Of the 16 embossed designs, one of them features Luigi, and none of them depicts Monty Mole. If you eat the entire package by yourself, you’ll be treating yourself to 720 calories and immeasurable shame.
Oreos are also challenging you to balance the allegedly rare Bowser cookie on the edge of a glass and then stack all the other characters on top of it until it all collapses. I guess this is a social media thing. No prize has been announced, but they say, "The Oreo brand may even have a surprise in store for fans who rise to the challenge, defeat Bowser and save the Mushroom Kingdom." Oh, gosh, there's a trailer on the site.
Huh. Oreos definitely aren’t bad cookies, and I have no problems with product marketing. This just seems a bit extra. Preorders for a Cookie? Maybe this is normal, and I'm the one who's out of touch. It reminds me of the Super Mario Cereal, where the box was also an Amiibo. I still have never seen a physical box of that stuff. It disappeared the moment it hit the shelf. Even still, I wouldn’t have pre-ordered it.
If you do want to pre-order some cookies, there’s a limit of 1 per order. That means your pre-order can’t possibly net you all 16 designs. Weird. However, they will appear in stores like any normal cookie. Their release into the world begins on July 10, 2023.

When will the discovery period for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom end? Never, probably. We're fascinated by people's vehicles for sure, but sometimes the most simple, everyday creations are the most surprising. And today's creation has answered a simple question — how much does Link weigh?
Reddit user u/RecommendationOk6842 over on the HyruleEngineering subreddit has shared their latest creation — a pair of weighing scales. We've all got something like this in our home, or have at least seen them, but this simple device — made up of planks of wood, swords, brooms, a wheel, and a Stabilizer Zonai device — could unlock many secrets in Tears of the Kingdom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Both the Vanilla and GOTY editions
Remember Fallout 4? Of course you do. It's barely eight years old! Well, for those of you who have yet to play it, now seems like a good time, as it's currently on offer for ridiculously cheap. With Starfield still a few months away, you might want something to do until then. And let's face it, we've all pretty much had our fill of Skyrim.
So how much is Fallout 4 at the moment? Head on over to the Steam page and you'll see that you can pick up the vanilla copy of the game for $6.59 (or £5.27 for our British readers). That's a pretty magnificent 67% off the usual price. But it doesn't end there, either.
[caption id="attachment_388625" align="aligncenter" width="1200"] Image via Bethesda.[/caption]
Say you fancy "going big" and you want the Game of the Year edition. Well, that too is on sale, now priced at $9.99 (or £8.74). The GOTY version of Fallout 4 comes with all the official expansions, including Far Harbor and Nuka-World.
You'll need to be a little quick though if you want to take advantage of the promotion, as it ends on June 29. That still gives you a few days to make a purchase, but it's not going to be around for long.
But let's say you don't fancy playing Fallout 4. Maybe you've already got a copy of it and you've been playing it to death since 2015. Well, you might be interested in hearing about the Fallout: London. This is a fan project that, as the name suggests, tells a F4 story in England's capital city. The DLC-sized mod is loaded with custom content and is expected to release sometime in 2023, so keep an eye out for that.

Atari has announced two new titles getting refreshed as part of their ongoing efforts, Quantum: Recharged and Haunted House. Neither has a stated release window, but both will be dropping on all consoles, PC, and the Atari VCS.
Quantum: Recharged is the next in Atari’s Recharged line of game revivals. These have included Yars: Recharged and Gravitar: Recharged. This time, they’re focusing on Quantum, which is a bit of an obscure title, but it was included in the Atari 50 collection. It’s a 1982 arcade title that uses vector graphics. You would use a trackball to try and engulf dots and other shapes. The closest I can come to a comparison is Qix, but I feel like that isn’t all that sufficient.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not enough reason to spend more time with Rabbids.
To the surprise of pretty much everyone, the original Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle became one of the best tactics games on the Nintendo Switch. We loved its tight, puzzle-like missions and vibrant world that somehow presented Ubisoft’s Rabbids as less-than-annoying – even, dare we say, sometimes endearing. The sequel followed suit, impressing critics and fans alike with a handful of great planets to explore, though we preferred the tight gameplay of the first over the creative freedom of Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope.
One area where Kingdom Battle excelled was its Donkey Kong Adventure DLC. Completely separate from the campaign, it saw Rabbid Peach teaming up with Donkey and Cranky Kong to take on a Rabbid threat, resplendent with an overwhelming amount of nostalgic Donkey Kong Country references. To say we have high hopes for Sparks of Hope’s DLC is an understatement, and unfortunately, the first major DLC – following the season pass-exclusive update The Tower of Doooom – fails to reach the same heights despite being a fun little addition to the base game.

If you haven't been keeping a close eye on the Oblivion/Skyrim modding community, you may have missed out on the progress of Skyblivion. The fan-made modification takes TES4 and rebuilds it in TES5's engine, and the scope of this project is one for the ages. Now, the volunteers working on this unofficial remake has shared a new video that shows the current progress plus what's left to do.
The 10-minute footage over on YouTube is essentially a checklist of how much has been done on Skyblivion since work began in 2012. While there's still a way to go, So far the team has managed to map around 82% of Oblivion's world. On top of that, roughly 40% of the interiors have been done, a third of the "meshing" is now complete, and nearly 100 quests are described as "playable".
https://youtu.be/H1q1nXLDjB8
The video also shows how much is still left, with a staggering amount of work still ahead for the modders. They're also calling out for additional help, so if you feel you have the skills and want to contribute towards Skyblivion's success, you can become a volunteer.
The team also recently celebrated eight years of continuous work that's gone into the project. As it stands, the fan remake is due to release sometime in 2025, so there are still a couple more years to go. The best thing about it is it'll be completely free. You just need official copies of both Skyrim and Oblivion, as well as the expansions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Humble Games and developer Crema have revealed Temtem Showdown, a new standalone battle-focused game, and it's out right now. 
This surprise reveal comes less than a year after the full 1.0 release of Temtem, the game that Showdown is based on. Similar to Pokemon Showdown, Temtem Showdown is all about battling. It's also free to everyone. 
"Temtem Showdown takes the best Temtem competitive action and places it within immediate reach for everyone," a press release reads. "Get to know the colorful critters from the massively multiplayer creature-collection adventure, build your team in seconds, and dash into battle to test it out against other players and their teams – or carefully curate a plan of action to overpower your opponents." 
Unlike Temtem, which is a multiplayer Pokemon-like game where you catch and train Temtem to use in 2 vs. 2 battles, Showdown will let players build a team from scratch right from the jump. And then you can hop right into a battle, without needing to worry about their level like you might in the base game. You can play against other players both casually and competitively, and the latter will feature a ranked system and a ladder to climb up as you play. 
Crema says Showdown will receive regular balance patches to keep the meta fair, and new Seasons will bring additional content and changes as well. 
For more, read our thoughts on the base game in Game Informer's Temtem review.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back on the shores of hell
In 2020, Nightdive Studios released a source port of the oft-forgotten Doom 64 that brought it to modern platforms and reintroduced it to a new, more receptive audience. Beyond simply porting it, however, they added a new episode that better links it to the rest of the Doom series narrative. Now fans have implemented the new episode back into the N64 version as Doom 64: Complete Edition.
This means that if you, for whatever reason (not judging), preferred the N64 version of Doom 64, you can play it again without sacrificing the extra features of Nightdive Studios’ source port. This all sounds really difficult, since the 2020 version runs on Nightdive’s proprietary Kex Engine. I’m assuming the maps still exist in an extractable format because I imagine it would be too much work to try to manually recreate them for a release such as this.
[caption id="attachment_388694" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via MobyGames[/caption]
Beyond simply adding the extra maps, Doom 64: Complete Edition adds a number of quality-of-life upgrades. You can find them at this link. One of the most important revisions for me, however, is the ability to disable three-point texture filtering. This was what was mostly to blame for everything on the N64 looking blurry. They also improved the framerate in some areas and enabled support for the Expansion Pak upgrade. That’s some good stuff!
If you haven’t played Doom 64, it’s definitely worth checking out. It always had its fans, but Nightdive’s port helped force a wider re-assessment of Midway’s contribution to the series. Personally, I don’t think it’s better than Doom, but I might put it above Doom 2. However, it has its own style and approach to the series’ formula.
The Doom 64: Complete Edition fan patch can be found here.

Showdown was the mode's name; something for the animal fight pit lovers in the room, rather than the plain old animal lovers. That mode has now been spun into a free standalone release aptly called Temtem Showdown, out now.

The cookies feature 16 unique embossments starring characters like Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Goomba, and Bowser Jr., as well as power-ups like Super Stars and Fire Flowers. Packs will be filled at random. Oreo is also holding a social media event where they're asking those who buy the cookies to stack as many of the hero-embossed cookies on the rim of a glass of milk without the cookies falling into the milk and share the video on social media in a concerted effort to save Princess Peach from Bowser's Castle.
"We hope to unite cookie lovers and Super Mario enthusiasts alike with this playful mission, inspired by a storyline fans know all too well," Oreo senior brand manager Vishnu Nair said in a press release. "We may even reveal a surprise as a thank you to those who successfully defeat Bowser and save the kingdom... Fans will have to wait and see!"
You can check out a fun musical trailer for the collaboration below.


The Oreo x Super Mario cookies will begin rolling out to retailers nationwide starting July 10, but will only be available for a limited time.

Yes, you read that headline correctly. Outright Games has today announced that it is collaborating with The Pinkfong Company (the team behind the Baby Shark IP) to release Baby Shark: Sing & Swim Party, a video game based on the immensely popular/annoying YouTube video which will be making its way to Switch on 15th September.
Sing & Swim Party is a rhythm adventure game where you will play as one of the five members of the Shark family (Baby, Mommy, Daddy, Grandma or Grandpa) making your way to the Fin-Tastic Festival. The gameplay seems to consist of either a 'Rhythm Mode' or a 'Runner Mode' where the objective is to keep to the beat of a variety of popular Baby Shark songs.

If you've played Alan Wake Remastered on the Switch (or any other platform, for that matter) then you'll have no doubt noticed that the opening line is quite unique in that it directly quotes the exceptionally popular author, Stephen King.
This was a deliberate decision from the game's writer Sam Lake, who told Eurogamer that he "really, really, desperately wanted" to be able to open the game with a King quote specifically, presumably because the story itself pulls a great deal of inspiration from King's extensive work.

Yep, only one of the games in the "trilogy" will be included physically, and you'll need to download the rest. Don't just take it from me, read the entire FAQ entry on the game's official site:
Does the Nintendo Switch physical version of Batman: Arkham Trilogy include all three games on one cartridge?
Batman: Arkham Asylum will be included on the Batman: Arkham Trilogy game cartridge. Batman: Arkham City and Batman: Arkham Knight will require an online connection to download and install both titles when the Batman: Arkham Trilogy cartridge is inserted into the Nintendo Switch console. All three games will then be playable as long as the cartridge is inserted into the Nintendo Switch console.

Welp! At least you get "all previously released DLC" with that download when it comes out this fall!
This is part of a longer trend for third-party games
Although The Witcher 3 managed to cram the game on a higher-capacity cart, many third-party Switch games have suffered the same fate as the Arkham Trilogy. In fact, Arkham wasn't the only series that's fending off criticism in that very same Nintendo Direct, as Konami revealed that Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol 1 would also require massive downloads.
Start clearing up your SD space now if you're partaking in either of them later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Possibly next-gen?
We're already painfully aware that Bethesda is taking its sweet time with The Elder Scrolls 6. However, there may be longer to wait still, as even the Head of Xbox Gaming, Phil Spencer, admits he doesn't even know what platform it's going to be on. There may be a few more years to go until the anticipated sequel ever sees the light of day.
And exactly how long are we talking? Well, according to journalist Stephen Totilo, (reporting on the Microsoft/Activision court case), Spencer npted that Elder Scrolls 6 could be "five-plus years away." If true, this would put the elusive Skyrim follow-up on track for a 2028 release at the earliest. As such, it could mean that the long-awaited Bethesda RPG is actually on deck for gaming's next generation.
https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1672314548995366935
According to a recent report from The Verge, Spencer did say in a 2021 interview that it will be exclusive to Xbox, though it doesn't necessarily mean it will be this generation's Xbox. When questioned about this today, the executive doesn't recall ever making such a statement. And so, it stands, we're not really any closer to understanding what's happening with the next Elder Scrolls installment. A couple of years ago, Todd Howard said the game was still in early development.
All we can really hope is that once Starfield is released this September, then Bethesda will be willing to spill a few more beans. We can assume that, for now, the studio is just keeping its cards close to its chest.

Amidst all the madness though, one indie has been able to blast through the noise to become a smash hit on Steam - only sitting behind CS:GO on the sales charts - and potentially one of this year’s biggest shooters. That impressive feat goes to BattleBit Remastered, a 254-player FPS that mixes Battlefield’s large-scale skirmishes, Roblox’s low-poly aesthetics, and some wild destructible environments.

A little less than a week ago, Nintendo once again showed us the staying power of the Direct, and gave us a ton of announcements and a few surprise releases. We have a full recap here, but if you're a visual learner, Nintendo recently tweeted out a full infographic of what was announced or reconfirmed; with the first-party cream rising to the top.
[caption id="attachment_388663" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Nintendo[/caption]
If I had to guess what would win a "most excited" poll, it would be Mario RPG
I'm still cautiously optimistic about Super Mario Bros. Wonder (I hope the gimmicks are more than skin-deep), but based on the almost universally-positive reaction to the Super Mario RPG revival, I'd say that takes the highest hype spot. I mean, it's at the top of my list too! Re-releasing Pikmin 1 and 2 was a genius move as well, as you can get the entire mainline Pikmin series on one platform now. That's kind of become a calling card for the Nintendo Switch: a successor to the 3DS in its own right, collecting both old, new, and new-again games in one spot.
As for Detective Pikachu Returns, it's in a super weird spot. We're years removed from the film, and I'm the only person I know who actually played the original Detective Pikachu from start to finish. It'll be interesting to see how the game performs, and if it gets another gigantic amiibo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Battle Beyond the Stars
Bethesda has confirmed that the "Constellation Edition" of its upcoming space opera Starfield will not contain an actual disc of the game itself, and will instead feature a download code for the chosen platform. The publisher noted this controversial development in a tweet from its support team.
"Hello!" said the team, responding directly to a fan's question. "All physical editions include a code for the chosen platform. There are no physical discs". The tweet has since been deleted from Twitter.
The community understandably responded unhappily to the news, with some decrying the return of "non-physical physical editions", while others pointed to the continued slant toward a future where archiving games becomes a much-more-difficult venture without hard copies of the games themselves. The response was overwhelmingly negative, with some, (some as Twitter's Wario64), pointing out that certain adverts for Starfield's physical release had clearly stated that a disc was included.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYEiTdsyas
The removal of the initial tweet suggested that there were crossed wires somewhere along the chain of communication. And that indeed proved to be the case, as it now seems that while the standard edition of Starfield will feature a physical disc including game code, it is purely the $250 Constellation Edition that will not — a digital download code for the title being issued as part of this version. And so, anybody who wishes to pick up the Collector's Edition and own a physical disc of the sci-fi spectacle will, at this stage, be required to pick up both versions.
Starfield launches September 6 on PC and Xbox Series X/S.

That tragically forced many gamers to step outside during the hottest weekend in recent memory. Thankfully, Blizzard now states the DDoS attacks have ended, meaning everything should be working as normal.

For the uninitiated, Sonic Origins launched one year ago today, letting players speed through Sonic the Hedgehog 1, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and Sonic 3 & Knuckles from the Sega Genesis, as well as Sonic CD from Sega CD with the option to play as Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles in all of them (except Knuckles in Sonic CD, for some reason). You can play through them in Classic Mode, which retains the original aspect ratio and lives system of the games, or in Anniversary Mode, which adds n…]]></summary>

Seeing all the great demos this week has made me far more excited about the future of video games than any of the notE3 streams did the other week, and I'm not gonna lie, a large part of my excitement stems from the brilliant Let's! Revolution!, a beautifully animated tile-based roguelite that has a touch of Minesweeper about it. I highlighted it in our big demo rec list at the start of the week, but 150-odd words simply wasn't enough to really get across just how excellent this is. So indulge me a bit while I tell you more about it.

This news comes from yesterday's court trial between Xbox (and Activision Blizzard) and the Federal Trade Commission over Microsoft's attempted acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Bond claimed in court that, in the leadup to the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S generation of hardware in 2020, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said his company did not intend to put Call of Duty – presumably new, upcoming ones – on the Xbox platform unless Microsoft shared more revenue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Sonic Central stream to celebrate the anniversary of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, Sonic Team announced that the second free content update on Sonic Frontiers' 2023 roadmap, titled Sonic's Birthday Bash, is available today. The update was announced in November 2022 as part of the game's 2023 roadmap.
The Sonic's Birthday Bash update adds new challenges, moves, and a new kind of collectible Koco for Sonic. The update also promises free birthday decorations for our hero, as well as the addition of New Game Plus. As is standard with most New Game Plus modes, you can begin the adventure from the start with all of your skill tree and power-up levels carried over into the new file.
Sonic's Birthday Bash arrives free to download beginning today at 5 p.m. PT / 8 p.m. ET. The first of three content updates arrived in March, adding a photo mode, Cyber Space Challenges, and Battle Rush mode, plus a jukebox featuring collectible songs from Sonic's past. The third update, which promises to be the most substantial, adds new playable characters and a new story and is set to arrive later this year.

That's the journey I've been on with deckbuilding RPG Cross Blitz this week. I first heard about it last month back when word hit that it was coming to early access this year, and I was instantly taken with its chunky animal character sprites. There was something a bit Advance Wars about the look and style about its burly lion pirate captain, but just, you know, in a high seas card battle kind of setting instead of dealing with sergeants, tanks and air support. But its Steam Next Fest demo has really sunk its teeth into me this week, offering up turn-based card duels that scratch exactly the same kind of itch as Inscryption did for me a couple of years ago.

As you might imagine, today's Sonic Central also shined a spotlight on the highly anticipated 2D Sonic game. We received a new trailer that showed off some new DLC coming to Sonic Superstars that features a collaboration with the Lego brand.
Players will be able to download a free Lego Sonic DLC skin to give the Blue Blur a new, bricky look. In addition, those who preorder Sonic Superstars will receive a Lego Eggman skin as well. You can see the new trailer below.


While Sonic is a recent addition to the Lego stable of characters, he appeared in the 2015 toys-to-life game Lego Dimensions, where he received specialized stages geared towards the speedy playstyle. However, it wasn't until 2021 that Lego officially greenlit a fan creation featuring Green Hill Zone from Sonic Mania. Then, earlier this year, Lego announced four new Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets, which will be available in August.
Sonic Superstars arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year. For more, check out our hands-on preview right here.]]></summary>

Usually, when I read a game description like that, I’m already grabbing my cushion to hide behind and readying my cute puppy compilation video on a second screen, but Team17 have heavily leaned into the campy side of slasher horror with humour serving as the perfect buffer. No safety cushion or puppies needed here, folks. 
Here’s the set-up: You’re playing as Forrest Nash, a big-time radio DJ who has found himself stuck in Small Town, Nowhere, USA. While you're working as the host for the town’s local station, it turns out the police chief has only gone and gotten themselves stabbed by a serial killer. With them out of action, you’re roped into acting as a stand-in 911 operator - and with the murderer still on the loose and ready to strike again, that line is going to be pretty busy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday marked the first day of proceedings in the legal battle between Microsoft and the US Federal Trade Commission as the FTC seeks a preliminary injunction on Microsoft and Activision Blizzard. The injunction would further prevent Microsoft's acquisition deal of Activision Blizzard from going through. 

Several of Xbox's high profile figures testified at the first day of trial, including the likes of Sarah Bond, corporate vice president of gaming partnerships and business development at Microsoft, Bethesda head of publishing Pete Hines, and Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty. They were questioned on a range of things including cloud gaming, Call Of Duty exclusivity, and Bobby Kotick's revenue share demands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a bunch of reasons I like The Tartarus Key (enough to make it our RPS Game Club pick this month), and one of them is that it's not actually scary. Like, sure, you could attach the horror tag to it on Steam if you wanted, but it's more of a costume for you to enjoy - like the family down the street who are really into Halloween and turn their suburban semi into a haunted house with a movie-quality zombie in the front yard. It's really cool and you like it on its own terms, but being frightened isn't so much the point as it is to remember you have enjoyed being frightened in the past. Also, for some reason the family won't let you out of the living room until you complete a logic puzzle involving maths.

It's been emotional whiplash for some PC fans. A PC version was specified in the game's announcement trailer, and then FF16 producer Yoshi-P walked it back and said that didn't happen, and then Yoshi-P addressed his previous words and said he'd like to bring the game to PC eventually. Just don't expect it within six months. Or before 2024, actually.

Then a character opens their mouth, and the dialogue and how it’s delivered is so cringeworthy that you’re ready to jump ship. Sometimes that’s bad writing. But when we’re talking about a game from a different part of the world, it’s just as likely that questionable localization is the culprit. 
Localization and translation are difficult. Doing it exceptionally well is exceedingly difficult. Often, minute cultural differences in how storytelling is delivered in different places can add up; in the aggregate, those minor differences can alienate players from another region.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda's Indiana Jones game, which is currently being developed by Wolfenstein developer Machine Games, will be exclusive to Xbox. 
This news comes from an ongoing court trial between the Federal Trade Commission and Xbox (and Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft is trying to acquire) happening today, which is where Bethesda's Head of Publishing Pete Hines revealed the game will be a console exclusive on Xbox, as reported by IGN. Like Xbox's other first-party releases, Machine Games' Indiana Jones game will also come to PC. 
However, Hines also revealed that Disney and Bethesda parent company ZeniMax originally signed an agreement that this Indiana Jones game would be multiplatform, meaning it'd likely also release on PlayStation. Hines says after Microsoft acquired ZeniMax in 2020, the agreement with Disney was amended to transition the Indiana Jones game away from a multiplatform release and instead, into one that will release exclusively on Xbox and PC.


Today's court trial also revealed that Xbox head Phil Spencer told Hines that Bethesda should look at title exclusivity on a case-by-case basis, IGN reports. As for why Indiana Jones was transitioned into an exclusive, Hines cited "reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity." 
"You're dealing with a licensor who is giving a ton of feedback on what you're making, is going to add a ton of time to your scheduling, these agreements, you don't get to take as long as you want, you have a window of time in which you're going to release a game, you immediately have a clock that's ticking on you," Hines said, according to IGN.
Bethesda revealed Machine Games' Indiana Jones game back in 2021 with a short teaser trailer, and that was the last we've seen of it. However, Bethesda head Todd Howard says he first pitched this Indiana Jones game way back in 2009. There's still no release window for the game today.

From its explosive story to its fast-paced and robust combat, it’s a treat for any Final Fantasy fan, especially those looking for an extra dose of action. However, it’s still a Final Fantasy, meaning there are dozens of hours of content to experience, from the main story to the side quests, hunts, and more. 
With FFXVI now behind me after more than 65 hours (although I’m still tinkering with the idea of getting the Platinum trophy for it on PlayStation 5), I’m excited to share with you 10 tips and tricks I think you should know before getting started in FFXVI. And look, if you began FFXVI at midnight right when it…]]></summary>

While Sonic Mania was a 2D platformer, the studio's first game under their new name brings them into the realm of 3D, taking an incredibly vibrant colour palette that would certainly work in any classic Sonic game, and marrying it a world that one could say is mildly reminiscent of the hedgehog's rival Mario.

It apparently helps to crib the mining, mineral hoarding, and maladroit approach to industrial safety that makes source material Deep Rock Galactic one of the best FPS games going.
Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is in the works at Funday Games, not original DRG devs and fellow Danish outfit Ghost Ship Games. But it does fall under the latter’s new publishing arm, Ghost Ship Publishing, and can trace its origins back to a casual meeting between Funday co-founder Anders Leicht Rohde and Ghost Ship CEO Søren Lundgaard – and beyond.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remakes tend to be more exciting than remasters because the improvements often go beyond mere bumps in resolution or framerate. At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window.

From now on, EA Games will be known as EA Entertainment, which really doesn't have as good a ring to it (no one's going to be quoting "it's in the entertainment," any time soon are they?). The name change does imply a broader expansion into more than just games, but it's obviously a bit of a wait and see kind of situation until EA show off something that isn't a video game.

It's an adaptation on one of Toriyama's lesser-known mangas, which features a band of misfits who aim to right the wrongs of a king who's hogged the desert's vital water supply. I got to play it for all of 20 minutes, in a demo that was as stripped back as a grated cactus. Still, I got to sample a bit of roaming about in a tank, one brief stop at a town, an opening of one (1) chest, and some fighting. It seemed okay, I guess? But my main worry is whether its desert is interesting enough to hold people's attention.

However, it can be difficult. As someone with dozens of hours in the game (and still playing more as I stretch into its endgame content) and a pretty good handle on FFXVI’s combat, I’m here to help with that! Here are 10 tips and tricks to help you dominate the battlefield in FFXVI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has done a great job making some truly inventive special edition Xbox Series controllers, and their latest effort is one that uses the 'NASA-punk' aesthetics of upcoming big budget Bethesda RPG Starfield. The controller looks phenomenal, but it does cost a fair bit - so I thought it was worth letting you know that the early adopter tax has been lifted, and the controller is now down to £65. 
That's still fairly expensive, but given that this controller seems destined to sell out - as it has done in the US - then I thought it was worth bringing up regardless.

There are flayed corpses everywhere, fathers are haunted by the ghosts of their dead sons, blokes cram flaming eyeballs into their skulls and sometimes a guy turns up at random just to stomp you (and a lot of other people) into fleshy jam on the ground. Given all the abject suffering that the game and its predecessors make their stock and trade, it was an especially nice surprise to see real, genuine positivity emerge out of the literal hellscape of Sanctuary.

That makes it a cheaper alternative to their PCIe 4.0 drives with DRAM, but still more than fast enough for PC gaming. Therefore, it's worth knowing that the 1TB 980 is now available for less than £40 at Amazon, a £16 reduction from its usual price and less than half the cost it debuted at back in 2021.

In childish, whimsical fashion as a childish, whimsical child, I grab my pair of chopsticks and start hitting them together as if I'm a drummer. "Olivia, don't do that," my mum scolds me. "Your grandma always used to tell me off when I did that as a child." Sullenly, I put the chopsticks back down on the table.

Well, 10 year old me, you're in for a treat. If you wait a couple of decades, you'll learn of Nour: Play With Your Food, a game which allows you to bang together chopsticks. The game wants you to. Nour is a physics simulation of a variety of foods, where you can choose the ingredients for the dish and add various "effects" of a non-culinary nature.

During today's Nintendo Direct, we got our first details on Wave 5 of the Booster Course Pass DLC, which is set to hit within the next couple of months.
Booster Course Pass Wave 5 will feature an all-new course in the bathroom-themed Squeaky Clean Sprint, as well as three new characters. Petey Piranha, who made his debut in Mario Kart: Double Dash; Wiggler, who debuted in Mario Kart 7; and Kamek, who appears in Mario Kart Tour (and was a character in Mario Kart 64 before being replaced by Donkey Kong in the retail version) are all set to join the roster of playable racers in this wave of DLC. Seven more courses will join the pack as well, but we have no indication of which tracks those will be just yet. You can see the announcement trailer below.


Wave 5 of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass arrives this summer. The Booster Course Pass is included as a part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription plan, or you can buy the DLC pack itself for $25.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Ocean: The Second Story is getting an HD-2D overhaul that slaps the letter R at the end of the title, a nod to the fact that it’s a remake.
The game first launched for PlayStation in 1998 (1999 in the U.S.) and stars protagonists Claude, a human federation officer, and Rena, a mystically powered girl, who players choose to control in separate campaigns. The game heavily emphasizes decision-making as your choices determine which of many playable allies you meet along the way join your party. 


This enhanced remake includes a modernized version of the game’s real-time combat; players can now stun enemies with chain attacks. Another cool addition is that party members not in combat can still lend a hand by executing assist-style follow-up attacks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom arrived on May 12, its launch was accompanied by an Amiibo of Link. But Link was far from the only star of Nintendo's most popular game of 2023. During today's Nintendo Direct, the company announced the two other stars, Zelda and Ganondorf, are also set to receive Amiibo figures.
While the Tears of the Kingdom Link Amiibo is somewhat disappointing in its functionality (mostly the same as its Breath of the Wild counterpart), it provides special fabric for Link's paraglider. It appears as though fans should expect similar functionality from the upcoming Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures, as the press release promises "valuable in-game items, as well as special fabric for the paraglider." 
The Tears of the Kingdom Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures arrive later this holiday season. For more on what each Amiibo in the Legend of Zelda series does within The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, check out our Amiibo guide here.

This brand-new adventure sports a revamped art style (and more expressive characters) and stars the familiar foursome of Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad in addition to Daisy and Yoshi.


The 2D worlds sport trippy features caused by a new power-up called the Wonder Flower. This transforms the world and gameplay in unexpected ways; pipes come to life, Mario can stretch his body to absurd lengths, and hordes of stampeding rhinos can appear, among other wacky effects. The biggest gasp came from a new power-up that transformed Mario into an elephant. Yes, you read that right. Mario's an elephant now, and it looks delightfully ridiculous.

More specifically, the Arkham Trilogy is due out this fall and promises to allow players to experience "the definitive versions of Rocksteady's Arkham Trilogy games." This trilogy also includes all post-launch content, including DLC expansions, suits, Batmobiles, and more. All three of these games have been available elsewhere for years but this trilogy marks the first time Switch players can play through all three games. 
Check out Batman: Arkham Trilogy in the reveal trailer below: 


Unfortunately, this trilogy does not include the (pretty great) Batman: Arkham Origins, which wasn't developed by Rocksteady; it was developed by Gotham Knights developer WB Games Montreal. However, the three games in this trilogy are still great, so it's still a good get for the Switch platform.]]></summary>

The company revealed this during today's Nintendo Direct, highlighting the unique ways players can use two Joy-Con (and body movement) to complete microgames. One example shows a player using Joy-Con to balance Mario sliding in Super Mario 64. There's also plenty of first-person Wario action as well, with one microgame showing Wario trying to break out of what appears to be a jail cell. 


As you'd expect, WarioWare: Move It features a very unique, albeit strange, art style. Plus, it features two-player local co-op and a special Party Mode that allows up to four players to play various microgames together. 
WarioWare: Move It hits Switch on November 3.]]></summary>

As you might expect, Penny's Big Breakaway is a colorful platformer with a focus on movement and traversal. Here's the game's full description:
"In this 3D platforming adventure, you’ll explore the bright and colorful world of Macaroon, and help Penny and Yo-Yo escape the clutches of the grouchy Emperor Eddie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pikmin 4 is right around the corner, but that didn't stop Nintendo from flooding us with new information about the game during today's Nintendo Direct. From a new underground area, to night expeditions, to a new demo out next week, here's everything you need to know about Pikmin 4.


The main draw in the newest game in the Pikmin series is Oatchi, a dog-like companion that assists you and your Pikmin as you try to survive the cute and hostile alien world. In addition to helping out with lifting and pushing items, you and your Pikmin can ride him across land and water. You'll also be able to upgrade his abilities over time, increasing the amount of damage he does, the number of Pikmin he can carry, or the total weight of objects he can push.
You'll need those upgraded abilities to explore Pikmin 4's new underground areas, which appear to be more heavily centered around contraption-based puzzles. With more treasures and new enemies, it's a lot less open than the aboveground portions, but should provide an interesting challenge.
Finally, Pikmin 4 marks the first time in the series your explorer will be able to go on nighttime expeditions. Wild creatures are in a frenzy, making them much more dangerous, but you'll have the help of the new Glow Pikmin, a species only out at night. Instead of throwing them one by one, you can focus them into one glowing energy ball to release all at once, doing huge amounts of damage.
If you want to try it for yourself, a demo for Pikmin 4 will be available on the Nintendo eShop on June 28. The full game will be released one month from today, on July 21. For more on the game, check out the recent trailer that reveals you can customize your explorer, or download Pikmin 1 and 2 on your Switch right now.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Persona 5 Tactica was announced recently through the Xbox Games Showcase, but details on gameplay were limited. Today’s Nintendo Direct brought us a closer look at the game while highlighting the project's appearance on Switch consoles.
In the game, the group from Persona 5 is pulled into a new world, where they join forces with a new character named Erina, who is fighting as a revolutionary against the prevailing power in that place.
Gameplay allows for both up-close and ranged attacks over the course of its turn-based tactics encounters, but you can also use Personas to get your point across. Knocking enemies down opens up the “One More” action to double up damage. The game also encourages canny positioning choices, since surrounding your foes with three characters opens up the “Triple Threat” ability to deal big damage.
Drawing from the capability seen in Persona 5, you can also fuse Personas to create new ones.
Persona 5 Tactica is coming to PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as Switch, on November 17.]]></summary>

It's called Detective Pikachu Returns, and the chatty, gruff-voiced Pikachu and his human partner Tim Goodman have a new batch of mysteries to solve in Ryme City. While we don't have a great sense of the game's plot or features, we'd wager there's plenty of investigative gameplay and puzzle-solving.


The first Detective Pikachu launched in 2016 for 3DS and was adapted into a live-action film in 2019.  We'll have to watch out to learn more about this follow-up in the coming weeks.]]></summary>

Nintendo announced this during today's Nintendo Direct, stopping short of really any details beyond that. The company didn't reveal a name or any details about gameplay, but it did actually show gameplay and it looks exactly how you'd expect. We control Peach in a 3D world that looks reminiscent of something we'd see in a Super Mario RPG.
One interesting thing the Direct did reveal was that when Peach steps on a special pedestal, her outfit changes, going from her usual pink dress to a bright, light blue dress that seems to indicate she's powered up in some way. But the reveal ends there, with Nintendo promising more information at a later date. The last game to star Peach as the main character was 2005's Super Princess Peach for DS.]]></summary>

The original Super Mario RPG was released for the Super Nintendo in 1996.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last February, Game Freak revealed that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet had DLC in the works, but all we got to show for it was a few pieces of concept art and static images of new Pokémon. Today changed that, as the Nintendo Direct showed off in-game footage for the very first time. Check it out for yourself below.


Titled “The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero,” this DLC comes in two waves. The Teal Mask is slated for this fall, while The Indigo Disk will come this winter. The first expansion will be available to play as soon as the player begins the treasure hunt, which happens a few hours into the game. Meanwhile, The Indigo Disk will require you to complete the entirety of the main story plus the previous expansion.
The first of the two expansions, The Teal Mask, will bring trainers to the land of Kitakami, an area completely distinct from the Paldea region they were born in. The adventure takes place during some kind of festival, and players will be tasked with unraveling mysteries tied to the local folklore. Part two, The Indigo Disk, takes place at Blueberry Academy, a school similar to Naranja and Uva Academy. As an exchange student, you’ll get to take classes, interact with students, and participate in the school’s battle-focused curriculum.
While the trailers didn't provide any major new announcements, we got another look at Pokémon we already knew about, like Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti in the Teal Mask and Terapagos in The Indigo Disk. There are also new looks at the DLC's exclusive characters Carmine and Kieran.
No specific dates were announced today, but The Teal Mask will still be released this Fall, while the Indigo Disk will be released sometime this winter.]]></summary>

Final Fantasy XVI is bombastic, indulgent, and extreme, breaking far beyond the limits of what I thought an action-oriented Final Fantasy could pull off. It represents a pivotal shift for the series, ditching any semblance of turn-based move selection, active-time battles, or anything else in its history in favor of a fast-paced, extravagant, combo-heavy combat system that continued to grow more robust throughout my 60-plus hour journey. 
There’s a linear action game in FFXVI, and it’s the highlight of the experience. But standard RPG tropes, mechanics, …]]></summary>

Thankfully for me, there's been a fair few riffs on Dorformantik's formula recently - a focus on nature, a soothing soundtrack, and some good old puzzling. Growth is one of these, and I'm hooked on the demo that's playable as part of Steam Next Fest. Taking place on a hexagonal grid, the aim is to uncover the map using a range of wildlife, fertilising the land in the process. Each tile you reveal gives you points, and you'll have to navigate around mountains, water, and special landmarks.

From what Manuel Bronstein, Roblox's Chief Product Officer, shared in an official blog post yesterday, it seems that it'll be on creators to label their experiences as mature, which "may contain more violence, blood, or crude humour" than usual experiences.
The introduction of age appropriate access is not for safety primarily, as Roblox say they want to "simulate and even go beyond what's possible in the real world". Bronstein also added that, "We want to replicate that dynamic on Roblox," referring to the idea of getting older and legally being allowed to enter places such as nightclubs.

The stand-off reached the boiling point in March when broadcasters formed a new anti-piracy coalition and warned of punishing legal action. Noonoo TV responded by throwing in the towel but after clone site 'Noonoo TV Season 2' appeared online, the government says it will develop an AI anti-piracy system that will stop any 'Season 3' variants in their tracks.

It's around 85 to 90 percent of the performance at less than 70 percent of the cost - although you do give up better power efficiency and DLSS 3 on the newer model. 
We've highlighted a few UK RTX 3060 Ti deals before, but here's one for the US market courtesy of Best Buy - on a PNY unit with a simple dual-fan design, plenty of cooling potential and a price that makes a lot of sense: $275, down from a previous price of $320 and considerably less than the $399 Nvidia is asking for their 4060 Ti FE.

According to the latest research, this phenomena can be observed on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, specifically the UK and the US, with discounts applied on both sides. This makes it a better time to buy this particular item than times when it is more expensive, generally speaking. 
The specifics are as follows: the Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7900 XTX has been discounted from $1000 to $900 in the US (tick the $100 code on the product page), while Sapphire's AMD reference design has dropped from £1099 to £949 in the UK (no ticking required).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immortals of Aveum was revealed with a short teaser trailer at the 2022 Game Awards. The implication of the teaser was that it was a game in early development, which is why it was a surprise when the game was revealed to be releasing July 20, 2023. That release date has now slipped, but only be a few weeks. It is now launching a month and a couple of days later, on August 22.
You can find the full delay statement, signed by developer Ascendant Studios and the game's director, Bret Robbins, below.
As you know, this is our first game as a self-funded independent studio. We set out five years ago to ambitiously make an original Magic FPS in a new fantasy world. Along the way, we worked through a pandemic, built a new team, developed on Unreal Engine 5.1 and pushed the boundaries of what we thought was possible. Now, the finish line is in sight.
The recent feedback to the game proves to us what we already felt: that Immortals of Aveum is something special. In order to realize our full vision, we are going to take a few extra weeks, making our new launch date Tuesday, August 22nd. This will give us time to further polish the game, finish optimizing all platforms, and deliver a strong launch. We owe it to ourselves and to you to get this right.
For more on Immortals of Aveum's delay, you can find an official blog post here. For some of our positive hands-on impressions of the game, head here.]]></summary>

From Software reached a critical and commercial apex in 2022 when it released Elden Ring, its most popular game to date by a large margin. And now that it's become a household name in the gaming world, the studio is going back to its roots.

This guide is keeping separate from the best Steam Deck microSD card list, mainly because a good microSD card is less of an accessory and more of a core essential (especially if you’ve gone for the 64GB Steam Deck model). Still, this guide will cover an array of addons, from alternative cases to thumbstick covers and USB-C docking stations.

Initially revealed on stage during Sony's 2014 E3 press conference, Dead Island 2 had an infamously rocky road to release. What briefly began in the early 2010s at Techland, the developer behind the first Dead Island and similar open-world zombie game Dying Light, then moved to Yager Development, then Sumo Digital, and then finally, Deep Silver's Dambuster Studio, was for many years a giant question mark in the game industry. Its publisher, Deep Silver, spent many of those years saying little to nothing about the game other than vague confirmations that it was still in development. Until it resurfaced in late 2022, a seeming sign that Dead Island 2 would see the light of day – which i…]]></summary>

June 20, 2023
While Nintendo's presence was typically a given back when E3 was still around, its relative silence over the last month left many to doubt whether or not there would be a summer showcase at all. The company's Twitter account has also been the source of a scattered handful of announcements lately, posting everything from new Joy-Con colors to a sequel to 1-2 Switch to a new trailer for Pikmin 4. Still, Nintendo has plenty to announce, whether it's something we expect (like Metroid Prime 4) or something entirely new.
We'll find out for ourselves at the livestream tomorrow.

But as he pulled away, he caught a snippet of our conversation that was so unusual it's the reason this seemingly normal car ride has cemented itself as a core memory. We were talking about the price of eggs. And tomatoes. And the order in which we were planting crops to ensure the greatest yield.


My poor father interrupted us, turning in his seat to ask what the hell we were talking about. “It’s a game we’re both playing called Harvest Moon” I scoffed in his direction. “You wouldn’t understand”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Callisto Protocol will be getting its first and only bit of story DLC next week, which Striking Distance are describing as the game's "heart-pounding final chapter". Entitled Final Transmission, a short teaser trailer has been released giving us a look at what protagonist Jacob Lee will be getting up to, but it doesn't really show us all that much. There seems to be some kind of fleshy robot monster that says he'll "never escape," but that's all we've got to go off right now.

The Plus expansion will bring remastered visuals, bonus characters, new modes and challenges to the original Sonic Origins compilation, but it's the audio quality of the 12 new Sonic Game Gear additions that fans seem to have taken issue with. As spotted by TheGamer, fans who have got their hands on copies of the game early, such as YouTuber belmont gr, are reporting that the Game Gear games sound off, like there's some kind of echo effect.

I got to chat with principal designer Sandro Sammarco last week, and he told me they've been hard at work making sure it's "filled with loads of cool new stuff that people really haven't seen before". He also said that their partnership with Games Workshop has allowed them to "really go to town in terms of the visuals, the lore, [and] the story that we're telling", and he hopes that the way they've characterised the campaign's principal faction, the Stormcast Eternals, will give players plenty to sink their teeth into when it launches in full.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the same way that Alien: Isolation is, for many, now the definitive Ridley Scott’s Alien game, I’ve got no problem getting all ‘game critic who wants to feel important by making wild declarative statements’ and saying that Aliens: Dark Descent is now, for me at least, the definitive James Cameron’s Aliens game. It’s the first to really capture the white-knuckle vibe of setting up perimeters, quipping out that last line of top-tier banter you’ve been saving, and seeing the shapes on the motion tracker creep closer and squeal louder. It really does do the license justice, so if that’s what you’re looking for, dig in. I just wish it trusted me to be able to count higher than one. Not that much higher, either. Just four.
Dark Descent is not a game for strategy game fans nearly as much as it’s one for Aliens fans. You order your entire squad around at the same time, pausing or slowing time to issue commands like grenades or suppressive fire, using a stock of command points that refill over time. It’s a game that’s (rightly) decided that a very particular type of strategy game is the best format to convey Aliens’ whole schtick, but then seems to have realised, hang on, we’re at risk of (alien) isolating and possibly even (alien)ating a lot of potential customers here. What if there was a way to do XCOM but without all the knobbly bits?

It's true that higher-end models offer more features and can support better overclocking performance, but for the vast majority of people you're better off putting your budget towards the highest-tier graphics card and processor you can afford - as these actually determine in-game performance! - then slotting in the cheapest motherboard that gets decent reviews and supports your components. 
One excellent example of just such a motherboard is the Gigabyte B760M Gaming X DDR4, a simple option that supports 12th/13th-gen Intel processors all the way up to the 13900K. With an asking price of just £116 right now, you can pick up this plus a cheap 16GB DDR4 RAM kit for just £152, letting you spend the vast majority of your PC budget where it really matters.

        <updated>2023-06-19T15:54:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last December, Deadline reported that a Death Stranding movie was in the works. Kojima Productions, the studio that made the original game, was set to be one of two main producers, but there was no word on who would write, direct, or star in the film, or if any members of the original creative team would occupy any of those roles. Yesterday, Death Stranding's game director Hideo Kojima took to Twitter to clarify his involvement.
Just to be clear, I am deeply involved in producing, supervising, plotting, look, design and content of the film adaptation of DS, just not in charge of directing.
June 18, 2023
Here, Kojima confirms that he will not be directing the movie, but fans worried that Kojima Productions' involvement wouldn't involve input from the man at its helm can rest easy. In addition to his role as producer, Kojima will be "deeply involved" with many other elements of the film, including its plot and overall aesthetics. While the movie takes place in the existing Death Stranding world, it will "introduce new elements and characters within the Death Stranding universe," according to Deadline. Whether that consists of a retelling of an existing plot or an entirely new one is unclear, but it will certainly have that distinct Kojima touch.
In addition to the film-focused branch of Kojima Productions, the film will be produced by Hammerstone Studios. Founded in 2018, the studio's best-known films include Barbarian (2022) and Bill and Ted Face the Music (2020). The studio's founder, Alex Lebovici, had the following to say to Deadline about the upcoming project:
Given the fact that the production teams have yet to announce any director, writer or actor that's attached to the project (I'm hoping it involves Nicolas Cage), it's still a few years out. If you're dying for more Kojima before then, you can re-watch the Death Stranding 2 reveal trailer or fantasize about the game Kojima wants to make in space.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Boy howdy, Voidigo is lively. Think Nuclear Throne but weirder. Every sprite oozes a frantic combination of energy and personality, from the steel-eyed sprint of your starting gun-bird-thing to the bobbing scuttle of the cyclops clayfish boss. Guns have punch, stomps have oomph, reward boxes have merry jingles. It's a top-down roguelike shooter that does everything right, and seldom have I seen a game more deserving of its Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam. 
It left early access 11 days ago, which is 11 days you could have spent splatting crustaceans and wasps with skeleton trombones and deadly finger guns.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If Mewgenics were an actual cat, it would be approaching its twilight years. It's been nearly 11 years since Edmund Mcmillen, known for Super Meat Boy and Binding Of Isaac, first announced that the mysterious cat breed 'em up would be Team Meat's next game. The cats wound up waiting outside while they worked on other things, but we now have a much more concrete idea of what the game is.
The developers have actually been posting extensive development updates since January, but McMillen also just recorded an adhoc TikTok video where he points his phone at his screen. Turns out Mewgenics is a turn-based strategy roguelike with wizard cats who can cut their paws while opening windows. Could be worth the wait!

The conundrum for Arcom is that if it cracked down on the most prolific football pirates, it would also be cracking down on the fans most likely to use paid, legal services.

I don't take that at face value, but it has given me my first pangs of regret over selling my PS5. Those who didn't sell their PS5 for travel money get to play in a few days, while PC players are in for an indefinitely long wait.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:
The original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)
A ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive "Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.
Both modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.
Help us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!
