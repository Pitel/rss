Throughout the lifespan of the Nintendo Switch, there has been all sorts of controversy surrounding Joy-Con controller drift.
As the generation winds down, it looks like "5 years of efforts" to sue Nintendo over "Joy-Con drift" issues have now come to an end. As highlighted by Game File reporter Stephen Totilo, the cases (Diaz vs. Nintendo and Carbajal vs. Nintendo) have both been called for dismissal.

Hades 2 has been in Early Access for about a week, with the developer tweaking the game here and there with minor hotfixes. The upcoming patch should notably be larger, as the studio announced its upcoming due date in a Steam community note earlier today. It'll likely be the first of many regular patches for the game, but not necessarily a major one. Much of the game is still being worked on, but it just released so don't expect to see new Regions or weapons yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve been fighting with the 3D glasses glitch in Disney Dreamlight Valley, which prevented you from progressing Oswald’s Many Dimensions, then rejoice! The May 13 update has fixed this issue and, in line with player feedback since the Thrills and Frills update launched, a few more tweaks.


Of course, the most important update from this patch is that buying the 3D glasses before Oswald prompts you to make the purchase longer prevents the progression of Oswald’s Many Dimensions. That's not it for Oswald-related fixes, either, as many players were having issues with another request from Oswald at a previous stage of the same quest. 


When asked to don a pair of white pants, players realized they didn’t actually own any, and Scrooge wasn’t selling any, either. This left them unable to progress until Scrooge coughed up the goods. However, this update also changed the requirement to “light colored pants”, widening the scope of choices for players.

Daisy’s Boutique also receives a few tweaks and some fine-tuning, including the addition of a placement grid in the area of the shop that is used to participate in her challenges while it’s being edited. You also no longer have to wait 24 hours between cancelling a challenge and picking up a new one. 


Perhaps the most notable update in terms of the Boutique, though, is the fact that tips have been added during the “You Have Mail!” quest - meaning that players will no longer be left confused about what they have to do. 


Other notable fixes included with today’s update:



Fixed issues, including “A Day at Disney” duties not appearing and the Premium Shop appearing empty


Door frames and wall items no longer appear when the camera is moved behind a wall


Dreamlight Fruit can now be harvested during Valley Visits


The main loading screen now displays the proper “Thrills and Frills” artwork

Here's everything we know about the Bloodlust Aura in Sol's RNG including the chance to get it and how to increase you overall chances of getting it.

Sol's RNG Era 7 Bloodlust Aura


You'll need to be extremely lucky to get the new Bloodlust Aura in Sol's RNG, as the default chance of rolling it is 1 in 300,000,000. No, that's not a typo. The celestial black and red Aura is without a doubt the coolest in Sol's RNG, so you'll definitely want to try your luck at acquiring it. Even though you can get this aura by any means of rolling, even in the default biome and with Heavenly, there is actually some tips to help improve your chance of getting Bloodlust Aura in Sol's RNG. Here's what you should do:



Roll inside the new Hell Biome


Equip the new Vulkanic Device (don't need to be in Hell Biome for this)

Simulates 100% of Hell's Heats


Increases luck by 290%


Decreases roll cooldown by 35%




If you are interested in VIP, get the Quick Roll and VIP for faster rolls and better rewards.



How to get Bloodlust Era in Sol's RNG


Assuming you're going to go to the new Hell Biome, you have a 1/6,666 chance of it spawning without using the new Biome Randomizer or Manipulator items. The biome itself lasts about 11 minutes and is easy to notice due all of the flora and fauna being bright red, waterfalls flowing lava, and the overall red hell-themed environment.


When here, the chance for Bloodlust Aura instantly comes down to 1/50,000,000, which while not great, is 6x better than 1/300,000,000 if you're in the default biome. Throw on a Vulkanic Device to increase your luck by 290% and the chance is even greater.


Keep rolling in the Hell Biome with your Vulkanic  Device to get even quicker rolls, and you will get the Bloodlust Aura in no time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GeoGuessr's appeal of having you land in a random location and guessing where you are translates well into most video games, with Fortnite's unofficial version testing your game knowledge while sending you down memory lane. Here's how to find and play Fortnite GeoGuessr.


What is Fortnite GeoGuessr?


Fortnite GeoGuessr is a game much like regular GeoGuessr that, rather than having you guess real-world locations, has you pick where you are on the Fortnite map. You can choose between the game's full history, all of a chapter, or a specific season. 


Once you pick your map and create a single-player or multiplayer game, your view will land in a random spot in the world. Using context clues, previous game knowledge, and map hints, you'll look around the world before going to your Fortnite GeoGuessr minimap and choosing a location. Like GeoGuessr, you'll score more points the closer you are to the correct location, with the maximum score being 25,000 points for a standard five-round game.


Fortnite GeoGuessr also features a leaderboard for each map, allowing you to compete with other players to see who can get the most points the fastest. In other words, if you're knowledgeable enough about your chosen Fortnite chapter or season to consistently get 25,000 points each time, you can compete for the top spot by improving your speed. 


Currently, Fortnite GeoGuessr only supports up to Chapter 4, Season 1, meaning you won't find any Chapter 5 content for now. While this might change in the future, you'll have to stick to older map versions for now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With each expansion of Final Fantasy XIV, a new raid tier arrives to test your mettle against high-level foes. There are a lot of different raids to complete within each expansion, with Normal and Savage raids proving the most popular and often giving some of the best rewards.


There are, in fact, four different types of Raid within Final Fantasy XIV: Alliance, Normal, Savage, and Ultimate. However, this guide is going to focus solely on how to unlock the Normal Raids, their Savage counterparts, and Ultimate raids where applicable. 



Before you can unlock any Savage Raid in FFXIV, you’ll need to complete the level 50 side quest “The Ultimate Ballad”. To pick this up, head to Mor Dhona and talk to Alys (X:21.7, Y:8.6).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ImperialHal reached the mountaintop with TSM in 2023, securing an Apex Legends Global Series Championship title. However, a historic five-year run with the organization is officially ending. 


In the Year 4 ALGS regular season split 1, TSM finished 13th place, arguably lower than most fans expected. Then, at the Year 4 Split 1Playoffs LAN event that ended on May 5, TSM finished in 17th, marking another disappointing performance. Those results played a significant role in ImperialHal deciding to make a change. 


"To put it as bluntly as possible, it had nothing to do with money, it had nothing to do with contracts, it had nothing to do with TSM management, ImperialHal said. "It felt like there was a change needed." 





As for what's next, ImperialHal confirmed that he will be teaming up with Zer0 and Genburten on Dark Zero in place of eSikezz, who will now be a free agent. It was also revealed that Zer0 will be the in-game leader for the new squad. After a first-place finish in the regular season and placing second at the Year 4 Split 1Playoffs, Dark Zero will be one of the favorites in Split 2, which is scheduled to start on June 1. 


"I understand that people will be like it's one bad LAN there's no reason to be so sporadic and make a huge move," ImperialHal added. "But I feel like a majority of my decisions when it came to my career like who to pick up and who to join has been pretty spot on ever since the beginning because all I want to do is win." 


Imperial leaves behind a legacy that will be hard to top at TSM. With the organization, the decorated pro built up an impressive trophy cabinet, including wins at the 2019 X Games and 2019 Preseason Invitational and multiple playoff triumphs. TSM has yet to confirm who will be stepping in for ImperialHal to flank alongside Reps and Verhulst.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though Valentine's Day has come and gone, The Sims 4's upcoming content will certainly get you in a lovey-dovey mood. The roadmap seeks to revitalize its romance features and the now iconic Woohoo. Here is all the future content expected for Sims 4 Season of Love, including our predictions of what they could entail.  


All upcoming features in Sims 4 Season of Love


The Sims 4 Season of Love is scheduled to blossom between May and August, as officially announced on The Sims TikTok page. During this period, you can look forward to the following exciting content:



1 "flirtatious" Expansion pack


2 Destination kits


2 Free "stylish" updates



With its romance theme, many Simmers believe that the Sims 4 Season of Love is a nostalgic nod to the franchise's original Hot Date expansion pack. This groundbreaking addition introduced the concept of location visits, a feature that has evolved significantly in the fourth installment. The latest news has sparked speculation among fans, with some already dubbing the next EP as Sims 4 Hot Date 2. Personally, I'm crossing my fingers for the return of the heart-shaped hot tub.


Based on the artwork of Season of Love, the kits will likely provide more pool outdoor furniture and French cafe-inspired items. New cosmetics are also set to arrive with the two free updates. 




Although the upcoming content hasn't been explicitly clear, fans still hope to see hotels added to the game, which would be perfect for romantic getaways. Online dating could be another feature added, but we'll have to see what happens in the coming months. No matter what, Sims 4 Season of Love will undoubtedly change up its classic romance system, bringing in possible new interactions and alluring build items.

On June 13, Shin Megami Tensei V’s Digital Standard and Digital Deluxe editions and all of its DLC will be removed from the eShop. However, owners of the physical and digital versions will still be able to play and redownload this content after it’s been delisted. SMT V first launched in November 2021, and Atlus declared it the best-selling game in the series in January 2022.
The original Shin Megami Tensei V Digital Standard, Digital Deluxe, and all associated DLC will be delisted from the Nintendo eShop on June 13.
May 13, 2024
Atlus has not provided a reason for this move, but given the timing, it’s likely to avoid confusion with the upcoming SMTV: Vengeance, which is the same game but with quality-of-life improvements and an additional storyline that introduces new locations and demons (think of it as the Persona 5 Royal of SMT V). Vengeance will also be multi-platform, whereas the original game was a Switch exclusive, and it will run for the same price as the original Standard version, $59.99.
Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance launches on June 14. You can read our extended preview of the game here, and you can also check out our review of the original SMT V here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crow Country's various wings (heh) and storerooms are often locked behind keyholes of varying value: bronze, silver, and gold. The mid-game silver key has a few requirements that are sure to spoil things if you aren't far enough along, so read on with caution.


To get the silver key in Crow Country, you're going to need three core items that can be found in the midsection of the game:



The Crank, accessed from the vault beyond the Crypt (code 1872)


The Ruby, found in Haunted Manor demon painting (this requires the crank to access via the clocks)


The Chain, accessed from the Swan Boats puzzle, which requires the ruby to be inserted into the swan head to gain control of the ride controls



With these components in hand, head to the Dig Site, which can be accessed by using the bronze key on the mailbox outside the entrance. Inside, grab the gasoline tank from the corner of the room and use it to fill the tank behind the torch. Use the crank to fill the hole with water, then use the crane by attaching the chain to its gears. This will lift a resin-coated mask to the surface, which can be freed by using the torch. 


Mask in hand, head to the Witch Wood and open the entrance by slotting it into the right indentation. Inside, you'll find a labyrinth which can be completed by whacking totems to lower barriers. This isn't too difficult, and there's no limit on how many times you can hit each. Be sure to watch your head for falling traps, though. 


Screenshot by Destructoid.


Once you're in the middle, grab the key from the pond and get ready for a fight. The barriers will all lower, but enemies will begin to enter the maze. Exit the labyrinth by slaying foes and enjoy trying to remember where it was you needed to use this silver key in Crow Country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legendary Core is one of the old items of Warframe that has only remained relevant because of its status. If you’re wondering what it is or how to get your hands on one, look below.


What is a Legendary Core in Warframe?


A Legendary Core is technically a mod in Warframe that will upgrade a selected mod to its maximum level without cost. It’s a relic of the past.


Before we had the Endo system that we use today, we used to have to collect Fusion Cores. These would have different tiers and values, making them have different levels of potency when it comes to upgrading mods. The Legendary Core was the highest and most valuable tier of them.


With the mod upgrading system being consolidated into Endo, the only things that remained were the Legendary Cores.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While resources are somewhat common in the early game of Hades 2, the grind only gets more time-consuming and difficult from there. Some resources only show up in specific places, while others show up in batches of 1-2 a run while you need a dozen. It gets tough, but those rewards are so, so worth it. Here's how to get Marble in Hades 2.


Where to get Marble in Hades 2

Marble is found exclusively in Tartarus, the fourth zone of the main Hades 2 run. Bring the pickaxe with you and progress to the region, then work through it until you spot several Marble busts of Chronos. Break these fully to get three Marble each. Since these show up once or twice in Tartarus each run, you should be able to snag 3-6 Marble quite easily. It helps that most recipes don't require much.


If you've progressed far enough and gotten the Incantation, it's possible to get more Marble by upgrading your pickaxe. This can be done within the central equipment area, in the menu where you select your weapon and tool. It'll cost a pretty penny, but those extra resources can be more than worth it.


What is Marble used for?


Marble is used in a variety of important Incantations across Hades 2. The most useful by far is the one mentioned above regarding upgrading your tools. 


However, you can also unlock a fountain in Tartarus to help keep you going, alongside upgrading certain Arcana cards. This all means you'll need a ton of Marble, though since completing runs requires you to pass through Tartarus, it isn't as bad as it sounds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the regular eight mod slots of your frame in Warframe are important, you shouldn't ignore that Aura slot. Its benefits are more passive than the regular mods, but these benefits can be massive. 


Take the Growing Power Aura mod for example, which increases Ability Strength when applying Status Effects to enemies. One such mod is great in some builds, though getting it is tough. Here's how to get the Corrosive Projection mod in Warframe.


Where to get the Corrosive Projection mod in Warframe

The Corrosive Projection mod is exclusively available as part of the rotating Nightwave Cred Offerings for 20 Creds. These Offerings rotate every week on Sunday at 8 PM ET, so you'll need to return each week until Corrosive Projection appears. If you don't have any Creds, you need to complete levels of the Nightwave by handling specific challenges and acquiring XP. Certain levels on the reward track reward Nightwave Creds. Once you have enough and Corrosive Projection is an available mod, snag it before it disappears!


Plenty of other Aura mods are also available as part of the rotating Cred Offerings. For 20 Creds each, you can acquire  Energy Siphon, Physique, and Shield Disruption. All three are worth picking up, with other Aura mods decent albeit very situational.


Is the Corrosive Projection mod worth using?


The Corrosive Projection mod, at max rank, reduces enemy armor by 18%. Naturally, this means you'll output more damage. This isn't a big damage increase on its own, but in an armor-stripping build, can be invaluable. For example, I run my Wisp with Pillage as her ult, already armor-stripping enemies a ton. Combined with Molt Augmented to get more Ability Strength on kill, alongside Corrosive Projection, I can remove 100% of enemy armor and make it impossible for them to survive. If this sounds like the type of build for you, give it a whirl.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While most games would list a handful of resources early that you'll need throughout the game, Hades 2 is a different beast. You'll need plenty of early resources for various recipes, but new ones are introduced as late as after your first victory. These factor into late-game upgrades and can be utterly invaluable. One such resource is tough to get but plays into select upgrades for your arsenal. Here's how to get Dark in Hades 2.


Where to find Dark in Hades 2


Dark is acquired from the Chaos realm, which is accessed through the occasional Chaos portal found in a run. These require some health to be sacrificed but can make for a good challenge/reward boon. Once you've spoken to Chaos enough and progressed the story with them, they will eventually mention Dark and reward you with one for free. From there, you'll sometimes find Dark when visiting the Chaos realm and be able to pick it up. You don't need a specific tool for it.


While you're in the realm of Chaos, you can score both Plasma and Origin Seeds. The latter is especially important since it allows you to grow Thalamus, a resource used in a specific Incantation to reach the surface. If you haven't gotten to the surface yet, it's highly suggested you bring a shovel to try and get some seeds while grinding for Dark.


What is Dark used for?

As far as we can tell, there are two specific uses for Dark. The main use is for late-game Grasp upgrades, which allow you to take more Arcana cards with you. However, certain weapon Aspects such as the Aspect of Thanatos seem to require Dark as well. You should visit Chaos as often as possible to get an early surplus of Dark, saving you time later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While you can mostly farm resources passively in Warframe, some resources are better acquired through target farming them. Certain areas are either much better for specific resources or are the only way to acquire them, so it can help a ton to know where to look. One of these resources can be somewhat rare and is used in many blueprints. Here's how to farm Neural Sensors in Warframe.


Where to get Neural Sensors in Warframe


There are two ways you can go about farming Neural Sensors. You can either farm the Alad V Assassination mission on Themisto, Jupiter, or you can farm a specific Survival or Defense mission and hope enemies drop them. The Alad V Assassination mission is typically the more consistent one, giving Neural Sensors every 1-2 runs of the mission. It's also quite fast once you know how to deal with Alad V. However, missions like Elara and Cameria on Jupiter could give more, provided you're willing to put in the time.


Once you get a drop of Neural Sensors, you should get 1-2 no matter the enemy. If you're running a Resource Booster, this can be upped to 2-4 per drop. A Resource Drop Chance Booster can also help, but it won't affect the drop rate of Neural Sensors when fighting Alad V.


What are Neural Sensors used for?


Neural Sensors are used in numerous blueprints, including parts for numerous frames, several weapons, and a handful of cosmetics. The most common use, however, is in Forma. Since you need a lot of these to get the most out of your frame and weapon builds, you'll naturally need a ton of Neural Sensors. Even excluding the need to repeat the process, building one of everything that needs Neural Sensors requires 241. That's a lot of grinding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Tonfa melee weapon hasn't quite become popular yet, but it's emerged in Asian lobbies and might spread like wildfire soon. 


The Tonfa is a melee weapon first introduced to Modern Warfare 2 in Season 4. As part of the carry forward program, the weapon came over to MW3, but most melee weapons go unnoticed in Warzone, as SMGs and shotguns are usually better for short-range engagements. However, a player claimed on Reddit that there had been a surge of Tonfa users in Asian lobbies since the Season 3 Reloaded update went live on May 1.


Image via Activision


One user pointed out that the automatic tactical sprint bug helped increase popularity because players don't need to reload while using a melee weapon. As a result, players could still have the automatic tactical sprint setting on without worrying about their weapons being unable to reload. Raven Software fixed the bug, but there are also other advantages worth noting. 


According to that same player, the Tonfa can kill faster than any other weapon within a three-meter range, which gets even deadlier with a smoke grenade. If a player tries to fire their weapon through a smoke grenade, they lose aim assist, making it harder to hit an enemy. But with a Tonfa equipped, users can blindly swing around and get a kill. To add insult to injury, players can also equip the Combat Scout perk so the enemy will be highlighted in orange after taking damage, so it would be even easier to get a kill with a Tonfa. 


And for the cherry on top, a riot shield and Tonfa combination provides cover while they get closer to finish the kill off with the melee weapon. It's unclear if this trend will extend outside these anecdotal matches, but lobbies are in trouble if players catch wind of how powerful the weapon can be.

Among the publishers’ revamped approach to making money - following a recent drop in profits, per their latest financials - is a more “aggressive” approach to bringing their games to more platforms than specific consoles (in other words, PlayStation) as exclusives, with a particular focus on “win[ning] over PC users”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed Codename Red now has an official title: Assassin’s Creed Shadows. We’ll also get our first full-length look at the series' first Japanese entry this week. 
Ubisoft announced on X that the game’s cinematic world premiere trailer will air on May 15 at 9 a.m. P.T./12 p.m. ET. Ubisoft’s use of the word “cinematic” suggests that this trailer will not include gameplay. If that’s the case, Ubisoft could be saving a gameplay reveal for its Ubisoft Forward presentation less than a month later, on June 10.
Assassin's Creed Codename Red becomes Assassin's Creed Shadows.

Assassin’s Creed Shadows was first announced in 2022 and will be the first entry set in feudal Japan. At the time, Ubisoft described the game as being an open-world RPG and the ultimate "shinobi fantasy." It is being developed by Ubisoft Quebec, the team behind Assassin's Creed Odyssey. It has no release window, but the game is expected to launch later this year.]]></summary>

What is time? Does the future come into existence, become the present, then vanish into the past? Or are all times equally real, only our perspective on them changing as we travel towards our destinies? And while we’re on the subject, why is it taking so much time to get a “Switch 2”? Not to worry: Braid, Anniversary Edition, with its tricksy temporal mechanics, is another exceptional game to make the time just fly by.
Originally released in 2008 and developed by then indie superstar-to-be Jonathan Blow, Braid was the poster child for the blossoming Xbox Live Arcade, the highly impactful online platform that provided a route to the console market for smaller developers. Alongside Steam on the PC side of the fence, where Braid also did gangbusters on launch in 2009, XBLA helped to democratise game publishing, and the two storefronts enabled Braid – and Blow – to rocket to fame.

It was pre-covid, and Pressure Cooker Studios’ composer Daniel Caleb was flicking through reddit posts when a trailer cut through the glare. He’d never heard of Manor Lords before. It looked like a new IP, but already had a huge Reddit following. Caleb loved what he saw. At that point, Pressure Cooker mainly worked on film scores, but both Caleb and fellow composer Elben Schutte had always wanted to eventually move on to bringing their storytelling from cinema to games. Even more so than film, games were the passion. Manor Lords would be perfect for them.

Square Enix has released a three-year Medium-term Business Plan and its financial report for fiscal year 2024. And while it's mixed results for the developer, it has addressed how its going to try and improve things.
Most notably, the company has revealed a brand new "four-pillar" plan, and under one of these pillars, it will "aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox,
and PCs". Not just Switch, but "Nintendo platforms". Which is an obvious statement to make, of course, given that we are slowly approaching the Switch successor's official announcement. Square wants to "build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles" and that includes AAA games and major franchises.

To fill you in, Fire Emblem is known and sort of celebrated for being a rich ensemble fantasy story with character permadeath. Helldivers 2, meanwhile, is a game in which people are as expendable as bullets, and the storytelling is deliberately brittle because it consists largely of clownish propaganda. Put the two sets of inspirations together, and what do you get? You get a headline, that's what. Beyond that, we can only dream.

This comes from the company's latest financial earnings report, which details Square Enix's three-year reboot plan for long-term growth. 
Within that three-year reboot plan, Square Enix lists four pillars:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Biomutant X.
It's been a long road for Biomutant's Switch release. The action RPG originally came out almost three years ago, back in May 2021, with the Switch version slowly getting pushed back time and time again. However, Experiment 101’s debut title is finally here, but it maybe should have been held back for the Switch's successor.
Biomutant takes place in a post-apocalyptic open world, where the Tree-of-Life, a gigantic natural wonder that brings life to the whole world, is slowly being destroyed by five creatures gnawing away at its roots. You begin the game by creating your mutant character who, during the adventure, can choose to save the Tree-of-Life from these creatures and let the tree heal or let the world fall to ruin. After the intro tutorial, you can visit a variety of tribes scattered throughout the corners of the world, side with them, and complete quests that meet their wishes for the world. Some want it to fall to the plague and others are united in trying to save the Tree-of-Life.

The concept evidently appeals to me enough to try out those other two, but I guess that I’m simply too much of a rebel-maverick-disruptor to play to the stiflingly enforced rhythms of somebody else’s drum. Something about ROBOBEAT’s roguelike shooting feels different though.

Much like Scorn, Necrophosis is also part-inspired by the dystopian surrealist works of Zdzisław Beksiński, which means lots of plucking brains out of sinewy bodies and plopping them into fleshy receptacles. There's a demo out now and while it's not outstanding, it tickled my curiosity more than I thought it would.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the late 90s when all of you NORMIES were playing Diablo, I was playing a little-known Konami ARPG called Azure Dreams, which has alas never escaped PlayStation prison. It's a grid-based, upwardly mobile roguelitey dungeon crawler set in a big tower, each floor a semi-randomised maze of monsters (which you can capture), traps and pick-ups, where player and creature actions happen simultaneously.
Effort Star's Enter The Chronosphere doesn't have grids or monster capturing, that I know of, but it taps into a comparable vein of diorama-sized frantic-yet-laidback challenge, with characters, foes and projectiles frozen in time till you give a command. There's a demo on Steam as part of the platform's Endless Replayability Fest, which I encourage you to try, whether you are one of the COOL KIDS who played Azure Dreams or not.

The dairy product manifests as various suspiciously coloured cheese wheels which you can cook and eat, while loyalty comes in the form of freakish pets that can now follow your every move. The pets themselves are technically not new to Abiotic Factor, but their player-tracking behaviour is. "There is, as far as we know, no limit to how many pets can follow you at once," say the devs. Hmmm. I wonder if any scientifically minded folks will test such a hypothesis.

Little-Known Galaxy is out in a week, and currently has a demo on Steam, where you can sample many of the delights that you're used to from a Stardewlike when you're new in town: meeting the locals, growing potatoes, and tidying up the place. Also, raising alien pets, seeking out new life, and new civilisations... It all takes place on a spaceship, you see, and this has some ramifications to playing the game beyond reskinning everything to be shiny metal instead of picturesque mud. It's an intriguing proposition.

Hi folks, and welcome back to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
Before we get cracking with this week's battle, let's see what happened last time. We looked at Mario Paint for the SNES, with North America and Europe taking on Japan.

Hades II marks a first for Supergiant Games. This is the first time the studio has revisited a world, its characters, and their stories, and as a result, is its very first direct sequel. In a way, that might seem disappointing, but this is Supergiant Games we're talking about. Hades is a masterclass in narrative design, addictive gameplay, rewarding progression, beautiful art, etc. It's excellent across the board. However — this will shock you — Hades II also happens to be brilliant, and it's not even finished yet!
After 20 hours of playing through the Early Access version, available via Steam and the Epic Games Store, we can tell Supergiant already has another hit on its hands. The studio can't currently reveal what consoles it will be released on just yet — Switch Successor, maybe? We sure as hell hope so — but we couldn't wait that long. So we loaded up our Steam Deck to check out this God-like, rogue-like sequel.

Indika is bizarre, surprising, and captivating. It made me question its reality almost as often as its titular protagonist, a young nun tormented by the Devil, doubts her faith. This odd adventure from its aptly named developer Odd Meter may lack some design polish, but the fascinating tale at its core instilled enough faith in me to see it through to the end. 
The game unfolds in early 19th-century Russia. Indika is treated as an outcast at her monastery, and, for some reason, she’s re…]]></summary>

Sure, other run-based indies like Balatro and Dead Cells, all-encompassing triple-A titles like Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and retro compilations like Sonic Origins and TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection, have shared that title, but I always know that when I need to pass time on a flight, no game does so as effectively as Vampire Survivors. Logically, I know that each run will last, at most, 30 minutes, but for some reason, it never feels that way. And because of that, I look down for what feels like 20 minutes, and when I look up, 2 hours have passed.

It’s also good sci-fi because its characters converse through reams of inscrutable but cool-sounding space science, and at no point does a grinning quipster tell a scientist: “Whoa there, professor. Why don’t you try saying that again... but in English!” Basically, if your wishlist for Homeworld 3 has tone and atmosphere at the top, rest easy. At no point did I get the sense that Blackbird ever took making the first proper Homeworld in eight years lightly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:10 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Studios has cast Ralph Ineson as the planet-eating Galactus for The Fantastic Four. PlayStation 5 players might recognize that name as the voice of Cidolfus Telamon, aka Cid, in Final Fantasy XVI. This casting comes from The Hollywood Reporter, which reports that the production will begin shooting mid-summer in England. 
Ineson, whom you might also know from The VVitch, The Northman, and The Creator, joins a star-studded cast for the Marvel Cinematic Universe's first film about Marvel's First Family, which features Pedro Pascal (HBO's The Last of Us) as Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby (Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning) as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, Joseph Quinn (Stranger Things) as Johnny Storm/Human Torch, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Bear), as Ben Grimm/The Thing. Joining Ineson is a female Silver Surfer played by Julia Garner (Ozark).


Paul Walter Hauser (Cobra Kai) and John Malkovich (Being John Malkovich) will also appear in The Fantastic Four, although their roles are currently undisclosed. 
If you've played FFXVI, you already know Ineson has an incredible voice, certainly perfect for the role of a massive galactic entity that devours planets; we can't wait to see what he does as Galactus when The Fantastic Four hits theaters on July 25, 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Xbox closed four Bethesda studios, including Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks, the team behind last year's Hi-Fi Rush. While each of the four studios affected, which also included Mighty Doom developer Alpha Dog Games and Bethesda support studio Roundhouse Games, released a statement about the closures, Xbox remained silent. 
However, four days later, Bloomberg's Dina Bass interviewed Xbox president Sarah Bond and asked her about the Bethesda closures, to which Bond cited a desire to keep the Xbox business healthy in the long term, even through hard transition periods. 


Here's what Bond said: 
Bass then asked Bond specifically about the closure of Tango Gameworks after Hi-Fi Rush, which by Xbox's own admitted metrics, was a big success. Bond's answer here was less straightforward – you can read it below in full: 
While it's great that Bond addressed these closures at Xbox, it still lacks the clarity you'd expect from one of the biggest companies in the games industry. Neither Microsoft nor Xbox, including Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, has yet to address the layoffs and closures in an official capacity beyond this.
For more, read about how Redfall was reportedly set to receive a big offline play update this month before Xbox shut down Arkane Austin, and then read about how Xbox is reportedly considering bringing Senua's Saga: Hellblade II to PlayStation 5. After that, check out this story about how more job cuts at Xbox are reportedly on the way, and then read about how the company is debating putting Call of Duty on Xbox Game Pass alongside a price hike.

During the quest for a new flat - a quest I would slot somewhere between return to Ravenholm in Half-Life 2 and the Shalebridge Cradle in Thief: Deadly Shadows in terms of overall hopefulness and unpleasant surprises - I toyed briefly with the idea of living in a mobile home.
You can find all kinds of weirdo moving property on Gumtree - houseboats, caravans, yurts, large coats, coffins - but they all share the disadvantage of being cramped and more expensive than described and inadequate to the power and internet needs of a Maxed-Out Videogame Journalist. If I'd seen a house with chicken legs, though? It'd have been worth the sacrifice. Just think, whenever James Archer gives me grief about my performance in Lethal Company I could send my house to step on him.

From newer titles like Fallout 76 to older games like Fallout 3, Bethesda’s post-apocalyptic franchise is arguably bigger than ever thanks to the recently released hit series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's once again just about time for a new Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion to hit store shelves. Continuing the Scarlet & Violet series is Twilight Masquerade, a set that focuses on the Teal Mask DLC of the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet video games. Because of that, players can expect locations, characters, and Pokémon from Kitakami, the folklore-rich area from the first part of the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero storyline.
As such, new Pokémon like Bloodmoon Ursaluna, Fezandipiti, Okidogi, Munkidori, and Sinistcha are all featured in Twilight Masquerade. However, the most common new Pokémon I encountered during my opening of several booster packs sent over by The Pokémon Company was Ogerpon; I pulled several different versions of the grass-type Legendary Pokémon from The Teal Mask. 
Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Twilight Masquerade adds 226 cards, including 14 new Pokémon ex cards, more than 30 Trainer cards, and dozens of special-illustration cards. I'll always love Gen I the most, so I was happy to add new cards featuring favorites like Alakazam, Zapdos, Ninetales, and Eevee, but my absolute favorites are the special illustration versions of Applin, Sunflora, and Infernape. I also adore the Hearthflame Mask Ogerpon ex card that I was lucky enough to grab.
You can check out my favorite cards I pulled from booster packs below.

 Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Twilight Masquerade is available on May 24. For more on the long-running Pokémon Trading Card Game, including other galleries from past expansions, head to our Pokémon TCG hub at the banner below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Open world fantasy RPG Runes emits a deeply powerful aura. I can tell it’s deeply powerful because MSI Afterburner’s fan control immediately went mental after I loaded up its free Steam combat demo. What do you mean ‘unoptimised’? That alarming sound is simply my computer shaking with awe at the fearless flippancy required to leave enemies fully untextured so they resemble Metal Gear Solid’s cyborg ninja. The promise of an indie fantasy RPG drew me in, but I must admit, I almost didn’t bother writing about this upon learning the demo is just a pre-Kickstarter combat slice. But something about it entrances me. What it lacks in textures, it makes up for in sheer moxy. You can’t optimise moxy! You can either make MSI shudder in terror or you can’t.

In Hilderbrand’s view, Game Pass will likely never be sustainable or profitable. Microsoft’s only chance on this front, he says, is “to put all the world's biggest games on the service” – namely, Call of Duty, which still earns hundreds of millions annually in direct sales, or GTA 6, which, hahahaha.

You briefly meet Orpheus in the base game while playing as leatherclad muse Grace, finding him moping in the underworld, eyes dripping with glam rock mascara. In the DLC he makes a musical comeback on earth, alongside messenger god Hermes. I've not stumbled on Orpheus in the other mythical game of this season, Hades 2 (he showed up in the first Hades but there's no sign he's reappearing in the sequel). So it looks like fans of the ancient Greek sadboi will have to flock to Summerfall's expansion when it comes out this summer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss our Hades II cover story trip to Supergiant Games in San Francisco and Xbox shutting down four game studios, including Prey, Dishonored, and Redfall developer Arkane Austin, alongside Tango Gameworks, the team behind The Evil Within series and last year's critically-acclaimed Hi-Fi Rush. Afterward, we chat about Shuntaro Furukawa, President of Nintendo, revealing the company will reveal details about the Nintendo Switch's successor within this fiscal year via a post on X. Before diving into our positive reviews of '90s-survival-horror Crow Country and Little Kitty, Big City, special guest Charlie Wacholz joins us to chat about his Animal Well review, in which he calls Bigmode's first published title "a masterclass in environmental design."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lightforge Games is indefinitely pausing work on its upcoming RPG Project O.R.C.S. The team has been reduced to a skeleton crew as the few remaining staff members look to determine their next course of action.
In a message posted to the game’s website and social media channels yesterday, Lightforge cites a lack of publisher funding as the reason it no longer has the means to continue work on Project O.R.C.S. To minimize any prolonged struggle, the team decided to immediately pull the plug.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical, a creative and ambitious attempt to fuse musical theatre with interactive fiction, launched last August, but that's not the last time fans will get to experience that modern take on Greek myth. Announced today at LudoNarraCon, the game is getting DLC called Stray Gods: Orpheus, which follows the titular character through a new adventure. Check out the reveal trailer below.


Orpheus (played by Rent star Anthony Rapp) appeared in the base game, but only briefly, so this expansion will give players a better idea of his backstory and personality. The trailer also features Hermes (played by Erika Ishii), though their exact role in the DLC isn't clarified. The experience is roughly two hours long with six new interactive tracks and features some returning songwriters, including Austin Wintory, Simon Hall, and Montaigne, but also adds comedic musician Tom Cardy to the mix.
As for the plot, the following excerpt from a press release explains what to expect. "When the curtain has fallen and the show is over, who do you go home as?" it reads. "Choose to reject, embrace, or rewrite the stories the world expects of you. Is the mortal world ready for the return of Ancient Greece’s most infamous bard?"

Stray Gods: Orpheus hits PC on June 27, with a console release date "coming soon." For more Stray Gods, check out our feature on how it was made. For more Greek mythology, visit our Hades II coverage hub for this month's exclusive coverage.]]></summary>

See, these are the kinds of glacial changes of focus and ponderous shifts of strategy you often get at very large videogame publishers such as Microsoft. Trends are cyclical and corporations are sort of just these massive, sleepy hamsters, trundling around the wheel to rediscover practices and projects they once deemed bad for business. Hang on, let me go look up "yesterday" in the dictionary and fetch some sellotape - my brain appears to have exploded.

The game in question is cheery co-op shooter Helldivers 2, over which Aunty Sony recently upended a can of furious worms by abruptly insisting that Steam players have a PSN account for security reasons and so, blocking players in regions where PSN isn't available. Sony have subsequently walked back the requirement following a backlash of truly hellish proportions, though I understand that the game remains unavailable on Steam in certain regions. By comparison, Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt's remarks overnight that the developers might have been "removing the fun" with their gun balancing seem pretty innocuous.

Plus: the games we've been playing this week, including a cute survival horror and RimWorld, still. Also, Nate asks me to explain what the hap was heckening with Helldivers 2, and if Joel remains safe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League's release was "disappointing" for the company. He said this during Warner Bros. Discovery's Q1 financial results call, noting its games revenue declined a lot compared to last year, as reported by IGN. 
Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League was likely never going to perform well for Warner Bros. Discovery's gaming division compared to the sector's revenue last year, which was anchored in the release of Hogwarts Legacy, the best-selling game of 2023 and the first non-Call of Duty game to take that spot in years. Still, as critics and players will tell you, Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League was a disappointing release from Rocksteady Studios, the team behind the Batman: Arkham series – you can read Game…]]></summary>

I confess, I found this response annoying - partly because I was hoping Johanas would bring up some obscure indie composer I could then namecheck at parties, and partly, because I have spent years waiting for Tango to escape Mikami's shadow after essentially announcing themselves as a Mikami fan project back in 2010.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More cuts at Xbox are reportedly on the way, with some staff at ZeniMax getting offered voluntary severance agreements this week. This news comes from a Bloomberg report that says employees across the Xbox organization have been told to expect more cuts. 
These potential layoffs would follow Xbox's decision to shutter four Bethesda studios earlier this week, including Hi-Fi Rush team Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin. As for the staff offered voluntary severance agreements, Bloomberg reports that producers, quality assurance testers, and other staff at ZeniMax are receiving them. 


The publication also reports the reason Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin were shut down this week is that they were in the process of pitching new projects and hiring additional staff for said projects, something suggested by ZeniMax head Jill Braff and Xbox president Matt Booty during a town hall held this week. Xbox and ZeniMax chose to shut these studios down – both in the beginning processes of creating new games – instead of closing a studio deeper in development on projects. 
Elsewhere in Bloomberg's report, which details an internal town hall held at Xbox following the studio closures this week, Booty reportedly described its studios as spread too thin, like "peanut butter on bread," and that leaders across the company felt understaffed. Xbox closed three studios and had ZeniMax Online Studios absorb Roundhouse Games to free up resources. Braff said during the meeting, "It's hard to support nine studios all across the world with a lean central team with an ever-growing plate of things to do. I think we were about to topple over." 
These studio closures follow the January layoffs of 1,900 employees at Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax, which add to the total of more than 10,000 laid off in the games industry just this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Senua's Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC later this month on May 21. However, its release arrives at a rocky period for Xbox, which just shuttered four Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush team Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin. As a result, Xbox players have wondered how safe Hellblade II developer Ninja Theory might be after its sequel's release, given Hi-Fi Rush was a "break out hit" for the company but wasn't enough to keep Tango open. 
Perhaps to help boost Hellblade II's sales, Xbox is reportedly considering bringing the game to PlayStation 5, according to The Verge. The publication's Tom Warren writes, "I understand Hellblade II is another game that Microsoft has been considering for the PS5. If that ever happens, at this point, it's not clear if even that would be considered a success." 


Hellblade II coming to PS5 wouldn't be out of left field, considering Xbox has brought previously exclusive games like Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Hi-Fi Rush to PS5 this year. However, with the launch of Hellblade II happening in just a few weeks, it seems if it does come to PS5, it will be post-launch, which lines up with Xbox's strategy in this realm thus far. 
Senua's Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21, 2024. 
For more about the game, check out the Senua's Saga: Hellblade II PC specs and system requirements, and then read about how Senua's Saga: Hellblade II will be locked to 30 FPS on Xbox Series X/S. After that, read about how the game will have a photo mode at launch.

As in ecologies at large, the most abundant and widespread are probably the bugs, beginning with the moth that flew into that Harvard Mark II in 1947 and ending with the teeming contents of the average free-to-play changelog. A little further up the food chain we find "worms", like the Creeper that once invaded the ARPANET, and "gophers", a directory/client system written in 1991 for the University of Minnesota. There are computer animals spawned by branding - foxes of fire and twittering birds and the anonymous beasts that haunt the margins of Google documents. There are computer animals that are implied by the verbs we use in computing - take "browser", derived from the old French word for nibbling at buds and sprouts, which suggests that all modern internet searches are innately herbivorous.

He was way more online when he was younger, and is the one who got me into the games of Lucasfilm, Troika and Blizzard, but these days he plays the games he likes a lot and does not read specialist websites that tell him why he shouldn't like them. He used to play loads of League Of Legends, but the game he was most into more recently was Hades. This is because he studied Classics.
I won't tell you how many years its been since he was at university, but for many years - and still sort of now, to be honest - "liking Apollo" was a key part of his personality. It's interesting, therefore, to text him about Hades 2. Partly because he wasn't even aware it was happening.

Animal Well pleased, surprised, or scared me with something new at every turn as it confidently jumped from one idea to the next up until its conclusion. That novelty lost its luster near the end of its 8-to-10-hour runtime as I treaded the fresh sheen off familiar ground, but it never lost its lively, naturalistically wild heart – even when occasional difficulty spikes compounded that staleness.

It’s got shades of all these games, but thrown together with a wonderfully vibrant wood craft art style. It ends up as something I feel is going to be a lot more approachable for players who like the idea of massive medieval simulations but don’t care to spend time reading a Magna Carta-fat wiki to learn exactly what pop growth percentage is. I know what it is, and most days I wish I’d saved that brain space to e.g learn how to keep house plants alive instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MultiVersus makes its grand return on May 28, and a new trailer reveals that the Joker is joining the roster. Even better, Mark Hamill is voicing the Clown Prince of Crime once more.
Though we don’t see gameplay, a cinematic trailer sets up a dramatic confrontation (and likely emotional reunion for fans) between Batman, voiced in the game by the late Kevin Conroy, and his archnemesis. 


This marks the first game to feature both Batman: The Animated Series actors together as their respective characters since 2018’s Lego DC Super Villans. Conroy passed away in 2022, and prior to 2024's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, MultiVersus was the final game to feature his Batman performance. Following his death, Hamill had alluded to retiring the Joker role for good. However, dataminers uncovered Joker’s existence in MultiVersus in 2022 and found audio files revealing Hamill’s performance. This means he likely recorded his lines before Conroy’s passing. 
Joker is the first new character to join the existing line-up of fighters, but he won't be the last. We're curious to see who else joins the fray after MultiVersus re-launches on May 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent update for procgen whodunnit sim Shadows of Doubt added "Sharpshooter Assassins" with high-powered rifles to the game's glowering alternate-1980s cities, with players having to work out the killer's vantage point by deducing a bullet's trajectory, before proceeding to a secondary crime scene to search for a murder weapon and witnesses. The prospect of snipers certainly adds menace to the game's forensic sandboxing. The trouble is, the shooters aren't always as sharp as they could be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has revealed Sonic Rumble, a 32-player mobile platforming battle royale, and it's coming this winter. As is par for the course of battle royale-type games, Sonic Rumble puts 32 players against each other competing on various levels and obstacle courses to remain the last person standing. 
In the reveal trailer, it's clear players control various characters from the universe of Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series, including Sonic, of course, Tails, Knuckles, Shadow, Amy, Dr. Eggman, and presumably more. As you play, you collect rings and these are used to customize your characters in special outfits and more. 
Check it out for yourself in the Sonic Rumble announce trailer below: 


There's no release date for Sonic Rumble yet, but Sega says it's releasing this Winter. Given it's a mobile game, it's expected to hit iOS and Android. If you're interested in trying the game out, you can sign up for beta tests right now. 
For more about everyone's favorite blue blur, read Game Informer's Sonic Frontiers review, and then read Game Informer's Sonic Superstars review. After that, watch Game Informer's exclusive video interview with Sonic's Takashi Iizuka about Sega's road to the Dreamcast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition, a game designed around speedrunning challenges and more across 13 classic NES games. Set to hit Switch on July 18, Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition features more than 150 challenges to complete, and you can compete for top spots on global online leaderboards or with friends. 
Nintendo revealed this compilation title with a trailer that pulls heavy on the Nintendo World Championship nostalgia, with previous winners appearing, footage from old competitions, and more throughout. 
Check out the Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition announcement trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, challenges in the game include reaching the Super Mushroom as fast as you can in Super Mario Bros., defeating the Octorocks the fastest in The Legend of Zelda, and reaching a specified gate as quickly as possible in Metroid. And those are just three of the 150+ challenges available in the game, spread across 13 NES games. 
Each week, you can compete for the top spot in the World Championships Weekly  Global Online leaderboards, or you can compete against up to seven friends in the local eight-player Party Mode. 
"With 'byte-sized' challenges and an automatic rewind feature, you don't need to master entire games to feel like a Nintendo World Champion," the trailer's description reads. 
Alongside today's reveal, Nintendo has also unveiled a Deluxe Set for Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition. It includes collectible items, like art cards, a golden NES cartridge, and a physical game card.  

Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition hits Switch on July 18, 2024. The Deluxe Set will cost $59.99, and the digital eShop version will cost $29.99.

I've seen loads of vids from big FPS YouTubers pivoting to it as the next big thing, especially for the Escape From Tarkov-likers. So I gave it a whirl, both as someone who wanted to see what these more hardcore extraction shooters were like and to play a video game that worked. Unfortunately for me, the game barely functions on my rig to the point where it hurts my poor eyes.

Crow Country is like if Resident Evil was made out of Duplo: more chunky, less threatening, and easier than playing with a fully motorised K'Nex ferris wheel, but darn it, it's still a good time.

The Resident Evil series has redefined and refined survival horror in recent years, arguably single-handedly. However, as the venerable series continues to push the genre forward, a growing number of indie games are looking back to survival horror’s late ‘90s heyday for inspiration. Crow Country joins those ranks, offering a respectable nostalgic homage to the past. Veterans won’t encounter anything they haven’t seen, but the experience is comforting in its spooky familiarity.  
Developer SFB Games clearly understood its self-imposed assignment. Crow Country…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny 2: The Final Shape is set to wrap up the decade-long War of Light and Darkness story arc when it launches on June 4, but ahead of that, developer Bungie is giving players an easy way to catch up on previous expansions. Unveiled yesterday under the initiative name "Expansion Open Access," all Destiny 2 players can access and play through the game's Shadowkeep (2019), Beyond Light (2020), and The Witch Queen (2022) expansions. 
"Prepare for The Final Shape with three epic campaigns and earn an arsenal of exotic and legendary gear," the Expansion Open Access trailer's description reads. And speaking of trailer, check out the Destiny 2 Expansion Open Access trailer for yourself below: 


Now, of course, these three aren't the only Destiny 2 expansions but they're the only ones currently available to play through in the game. As such, it might be smart to watch a playthrough or read a narrative summary of all expansions released before The Final Shape next month. 
Here's every Destiny 2 expansion/DLC released since the game's launch: 
Curse of Osiris (2017)
Warmind (2018)
Forsaken (2018)
Shadowkeep (2019)
Beyond Light (2020)
The Witch Queen (2022)
Lightfall (2023)
The Destiny 2 Expansion Open Access period lasts from now until June 3. If you're a PlayStation Plus subscriber, you also currently have access to Lightfall, making now a perfect time to catch up. 
For more, watch the Destiny 2: The Final Shape reveal trailer here, and then check out this breakdown of The Final Shape's new prismatic subclass, enemy faction, exotics, and more.

        <id>122576</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/08/redfall-was-reportedly-set-to-receive-a-big-offline-play-update-this-month-before"/>
        <updated>2024-05-08T12:02:46.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arkane Austin was reportedly set to release a big Redfall update this month that would have added offline play to the always-online game before Microsoft suddenly shut the studio down, according to IGN. This follows yesterday's news that Microsoft was shutting down Arkane Austin, Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks, Mighty Doom studio Alpha Dog Games, and absorbing Roundhouse Games into ZeniMax Online Studios.
This offline play update would have addressed one of players' biggest complaints with the game – that Redfall always requires a connection to the internet – but now that update will never see the light of day. It's an especially concerning detail considering now that Arkane Austin is closed, the day when Redfall servers are no longer live, rendering the game unplayable, seems closer than ever before. 


IGN also reports that it was told the now-canceled Hero Pass, which would have added two additional playable characters to Redfall, was scheduled for release around Halloween. It obviously won't be released now – Bethesda says those who purchased the Hero Pass will be eligible "to receive the value of the upgrade" – but if it had hit the game around Halloween, that would have been roughly 18 months after Redfall's launch. 
Redfall hit Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 2 to poor reviews from critics – read Game Informer's review here – and players alike, and the first-person multiplayer vampire shooter failed to recover, with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer saying, "I'm upset with myself," when asked about its launch.
According to reports, some of Arkane Austin's staff hoped Microsoft might cancel Redfall or reboot it as a single player game, following the former's acquisition of ZeniMax Media in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Arkane Austin director Harvey Smith said Microsoft canceled a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall following this acquisition.

The employee, "Spitz", was let go following the fiasco in which Sony told PC players they would need to link their Steam and PlayStation Network accounts to continue playing the shooter. Sony and Arrowhead changed their mind about that after player backlash in the form of 100,000+ negative reviews on Steam. The kicker? Community manager "Spitz" was low-key encouraging players to continue the review bombing. This doesn't seem to have gone down well internally.

With My Past, the debut game from developer Imagine Wings Studio, attempts to blend those feelings with platforming-puzzle gameplay and does so excellently. The result is a therapeutic five-hour adventure I'll be thinking about long after today.

        <id>122520</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/07/marvel-snaps-may-2024-season-takes-a-turn-for-the-multiverse-with-blink-and-the-exiles"/>
        <updated>2024-05-07T19:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The success of Marvel Snap rolls on, as does the seasonal structure of the free-to-play, deck-building card-battler from Second Dinner. Recent seasons have been themed after corners of the Marvel Universe, like Avengers vs. X-Men or Thunderbolts, but this season leans a bit more into the Marvel Multiverse with Blink and the Exiles. This season, titled "A Blink in Time," introduces five new characters, two new locations, and more.
The new characters joining the game in A Blink in Time are as follows:
Blink (5 Cost, 7 Power)

	
On reveal, swap the last card you played with a higher-cost card from your deck.

	
Nocturne (3 Cost, 5 Power)
	
You can move this once. When this moves, replace its location with a random new one.

	
Sage (3 Cost, 0 Power)
	
On reveal, +2 power for each different power among all other cards here.

	
Namora (5 Cost, 6 Power)
	
On reveal, give +5 power to each of your cards alone at another location.

	
Sasquatch (6 Cost, 10 Power)
	
Costs 1 less for each card you played last turn.

                  

On top of those all-new characters joining Marvel Snap collections, there are two new locations: Panoptichron, where cards that didn't start in your deck get +2 power, and Cancun, where power at that location doesn't count toward winning the game. New albums featuring Dan Hipp and Rian Gonzales also further incentivize Variant collections by rewarding items themed after Werewolf By Night, Silk, and Iron Lad. Finally, we know the dates of the Series 5 releases of this season. Baron Zemo and Nocturne get their Series 5 release on May 7, Sage arrives on May 14, Namora on May 21, and Sasquatch on May 28.
Marvel Snap's May season, A Blink in Time, kicks off today. For more on Marvel Snap, check out Charles Harte's opinion piece from when the game originally arrived on mobile devices.]]></summary>

Microsoft si před deseti lety koupil mobilní divizi finské Nokie, za nemalého přispění CEO Nokie Stephena Elopa, předtím vysoce postaveného manažera Microsoftu. Softwarový gigant, kterému krutě ujížděl vlak na poli mobilních platforem si koupil telefonního giganta, kterému také krutě ujížděl vlak. Nokia skončila se Symbianem a přešla na nově vznikající systém Windows Phone.

The first of which, understandably if you don’t happen to carry a burning penchant for cultishly adored but undeniably niche 80’s schlock, is simple: Why? First, why get invested in another asymmetrical multiplayer game from a studio that has a bit of a history with limited shelf lives? And why, of all the licenses, have they chosen one so relatively forgotten, at least in comparison to Predator, Ghostbusters, and Friday the 13th?

From a top-down view, you still play as a newly awakened vampire on PVE, PVP, or private servers, and you're still tasked with becoming the most powerful bloodsucker around. It has, however, streamlined some things and added in an endgame zone. All of this combines to form a survival game that was great back then and is even better now, with thrilling MOBA-esque fights and little in the way of faff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hardcore tactical FPS Gray Zone Warfare is proving to be yet another of 2024’s unexpected successes, shifting over half a million copies when it launched into early access last week. Unfortunately, in its attempt to eat Escape from Tarkov’s lunch – a timely one, given that game’s self-inflicted DLC misery – it’s currently choking on the wishbone of some truly dire performance issues. Even players with tip-top graphics cards are seeing heavy stuttering while out in the field, and none of the updates released thus far, including today’s Hotfix #3, have done much to soothe it.
Said hotfix does include some fixes for other widespread problems, including a second attempt at preventing players from becoming headless when rejoining a server (an amusing though resilient glitch, given a previous hotfix had also tried to nix it). But having played a bit of this third patch on a usually reliable RTX 4060, there’s clearly an awful lot of work left to do before Gray Zone Warfare performs acceptably.

Naturally, our favourite gods and goddesses are emerging from our evenings of hacking and/or slashing. For me, Nemesis provides a lot of chuckles. Not because she's bright and jokey (she is frownier than a wet bulldog). But because she's determined to put the player in their place and to beat you at your own roguelike. Narratively, she fulfills a role similar to Meg in the first Hades, that of closest frenemy. But in gameplay terms, Nemesis won't stoop to something as trite as a boss battle. Oh no. She's out to mess with your build.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed the Switch has surpassed 140 million units sold, further securing its current place as the second-best-selling console in the company's history. This news arrives at the same time Nintendo has revealed it will announce the Switch successor by March 2025, meaning there's still some time for the Switch to catch up to Nintendo's best-selling console: the Nintendo DS. 
Since the last financial results call, the Switch has sold an additional 1.96 million units, bringing its grand total up to 141.32. That keeps it in second place, only behind the Nintendo DS' massive 154.02 million. It's possible the Switch surpasses the Nintendo DS, especially considering the Switch will likely continue to sell even once its successor is released, but that's a big 13 million-unit gap to close. 


Elsewhere in the financial results, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has hit 20.28 million units sold, Super Mario Bros. Wonder has sold through 11.96 million, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe another 6.79 million, and Pikmin 4 3.33 million. The fiscal year ending with March 2024 was a strong one for Switch software, selling 163.95 million units in Q1 through Q3 of Fiscal Year 2024. However, compared to the same quarters for Fiscal Year 2023, Switch software is down 4.7%. 
With the Switch successor on the horizon, that number will likely be way up this time next year. 
In the meantime, read about the Nintendo Direct happening next month, and then check out Game Informer's top 10 Switch games. After that, check out this list of the Switch's best-selling games.

Software has reached 1.235 billion units. 


"This is Furukawa, President of Nintendo," the company's announcement reads on X (formerly Twitter). "We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year. It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015. We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation."
This announcement follows industry reports from earlier this year stating the Switch successor was targeting a March 2025 release date. That could still be the case given Furukawa's reveal, but given the timeline, Nintendo could also announce the successor that month, meaning we likely wouldn't have it in our hands until later that year. Only time will, though, but at least we now officially know that by this time next year, we'll know what the successor to the Switch is.

I'd say it's maybe a Gorogoa-like, but the demo is also a series of little vignettes that sort of reminded me of Edith Finch, but way less in depth. It's about a middle aged woman navigating her past and present by taking a closer at her mind, which means sorting through a load of magical realist meldings of memories. It's very pretty, and I liked the demo a lot.

It can be a lot to dig into, given the game more or less tosses you into the deep end without context for how things work, at least initially. Instead of spending several runs figuring things out, here’s a short, spoiler-free primer explaining some core new features to get you going on the right foot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been sampling Hades 2’s early access build on the Steam Deck, and my only complaint – besides the smooching frog having eluded me for hours – is that it’s giving me very little to write about, performance analysis-wise. Honestly, it fits the dinky PC so well you’d have thought Supergiant had decided to make this roguelike sequel a Steam Deck game that just happened to run on desktops by accident.
Hades the first was much the same, taking to the Deck like Hercules to Augean shit, but Hades 2 barely even gives away that fact that it’s unfinished. It doesn’t crash, stutter, or hang, and there’s no point in talking about settings when it runs at a practically perfect 60fps on max quality. Make that 90fps on the Steam Deck OLED, too. It’s just a fabulous game for handhelds, even in its earliest of early access days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hades II, the much-anticipated sequel to Supergian's excellent roguelike, is entering Early Access today and is on the cover of Game Informer Magazine with incredible original art by acclaimed artist Jen Zee. Join Alex Van Aken – who visited Supergiant for the cover story and has played Hades II extensively – and myself for a look at the game's second area and boss fight. Spoilers ahead if you want to experience the locations and enemies for yourself, but otherwise, enjoy this New Gameplay Today episode!
This second area in Hades II is called Oceanus, an underwater realm Melinoë uses to bypass the armies of Chronos, the game's antagonist and Titan of Time. Oceanus is generally more difficult to navigate than Erebus, the first area, due to explosive hazards, more powerful ranged enemies, and darting schools of swordfish. The level culminates in a musical boss fight against a rock band of sirens led by Scylla, a well-known sea monster from Greek myth. Scylla sings while her keyboardist and drummer back her up. Despite sharing one health bar, the individual monsters can be stunned and knocked out of the fight, muting the appropriate instruments in the active music track.

The cover story reveals why Supergiant decided to create its first sequel, how it chose a new protagonist in Zagreus' sister, Melinoë, along with her mythological origins, and how the team is changing its approach to early access and the content it has planned for the future.

The game’s first big patch goes a step further, seemingly boosting the game’s performance to a degree that its minimum and recommended hardware specs have been lowered as a result.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost of Tsushima, the hit 2020 PlayStation-exclusive samurai game, rides onto PC on May 16, and ahead of the game's launch there, developer Sucker Punch Productions has revealed players will not need a PlayStation Network account to play through the game's single-player story mode, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. However, a PSN account will be required to play through Ghost of Tsushima's multiplayer Legends mode, or if you want to use the new PlayStation PC overlay to acquire trophies and more. 
This follows news from last week where PlayStation announced (and later walked back) that Helldivers 2 players will soon be required to link a PSN account to their Steam account, leading to widespread anger in the game's community. It seems Sucker Punch is looking to get ahead of this by revealing its PSN plans ahead of the game's launch in 10 days. 
Thank you for your feedback.
May 3, 2024
If you're unfamiliar with Ghost of Tsushima: Legends, it's a standalone multiplayer experience that allows you and up to three other players to fight enemies in special missions, defeat waves of foes, and complete raids. A PSN account will be required to play Legends, but if you want to play through the game's story (and Iki Island expansion), you won't need one. 
Ghost of Tsushima hit PlayStation 4 on July 17, 2020, before launching on PlayStation 5 with a Director's Cut on August 20, 2021. This is the version of the game hitting PC in 10 days on May 16, 2024.
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Ghost of Tsushima review, and then read about why the Director's Cut of Ghost of Tsushima is a must-play for fans.

Ahead of the game's May 21 launch, developer Ninja Theory has revealed the PC specs and system requirements for Senua's Saga: Hellblade II and to play the game at its best, you'll need quite a powerful system. 
If you're familiar with Ninja Theory's work, you likely already know it pushes the envelope with technology so it might not come as a surprise your PC will need to do the same.

Senua's Saga: Hellblade II PC Specs And System Requirements
Below is a chart released by Ninja Theory detailing everything you need to know about running Senua's Saga: Hellblade II at its most demanding, recommended specs, and even at the bare minimum. And as you can see, it's a game that requires a lot of power (click the image to enlarge). 
Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21.

Amongst other things, they'd reach over and flick the power off while I was playing The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. I didn't finish that game for 15 years. I'd flown the family nest before I braved the Eagle's Tower. Can you imagine what my friends would have done if I'd owned a Game Boy Camera? Probably, they'd have taken photos of... bottoms with it, and such. 
I'm aware I'm not making a great case for being a graduate of the School of Hard Knocks. The point is: I didn't have a Game Boy Camera then, so I'm delighted that the Game Boy Camera has caught on among a later generation of indie PC developers - prominent among them artist and educator Catharine Graffam, whose GB Camera Gallery: Mystery Show you can play for free in a browser.

A new survey carried out by French anti-piracy agency Arcom reveals how internet users circumvent blocking and their preferred tools. More importantly from a piracy mitigation perspective, the survey reveals why users feel the need to circumvent blocking in the first place.

The environments take hefty influence from Carceri d'invenzione, a series of prints created in the 18th century by Giovanni Battista Piranesi, whose name has become a byword for impossible spaces.

It's now almost seven years later but at least one person has not forgotten this missed opportunity. A fighting game modder has been tinkering with shaders to bring the comic book style of previous games to Infinite. Looks cool.

His demonic influence manifests into world-distorting gameplay sequences as Indika explores the rural wilds of early 20th-century Russia.
