Earlier this week, Nintendo dropped a major firmware update - bumping the software up to version 14.0.0. The talking point of this update is the ability to now group software together.

No doubt about it, Yoshitaka Amano is one of the most famous video game artists in the world, and probably one of the most famous Japanese artists too. His distinctive, elegant character designs and illustrations brough together western comic book art, Japanese woodblock print, and Art Nouveau to create something that felt alive on the paper.
Though he worked on the anime Speed Racer and novel Vampire Hunter D, he didn't get into the video game art scene until 1987, when the very first Final Fantasy was in development. And while he stepped down as the lead character designer after Final Fantasy VI, he has continued to provide logos for the series - all of which are iconic.

If you’re a fan of 2019’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and plan to visit Galaxy Edge at one of the Disney parks in the near future, there’s good news. As spotted by Venture Beat, Cal Kestis’ lightsaber hilt will soon be available to purchase, thanks to it winning a 2020 fan poll for requested legacy lightsabers. 
Beginning March 25, you can buy Cal’s legacy lightsaber hilt at Dok-Ondar’s Den of Antiquities. It sports the signature damaged base but comes with a dual lightsaber adapter. That means you can make it a double-bladed sword should you buy a second hilt. You can display the replica as is, or add a blade to it at Savi’s Workshop – Handbuilt Lightsabers store. Actor Cameron Monaghan, who portrayed Cal in the game, visited Disneyland to get an early peek at his signature weapon and make it a full lightsaber. You can view the photos from his visit, such as the one above, at the Disney Parks Blog. 
There’s no word how much Cal’s weapon will cost, but replica lightsabers can run for over $100, and adding a blade to them is similarly pricey. You can only buy the lightsaber at Galaxy’s Edge in Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, FL or Disneyland Park in Anaheim, CA.
You can watch us relieve Cal Ketis’ entire journey in our ongoing Super Replay of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, which may hold you over as we eagerly await the confirmed sequel.

Another excellent puzzle-platformer is making its way to the Switch: Toodee and Topdee, a game that plays with dimensional perspective to create a ton of brain-tingly levels to solve!
Toodee and Topdee is all about the two titular characters, who can each see from a different perspective. Toodee sees everything as a 2D platformer, while Topdee sees the same levels as a top-down puzzle... and you can switch between the two at will. Some levels will reveal secrets when viewed in a different way, while others will require you to move platforms in the top-down view to help Toodee land on his feet.

We all know Super Mario Bros., and we all know Paper Mario - but what if the two collided into a beautiful, origami mash-up?
That's exactly what the fan-made game Super Mario Bros. Papercraft has done, taking the original NES classic and twisting it into a rather delightful 2.5D visual treat. Right now, only the first world is playable, right up to the first encounter with Boswer (and let's be honest, it probably won't be long until Nintendo swings that ban hammer), but it's a wonderful showcase of what can be done with a game that's about as familiar as the inside of your fridge.

Dying Light 2 Stay Human was released on February 4 to largely positive reviews and massive player count numbers, especially compared to that of the first Dying Light. It remains one of the highest-scoring games Game Informer has reviewed this year, receiving a 9.5 out of 10, and in less than 24 hours after release, Dying Light 2’s PC player count peak surpassed Dying Light’s all-time high peak. 
By all accounts, Dying Light 2 was a massive success f…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look out for an invite.
Around a month ago Square Enix opened sign-ups in some territories for the early access beta of Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent, giving eager fans a chance to check out the localised mobile-only prequel. Now invites are starting to roll-out on Android, with one of our team getting a notification to download the app.
We've taken an initial look and have started a save, working through the tutorial so far and getting a feel for the mechanics. After the initial install the game wants additional downloads (which work in the background as you play the opening), so if you have limited mobile data perhaps wait until you're on Wi-Fi. After a small 14.5MB download you then have to choose between 644MB of 868MB for the main download, the latter including Japanese voices.

Up until about six years ago, my experience with the world of programming and code amounted to understanding what <b>formatting</b> meant in html, and vaguely remembering that one game about steering a turtle using basic commands like "FORWARD 10". I enjoy games, but I do not usually care to see the chaotic tangle of code that lives behind the screen. As long as it works, lads, I'm happy.
But about six years ago, I met my partner, who will be deeply embarrassed to know that I consider him a programming wizard. He has a degree in computer science, and thinks that BASIC is "fun". Despite this, I fancied him like mad, and when you're a romantic dork, you try to impress people you fancy by attempting to learn the things they like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Sorry.).
Given how hard it is to come by, it's little surprise that the Analogue Pocket has become a treasured object for those lucky enough to own one. With that in mind, it goes without saying that some form of protection is in order – especially if you're going to be, you know, carrying this thing around with you, so thank goodness for the talents peeps over at WaterField Designs. As we reported not so long ago, they've cooked up a neat little $49 pouch which is the ideal replacement for Analogue's official hard-shell case (which is only really good for putting your console on display).
The pouch comes in black, blue, green and red (as you can see, we've opted for the rather swanky red version) and we can confirm the "high-performance textile" used for the outside is able to withstand bumps and scrapes with relative ease – although, because it's not a 'hard-shell' design, we'd avoid applying too much pressure to the pouch as it could result in damage to the console. You won't want to be placing this at the bottom of a bag full of other heavy items, for example.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is Microsoft’s monthly subscription that gives players access to not just Xbox Game Pass on consoles but also PC Game Pass and Xbox Live Gold. Now, alongside its other features, it includes three months of Marvel Unlimited. 
Marvel Unlimited is Marvel’s comic book subscription service that, like what Game Pass is for games, gives users access to tons of comic books on devices like phones, tablets, and more. In fact, in the trailer announcing this news, Marvel boasts that there are more than 29,000 digital comics on the service.

However, one important thing to note is that you must be a new Marvel Unlimited subscriber to take advantage of this deal. If you already have a subscription or have had one in the past, you will not be able to take advantage of these three free months on that account. However, you could always create a new Marvel Unlimited account. Over on the Xbox side of things, fortunately, this deal applies to both existing and new Ultimate subscribers. 
News of Marvel Unlimited joining Xbox Game Pass Ultimate in this capacity isn’t surprising. Not only has Microsoft been bolstering the offerings of Ultimate consistently to boost its subscription count, but it already has partnerships with Marvel’s parent company, Disney, in the form of free Disney Plus service. It also includes bonuses like EA Play, discounts, and free perks, like a monthly Halo Infinite cosmetic pack.]]></summary>

Bytten Studio's upcoming open-world monster collector Cassette Beasts is shaping up to be a record-scratcher when it eventually comes out. Today, publisher Raw Fury has shared a brand new trailer that showcases the cosy, comfortable world of New Wirral.
This turn-based RPG has the look and feel of Pokémon, but with the ability to fuse the rhythm and music-inspired monsters is a lot closer to Digimon. Clearly capturing the "vibes" of the '90s from its inspirations, instead of sending monsters out to do battle, your character transforms into them at the click of a cassette player.

Time on Frog Island is a delightfully silly-looking sandbox game that puts you in the shipwrecked boots of a sailor stranded on an island. He needs to repair his vessel to escape and can only turn to the island’s frog citizens for help. Unfortunately, the sailor can’t speak his language and can only get the materials he needs by trading for them.
The core of the game involves navigating a web of trades as you sprint across the island, figuring out different methods of gathering everything everyone needs while solving puzzles. Holding different items grants unique abilities, encouraging discovery and experimentation. Your captain protagonist also sports a froggy tongue for some reason, which you can use to snap distant items. When you’re not reassembling your boat, you can relax with some fishing or farming.  You can watch the new trailer unveiled during GDC below.

Jim, Dave, and Sally all have their map markers in Vice City for a portion of the game, then they'll shift over to Tilted Towers after a few hours. Perhaps the bridge to Shrek's Swamp won't open unless you rescue the princess from Bowser's Castle later down the line.
And there's nothing wrong with an open world that gently steers you in the right direction. Elden Ring does this with its checkpoints that blow the equivalent of directional arrows in the breeze, helping you feel in control of your progress. But I'd argue it's even better at the opposite: wresting that control away in a split-second.

By now, you may well be familiar with Robotry's style of platforming: You control both legs (or arms?) of a little robot lad, and you can use your controller to move them individually, grab onto things, and let go. It's a simple system, but if you've got excellent hand-eye coordination, you can use this simple system to approximate Real Human-Style Walking. Mostly.

Souldiers is a promising-looking retro-inspired action game that draws inspiration from Metroid and a sprinkle of Dark Souls. We now know it’s arriving this May and that it’s hitting PlayStation and Xbox platforms in addition to Switch and PC.
Launching May 19, Souldiers tosses Soulslike combat, RPG classes and progression, and side-scrolling Metroid-style exploration into a blender to form what looks to be a fun and challenging adventure. Characters take the roles of archer, caster, or scout and can be customized further thanks to various skill trees. Toppling enemies and bosses requires a mastery of when to attack, dodge, and parry. Outside of battle, you’ll solve environmental puzzles to unlock new areas of the vibrant, interconnected world.

Souldiers is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Thanks to a free Steam demo, you can find out if it’s up your alley right now.]]></summary>

As part of our long-running (but often neglected) Ninterview series – where we speak to Nintendo fans from all walks of life – we got the chance to sit down with British actor George Banks, who is perhaps most famous in this part of the world for his role as Henry Newton in Coronation Street, the world's longest-running soap opera. What fans of that show might not know is that George is a massive Nintendo fan. We caught up with him to discuss his love of all things Nintendo, his other acting roles (including voice-over work on Harry Potter video games) and much more besides.

Doomfist, a damage hero in Overwatch, will be swapping roles in Overwatch 2, whenever that finally releases. 
This news comes by way of Overwatch 2 game director Aaron Keller, who announced that Doomfist would instead become a tank hero during a recent stream, as reported by PC Gamer. Keller even touched on some details regarding this change, including some switches to Doomfist’s moveset to make him a Tank. 
“He basically has a leap that’s similar to a Winston leap,” Keller said. 
Winston’s leap is more about horizontal movement whereas Doomfist’s leap, as it stands today in Overwatch, is about vertical height and resulting slamdown damage. It sounds like his leap will be more similar to Winston’s in Overwatch 2, which makes sense because it would give Doomfist the ability to reach a combat scenario quicker and tank some damage. 
PC Gamer reports that Keller further described the tank version of Doomfist as “more surviveable” with “good escape” capatilibies. During the stream, Overwatch lead hero designer Geoff Goodman said Doomfist “does a lot less damage” as a tank than when he was a hero, but he also said that today, in Overwatch 2’s closed alpha, Doomfist is overpowered and in need of a nerf. 
This is a big change for Doomfist, which accompanies larger changes happening in Overwatch 2, like a shift to 5v5 gameplay. Bastion will also be wildly different in Overwatch 2, as well. For more about Overwatch 2, read about how Blizzard is “decoupling” Overwatch 2’s PvP and PvE experiences.

Retro Forge revealed at The MIX showcase that its Soulslike Metroidvania, Souldiers, will be releasing on 19th May. To celebrate - and to match its stunning pixel art - a new trailer premiered during the show with some lovely anime-esque visuals from Sunshine Animation, the Spanish animation studio behind intros for games like Cris Tales, Sword of the Necromancer, Blasphemous, and more!
What sets this Metroidvania apart from the sea of other excellent examples is that you can customise your character. You can play as a scout, caster, or archer, and each class brings its own benefits to both combat and action. Each class also has its own skill tree to help develop your character however you want!

The House of the Dead: Remake is just around the corner, launching on the Switch eShop on April 7th (you can also pre-order one of three sweet physical editions from Forever Limited). We're excited to see how the 1996 classic has been revamped for the Switch, but one of the biggest questions lingering for many fans was whether it would actually support gyro controls or not.
The good news is that yes, of course it does. It may seem obvious, but some readers (and some of us, too) were concerned that perhaps the upcoming remake would opt for stick-and-button controls as its sole control method. As it turns out, however, gyro support was previously mentioned in an extensive list of features (silly us!), but just to be extra cautious we reached out to Forever Entertainment to check once again for ourselves.

The lumbering forms of Elden Ring’s trolls disguise an ancient melancholy. Turned traitors in the war between demigods and giants, their reward for loyalty to the Golden Lineage was an eternity in shackles, used as frontline fodder in bloody conflicts or beasts of burden hauling funereal carriages around the Lands Between. Since learning their history, I often muse sadly upon it, as I weave between their horribly gnarled legs in my freshly tarnished underwear and hoover up the shiny objects scattered underneath their feet. 


I’m on my second run of Elden Ring now, progressing slowly and methodically, examining every statue and reading every spell description. But the first time through, the need to cram the whole content buffet in my face at once got the better of me. Underleveled and underprepared for most areas, I developed the winning strategy of stripping down to my burial rags for a speed boost and streaking through the wilds, shoving everything valuable down my pants.

Ubisoft announced back in September that Far Cry 6 would be crossing over with Stranger Things in future DLC and today, the company has revealed that this crossover will go live tomorrow. 
Ubisoft revealed that the Stranger Things crossover mission starts March 24 in a new teaser trailer released today that offers a quick glimpse at some of the imagery that will be featured in it. As expected, it features some sights that fans of Netflix’s Stranger Things will recognize, like the infamous Demogorgon, the trademark red skies, and more. As it’s still Far Cry 6, protagonist Dani Rojas will be the playable character during this crossover mission, but perhaps some familiar faces will show up in it, too.

On top of that, this mission will be playable by all because this weekend – March 24 through March 27 – Far Cry 6 will be free to play. Like the rest of Far Cry 6, this crossover mission can be played alone or in co-op. 
Despite being announced months ago with a release date less than 24 hours away, not much is known about this Stranger Things crossover. It’s certainly an odd piece of DLC, considering there’s not much, if anything, that connect the two franchises, but it looks like it’s going to be a good time nonetheless. Fortunately, we don’t have to wait too long to find out because it’s out tomorrow. 
For more about Far Cry 6, read Game Informer’s Far Cry 6 review and then find out why it’s on Game Informer’s list of the top 10 action games to play right now. After that, catch up on the Far Cry 4 Pagan Min DLC recently released for Far Cry 6.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's the verdict?
Kirby and the Forgotten Land is right around the corner and it's looking like our favourite pink hero's venture into 3D is a resounding success. Ahead of its release, we've put together a round up of some of the reviews released so far.
Before we do so, however, make sure you check out our own review on Nintendo Life. We gave the game a 9/10, stating that it is "bursting at the seams with fun and inventiveness, managing to transpose everything we know and love about past Kirby games to this all-new arena whilst adding plenty of delightful new aspects as it goes".

      Sony Interactive Entertainment
      
Editor’s Note: Video Games Chronicle is reporting that after updating to this new update for PlayStation 5 (and PlayStation 4), users are unable to play online games. Before updating, please take note of that. However, if you’ve already downloaded the update, it’s hard to imagine that PlayStation doesn’t get this fixed as soon as possible. 
A new update for the PS5 is live and it brings a number of enhancements to the console, including improvements to parties, UI enhancement to Game Base and Trophy Cards, and more. 
Before diving into the details of the update in a new PlayStation Blog post, though, Sony revealed that players can expect Variable Refresh Rate support in the coming months. Of course, this will only be an option to those…]]></summary>

At yesterday's MIX showcase, visual effects studio Tuatara Games revealed a brand new, delightfully silly brawler that's coming to Switch - and you won't need pants for this one.
Bare Butt Boxing tells you exactly what the basic premise is from the name alone. A group of aliens, fascinated by boxing, travel to Earth to participate in their favourite sport. The problem is, they're not accustomed to any of the rules or laws of the planet, so baring their posteriors for all to see, they attempt to replicate their favourite boxers on Earth - with chaotic results.

Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is Gearbox Software's best game. Built upon the studio's successful Borderlands formula, this experience adds a whimsical element to the familiar looter-shooter thrills and delivers so much firepower to your fingertips you'd think you were wearing the Infinity Gauntlet. Caked in silliness and always trying to make you laugh, Wonderlands hits with distinct charm and handles its characters and world with care, making you engage with both on a journey I didn't want to end.

This story trailer is a bit of a tease, in that it doesn't really de-mystify any of the elements of the game that I found most mystifying in my earlier preview, but it definitely does give you a flavour of the kind of adventures and quick-fixes you get into as Vix the space mechanic. Plus it shows off some of the cooler visual flair FixFox has (especially in its loading screens). Give it a watch after the cut.

As Matthew's review notes, there’s a lot of busywork, but Tango Gamework’s rain-slicked rendition of the Japanese capital is quite the place to explore. And to gawp at, even if you don’t have the hardware for its fanciest ray tracing capabilities. 


Indeed, despite some spooky-looking system requirements, Ghostwire: Tokyo can run well on older or lower-spec builds, just as surely as it gets the most out of the very best graphics cards. Within these paragraphs we’ll take a close inspection of how it handles different hardware and display resolutions, as well as which are the best settings to change for optimal PC performance.

Nintendo’s insatiable pink mascot finally has his first full-featured 3D adventure with Kirby and the Forgotten Land. After being sucked into a mysterious vortex (oh, how the tables have turned), he finds himself transported to what looks to be an unknown post-apocalyptic world. By building upon his old bag of tricks and adding successful new gimmicks like Mouthful Mode, Kirby makes a fantastic transition to the third dimension. 
Kirby’s classic suite of abilities are all here and are as fun to use as ever, only now he’s able to use them in 3D space. He can j…]]></summary>

Fobia - St. Dinfna Hotel is a newly announced survival horror game opening its doors this year that invites players to survive a monster-infested hotel. Its resource management and puzzle-solving evoke shades of a modern Resident Evil in a way that has our attention, as does its time-traveling hook. 
Players control rookie journalist Roberto who investigates the infamously haunted St. Dinfna Hotel. The building, located in Treze Trilhas, Santa Catarina, Brazil, has been the subject of rumored disappearances connected to paranormal phenomena, and it’s your job to get to the bottom of it all. Spoiler: the hotel is all sorts of infested by sinister creatures looking to kill you.

Surviving requires thoughtful management of resources. Depending on your inventory, it may be better to run and hide than to fight whatever monstrosity hunts you. St. Dinfna is riddled with puzzles, and Roberto possesses a mysterious camera that connects him to parallel realities, letting players explore past, present, and future timelines to uncover all of the hotel’s secrets. The game’s website also mentions that players will control another protagonist besides Roberto, with both stories intertwining to a grand finale. 
Fobia – St. Dinfna Hotel multiversal storytelling adds an intriguing layer to the standard haunted house affair, and we’re curious to see how it pans out when it arrives later this to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Or you can sample its scares now, thanks to a free Steam demo.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cantata, the upcoming game from Afterschool Studio, is releasing in Early Access on the 12th of May. It's a turn-based strategy game set during a surreal and futuristic war, where, shocker, the aim is to kill your opponent. The twist is that while you’re building your base in each encounter, you’ll also need to manage logistics. The maps in Cantata are bigger than most other strategy games, so you’ll have to construct a supply chain alongside your army to keep your base expanding. And it’s all wrapped up in a unique and colourful aesthetic too.

Square Enix has made a name for itself for many reasons, one of them for its penchant for iconic enemy and boss designs. Kefka. Sephiroth. Sora's pants. The list goes on. In that way, Forspoken has a lot to live up to, and Developer Luminous Production's follow-up to Final Fantasy XV is attempting to do just that. Today, we're showing off exclusive 4K gameplay featuring the baddies that would halt protagonist Frey Holland from accomplishing her goal of saving Athia.

But what's a tour of the enemies of Forspoken without knowledgeable guides? Join your hosts Kimberley Wallace and Alex Stadnik as they prep you for what you'll be fighting ahead of the game's October 11 release date. In the first part of today's spicy 4K video, we outline the tier structure of what you'll be battling. The blight is a mythical storm that mutates anything it touches and has turned the beautiful world of Athia into a terrifying magical hellscape. Enemies physically change depending on which of the three tiers they fall into. The deeper you go into the storm, the higher tiered the foe will be, and thus the challenge also rises alongside their increasingly scary appearance. On top of that, we highlight the Pitiless Arbiter, a mini-boss terror that Frey will have to vanquish if she hopes to return home.
Thank you as always for watching our latest cover video. Let us know what you think in the comments below. Enjoyed today's look at Forspoken but want more? We have an entire month of written and video coverage featuring Square Enix's exciting new ARPG, including exclusive looks at the spells Frey uses, a tour of the latest area of Avoalet, and our in-depth preview impressions on The Game Informer Show.

All we've got to go on is a cryptic image of a lynx-like Witcher medallion sitting in a bed of snow. Some of us from the Treehouse ran through what we'd like to see from The Witcher 4, including some truly insightful quotes about leg muscles from myself. One thing I failed to mention, though, was Roach, Geralt's horse.
I'm sure Roach has a great personality, I'm sure he's very kind. But from a purely professional standpoint, I can't stand him. He's hardly smooth in the stirrups, nor can he really climb anything substantial. That's why I'd like Roach swapped out for Elden Ring's Torrent, a horse-goat that corners like Colin McCrae and double jumps like Super Mario. The Witcher 4 deserves a super horse like Torrent.

      Electronic Arts
			
Developer:
      EA Tiburon
      
EA Sports PGA Tour has been delayed out of 2022 and will now launch sometime during Spring 2023. 
EA’s big return to golf video games never had a firm release date and had been pushed out of its Spring 2022 window last November. The press release announcing the delay does not cite a reason for the change in plans.  
First announced in March 2021, EA Sports PGA Tour is the first golf game from the publisher after a years-long hiatus. So far, we know that it will feature the Masters Tournament (which the game has an exclusive partnership with), PGA Championship, U.S. Open Championship, and The Open Championship. It also has a career mode that includes The Players Championship and FedExCup Playoffs. The game will also include the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) and The Amundi Evian Championship. EA Sports PGA Tour is being developed using the Frostbite Engine by EA Tiburon. 
EA still has not confirmed the platforms PGA Tour will appear on, but one would imagine it’ll target current consoles and/or PC. In the meantime, check out this opinion piece on why EA should abandon the annual release model for its sports games.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has given away some cool and outright strange custom consoles in the past, but its latest creation may top them all in the weird category. To celebrate the upcoming premiere of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, the company is giving away a movie-themed Xbox Series S accompanied by a pair of furry controllers modeled after Sonic and Knuckles.
The gamepads are covered in what Microsoft describes as “textured coatings reminiscent of the ‘bristly’ texture of hedgehogs in the wild.” Excusing that Knuckles is an echidna, the controllers are officially dubbed Sonic Blue and Knuckles Red. It appears that only the front of these controllers is fur-covered; the back retains the standard textured plastic. The console itself sports a black paint job with a big gold ring around the vent with an image of the two rivals clashing. It’s... imaginative, to say the least, though I can’t imagine the dust and debris those controllers will collect over time. But at least they should feel comfy to hold. 
There are two ways to get your hands around this unique piece of hardware. You can either retweet the sweepstakes tweet and include #XboxSonic2Sweepstakes or redeem Microsoft Rewards Points (US only) in the console’s rewards app. You can read the official rules by visiting the contest’s Xbox Wire post. The contest begins today and wraps up on April 30. 
Sonic the Hedgehog 2 premieres in theaters on April 8, but it’s already getting a third film and a spin-off series on Paramount+. To gawk at other movie-themed Xbox consoles, check out this custom Shang-Chi Series X.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you heard of Humanoid Studios, the new development team led by ex-Bioware boss Casey Hudson? Last summer, Hudson announced the company on Twitter, stating, "[Humanoid Studios is a] videogame company built to unleash the creative freedom of developers - bringing innovation and artistry to players through an all-new IP." The details surrounding this project have remained a mystery for almost a year, but new concept art uploaded to the developer's site might offer some clues about what Hudson and co. are making. According to the now-updated home page, Humanoid Studios is creating a multi-platform science-fiction game.  
Humanoid Studios' "Our Mission" section reads as follows, "Delivering magical interactive storytelling, by connecting talented creatives to powerful tools, in a safe and supportive environment. Our current project is a multi-platform AAA game, focusing on character-driven narrative in an all-new science-fiction universe." The background art on the site is reminiscent of games like Destiny and GTFO. Of course, Mass Effect influences are apparent, too, with ethereal alien ruins, craggy vistas, and hazy underbellies. 
"By combining excellence in the arts with innovative technologies, videogames have the extraordinary power to transport you to new worlds of adventure," Hudson states. "That's what first inspired me to make games, and it's at the heart of what we do at Humanoid Studios." When the developer's flagship title will release is anyone's guess, but it's safe to assume that the game is still in early development as several roles – from level designers to systems programmers – are being sought out. 
What do you hope to see in Humanoid Studios' upcoming sci-fi adventure?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the comments under my interview with the Paradise Killer devs last week, someone suggested posting more of the answers as like a B-side. I thought this was an excellent suggestion, for three reasons: 1) it's a much easier post to write on my part compared to doing the full interview; b) Oli Clarke Smith and Phil Crabtree said a bunch of interesting things that I wasn't able to cram into the article; iii) it might give you a sense of how weird interviews actually are. 
This transcript is just two questions and a follow-up, but runs to over 1500 words. The whole conversation I had with these two dudes was over 40 minutes long. So much of interviews gets discarded (like tears in rain etc) and the process of distilling it all down to a few quotes can be, to put it succinctly, a pain in the hole. Especially if your interview subject talks quickly. Top tip to people who don't like interviews: talk slowly. It'll be over faster.

Rare Games has announced that the next Sea of Thieves adventure, Forts of the Forgotten, will launch this week, giving players two weeks to make a daring rescue for the residents of the Golden Sands Outpost. 
Rare also released a new cinematic trailer showcasing what’s in store in Forts of the Forgotten to get pirates prepared for their next adventure. It begins with a Sea Fort, a new addition to the game as of this month’s Season Six, where we see one pirate held captive in a jail cell watched by two pirate ghosts from a Spanish fleet. The two speak of their dreaded captain, and it turns out, it’s The Servant of the Flame, who longtime players will recognize as the former leader of The Reaper’s Hideout. 
Click here to watch embedded media
As you can see in the trailer above, The Servant of the Flame wants something from the pirate held captive, but before we can find out why he needs her, the trailer cuts to a ship sailing just outside the Sea Fort. We then see the Masked Stranger, who some suspect is either in cahoots or at odds with The Servant of the Flame. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don’t have to wait too long because Forts of the Forgotten begins this Thursday, on March 24, and will run through April 7. 
Sea of Thieves’ first adventure, Shrouded Islands, was released in February. Forts of the Forgotten represents a new addition to the game that will happen each month.

Nintendo announced this news in a blog post today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer:
      Nintendo
      
The latest update for Nintendo Switch lets players organize their games into groups; this applies to all Switch models. If you also own an Xbox, the functionality of this new feature is quite similar to the groups setting on Microsoft's console.
The latest #NintendoSwitch update is now available, including a new feature to create groups for software on the console.
https://t.co/RuNTfgEKBl pic.twitter.com/UFiwuOc1fw
March 22, 2022
For more information, including images, head here. But I'll also be listing the ground rules of creating software groups on Switch below. You'll probably be happy to hear that the update has accounted for large numbers of potential groups:
The All Software menu and groups are only available when more than 12 software titles are saved on the Nintendo Switch system.
Up to 100 groups can be created with a max of 200 titles per group.
The same software title can be added to multiple groups.
And here's a comprehensive step-by-step summary of how you can go about making any group of your choice:
Make sure your Nintendo Switch system has been updated to version 14.0.0 or later.
From the Nintendo Switch HOME Menu, scroll all the way to the right and select All Software.
Press the L Button to view your software by groups.
The first time you create a group, you’ll get a popup where you can select Create New Group.
After the first group has been created, click the +Button to create a new group.
Check all software titles that you want to add to the new group, then press Next.
Rearrange the software titles as desired, then press Next.
Enter a name for the group, then press OK.
The new group will be added to the list of Groups.
And there you have it. Now you'll be able to organize your games by franchise, genre, and more. Hopefully future Switch updates will bring even more customization options. I, for one, am hoping to eventually select dynamic themes for my dashboard. Only time will tell what else Nintendo has in store for its playerbase.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starship Troopers - Terran Command, an upcoming RTS based on the film series, has been delayed to June 16th 2022. Well, in the grand scheme of delays, that’s not too bad. The original release date for Starship Troopers - Terran Command was March 31st, just nine days away. Publisher Slitherine Games and developers The Artistocrats announced the news in a Steam post for the game, pinning the reason on “further polish and bug fixing.”

Right now this driver isn't the default over ACPI CPUFreq and I haven't seen any Linux distribution vendors announce their plans to immediately default to this new driver, but over the months ahead I expect that to change. In any case, if wanting to use amd_pstate on Linux 5.17 today here is a brief how-to guide for making the transition...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Právě vyšla nová verze desktopové RSS čtečky RSS Guard. RSS Guard je čtečka, která cílí jak na začátečníky tak pokročilé uživatelé a podporuje všechny rozšířené syndikační formáty a mnoho online služeb. RSS Guard nabízí rozhraní pro zásuvné moduly, přes které lze doimplementovat podporu pro další služby.

Změn v nové verzi 4.2.0 je nyní nezvykle mnoho a mezi největší patří:

- podpora manuálního řazení položek v seznamu kanálů
- podpora zobrazování víceřádkových nadpisů v seznamu zpráviček
- nastavitelný formát datumu/času u zpráviček - navíc i možnost nastavení relativního času, či samostatného formátu pro dnešní zprávičky
- zobrazení počtu nepřečtených zpráviček v taskbaru (Linux, Windows), zobrazení průběhu stahování barvičkou v taskbaru (Windows)
- "čtecí režím" pro zobrazení zjednodušené varianty webové stránky
- zrychlení synchronizace Gmailu
- funkce "share-to-published" pro TT-RSS
- a další...


Nová verze obsahuje hodně UX oprav a úprav, opravena byl problém s kódováním znaků v MariaDB backendu, hodně věcí bylo přepsáno ve střevech programu.

Navíc má autor rozkopané hned 2 nové pluginy - Newsblur a Reddit. Jejich uvedení se ale nedá očekávat v horizontů dnů či týdnů.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last night, CD Projekt announced they were working on a brand-new Witcher game. Details are thin on the ground at the moment. All we have to go on is a cryptic piece of artwork showing what appears to be a lynx-like medallion peeking through some snow, and a declaration that it's going to represent a "new saga" of The Witcher series. Heck, we don't even know if it's technically going to be called The Witcher 4 yet (it probably isn't, in fairness), but for sake of ease that's how I'm going to refer to it for the time being. 
Still, talk of a new saga has got me thinking. Does that mean we'll simply see a new protagonist in the existing Witcher timeline we know and love? (Ciri, perhaps, or young hot Vesemir?) Or will it go earlier, maybe tying into the upcoming Netflix prequel The Witcher: Blood Origin that's set 1200 years before the events of the books? Or something else entirely? We probably won't know the answers for some time, but until CD Projekt have more beans to spill, RPS asks: what would you like to see from a new game in The Witcher series?

It’s an action platformer with gorgeous hand-drawn animation work, and as Red Candle put it, it’s “a journey of Asian fantasy inspired by Sekiro, Hollow Knight and Katana Zero.” That’s me sold. And clearly a lot of other people agree too, because Nine Sols broke its goal of three million Taiwanese dollars (that’s roughly £80,000) within 24 hours.

The King of Fighters is known for having oppressive and cheap bosses that prey on players at the end of the given game's arcade mode, and SNK is bringing back one of the most infamous boss characters in the series.
Starting on April 14, Omega Rugal will be revived in The King of Fighters XV as a free DLC available for any owner of the game. You can check out the trailer below which debuted as part of the Japan Fighting Game Publishers Roundtable that took place late last night. Rugal is quick, ruthless, and won't hesitate to leave undefended characters hanging on with nary a few pixels of life.

Along with the inclusion of Omega Rugal is the introduction of Boss Challenge, a new mode that tests the skills of players against an amped-up version of Rugal. In it, Omega Rugal dons a fancy new jacket with armored shoulder pads and gauntlets which can be used by any player strong enough to take down this retro threat.
You can attempt to "vanquish the nightmare" in The King of Fighters XV on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC when the DLC releases in a few weeks. The full game itself, including the newly released pack of Team Garou characters, are available now.]]></summary>

While there have been several trailers for the upcoming action RPG, Forspoken, much of the title's plot has remained a mystery. We know that Frey Holland, an orphan trying to make her way in New York City, is abruptly transported to Athia, a mystical realm battered by a deadly blight. Unaffected by the land's spreading corruption, Frey strikes out to find her way home, learning magical combat abilities along the way. But how she gets to Athia, finds herself attached to a talking bangle, and discovers how to use magic is still a mystery.

It will also be kicking off a new venture into Unreal Engine 5, as the developer announced they were leaving their own REDengine behind as they embark on a new, multi-year strategic partnership with Epic Games.

Real love letters are written by people so ruined by an oxytocin-soaked brain that they’re compelled to pick up a quill and rattle off paragraph after paragraph of rambling, horny nonsense, a hot stream of unalloyed adoration that is destined to one day be read aloud in a grave voice by the host of a mid-tier crime podcast.


Shredders is an actual love letter to snowboarding. It might have been coded using cut up letters from magazines. It is a pure, geeky, effusive veneration of the sport and its players, and so sincere about its passion for going down the side of a mountain on a long bit of wood that it occasionally verges on embarrassing. You’ve heard of dancing like nobody's watching, now get ready for a game about snowboarding made as though nobody will ever play it.

You'll be able to play as Glover in a brand new PC port coming to both Steam and GOG, and rather than restoring the old PC port that already exists, it's been "completely redone" using the original source code from the N64 version of the game.

Piko Interactive are the developers behind this release. Buying old games and rereleasing them seems to be most of Piko's wheelhouse, as they've bought a bunch of old IPs and stuck the games onto digital storefronts. Piko Interactive were, for example, behind the Steam releases of Super 3D Noah's Ark, First Samurai, and something called Bubble Ghost which sounds cuter than it probably is. Piko's previous releases typically also include the original file for the game, so hopefully Glover purists will also be satisfied by this version. And game preservation is always a good thing.

It involves installing a beta version of Microsoft Edge (less great!) and, by way of a Game Pass Ultimate subscription, streaming those games to the Deck in a browser. Not running Game Pass games locally, in other words, but running them well enough to be playable, and with seamless compatibility for the Steam Deck’s controls.


After having gone through the lengthy setup process (explained below, if you want to try streaming Game Pass games on the Steam Deck yourself) and playing for a while, I can say it’s a good enough start in bringing Microsoft’s library to Valve’s handheld. Between this and the Epic Games Launcher, it’s a relief that the Deck’s default SteamOS won’t be limited to Steam games after all. Still, a beta is a beta, and there are very much some kinks to work out.

In fact, it's so not in danger that they announced a new 1.1.0 update to Babylon's Fall with a statement over on Twitter saying that they have "no plans to reduce the scale of development on Babylon's Fall."

There’s no official date set for the update yet, but you can read Platinum's full plans in a blog post. The update's split into two halves, with one focused on providing new content, and the other full of changes to try to improve the game based on player feedback. And I would imagine there's a lot of that to go through, based on how critical the reviews for Babylon's Fall were.

Netflix has revealed its next video game adaptation and it’s based on the popular Bandai Namco fighting series, Tekken. 
Titled Tekken: Bloodline, Netflix surprise announced this anime with a nearly two-minute teaser trailer that shows a young Jin Kazama learning the Kazama-Style Traditional Martial Arts combat style to hopefully combat a new evil, with a look at Heihachi Mishima too. Tekken: Bloodline is set to premiere sometime this year, but there’s no release date to be found in the teaser. There’s also no word on its length or how many episodes it will have.
Here’s Netflix’s description of the series:
Tekken: Bloodline joins a wealth of video game animated series adaptations coming in the future, many of which are being developed by Netflix. The streaming service isn't just focused on anime and animated series adaptations, though. Last week, it released new details and three new posters for its upcoming Resident Evil series. Whether or not any of these, including Tekken: Bloodline, pan out to be great remains to be seen, but if Netflix’s Arcane is any indication, we’re in for a treat. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer’s Tekken 7 review and then check out this gameplay of Tekken’s Kazuya in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Read about Bandai Namco’s most expensive game to date, which is being developed by Tekken 7 director Katsuhiro Harada, after that.

A Plague Tale: Innocence, which was a surprise hit back when it was released in 2019, is getting the TV series treatment. 
This news comes by way of French director Mathieu Turi, who confirmed that he’s working on the adaptation on Twitter, as reported by Eurogamer. Turi’s involvement makes sense, too, because the publication reports that U.S. production studios passed over the project, which led to interest in it being a Fren…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's incredible to me that the last Lego Star Wars game came out in 2016. This was Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens, based on the first game in the new trilogy. For whatever reason, the other two films never got their own games - I just assumed that was because nobody liked the films that much. The truth is, developers TT Games have been working on them all along, albeit as part of Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, a mega-game including all nine mainline films in the franchise. 
It's been in development for a while, and has been delayed several times, allegedly resulting in extensive crunch. It's finally coming out on April 5th, but having played about an hour of Episode IV, this is not the Lego Star Wars-ing I remember. The plots are the same, of course, but much of its mindless minifig bashing has now been swapped for... over-the-shoulder third-person shooting? I feel a great disturbance in the Force.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many creators leave fingerprints on their games, but few apply their digits as physically as Shinji Mikami in Ghostwire: Tokyo. One sidequest in Tango’s open world spook-busting adventure sees a neighbourhood disturbed by piano music, eerily plonking away at ungodly hours. Roaming the streets you soon catch the haunting strains of Moonlight Sonata, a piece famously played in Mikami’s Resident Evil to unlock a secret passage. But it’s more than a cute nod. Ghostwire’s credits reveal the player to be Mikami himself - showing off talents usually reserved for fellow Bethesda creators behind closed doors. 
While I’m sure he contributed more than tinkling mood music for an optional quest, Ghostwire has been framed as a debutante ball for the next generation of Tango talent. In Archipel’s ace interview series Mikami spoke about fostering new creative leads and taking more of a backseat compared to his work on The Evil Within, which was more clearly made in the Resi mold. The result is, by design, the studio’s least Mikami-ish romp to date: a sprawling tale of a metropolis turned ghost town that is one part love letter to the city and its urban legends, and an opportunity to zap headless school girls and floating puppets with electrifying particle effects.

Ghostwire: Tokyo has a completely dead world, empty of any other human beings or people to talk to. It also has rote and repetitive combat with a bland and uninspired story. And yet, I love it more than I like most games, even if I think a lot of people won't. It might take a bit to explain why, but it all starts with Ghostwire's best feature: its cold, lifeless map. 
Early in the game, a supernatural force causes everyone roaming around the Shibuya Ward of Tokyo, Japan, to vanish. A mysterious man flashes on the man…]]></summary>

Babylon’s Fall was released on March 3 and it currently sits at a 42 on Metacritic, which is obviously not great. 
Reviews indicate that Babylon’s Fall is a game with a visual style that needs work featuring a live service model that needs drastic changes and a combat system that leaves a lot to be desired. In fact, last week, Square Enix, which published the title, sent out surveys to players asking them how the game can be improved. This makes it clear that Square Enix has plans to make the game better and that means more work on it from developer Platinum Games. 
In case that wasn’t clear, though, the official Babylon’s Fall Twitter account posted a message stating that the “continuing service” of Babylon’s Fall is not in danger. 
Today, we revealed new information about version 1.1.0, the NieR:Automata collaboration event and the future of BABYLON'S FALL development.

March 18, 2022
As you can see, Platinum Games and Square Enix have plenty of future plans for the live service action RPG, with content for at least up to Season 3 planned. As for whether or not this future content improves the title enough to shift players’ thoughts on it, only time will tell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2018, a court in the Netherlands ruled that companies selling access to a pirate IPTV playlist acted illegally, even though they weren't the suppliers of the infringing streams. The decision was a win for Dutch anti-piracy group BREIN, which later demanded a cash settlement from the companies' directors. They ultimately refused to pay so BREIN filed a full lawsuit and has now come out on top.

After the finals of Arc Revo America, Arc System Works revealed DNF duel will be releasing this June.
In a brief trailer showing plenty of Ghost Blade footage, it was announced that DNF Duel will be coming on June 28. The game will also be involved in multiple competitive events, including Arc World Tour 2022, a worldwide tournament tour that will have a $200,000 prize pool split between DNF and Guilty Gear Strive.
A new character other than the Ghost Blade was shown in the footage, which is the Mechanic that was teased after December's beta period. That would bring the known roster up to 12 characters, with hints at other classes remaining unconfirmed.
DNF Duel is a fighting game made in collaboration between Arc System Works and Eighting, the development house behind other fighting games such as Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 and Bloody Roar. It's based on Dungeon Fighter Online, a Korean MMO brawler made by Neople and published by Nexon, and brings the game's classes to life in a whole new way. Check out our New Gameplay Today to get a look at DNF Duel.
I've been very excited to play more of DNF Duel since its initial beta in December of last year. Combat is fun, flashy, and easy to execute, using simplified directional inputs for special attacks. It made our list of most anticipated fighting games of 2022 for a reason, and now that we have a release date, it can't come soon enough. DNF Duel will be released on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 28.]]></summary>

Arc System Works' tournament Arc Revo America has come to the end, and with it brings plenty of announcements for the future of Guilty Gear Strive and more.
Strive's final first season character was announced, and it's not what the majority of players expected. The goth, scythe-wielding Testament is back with a slight redesign featuring a new vest, ruffled jabot, and top hat. Like previous iterations, "The Elegant Grim Reaper's" attacks have a long reach and now have demon familiars to back them up in a fight. Testament hasn't been part of a Guilty Gear ro…]]></summary>

Employees at Moon Studios, which is the team behind Ori and the Blind Forest/Will of the Wisps, told GamesBeat that they view the studio’s culture as “oppressive,” citing that the studio’s leaders used buzzwords about being an open and honest workplace as a cover for abuse that happens there.

Gran Turismo 7 is back online after essentially being left unplayable for more than 24 hours following an earlier update.

He said that right before the release of the 1.07 update, which is the one that left GT7 largely unplayable, Polyphony Digital “discovered an issue where the game would not start properly in some cases on product versions for the PS4 and PS5.”

As for what Taopunk is, think cyberpunk meets Taoism and Far East mythology.

Even if you love Final Fantasy games, expect to feel like a stranger in a strange land when playing Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin. This violent retelling of the original Final Fantasy game from 1987 largely sidesteps the series’ adventurous spirit and heartfelt mysticism to focus on muscle, attitude, and everything extreme. Square Enix labels this remake as a “hardcore action/RPG,” an apt description for a game that rarely relents in its aggression.

I knew straight away what would be first up on my video game playlist: FAR: Changing Tides, the sequel to Okomotive's beautifully melancholy roadtrip adventure, FAR: Lone Sails. While Changing Tides tells a separate story to its predecessor, putting you in the shoes of a new protagonist and swapping its desolate wastelands for a watery seascape, the hot, beating core powering the game remains very much the same. With nothing left for you at home in the wake of an unknown disaster, it's time to pack up and head on out for a new beginning, with only your hulking great boat/steamtrain contraption for company. 
If you still haven't played FAR: Changing Tides, I'd urge you to stop reading now and come back later. There are big spoilers about the game's ending coming up in this article, and I really don't want to ruin that for you. So, fair warning, okay? If you're still here I'm assuming you've played and finished Changing Tides, because holy moly, isn't it just the most perfect thing?

I think that's because it's one of those that's made up of the gaps in between other genres. Right from the start of its anime goth girl intro I knew this wasn't really my kind of thing, and yet its striking art and sense of sincerity felt compelling. 
And it was a bit weird, which is sometimes enough. It depicts a frankenstein cast out by villagers, left to wander the wilderness, across forests and mountains, still peppered with arrows, turning up at a sinister tower that seems to welcome them. And just a few minutes in, it reveals itself as a mystery puzzle game with bullet hell parts. Almost none of this is my thing at all, but here I am playing it. Hmm.

Stranger Of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is a Soulslike Final Fantasy spin-off that swings so much it misses. Your sole focus is to kill a bad guy called Chaos and the game provides fights and loot in their hundreds, possibly thousands, to ensure you're beefy enough when the time comes. But cut away the combat and you're left with little, really. Search for anything other than Chaos and you'll find there's nothing else driving you forwards. You'll finish the game and part as strangers still, probably.

With Street Fighter 6 confirmed to be the future of the series, Capcom apparently isn't done with Street Fighter V quite yet. At least not until this new patch it's calling the "definitive update." Check out the trailer above to see some of the big changes in action.
The update, slated for release on March 29, will bring a variety of character balance changes. The trailer begins by showing off new combos for a good chunk of the cast, implying there are quite a lot of adjustments being made. Capcom has yet to detail exactly what these changes are but typically releases that information up to a few days before balance changes are implemented.
Also in the update are a pair of visual filters that change the way the battles look. The first and more appealing filter adds a cel-shaded styling to the fighters. It brightens up some of the colors in costumes and makes characters look a little more cartoony, which works quite well with the models shown in the trailer. A pixel filter attempting to mimic the look of a CRT screen will also be added in the update. What's present in the footage looks a bit messy (it's hard to make a 3D art style look 2D with a simple filter alone), but I'm going to still give it a shot when the update releases and hope it'll look nicer in person. Both filters are only available in offline modes. Sorry, online warriors. 
Tracksuit costumes for each character will finally be getting new color schemes, adding that missing bit of drip your main needs to perform their best in a match. And to round out the update, season 5 characters Dan, Rose, Oro, Akira, and Luke will have new Cap-Jam remix themes added to the game.
Capcom will be involved in a Japan Fighting Game Publishers Roundtable in the wee hours of March 21 and may talk more about this big update at that time.]]></summary>

Triangle Strategy is an exceptional tactics game some worried would be buried unearth the hype of heavy-hitters like Elden Ring and Horizon Forbidden West. That apparently hasn’t been the case, as the game has already sold hundreds of thousands of copies in the two weeks it’s been available.
The game’s Japanese Twitter account announced that Triangle Strategy has sold 200,000 copies in Japan and Asia alone and nearly 800,000 worldwide. The account states that this number includes shipped physical copies and digital downloads. Not bad for a Switch-only strategy game that launched in the shadow of recent triple-A titans, especially since it took Triangle Strategy’s sort-of-predecessor Octopath Traveler about a month to ship 1 million units. Triangle Strategy is on a good pace. The tweet also included a new art piece by Illustrator Naoki Ikushima to celebrate the occasion:
Triangle Strategy launched March 4 on Switch and is worth checking out if you enjoy turn-based strategy with heaps of choice-driven storytelling and political intrigue. We scored it an 8.25 out of 10, and you can read our full review here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the small slice I've played of samurai slasher Trek To Yomi, I'm convinced it's going to be the most Instagrammable game out there. Every frame looks gorgeous, capturing feudal Japan through a grainy black and white lens that evokes classic samurai flicks. Thankfully, there's some substance to match this style too. Combat is elegant and the story seems refined, not bloated, which makes this a ronin romp worth watching out for.

Nintendo announced last month that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe will be getting 48 new tracks by 2023 and that the tracks would be released in six waves, with each wave adding eight new tracks. 
Now, a little over a month later, Wave 1 of the Booster Course Pass is live alongside a new 2.0.0 update. As expected, this update brings the new courses to the game for those who pay and it prepares the new courses for online play (starting March 21) alongside some minor fixes. Plus, Nintendo has released a new launch trailer that highlights the eight new courses added to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe today.

GSC Game World has quietly updated the spelling of its upcoming FPS, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl. 
The subtitle on the game was previously spelled “Heart of Chernobyl,” which features the Russian spelling of the location where the game takes place. However, likely as a result of Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine (the studio has been vocal about its support for Ukraine), GSC Game World has changed “Chernobyl” to “Chornobyl” to reflect the Ukrainian spelling of the word, as reported by PC Gamer. 
The change reportedly happened on March 14 by way of a Steam name update. The new spelling is visible in both the standard Steam entry and the title’s description and Steam-related entries. PC Gamer points out that the original spelling can still be seen on some promotional art and other listings, though. 
GSC Game World has not publicly addressed this name change, but the studio is also based in Ukraine and has made it clear it is focusing on keeping its employees safe above all else, opting to sideline the development of Stalker 2 while the conflict continues.
For more about Stalker 2, check out the latest look at it. Read about the game studios that have shown their support for Ukraine amidst Russia’s ongoing invasion of the country after that.

Today's PlayStation State of Play presentation focused solely on Avalanche Software and Portkey Games' upcoming Harry Potter prequel game Hogwarts Legacy.
The game puts players in the robes of a custom character and sends them to school at the legendary wizarding academy Hogwarts. However, Legacy takes place in the late 1800s, meaning players are free to embark on their own legendary journey free from the shackles of the Harry Potter books and movies.

Final Fantasy is a staple in JRPGs and video games as a whole. It might have more entries in it than any other series out there and it won’t be slowing down anytime soon. On top of that, thanks to its anthology-like nature, if one Final Fantasy game doesn’t click for you, there’s a good chance another one will. As a result, ranking the Final Fantasy series can be highly contentious. Everyone has a lot of love for the first entry they played, and then there are heavy hitters like Final Fantasy X and VII, too. 
However, the staff here at Game Informer did the seemingly impossible: we ranked all 19 mainline numbered Final Fantasy games, including their direct sequels, from worst to best. As a reminder, this ranking is t…]]></summary>

The latest Into The Starfield developer video offers more insight into the game than anything else I've seen so far. It contains almost no in-game footage, mind you, but it contains hints about companions, romance, character start points, a new dialogue persuasion system that aims to improve on Oblivion's, and Bethesda returning to their old school RPG roots.

I chose the Astrologer class and used sorceries galore to effortlessly steamroll through almost every boss. Nothing could compete with my trusty staff, so I didn’t need to use spirit ashes for my first 100 hours or so. I was fine by myself, like any good romcom protagonist at the start of the movie.
As I walked into the final boss arena, I had unwaivering confidence. I strolled in, staff at the ready and prepared to win. Then, my string of easy victories came to a shocking end. I got walloped and decimated for about 10 hours and eventually announced my defeat. Elden Ring was a game I just couldn’t finish. Fortunately, love had other plans, and I entered into a whirlwind romance with the Mimic Tear Ash.

Matthew clues us in on what it was like to work for a secret shopper company, and Nate tells us about his repeat of his annual Eat Every Thing In Lord Of The Rings watch-along. Will this result in his daughter blocking memories? Only time will tell.

Jim Rossignol's Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine review in 2013 was pretty straightforward: "This is one of the most important independent games this year, and might well end up being one of the best-loved games of the decade." I don't think it panned out quite that way, partially because indie games grew so larger and more mainstream than expected across the decade, but the IGF Grand Prize winner is still a cracking game. And Monaco 2 looks pretty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GPU-based upscaling has proven to be one of the most useful additions to gaming PC tech in years. Big performance improvements in exchange for only a minor drop in visual quality, if any at all? Yes please and thank you. Nvidia’s DLSS has established itself as the gold standard of upscalers, outperforming AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR), but the Radeon makers are now readying two new offerings: FSR 2.0 and Radeon Super Resolution (RSR).


FSR 2.0 looks to be a straight upgrade on the current 1.0 version, promising sharper picture quality with “optimised anti-aliasing” to better compete with the built-in, AI-assisted edge smoothing of DLSS. It will still need to be implemented in games by their developers, though – unlike RSR, which aims to work with just about any game by applying its upscaling algorithm at the GPU driver level.

Cozy, rustic, slow-going living with a touch of the magical has a certain appeal all its own, and as the recent announcement of Songs Of Glimmerwick proves, EastStud don’t intend on shaking up that brand any time soon. This is a wonderful thing for me because their previous outing and namesake, Eastshade, is not only one of my favourite games of all time, but also such an important kind of game in the terrifying, nightmare world we find ourselves in today.
You see, Eastshade does one thing very, very well. In fact, it does it so well that most players probably won’t even have noticed until they look back and really think on it. Eastshade teaches mindfulness, a keen and acute awareness of oneself and one’s surroundings in the present moment. And that, my friends, is where the appeal comes from.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move befitting a game about immortal beings who live out countless repeating lives on artificial islands powered by human sacrifice, Paradise Killer is getting a re-release. Sort of. It's coming to next-gen consoles today, with all platforms (including PC) getting some extra bits added for free that weren't in the original 2020 release. Not bad for a game that Kaizen Game Works creative director Oli Clarke Smith thought would only really sell to "a niche of freaks". If you're not one of those freaks, I'd heartily recommend becoming one. Playing Paradise Killer is like going to a seaside cosplay party where police procedurals play on loop and cocktails are snorted in a dehydrated powder form. It is a meticulously authored murder mystery with a cast of freaks.
When I sat down to talk to both Clarke Smith and technical director Phil Crabtree about Paradise Killer's new update, it turns out that niche has already become quite large. Even Crabtree's dad has played Paradise Killer, though Crabtree isn't sure he really understood it. Crabtree also tells us he sometimes get messages from friends saying someone they know just played Paradise Killer and was talking about it. "It just seems so weird that that there is this audience there that we never expected, and it doesn't seem that far away," he says. "Like, it's not this mystery group of people, there always seems to be some connection that's quite close to you."

Many games pay their respects to the blonde lawn mower and his absentee princess, but few have such fondness and understanding of the exact feelings those adventures conjure up, the precise sensation of exploring, the nook-scavenging, and the meticulous internal mapping that happens when you play Zelda's brand of wundergame. Tunic might have sacrificed some of its own identity in hitting every Ocarina note so perfectly, but when the result is such a capable homage it's hard to complain.

Considering the latest game from the makers of Dark Souls launched less than three weeks ago, it's an impressive big number indeed. They also mention plans for "more of Elden Ring as an IP [. . .] in hopes of expanding beyond the realm of games," which I guess could mean anything from a novelisation to hats. Yes, please do clothes. Make Fashion Souls real.

Publishers and co-developers Square Enix aren't giving up, however. They've launched a survey asking how they can deliver a "better game experience", but it's the graphics they're focused on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re unfamiliar with Redout, it’s an anti-gravity racer inspired by the likes of F-Zero and Wipeout. And if you’ve not played any of those before, then imagine a pod-racer from Star Wars belting it down Mario Kart’s Rainbow Road - except, hang on, there’s a mysterious white powder caked on the bristles of Mario’s mustache. The sheer speed of the first game made it pretty popular among race-heads, but a bit of a daunting prospect for those used to a traditional “wheels on the ground” racing experience.
Redout 2 doubles down on the speed element, that's for sure. But there's definitely an added air of approachability to this anti-grav racer, making the transition from Geforce to g-force a little less bruising than before. AI presets, added customisation, and more generous modes help make this a racing game you should keep up with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may not have heard much about developer Complex Games, but the Canadian studio has a surprisingly storied history. Despite spending the last two decades building mobile and browser games for the likes of Disney, Nickelodeon and Zynga, their heart has always resided with the PC. "There wasn't a lot of game development in Winnipeg, so we tried to figure it out ourselves and spent a few years trying to build a PC game," says creative director Noah Decter-Jackson. Fresh out of college, Complex's first project was a third-person hand-to-hand action prototype that they pitched to publishers at E3 2003, an endeavour that Decter-Jackson describes as "phenomenally unsuccessful".
This led to Complex remodelling as a work-for-hire outfit, and their long track-record making mobile games. But in 2015, Complex launched The Horus Heresy: Drop Assault, a fast-paced tactics game in conjunction with Games Workshop. In the wake of Drop Assault's success, the studio saw an opportunity. "We had been wanting for a long time to return to our PC roots," he says. "So we pitched a core idea for a game to Games Workshop, because Drop Assault had been quite successful... and that's essentially how Chaos Gate: Daemonhunters came to be."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First unveiled last week, Ship Of Fools is an upcoming seafaring roguelite where you and a fellow co-op pal take on hordes of horrible beasties as you sail the high seas. Depending on your choice of player two, it's also likely to be an apt description of how you'll feel playing it.
Having waded through an early preview build of its opening Forgotten Waters stage this week, this is one co-operative cannon fest that seems destined to see friends and family not so much walk the plank after an untimely defeat as get absolutely spanked by it. Imagine the visual chaos of a game like Overcooked combined with the frantic, tactile ship management of Lovers In A Dangerous Spacetime and you're pretty much there, albeit with several more barnacles, bug-spewing mosquitoes and laser-firing totem poles in the mix. The jangle of Davy Jones' locker is never far away in this storm-stricken archipelago, so beware, fools. You will not be suffered gladly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam started a week-long "JRPG sale" last night, offering discounts on hundreds of games, some of which are RPGs, and some of which are even Japanese. The theme is broad but the deals are solid, including 80% off Valkyria Chronicles 4, 50% off Chrono Trigger, 45% off Yakuza: Like A Dragon, and hundreds more discounts. Heck, even RPG Maker is on sale, so you can make your own JRPG, and then sell it on Steam, and then join in the next JRPG sale.

Back in the not-exactly-halycon days of 2020, Microsoft revealed that the storage API would make its way to PC, having showed how it could slash loading times to bits on the Xbox Series X and S. A year and a half later, it’s finally ready for Windows, as Microsoft have made the full DirectStorage API available to developers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Behind the scenes I have been chipping away at Horizon Forbidden West on the PS5, a game I would characterise as good, lots of fun, very pretty. (Sidebar: having recently conducted an inventory of all my posessions for international shipping purposes, it appears the PS5 is literally the most valuable thing I own. I am 32 years old). I'm not very good at it, to be honest, so recently knocked it down to easy difficulty in order to stomp on robot heads with greater efficiency. Good ol' Aloy.
Anyway, now that I have awakened a sort of mother-surrogate AI and started the actual business of saving the world, I cannot help but ask the key question: why can I still not ride into battle atop a massive great robot T-Rex?

This comes off the back of a developer stream on Friday which showed off (sounded off? hearded off? noised off?) some of the fancy new noises and noise technologies they're working on. It sounds pretty good. And sounds pretty good, too.

Riot's unspecified share isn't large enough to buy control of Fortiche, but they say "this agreement ensures we'll be working closely for decades to come." Fortiche's League animations have been better than Riot's games so yeah, go on, I'll take more. They're currently working on a second season of Arcane.

You hear nothing but ambient city sounds and the tromping of a cameraman's feet. You could be watching a HUD-free FPS, albeit with incredi-graphics. Finally, in Ghostwire: Tokyo, someone has made a game of it, albeit with occasional ghost zapping.

In listing out the status of their own games, Microsoft say that Psyconauts 2 is "Verified" - meaning it's fully supported - while Sea Of Thieves is merely "playable" and Halo Infinite isn't supported at all due to its anti-cheat.

Hopefully those games will be better supported in future, but, Microsoft say, "It's up to our studios how they fit Steam Deck integration for their games into their busy schedules."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can't remember if I've mentioned this to you, dear readers, but I am currently mid-emigration. In about two weeks I'm moving to Ireland, which means for the past four months my live has been hellish. The paperwork the move involves, especially now we have from our European womb been untimely ripped, is a Kafkaesque nightmare. To ship my stuff without incurring importation tax I need to prove I'm going to live in Ireland and not just sell a bunch of second hand cutlery and old bras (one of those two things would probably be pretty lucrative, in fairness). This is all complicated even furtherer by the fact that I only found a flat to move to yesterday, and still don't have the tenancy agreement for it, which means no proof of address. Life, oh life.
I don't really have the option to have a piece of toast and watch the evening news, because when I'm not scanning my passport or estimating what worth to attach to my towels for the purposes of the shipping company's insurance, I am packing said towels into boxes, along with everything else I own. Basically the only free time I have is my lunch break. And what I am doing in my lunch break is making huge, virtual jigsaw puzzles in Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams. It's either that or go and sit in the toilets and have a little stress-cry. And as the move date approaches, the size of the puzzles has increased. On Thursday I started one that is 6k pieces. This may have been a miscalculation.

I'm glad I did. Aztech No Colon Forgotten Gods starts with its weaker foot, showing rough edges right away, but that’s overshadowed by its entertaining movement system.

GPU, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers are all available from Steam Support, so early Deck adopters looking for a change can get the requisite downloads all in one place.


These drivers come with caveats, mind. Audio drivers are still a work in progress, so only USB-C, 3.5mm, or Bluetooth headphones can output sound on Windows, and Valve’s post explains that dual-booting support still isn’t ready yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Square Enix first released RPG classic Chrono Trigger on PC in 2018, it was in a sorry state. Their 'updated' version was worse than the 1995 original, with blurry sprites, ugly menus, an incongruous font, and other problems. But they fixed it up a lot with patches, and now, almost four years since the last patch, they've applied a fresh coat of polish with another welcome update.
