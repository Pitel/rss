This was a huge surprise for gamers all around the world, seeing as this was an excellent year for the medium, with many solid titles that were fighting for the grand award, like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Metaphor: ReFantazio, Black Myth: Wukong and more.


Yes, Astro Bot may not seem all that impressive or ambitious when compared to those solid AAA titles, especially in terms of graphics, narrative, or scope. But it still truly deserved that award, because Astro Bot is exactly what the industry needs right now, and its victory is a huge indication of the direction it should go in the near future. It all comes down to three main reasons: Fun, Accessibility…]]></summary>

Just recently, it was revealed that developer Acquire worked with Nintendo to brainstorm "over 100 options" for the title of its new RPG that would go on to be called Mario & Luigi: Brothership.
Now, in a fresh interview with Nintendo Dream (thanks, Nintendo Everything), producer Akira Otani states that one of the potential titles in consideration was actually 'Mario & Luigi Wonder', but the team was forced to abandon this idea when Super Mario Bros. Wonder released on 20th October 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sandbox mode is one of the most useful features of Jujutsu Infinite, especially if you're still new to the game.


Based on the popular Jujutsun Kaisen arc, the new Roblox hit has quickly managed to catch the attention of all. There are several advanced concepts that you might not be familiar with, and the Sandbox mode is a great place to try them first.


How to enter Sandbox mode in Jujutsu Infinite


There are two ways to enter the Sandbox mode in Jujutsu Infinite. The game allows the use of certain admin console commands, and you can use the /sandbox command to enter the mode. To complete this method, just open the global server chat box and type the command. Press send, and you'll be teleported to the Sandbox mode.


The other way is to interact with Jake, who is the Sandbox NPC. He can be found near the PvP modes portal in the main lobby. Talk with him, and you'll be teleported to the Sandbox arena. On Discord, some players have reported that the console command fails to work at times, so the second method is a great backup in such cases.

How to use Jujutsu Infinite's Sandbox mode


The Sandbox mode isn't very different from the main server, but you won't have any limitation of resources. For starters, you'll have unlimited money and every type of resource that can be farmed on the main server. This is a great space to try out different resources and understand how they work. Certain resources like Purified Curse Hands and Energy Nature Scroll are hard to find, so it's important to understand their functions before you use them.


The benefits aren't only limited to resources, as you can try out advanced concepts like Innate Skills. Quests and boss fights can also take place in this mode, allowing you to test yourself. Additionally, you get to try out all the emotes that are available in Jujutsu Infinite by buying random rolls from the Comedian NPC.

While obtaining pre-war nuclear launch codes was a privilege only a few in the world had, the post-apocalyptic wasteland hands out codes as if they were phone numbers. If you're looking to leave a radioactive scar upon Earth yourself, you're gonna need to know what Nuke Codes are currently active.


Currently active Fallout 76 Nuke Codes:




Alpha: 
752 72 864




Bravo: 
234 62 604 




Charlie:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toho, the legendary studio behind the Godzilla franchise and the Haikyu!! anime is now set to adapt the odd and creepy Nintendo Switch hit Exit 8 to the big screen.


Via a scoop caught by Gamesradar, we learned Exit 8's creator has just written a message to fans, celebrating the surprise of learning the small title would be adapted to the big screen just a year after release.


If you don't know anything about the game I'm talking about, that actually speaks loads about Exit 8's prowess as the perfect indie sleeper hit. Exit 8 is a very simple affair, one where players are tasked with navigating a labyrinthian maze of liminal spaces that make up a nightmarish version of Tokyo's subway system. On top of the natural anxiety that comes from feeling lost, players will also have to deal with certain anomalies that are sure not to help them in their quest for freedom.


Even though it was this year's second-most downloaded Switch title, many still don't know about it. That sounds strange, but it is actually great if you're looking for a mysterious and creepy theater experience that'll have you on the edge of your seat.


Recent times have shown us that good video game adaptations can be a thing. While I have no idea how Toho manages to tackle such a title, I'm down to see what such a studio will try to pull with the adaptation of this creepy internet copypasta-inspired indie hit about making the mundane terrifying.


Whether or not you care about the upcoming adaptation of this spooky indie, you can get Exit 8 for the Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

This is the first special version of Ljungberg in this year's Ultimate Team, and everyone has an equal chance of obtaining the card. To do so, all the tasks of the SBC have to be completed before they expire from Ultimate Team. 


EA FC 25 Freddie Ljungberg Winter Wildcards Hero SBC tasks


The Freddie Ljungberg Winter Wildcards Hero SBC has three tasks, and here are the conditions. 


Task 1 - Top Form



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 84

Min. Team Rating: 85



Task 3 - 86-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 86



EA FC 25 Freddie Ljungberg Winter Wildcards Hero SBC solutions


Here's a set of solutions you can use to complete the latest Winter Wildcards Hero SBC in EA FC 25. 


Task 1 - Top Form



Any 10 84-rated items


Any 83-rated TOTW item



Task 2 - Premier League



Vitinha 85

The biggest limitation of this Hero item is its lack of an Inside Forward Role and 83 Shooting. However, he also offers 90 Pace, 5* Weak Foot, and 88 Dribbling. Rapid+ is arguably one of the best playstyle+ for wingers, and he can also operate as a striker. 


The SBC is really cheap to complete, and he also offers league chemistry to Premier League cards. At less than 100,000 coins, there can't be too many complaints.

The entirety of the trading card community — that is, people who collect, buy, and sell the Pokémon Trading Card game, sports cards, Magic: The Gathering, Disney, or literally any trading card game you can think of — has gradually become aware of what might be an existential threat to the entire concept of opening up a blind pack of trading cards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black Myth: Wukong and Astro Bot are two amazing AAA video games that came out in 2024 and gamers all around the world received them so well that The Game Awards nominated both for GOTY. Now, both of these incredible experiences join forces in this adorable but hilarious fan-made mod.




SnailSaber is a Modder/Youtuber/Redditor who recently shared his brand-new "Arachnophobia" mod for Black: Myth Wukong, which replaces the swarm of little spiders that come out of the Violet Spider boss with a bunch of little Astros, the titular main character of Astro Bot. The final result is both funny and endearing, and it's perfect for players who don't want to see spiders in their games.


However, there is some tongue-in-cheek history to this seemingly innocent mod. SnailSaber explained that they mad…]]></summary>

Another year, another set of beautiful-looking Switch games to savour. Even as the Switch is approaching its eighth birthday, we've seen a stunning variety of art styles grace our OLED (or NoLED) screens.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mission Essence is one of the many resources you can farm in Jujutsu Infinite, and doing so will help you level up your characters quicker.


The progression system of the latest Roblox hit is pretty robust, and there are numerous resources to earn. Some, like Purified Curse Hands and Maximum Scrolls, are relatively difficult to find. Mission Essence is rather basic, and you won't have to toil much to get it.


How to earn Mission Essence in Jujutsu Infinite


The core procedure to obtain Mission Essence is pretty simple. It can be obtained directly by completing missions, and you'll find them represented by crystal balls on the screen. Before you begin a mission, you'll have a fair idea about how many Mission Essence you'll receive.


You can also earn these essences after completing Investigation Tasks and taking down Bosses. The latter is certainly difficult and not ideally suited for immediate beginners. If you're just starting the game, completing the basic missions will be the best way to farm Mission Essence. If you've already leveled up your in-game character decently, you'll be able to take down the Bosses consistently.


Once you've reached level 60, you can rank up your character to a Grade 4 Sorcerer. To rank up, you'll need Mission Essence, along with credits. You begin the process with Grade 4 Sorcerer, which goes all the way up to Special Grade.

Grades
Requirements




Grade 4
Level 60, $5000, 25 Mission Essence


Grade 3
Level 120, $50,000, 50 Mission Essence


Grade 2
Level 180, $100,000, 100 Mission Essence


Grade 1
Level 240, $250,000, 150 Mission Essence


Special Grade
Level 300, $500,000, 200 Mission Essence






Unlocking every Grade will get you some unique rewards that will help you to customize the in-game looks of your character.

As we watch them sail from one island to another, we've not only seen their characters develop, but we've also seen the world of One Piece expand. Alongside the introduction of new environments is the debut of numerous side characters. Following this development, One Piece has accrued more than a thousand named characters.


While others may argue that that is already far too many characters and that the series is already too long, fans will (likely) agree that there isn't enough One Piece to consume. We always want more, especially since there are still many angles to cover. To support that argument, here are 10 One Piece side characters that deserve their own spin-off series.

At one point (which @realradec translated into English) Famitsu asked Hulst about all the classic PlayStation characters that appeared as fun little cameos in Astro Bot, which prompted many fans to ask Sony for a proper revival of franchises like Ape Escape, Jak & Daxter, Sly Cooper and more.

Its precise level design and enemy placement met with widespread critical acclaim, but developer Crazy Viking Studios had no intention of ever making a sequel.

There are a lot of different Armors currently available to find or craft within the game, and each of these Armors has multiple variations that come in the form of Schematics which can be found. Some of these Schematics drop from Treasure Chests across Palpagos, while others can be obtained through defeating Alpha Pals. 


I’m going to go through the basic Armor items and their Legendary equivalents if they have one, but remember that each Armor item has three or four improved versions to be found. If you find a Schematic followed by a 1 (Uncommon), 2 (Rare), 3 (Epic) or 4 (Legenda…]]></summary>

As long as I get to be immersed in an adventure. I think that's the big theme of my selection box: being grounded within my player character. I want to feel what it's like to hike through canyons with too much sellable loot in my backpack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maximum Scrolls is one of the most important types of resources in Jujutsu Infinite, and they're required to unlock Maximum Techniques.


Naturally, this item can't be obtained quite easily, and the game doesn't do much when it comes to explaining the basics. It can become quite difficult, especially if you're trying to unlock Maximum Techniques. This guide will help you understand the concept and get Maximum Scrolls at ease. 


Best ways to farm Maximum Scrolls in Jujutsu Infinite


For starters, Maximum Scrolls can be used on Innate Techniques that have a Maximum version in the first place. Not every Technique in Jujutsu Infinite has a Maximum version, and you can find them from the menu by spinning for them.


Once you have an Innate Technique with a Maximum version, you can use Maximum…]]></summary>

All Tekka Maki Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients


Tekka Maki can be made with the following ingredients in Disney Dreamlight Valley: 



Tuna


Seaweed


Soya


Rice

Tuna can be fished from the waters of Glade of Trust and Forgotten Lands in the original valley. The ingredient can be found in white ripples within the water. 


Seaweed can be found in a similar spot to Tuna. Use your fishing rod and set the feed to a place outside of ripples within any spot in the Valley. You should get Seaweed pretty quickly. This ingredient is also used to feed turtles in Disney Dreamlight Valley. 


Soya can be purchased from Goofy's Stall in the Lion King-themed Sunlit Plateau. The clumsy character sells the green beans' seeds for 60 Star Coins. It annoyingly grows within one hour and 30 minutes. You can speed up the process with some Miracle Growth Elixir. 


Rice is also bought from Goofy's Stall, this time in the Glade of Trust. The seeds are 35 Star Coins each, while the ingredient itself is 92 Star Coins each.  Rice is a little quicker to grow than Soya and takes 50 minutes. Rice can also be used to make another Japanese dish, Sake Maki, which includes Salmon instead of Tuna.


Once you have all the ingredients, go to a cooking station at your home or Chez Remy. Then, place them all into the pot to create your Tekka Maki. It can be sold for 366 Star Coins or consumed for 984 Energy. Now, you have the delicious recipe in your culinary repertoire!

The original version of Halo: Combat Evolved from a time when the most influential FPS of our time wasn't even an FPS yet. Then you can now download and play the elusive Halo 1: Speartest and e32k builds, completely free of charge, and enjoy a massive blast from an alternate past. 




You can now finally play as that old-school Master Chief with the weird helmet, fire the minigun shown in the very first previews, try out a non-covenant sword, various rocket launchers, a sick flamethrower, and even drive the scorpion tank. It's all there. Moreover, I was surprised to see just how beautiful and rich the original ringworld looked — and that's coming from someone who adores the original's aesthetic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. 


So! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.

Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

And by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness.

Is usually intended to test out the new and the strange of gaming hardware. Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.
Recently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?

Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.
Taxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time. But even if you absolutely, utterly, and correctly loathe card-based systems, this game has none.

The pair of directors were originally appointed to Epic's board by Tencent (who slurp upon a minority stake in the Unreal Engine company) but the United States government took a look at this and said: ah-ah-ah, you're not allowed to have a director in your boardroom if they're already fingers-deep in the pie of a competing company. Naughty Tencent! Naughty Epic! And, yes, naughty Riot Games!

The Winter sale that began yesterday is almost identical to the Autumn sale that ended just two weeks ago, for example. But you can still find one or two gifts if you bore deep enough into the ice. Me? I'm only interested in one thing. How many of these games are snowy and chilly enough to induce wonderful hypothermia? I'm on a frostbitten quest to find out. Here are the most winter-iest games you can pick up for cheap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coordinated by Italy last month, a huge law enforcement operation reportedly 'dismantled' a pirate IPTV service with 22 million users. That's an extraordinary number and shows why countries like Italy have adopted mass site blocking measures. Logic suggests that the removal of such a huge player from the market might reduce the need for blocking measures, if only temporarily. The data shows that in the wake of the action, blocking demands significantly increased.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At any given moment I am in the center of a wonderful vortex of skeletons. Bones splash and rattle and burst out of the ground in sharp, horrible spurs. My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.
This is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. 


Speaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We are a people who honour democracy," said the dog, scratching himself. "Per our custom, you may drink of our fresh water." The dog was called Senator Umeshefaat, and he was very civil, even if he was shedding his black and white fur everywhere. We spoke in his home village at dawn. Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was "hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal." I suppose every politician has their enemies. 
That Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.

They're all so insulting, whereas the kinds of insult I cherish are the ones that coax a belly laugh from both the roaster and the roastee.

Sony and Kadokawa were reported to be in talks last month, fomenting all sorts of speculation about, say, the PC version of Bloodborne being ritually sacrificed to consecrate the PS6-exclusivity of Dark Souls 4. Now, the pair have emerged from the Cave of Haggling and announced... "a strategic capital and business alliance agreement". What does this mean? Is it safe to scream yet?

Previously, on my mission to survive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl with only wild mutants as my weapons, I’d discovered clues that someone else was attempting to tame the Zone’s beastly inhabitants. With one of their electronic tracking collars in hand and absolutely no preexisting knowledge of their location, I set out to find this kindred spirit, only for the Zone to once again slam a door in my face.
A cold, steel, very literal door to boot. It turns out that the scientist’s laboratory is locked up tight, and will remain so until I delve about twenty hours deeper into the faction war that’s bubbled up while I’ve been running around throwing irradiated rats at people in tracksuits. Fine. Fine! But I’m keeping the collar.

But this year a modder began work on an overhaul that would grant the game pretty cel-shaded visuals. Since then the modding team has grown to 40 people and the scope of the mod's features has ballooned. It's now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff 'em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday.

In October of this year, we got a look at some icky celestial faction and zero in the way of actual gameplay. And now? Now we finally get a look at how you do things. Like sucker-punching armoured space bears in the face with electro-pistols.

In yet another hollow display of solidarity and "Liber-tea", they've teamed up with the loathsome fascists of Killzone, the elderly shooter series from Sony and Guerrilla Games.
From today, you'll be able to buy weapons, armour and cosmetics belonging to Killzone's despicable stormtroopers from the Helldivers Superstore, and there's the suggestion of an additional Killzone-themed reward depending on the fortunes of the so-called Galactic War, a xenocidal bloodbath couched as an exercise in bringing "freedom" to the upstanding socialist Automatons, the blameless wildlife of the Tyranids, and the Wellsian cosplayers of the recently added Illuminate faction.
We here at Rock Paper Shotgun stand against Super Earth and Arrowhead's wanton aggression, which absolutely isn't a big satirical joke based on some Verhoeven film or other. Anyway, those capes. Find an image and further details below.

The terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences - has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suing people for consuming content illegally can be a risky endeavor for companies with brands to protect. Nevertheless, sports rightsholders now seem prepared to put brand integrity on the line in their fight against IPTV pirates. Spain's LaLiga is already mailing out 'fines', ostensibly to people who simply watched pirate streams. Predictably, there's more to it than that.

Oh, you're sitting down at a cosy table in the local tavern. You're playing a card game with a dude called "Aldert". The wind outside is howling, and so are the nightwraiths, but you're just sitting there. Playing another "cow" card. Okay.
Guess you'll be happy to learn that the Witcher 4 developers have more or less confirmed that Gwent will be making a return in the recently trailered Ciri-led sequel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For over a decade, The Pirate Bay has been accepting Bitcoin donations. In dollar terms, this provided a relatively modest but consistent revenue stream. However, if the torrent site had held onto its early Bitcoin, it could have amassed a small fortune, worth $14 million today. The same applies to BitcoinTorrentz, which once charged today's equivalent of $8,000 per gigabyte transferred.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.
Until, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”
Back in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”

Just saying, this had better be good, Geoff, especially after the 2023 show’s "embarrassing" shooing-off of developers whose acceptance speeches cut into that valuable trailer showcase time.
Who will need to please wrap it up this time? Which games will be revealed? Will there be a musical number to top last year’s Herald of Darkness performance? (That was fun, actually, fair play on that one.) You can find out right along with us, as we once again fire up the RPS liveblog-o-tron to report all the developments as they happen. Even the ones that happen at 3:45am, when I’ll be desperately trying not to collapse into my keyboard like a felled tree.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first I thought Marvel Rivals was basically rebranded Overwatch, in the way it's a free-to-play PVP hero shooter. And in some ways, it is. Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.
The more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a failure-riddled start, my attempt to turn S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2’s mutants into beasts of war is finally bearing fruit. I’ve engineered a Bloodsucker attack that wiped out the worst of villains – someone who was mean to me – and I’ve progressed far enough to really open up the map, and with it, access to more of the Zone’s fiercest fleshwarps.
Also, rats. Buoyed by the successful Bloodsucker siccing, I’m back on the trail of some mysterious anomaly scanners, and word is I might find a lead inside a local maze of wrecked cars. It’s heavily guarded by some gangster types, but for once, I won’t have to dash off in search of some far-off muties and coax them back here using my neck as bait. Mercifully, a gaggle of overgrown rodents are already hopping around right outside the labyrinth’s entrance. I beckon them in like a bouncer on his last day, then sprint past the stunned gunmen, who can barely shoulder their rifles before being set upon by a pack of giant carnivorous hamsters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.
When Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That's a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.
Aldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book ("The goal is to do everything, right?"). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it's ever been.

It seems to play a bit like XCOM, with an oppressive world map that is slowly encroached upon as you travel around recruiting soldiers, interacting with settlements, and picking real-time fights with hellfiends "inspired by biblical descriptions and European folklore". Naturally, parallels with real-life xenophobia and sectarian hatred abound. Here's the trailer.

For most of us, Steam simply slurps down fresh gigs of installed games automatically when a new update is released (and sometimes schedules the updates according to its own capricious whims). But the platform is testing a new option in the beta client, which lets you set download behaviour to git new gigs only when you actually launch a game. This would be a terrible curse, for reasons I will explain, but it's only going to be an option - not the new default.

It's a galactic playground in which you smash meteors together to make planets, then tinker with the ecosystems of those planets to make life and watch that life evolve. All while a hungry black hole lingers nearby, eager to consume everything you have created. There's an explanatory video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back when I played Path Of Exile 2 at Summer Games Fest, I fought a cave-dwelling boss who summoned hordes of grotty subterranean wildlife to swamp me. Fortunately, I was rolling a Witch - perhaps the best beginner POE2 class - so I could summon an army of skeletons in response. A similar horde vs horde encounter is underway at POE 2 developers Grinding Gear Games. The game launched in early access over the weekend, and has already drawn so many players that the developers are emergency-hiring additional staff to cope with the waves of support emails.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In "non-violent and poetic" 2D platformer Symphonia, you're an extremely fancy violinist exploring a realm of musical machines, where gas lanterns kindle fitfully as you approach, crotchets adorn vast cogwheels, and reams of what I really hope isn't actual catgut feed through titanic pegboxes overhead. Sampling the demo, I was immediately enflamed by the orchestral score and placed in a mood of white-gloved sophistication only slightly spoiled by the familiarity of the underlying platform moveset, and by my repeatedly falling into pits.

And you’d bloody well make do, too. Not these days. Now, you get a squadron of tiny automata with drills for noses that burrow through your battle lines and utterly wreck your vulnerable missile launchers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First covered by Alice O (RPS in peace) in 2017, Short Trip was a chill hand-drawn game about driving a tram through a mountain populated by cats. Back then, it was only available as a free-to-play browser or itch.io experience. Seven years later, though, and on this very day, it's out on Steam. Not only that, it's arriving with all the tramming of the original, with an added "scheduled mode" that adds more charm to an already lovely game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever wondered what the intro cutscene to Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver would sound like voiced by Solid Snake actor David Hayter? Quite specific of you, but a new documentary from Noclip might just have what you’re looking for. The Past, Present & Future of Soul Reaver interviews key developers from the action adventure game, and about halfway through host Danny O’ Dwyer gets hold of some archive materials, including old audition tapes. These include Mark Hamill reading for Janos Audren, and Jennifer Hale for Ariel.
The biggest treat, of course, is hearing Hayter read for Raziel, especially as it’s that excellent opening monologue. You’ll find the video below, with Hayter around 37:30.

U zrodu tohoto počinu stálo elektronické hudební duo Daft Punk, které v roce 2001 vydalo své album "Discovery". K písničkám z alba vyšly animované videoklipy, které produkoval Leidži Macumoto, což byl kultovní japonský výtvarník (zemřel loni), který měl na svém kontě mnoho animovaných seriálů, především ze 70. - 80. let (nejslavnější z nich byl asi "Space Battleship Yamato"). Daft Punk ho oslovili proto, že na jeho seriálech vyrůstali, takže výsledné dílo, včetně "jednodušší" retro animace a naivní zápletky zcela záměrně připomíná staré japonské televizní počiny (n…]]></summary>
