        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Full server shutdowns could be coming sooner than you think, too.
Nintendo recently revealed its schedule for shuttering its digital storefronts for both the 3DS family of systems and the Wii U. From March 2023 you'll be unable to make new purchases of digital software of any kind on the 3DS and Wii U eShops, which includes digital versions of physical releases, digital-only download games and all forms of DLC. You will be able to redownload purchases made prior to that date (much as you can still download previously-purchases original Wii titles on that console) "for the foreseeable future", but obviously that functionality will eventually be removed.
'Such is the way of things', you might think — 'it was never going to last forever'. And while most of us can sit and rationalise that, yes, of course digital services have a finite lifespan, and no, obviously we didn't expect to be able to redownload our copy of Crimson Shroud when we're in our 90s, seeing the digital store closures come so comparatively swiftly after these eShops first appeared is a bitter pill to swallow if you're at all concerned about video game preservation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anime streaming app Crunchyroll has launched on Switch today. 
That's noteworthy for two reasons. One, it adds another streaming service to Switch, a platform with minimal options for watching TV and movies. Switch owners still only have Hulu, YouTube, Funimation, and Pokémon TV to turn to. There’s also Twitch if you prefer watching streamers. Two, it comes after Sony’s billion-dollar acquisition of the service in December 2020, showing that the company has no intention to prevent Crunchyroll from further spreading its wings to other platforms. 
Crunchyroll on Switch, which is powered by Unreal Engine, is the first video app on the console to offer offline viewing. That means you won’t need an internet connection to catch up on Demon Slayer should you decide to fire up the app at the park or on a car ride. Crunchyroll is a subscription service boasting one of the largest anime libraries, even letting fans stream shows the same day they premiere in Japan. 
While a nice addition, the Switch still lacks streaming heavyweights like Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, and others which has been frustrating for owners who want to take advantage of its portability to watch their favorite shows anywhere. If you’re not into anime, that leaves Hulu as the only real option. Hopefully, that changes, but given that the Switch has gone five years without even Netflix, it's probably best not to get your hopes up.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Was introduced in ver. 1.0.2.
Like any other Switch game, Pokémon Legends: Arceus has been subject to a series of updates since launch, updates which are intended to fix bugs and solve issues. However, ver. 1.0.2 has introduced a glitch that can 'softlock' your game if you're not careful.
Please note: the following information could be considered a spoiler, so proceed at your own risk.
The glitch impacts Mission No. 23. If the player catches Cresselia before speaking with Melli, Melli will not acknowledge the capture and Cresselia won’t respawn – and this means that the mission cannot be marked as complete.

It's no longer a case of simply unplugging said console and boxing it up for a new lease of life; most modern machines will have game installs, WiFi connection data and perhaps even personal information – like your credit card or bank account – saved to their internal memory.

It's not the cold. It's not even the lack of anything to do. It's that when your main threat is starvation and hypothermia, and your only real tool is stockpiling, it often feels like your fate is already sealed come October, and waiting around to see if you survived or not carries the same sense of slow inevitability that the average RTS or 4X game does past the opening act.
My first village in Timberborn gave me that feeling. Even though its dry season is the opposite of Winter, the ultimate effect was the same. I've played this before, I thought. This is the villagers vs winter game again.
I was a fool. A big, wrong fool.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's larger than you think.
Hyrule in Breath of the Wild is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely mind-bogglingly big it is. You may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to Hyrule in BOTW.
However, while the map itself is vast, the actual edges of the world – as in, what you can actually see – goes way beyond that. Gaming Reinvented proves this point by using glitches to try and ascertain the genuine scope of the world map in an attempt to see exactly where the world truly ends.
As you can see, even beyond the actual edges of the game world, there's a lot of space, and the 'playable' part of Hyrule only makes up a very small percentage of the world itself. There's nothing to actually do outside of the borders of the game, of course, but it's interesting nonetheless to see someone explore the fringes of this vast fantasy world.

Long before Techland’s Dying Light series, the developer made waves in the open-world, zombie-slaying community with Dead Island, an unconventional, tropical take on the beloved post-apocalyptic formula. Dead Island boasted a 4-player coop campaign, zany, moddable/craftable weapons that Dying Light is currently known for, and a satisfying balance of horrifying and comedic gameplay. Perhaps you can already see why Dead Island 2 was an exciting prospect for players that wanted a similar experience with updated visuals and mechanics.

So today we're talking about our favourite romances in video games, but also our absolute best mates, too.
Sadly Matthew, one of our real life bestest pals, couldn't be here this week. Curiously, it's a much more well-behaved podcast than normal, suggesting that actually the chaotic influence was Matthew all along... Still, Nate updates us on his war gaming models, which are slowly becoming a diorama and/or dolls' house. I also tell him about the final third of a film about an aquarium where all the fish become zombies, called Aquarium Of The Dead. It is not a good film.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA will now release The Sims 4's upcoming My Wedding Stories expansion in Russia, reversing a decision supposedly made due to concerns that it would run afoul of an anti-homosexuality law. Many fans were unhappy with this. Now EA say oh, they've checked again, and it turns out they don't need to censor anything. So the expansion will come to Russia too, but EA are delaying the launch one week so they can get their ducks in a line and launch simultaneously worldwide.

Developer:
      Larian Studios
      
Larian Studios’ Baldur’s Gate 3 will likely be released in 2023 after years of development, including time spent in Early Access. 
This news comes by way of PCGamesN, which recently spoke to Larian head Swen Vincke about the status of the RPG. According to Vincke, the team needs another year of development, but this year will be the last full year required for work on the game.

“We’re going to release it when it’s ready,” Vincke said. “I mean, the main goal here is quality: getting the game at the quality level that it needs to be. That said, we do think we still need a year to do that. But it will be the last year. We’re getting to the end of it.”
When asked about the launch, Vincke told PCGamesN that it’s “probably not this year, but it’s not going to be much later than that.” It sounds like 2022 is off the table, but 2023 is a sure bet. Of course, anything could happen between now and then that could push back release expectations, but it sounds like if things go according to plan, we’ll all be playing the final version of Baldur’s Gate 3 next year. 
In the meantime, read about this Baldur’s Gate 3 update that includes new “game-changing” mechanics, fine-tuned roleplaying, and more, and then check out the Druid class recently added alongside a loaded dice option, better cinematics, and multiplayer functionality. Watch this fantastic cover of Baldur’s Gate 3’s “Down By The River” after that.

I've run some benchmarks of the new EC2 C6a instances looking at how they perform over the prior 2nd Gen EPYC C5a based instances, against the Intel Ice Lake competition over in the M6i stack, and also how the C6a competes with Amazon's own Graviton2-based C6g type.]]></summary>

Did you miss out on Persona 4 when it took the world by storm in 2008? Did you also miss out on its augmented "Golden" edition? I did. Even though the latest version has been miraculously available on the Steam storefront for a little under two years, Persona devotees were disappointed to see the JRPG absent from the Steam Deck's list of supported games. However, the portable PC's latest software update should please any Atlus fans looking to relive their fond memories of playing Golden on the go. Persona 4 is finally Steam Deck compatible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hit and run.
The first entry in the convoluted Kunio-kun saga, localised in 1986 as Renegade, is considered the progenitor of the scrolling beat-em-up. While later efforts would evolve its arena-based model into the classic belt-scrolling format we know today, it was Technos that established the genre’s significant hallmarks: damsels in distress, bare-knuckle brawling, guys on motorbikes, 'chicks' with whips, and gun-toting final bosses.
Better-known in the West as the ‘River City’ series, in 2019 developer Wayforward (Shantae, Contra 4) plucked two female characters from Kunio-kun lore — the high-school girlfriends of the series’ principal delinquent duo — and made them the lead characters in an all-new title: River City Girls. An attractive, well-crafted scrolling-beat-em-up, it did well enough to prompt a sequel due out later this year. In the meantime, Wayforward and Arc System Works (the latter now holding the Kunio-kun rights) have whipped up an origin story of sorts: River City Girls Zero.

Rare is bringing more content to Sea of Thieves in 2022 than any year prior, it seems, and it’s mostly doing that by adding new live events called Adventures to keep players enthralled in an ongoing story each month. The first one, Shrouded Islands, is now live in-game and players have from now until March 3 to complete it. 
To help celebrate the release of the first-ever Sea of Thieves Adventure, Rare has released a new gameplay trailer that serves as a primer for Shrouded Islands. You can check it out below:

Nintendo of America was tweaking its official website early yesterday (16th February), and it transpires it was preparation for launching a new My Nintendo Store. It's a big step up on the region's previous offering and is now similar to the equivalent in the UK, as one example.
You can see what it has to offer at the My Nintendo Store Official Site, which blends a broad catalogue of new products along with some of the My Nintendo Rewards that are claimed with points. Like some other regional stores it offers a relatively decent range, including both physical and digital games, merchandise and some 'store exclusives' that include clothing. In terms of the nitty gritty it offers free shipping if you spend over $50, and a current offer is a range of first-party physical games reduced to $39.99.

Oh I'm sure expansions will follow, and the game-joining Mortal Empires campaign is still to come, but Total Warhammer 3 is here now. Sadly, the launch is somewhat blighted by many players suffering serious performance problems.

Update: We've tested Nintendo Switch Sports on the Switch Lite with some Joy-Con (you can download the playtest app now, but you can't actually get into any games) and it does seem to be another case of Nintendo being overly cautious here to avoid disappointment.
You can use Joy-Con to play Nintendo Switch Sports on the Switch Lite, but it naturally won't be the preferred approach to play; Nintendo is perhaps keen to make sure this is experienced on a big-screen TV with plenty of room for Joy-Con swinging, and not on your dining room table with the Switch Lite propped up by a pile of books.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s an old chestnut from gaming mythology - you surely know the one - about the movement in Mario’s 3D ventures being perfected by Shigeru Miyamoto at their very start with Super Mario 64. Core Design managed the same thing with the original Tomb Raider back in 1996, too. Nobody really talks about it now, while the Mario story endures. Possibly because Nintendo didn’t make umpteen identikit sequels over the following decade or splash Mario’s stretchy mug on the cover of The Face. 
Really though, the Italian plumber and English graverobber were equally confident that if all their moves were available right from the start with no unlocking needed then that was enough. Both games were – are still, after a quarter of a century – the Platonic ideal of their characters. And they had bloody good swimming sections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skateboarding sim Session has added a lot in the past two years, but also lost some of its ragdoll charm. Since last year's total physics overhaul, you no longer bail with every failed trick, instead teleporting off your board in a strange, stiff way that saves time but (for me at least) replaces one unrealistic motion with another, less funny one. I want to get that gripe out of the way, because otherwise it's still gunning to be the sim for darksliding anoraks. 
The next update will add two new areas, which I got to try out recently, and some new pro skater faces. If you can ignore the frequent wacky physics hiccups and the rigid, nonplussed reaction your character has when they should, by all rights, be landing flat on their face, you'll find a surprisingly chill skating game. It's less about hoarding points with as many tricks as possible and more about pushing languidly around a city as viewed through a seasoned kickflipper's fisheye goggles.

Nintendo yesterday announced the beginnings of a phased shutdown for the 3DS and Wii U eShop stores.
It's set to wipe out a huge amount of digital content on these systems, but just how many games can we expect to disappear? While we already know Fire Emblem Fates: Revelation and its DLC will be lost, our friends over at VGC have now done some rough estimates - highlighting the number of games that will no longer be accessible to the masses.

        <updated>2022-02-16T22:55:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While it feels like we've been hearing about the TV series based on The Last of Us for quite some time, it looks like the show is further down the road than we realized. In an interview with Deadline, HBO and HBO Max chief content officer Casey Bloys revealed the show is set to debut as early as next year.
“It’s not going to air in 2022 — they are still shooting in Canada. I imagine you will see it in ’23,” said Bloys to Deadline. "Craig [Mazin] did Chernobyl for us, he is a fantastic writer and director. What I’ve seen looks amazing, so I’m excited for it, but it will not be in ’22." While it's unfortunate that we won't see The Last of Us adapted this year, it sounds like everything is very much still in production and on track to be completed by sometime in 2023.
Another interesting quote from the interview came from Deadline asking whether The Last of Us was seen internally as the next Game of Thrones. To which Bloys replied, "There is no next Game of Thrones. I’ve been here long enough that I’ve been through, what’s the next Sopranos, what’s next Game of Thrones, now what’s next Succession. There is no next Game of Thrones.” 
The Last of Us follows Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) as they try to survive in a post-apocalyptic world. Not only are the horrific zombie-like Infected an ever-present threat, but so too are other remaining humans scratching and clawing to stay alive or stay in power. The duo must traverse the United States to deliver Ellie to a promised destination. Other cast members include Anna Torv as Tess, Nick Offerman as Bill, Murray Bartlett as Frank, Gabriel Luna as Tommy, and Merle Dandridge as Marlene.]]></summary>

"What games should I get for my PlayStation 5?" This is the question we've been asked the most since Sony's new generation of gaming arrived last November. People want to see what games are the best showpieces of PlayStation 5's power, and also which ones take their beloved medium to new heights. Although the PlayStation 5 is still young, it has already amassed a nice library of games, including a few titles that you can't play anywhere else.

Alongside the rather dispiriting — perhaps even controversial, depending on your take — news of the Wii U and 3DS eShop being shutdown in the next year, Nintendo also shared a rather neat trip down memory lane. Similar to the year-end Switch website many of us used, you can visit My Nintendo 3DS & Wii U memories, login with your Nintendo account and see lifetime stats for your 3DS and Wii U usage.
There are some provisos for the data (for example the 3DS data only includes up to February 2020), but nevertheless it's a nice little trip down Nostalgia Lane.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We put Cloud in your cloud.
We begged for this, you know. We begged on our damn, dirty knees for Kingdom Hearts to come to Switch. Not Melody of Memory, that's a half-measure. We wanted the full shebang, 1.5 + 2.5 ReMix. And now we've got it... in the most cursed form possible, a Cloud Version.
Don't worry, we're not going to spend the whole review complaining about this means of delivery, though we probably could. Let's just take the drawbacks as read; an unstable or weaker internet connection will hamper performance (stuttering, hitching and freezing), introduce significant input lag or, worst of all, simply kick you back to the menu, potentially losing extensive progress. This is far from an ideal way to play Kingdom Hearts, and in truth, we don't understand why 1.5 + 2.5 ReMix couldn't simply have been ported to a system that could plainly handle it. Square Enix certainly has the resources, and it's incredibly disappointing for fans of this series to see that the company simply wasn't willing to invest the time, effort and funds to make a native port a reality.

Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin may be a weird spin for the series, but one traditional staple remains present: the Job system. 
Jobs are basically roles you can assign to each party member that determine what abilities and weapons they utilize. Stranger of Paradise boasts 27 jobs and three of them are brand new to the series. The PlayStation Blog provides a rundown of what some of these jobs entail, including the ones exclusive to the title.
The jobs unique to Stranger of Paradise are Breaker, Void Knight, and Tyrant.  
Breaker lets players wield the legendary sword Zantetsuken (famously wielded by classic FF summon Odin) to smash through defenses and potentially land one-hit kills. Square describes this as a trickier playstyle to master but one that can have big payoffs.
Void Knight allows you to counter enemy magic attacks, either by absorbing and converting them to MP or turning back against their casters.  
Tyrant buffs your normal attacks with elemental attributes to devastate enemies vulnerable to a particular element. 
Other classes revealed so far include Swordsman (which protagonist Jack begins as), Dark Knight, Black Mage, Sage, Ninja, Paladin, and Thief. At their core, these jobs function the way old-school fans would assume but expect a more action-oriented slant. For example, Sage lets you quickly swap between white and black magic for some fast-paced spellcasting.
You can read more details on each revealed class by visiting the PlayStation Blog. Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin launches March 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You can watch the latest Frank Sinatra-themed trailer here.]]></summary>

Sony San Diego has revealed that its upcoming baseball game, MLB The Show 22, will be getting a technical test starting tomorrow, February 17, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch. 
It’ll begin at 10 a.m. PST and will last until February 23 at 10 a.m. PST giving players in the U.S. and Canada a week to try out the game ahead of its April 5 release. As for what to expect, the technical test seems primarily focused on stress testing MLB The Show 22’s online servers and functions.

“We want to deliver the best version possible of MLB The Show 22 and to do that, we need everyone’s help to stress the servers, online matchmaking, cross-platform play, online co-op, and more in addition to gathering feedback on gameplay,” Sony San Diego writes in the description of its trailer for this announcement. “The best news? No need to sign up [as] it’s open to everyone eligible.” 
You need only to download the technical test to participate and if you’re planning to play on a PlayStation console, you can download it right now so that when it’s live tomorrow, you’re all set to hit the mound. Because co-op is enabled, you can play 2vs or 3v3 online. Plus, because the test is open to all, you can post whatever you want from it on social media. 
This technical test is especially exciting because it’s the first chance to play MLB The Show 22 on Switch. This year’s baseball game from Sony San Diego is the first time an MLB The Show game will be released on a Nintendo platform.

Studio animations that play before movies are nothing new. Popularized by the likes of Marvel Studios (although who could forget the build-up of Fox 20th Century’s snare-centric intro animation), it’s not uncommon to see some flashy animation from a studio that lets you know, “Hey, this is a movie made by us.” 
That’s the case with PlayStation’s movie arm, PlayStation Productions, which is set to release its Tom Holland-led Uncharted movie in theaters this Friday. When you sit down to watch it, you’ll see a new PlayStation Productions animation, too, that features PlayStation mascots such as Horizon Forbidden West’s Aloy, Ghost of Tsushima’s Jin Sakai (who is also getting a own movie), God of War’s Kratos and Atreus, The Last of Us’ Joel and Ellie (which we’ll see in HBO’s upcoming show based on that game later this year), and Asto Bot, too. 
Is that a new PlayStation Productions animation? 👀

Of course, you’ll spot Nathan Drake from Uncharted, Sackboy, and Ratchet & Clank as well. And, if this new animation is anything like Marvel Studios’, it’ll change over time to include new and returning faces. 
You’ll be able to see this PlayStation Productions animation when it plays before Uncharted starting February 18. While waiting for that, read Game Informer’s Horizon Forbidden West review and then check out Game Informer’s Uncharted movie review. Watch Game Informer’s interview with Uncharted movie star, Tom Holland, after that.

With Nintendo Switch Online in full force, the official line is that Nintendo has “no plans to offer classic content in other ways.” Yikes! The fear that many online in Japan  have is that, despite Nintendo’s claims otherwise, soon it might not be…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The huge new patch released for Cyberpunk 2077 yesterday is mostly a good'un, bringing the dystopian RPG closer to the game it should have been 14 months ago. But Update 1.5 might be bad news for players with older PCs. CD Projekt Red have officially ended support for Nvidia GeForce 700 series graphics cards, and announced plans to end Windows 7 support later this year. This isn't immediately bad, but the game could end up breaking on affected computers in the future.

I had to buy new carpet recently, and Carpet Man told me that the only shade of carpet anyone wants nowadays is grey, resting one hand on his hip and the other on a pile of pile. He seemed weary, but livened up as I picked through some beige.
Eventually I decided on corn, a warm yellow to keep things light and breezy. To both my relief and, I think, the relief of the Carpet Man, it wasn't grey. The shade that, for whatever reason, most people like to walk on. One that tires Carpet Man and reminds me of Lost Ark, an MMO that's supremely popular for some reason. No matter how chic it may be right now, I can't see it being a permanent fixture in my life.

        <updated>2022-02-15T23:31:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic the Hedgehog 2 doesn’t premiere in theaters until April 8, but Sega and Paramount Pictures have confirmed that a third film is in the works along with TV spin-off series for Paramount+. 
In a press release, the companies revealed that development of Sonic 3 (or whatever it winds up being called) has already begun. There’s no word on who will be involved, but one would imagine the main cast will stick around along with director Jeff Fowler. Sega and Paramount did not share a release window. 
The live-action TV series features Idris Elba’s Knuckles, who makes his debut in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and will premiere in 2023. It’s unclear if Knuckles is the star of this show or is just the first character confirmed for it but the former sounds more likely. This adds another video game series to Paramount+'s line-up alongside its soon-to-premiere Halo. To avoid potential confusion, this Sonic TV show is a separate project from Sonic Prime, the animated series that debuts on Netflix sometime this year. 
“We’ve got a remarkable partnership with Paramount, and we are excited to continue expanding the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise with them,” says Sega CEO Haruki Satomi in the press release. “2022 is shaping up to be a significant year for the franchise with the second film being released this April, as well as Sonic Frontiers, the highly anticipated video game title, coming this holiday.” 
2022 is indeed a big year for Sonic. As previously mentioned, his first open-world game Sonic Frontiers is slated to arrive later this year. You can read about how that game was originally intended to release in 2021 here.]]></summary>

One, "Network Extensions 3", violates the Steam Subscriber Agreement by "discriminating against specific Steam users" blocking them from using it, Colossal Order say. Another mod, "Update From Github", aimed to circumvent the Steam Workshop entirely by allowing updates to mods to be installed directly form Github while "making changes to existing Workshop subscriptions without the user's knowledge."

Complicating matters somewhat is a sea of rumours about what else the mods contained, and a series of counter-allegations about Colossal Order from the creator of the mods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Variety is reporting that Paramount Plus has a few more missions for Master Chief to go on for the streaming network. The television adaptation Halo, based on the game franchise of the same name, is getting a second season prior to the airing of its first season. 
Along with the early renewal of the series, a new showrunner is taking over for the sophomore suite of episodes. According to Variety, Brave New World creator and Fear the Walking Dead co-executive producer, David Wiener will be helming the show moving forward. He'll be taking the place of former showrunners Kyle Killen (who left partway through season one) and Steven Kane. Kane reportedly departed the project after completing the first season due to the "massive scope of the series" and the two years of production it took the first set of episodes to film due to COVID complications. 
There's no word on what kind of threats the UNSC and Master Chief will face in season two of Halo, and we likely won't know until credits roll on the debut season. Halo stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief/John-117, Natascha McElhone as Dr. Halsey, and Jen Taylor will reprise her role as the AI Cortana. The show also stars Bokeem Woodbine, Shabana Azmi, Bentley Kalu, Natasha Culzac, Kate Kennedy, Danny Sapani, Olive Gray, and Charlie Murphy.
Halo premieres on Paramount Plus on March 24. Check out a recent trailer for the show here, and read about some legal drama surrounding Halo that could affect the TV series.]]></summary>

First up is a collection of four Funko Pop figures featuring characters from the upcoming Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. Of course, Tiny Tina herself is represented, but so is her trusty diamond unicorn, Butt Stallion. Unfortunately, it's probably not possible to have Tina ride on Butt Stallion's back. Joining that dynamic duo is the big baddie from Wonderlands, Will Arnett's Dragon Lord, along with Paladin Mike, an elite guard sworn to protect Queen Butt Stallion.

Apex Legends already has eight figurines in the Pop collection, and it looks like at least four more are being added in the near future. Slated to hit sometime this year are Wattson, Octane, Revenant, and Crypto. Given that these were the first four additions to the Apex roster, the following eight are likely to show up down the line. Or at least, anyone collecting this set would hope so.

Guardians will soon face off against Savathûn and her Lucent Brood in just one week and to prepare you for the upcoming fight, Bungie has released a new launch trailer for Destiny 2: The Witch Queen. 
As you might expect, it features plenty of new haunting imagery of the Witch Queen, plus some new threats from her. Like previous expansion launch trailers, this one is quite cinematic, featuring mostly CGI. If you’ve been paying attention to this expansion, you know Savathûn has been stealing the precious Light of the Guardians. Plus, she has a host of ally enemies that also fight using the light, representing an all-new fight for our own Guardians, who, up until this point, have never fought someone using their own powers.

Of course, Savathûn is thrilled that your Guardian and others are coming to her Throne World. In fact, she’s inviting you in. The trailer also showcases some new looks at the exotics and fancy Glaive weapons coming to Destiny 2 in The Witch Queen expansion. 
The trailer ends with a screen that showcases what you can get for preordering Destiny 2: The Witch Queen, which is the most preordered Destiny 2 expansion in the game’s history. If you preorder the deluxe edition, you’ll receive some instant in-game rewards as well as the Osteo Striga Exotic SMG (and other bonuses) when the expansion is live next week on February 22. 
While waiting for that day, read Game Informer’s preview of Destiny 2: The Witch Queen and then check out some gameplay from it in Game Informer’s Destiny 2: The Witch Queen New Gameplay Today. Read about how Sony and PlayStation are acquiring Destiny 2 developer, Bungie, after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur’s Gate’s most famous barbarian wasn’t actually a barbarian at all. Technically speaking, Minsc was a ranger - a man of the woods who just happened to spin into a rage during battle, hitting friend or foe for extra damage, while ignoring blows that would fell a tree. It was a classification that came with its benefits: since every ranger was entitled to an animal companion, Minsc had justification for his connection to Boo, the “miniature giant space hamster” that lived in his inventory. But the primary reason for the misnomer was a gap in the rules of Dungeons & Dragons.


“Second edition didn’t have the barbarian class,” remembers lead designer James Ohlen. “Baldur’s Gate 2 used third edition classes, but by then, it was too late.”


Larian Studios, the current custodians of the series, don’t have any such issues. Working with D&D’s fifth edition, which has full and flavoursome rules that allow players to embody barbarians, the developers have adapted the class for use in Baldur’s Gate III. It’s a typically meticulous transposition that holds true to the tabletop game’s definition of what makes a barbarian boil: “More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.”

Are you excited about the Uncharted movie? You don't have to wait long as Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg's latest film arrives this Friday only in theaters. If you can't get enough of Nathan Drake and his adventures, you've come to the right place. Be sure to check out Brian Shea's review of the movie, where he says: 
"The Uncharted video games set a high bar for storytelling, and though Uncharted doesn't quite clear that bar, I had a fun time from the very first scene. Through some awe-inspiring action set pieces and strong performances, the film ably showcases the strengths of the game franchise while giving fans a new, albeit slightly familiar storyline."

Suppose you want something a bit more traditional, head over to our YouTube page to watch a fresh episode of New Gameplay Today to check out Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, where we let you know if it's worth picking up for the PlayStation 5!

The Hollywood Reporter states that Netflix is partnering with 2K's parent company Take-Two Interactive and Vertigo Entertainment to bring the series to life. The THR report calls this an effort to "develop a potential cinematic universe," which is fitting considering the multiversal events of Bioshock Infinite. Currently, there are no names attached to the project for writing or directing, nor is there any word of which era of Bioshock we'll be seeing on film.

So as an alternative to spending £100-odd for all a game's DLC, Paradox have started dabbling in letting players pay monthly fees to play them. The next game to start such a DLC subscription service is Hearts Of Iron IV, launching today. Like the others, it'll charge £4 per month. Or alternatively, you can still just buy DLC for keepsies.

Dune: Spice Wars is an exciting prospect for real-time strategy fans and enthusiasts of the popular books (and recent Oscar-nominated film). The game takes the series back to its RTS roots, though we hadn't seen much of it beyond cinematic teases. However, a new trailer provides the first look at its tactical gameplay.
The trailer shows off how players can command units on Arrakis. You’ll lead your chosen faction using several methods, whether it be flexing political influence, having deep economic pockets, or just pure open warfare. As you travel the world and meet/capture villages, you gather resources and set up spice harvesters to keep the money flowing while using armies to keep attackers at bay. In addition to a single-player campaign, developer Shiro Games previously confirmed multiplayer.

Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams, by That's Nice Games, is a jigsaw game that came to Steam last December. No, more than that. It is a doing-a-jigsaw game. A jigsaw sim.
See, most jigsaw games - and I idly toy with the idea of playing a bit of any new one I find on Steam, before realising that is a fool's errand - are just kind of 2D, put together this flat JPEG of a flower that I have cut into triangles. There's no tactile pleasure to be had. But Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams is a little one bed mezzanine flat in which you do puzzles - on the floor, on the kitchen table, on the rug - and each puzzle piece is a little 3D thing you can pick up and drop and turn around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple of weeks back, I interviewed the creator of Left 4 Dead and general PC gaming multiplayer grandee Mike Booth about his VR tabletop game Demeo. In virtual reality, Demeo seeks to recreate the feeling of playing a TRPG strategy game, huddled around a table with three pals and a load of cheesey crisps. Soon, though, you won't need a headset to play it, as Demeo is also getting a standalone PC version. I got invited for a little hands-on of the PC build, and thought that since I am a tabletop-game-playing person, it'd be interesting to bring Ed along with me. Ed likes multiplayer PC games more than me, but in the kind of kill-streak, headshot, battle-royale way. Thus, as a team, we are perfectly poised to assess how Demeo stacks up as a co-op PC game.
We played a single level in Demeo's first adventure module, The Black Sarcophagus, although when it launches in early access a complete game will stretch to three. Demeo will also have all the other adventures released for the VR version, including the most recent forest-set Roots Of Evil, but The Black Sarcophagus placed us in a creepy stone dungeon and/or crypt. The goal was to find the monster carrying the crypt key, remove the key by force, and then unlock door to the next level. Our team of four was completed by Tommy Palm, CEO and founder of Resolution games (and owner of a truly top-tier cardigan) and producer Gustav Stenmark (no cardigan visible sadly, but he seemed cool). Here's how we got on.

Horizon Forbidden West, the long-awaited sequel to 2018’s acclaimed Zero Dawn, drops this Friday. Today, Lego revealed a tie-in “Tallneck” set for any avid collectors out there. The set comes with 1222 pieces and features a detailed Aloy minifigure along with the titular Tallneck robo-dinosaur (see gallery below).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Easily one of the standout PC reveals from last year's Game Awards, Dune: Spice Wars is an upcoming real-time 4X strategy game about everyone's favourite doomed sand planet. Based on Frank Herbert's acclaimed novel and made by the same folks behind Northgard and Wartales, Dune: Spice Wars will see players step into the boots of one of four factions when it launches in early access later this spring, and I've had a chance to see how one of them works in action. 
In a hands-off presentation, developers Shiro Games showed us how the (sadly Chalamet-less) Atreides family will be going about their fight to control Arrakis' most coveted substance - the all-important spice melange - although players will also be able to choose from the shady Harkonnen clan at launch, plus two more unannounced factions that will be revealed in the coming weeks. There's a lot to take in, but if you've been waiting for a Dune game to succeed the 1992 RTS epic that was Dune II: Battle For Arrakis, well, you better pull your head out of the sand and strap on your hydro-cycling stillsuit. The battle for this year's best strategy game is about to get spicy.

For some, it’s when you get a job and start making money. Parker Anderson, the one-man show behind PlugWorld, took on all of that and began developing a game that you can play with one hand all by himself. He’s now 17 years old, and Weaponeer is nearing its big (paid) re-release on February 14. 
While Anderson developed the game exclusively by himself, its re-release features a few extra helping hands in the form of VoxPop Games and charity AbleGamers. VoxPop was founded during the COVID-19 pandemic by current CEO Charles Yu and COO Marc Rodriguez.

WWE 2K22 launches on March 11 and Visual Concepts/2K have slowly begun rolling out roster reveals. Every wrestling fan knows that the quality of the roster makes or breaks any wrestling game but that's become especially crucial for 2K22. The game arrives in the wake of a pandemic era that saw over 100 wrestlers fired by WWE, leaving fans worried and skeptical about who's left to plug up the holes. 
Using 2K’s official roster list, as well as combing through trailers and marketing materials, we’ve put together a list of over 70 confirmed superstars for WWE 2K22. It’s worth noting that 2K’s own roster lacks names that have appeared in trailers while other faces have been confirmed via their character portraits instead of an in-game model. We're also sure you can use this list to connect the dots on who will appear (such as missing tag team partners) that have not been formally announced. We’ll update this list as new wrestlers make the cut. 
Update 2/14: The following superstars have been confirmed: Dakota Kai, Elias, Io Shirai, Jinder Mahal, Lacey Evans, Mandy Rose, Mansoor, Pete Dunne, and Roddy Piper. 
The confirmed roster so far: 
AJ Styles
Dakota Kai
Kane
Sami Zayn
Note: Jeff Hardy and Samoa Joe were previously confirmed, but given both have since been released from WWE, there's a good chance they’re no longer in the game.

Cyberpunk 2077 launched over a year ago with many issues, including game-breaking bugs, epileptic triggers, and more. Sadly, these issues led to class action lawsuits and storefront refunds. Despite this, CD Project Red’s futuristic RPG found financial success and was one of the most popular games on Steam in 2020. Mods helped stabilize and enrich the PC experience, while consoles (especially the Xbox One and last-gen PlayStation 4)  struggled…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uncharted arrives in theaters on February 18, but if you’d rather read the cinematic adaptation instead, a novelization of the film releases tomorrow. And if you’d rather listen to your books based on blockbuster films based on triple-A video games, Variety reports that the audiobook version has an added dose of authenticity since it’ll be narrated by the original Nathan Drake himself, Nolan North. 
Uncharted: The Official Movie Novelization goes on sale on February 15 and puts the exploits of Tom Holland's Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg's Victor “Sully” Sullivan from screen to page. The book is written by sci-fi and horror author S.D. Perry, who previously penned a series of books based on Resident Evil, Alien, Star Trek, and other properties. North, who brought Nathan Drake to life throughout the Uncharted video game series, will lend his talent to the film’s younger spin on the hero. Per Variety, North says he won’t be imitating Holland’s performance one-to-one, saying “I kind of just did me. I tried to young him up a little bit.” North also provides his spins on Walhberg’s Sully as well as its other characters including Antonio Banderas' villain, Moncada.  
Now that we're a week away from the film premiere, you can whet your appetite by watching Uncharted's airplane scene in its entirety here. You can also read about how the movie's director has his sights on Jak & Daxter for his next project here. Lastly, be sure to check out our new season of our Video Gameography podcast which provides a deep dive into the making and storytelling of Uncharted: Drake's Fortune.

The free demo will only be available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 (sorry, PC players) and lets players roam the game’s opening section.

Demo progress carries over to the full game, which launches on March 3.

The long road to Babylon’s Fall first began with its reveal during E3 2018. The crux of the adventure involves players fighting their way up a tower filled with increasingly difficult enemies and dangers. To survive, you’ll collect weapons and gear to enhance your Sentinel, the playable warrior. Babylon’s Fall is a live-service title that Platinum plans to update with new game modes, story content, equipment, and more post-launch. Platinum states that all of these additions will be free of charge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Total War: Warhammer 3 is an extremely hard game to review in isolation. It’s utterly massive in itself, with eight hulking single player campaigns at launch, not to mention a greatly expanded range of multiplayer and PvE skirmish options. But that’s just the start of it. For indeed, just like beloved Warhammer villain Ebeneezer Scrooge, any attempt to form an opinion on this game has to contend not just with the present, but with the bedevilments of its past and future to boot.


While it is very much a game you can buy and enjoy on its lonesome, TWW3 is perhaps better considered as the last, grand instalment of a game whose release began nearly eight years ago with Total War: Warhammer. It’s a genuinely epic construction; a proper Pillars-Of-The Earth-level feat of game development. And here’s where the future sticks the boot in. Because while the last stones of this electric cathedral have been lowered into place, the phone line to God hasn’t been wired in yet.

A new cinematic trailer for Horizon Forbidden West released today by Guerrilla Games and PlayStation showcases both the stunning locales in Aloy’s newest journey and her greatest hunt yet. 
If you’ve been paying attention to PlayStation as of late, you know they’ve significantly ramped up the marketing for Forbidden West, its next first-party title hitting PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on February 18. Most trailers have been about specific things within the sequel, such as salvage contracts and challenges, or new looks at gameplay running on different PlayStation consoles. Today’s trailer, however, is the most cinematic look we’ve received of Forbidden West yet and you can watch it below:

As you can see in the trailer, it shows Aloy’s journey across the Forbidden West. It starts in somewhat familiar territory before we see Aloy encounter some vicious dinosaur machines. We then get a new look at swimming mechanics in Forbidden West as well as a glimpse at a fight against one of the game’s new Elephant machines. Throughout the entire journey, Aloy narrates what is her biggest hunt – unknown to us at the moment – that takes her to the Forbidden West. 
It’s a great trailer and certainly one worth watching if you’re excited about this sequel. After watching it, watch this “Meet the Cast” of Horizon Forbidden West trailer and then read about how Guerrilla Games is taking Aloy to new places in Horizon Forbidden West. Check out this story about how Horizon Zero Dawn has surpassed 20 million copies sold, just a week before the release of Horizon Forbidden West, after that.

Capcom fans have been enjoying some fantastic games as of late. Between Resident Evil remakes, new entries in the long-running horror series, or beasts to hunt in Monster Hunter Rise, Capcom has been providing players with plenty to do. And now, the company is providing fans with something new to do: stare at a mysterious countdown. 
Perhaps as a Valentine’s Day surprise, Capcom tweeted out a random link today and upon clicking it, you’re brought to a relatively blank screen that features a countdown both in days and in hours. At first glance, it’s not really teasing anything, ex…]]></summary>

PowerTOP continues to see occasional commits and new releases, but there's less talk about it these days than going back a number of years when it was a must-have for x86_64 laptops.

Well, 1.32m were in-game, but they might not have been playing. Server problems continued after launch with long queues for some. Publishers Amazon say they're working on it, including planning to create a whole new extra European server region.

While it’s the default rendering option in the western version that launched last week, the original South Korean version went years with just DirectX 9 to its name, and the press build that I used for performance testing (and Ed is using for his review-in progress) remains locked to DX9. Despite the fact that, as I’ve confirmed from testing the release build as well, DX11 provides a tidy performance gain over its predecessor.

Amazon Games' followup to its MMO debut New World hit this week in the form of Lost Ark. An action-RPG MMO hybrid that dropped initially in South Korea in 2018, Lost Ark has built a following over the few short years and has made quite the impact when it released this week.

After tackling Metroid in season 1 and then Halo in season 2, Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast turns its gaze to one of Sony's biggest properties: Uncharted. Over the next several weeks, we'll examine all of the mainline entries in Naughty Dog's blockbuster action series, so sit back and relax as we kick the season off with Uncharted: Drake's Fortune.  
Developed by Naughty Dog, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune was a big release for Sony's PlayStation 3 console. Released on November 19, 2007, Uncharted brought Naughty Dog into a bold new era of "mature" game development. In this week's episode, we talk about Naughty Dog's history developing titles like Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter, how the studio was largely unprepared for the challenges of Uncharted's development. We also talk about how Naughty Dog almost designed a game similar to BioShock, how Johnny Knoxville served as inspiration for Nathan Drake, and how Gears of War's release changed Uncharted's design for the better. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and ex-Game Informer editor and host of the CrossFade podcast Matt Helgeson (@MattHelgeson) as we unpack the history and impact of Nathan Drake's video game debut.  
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

Traditionally MMOs are best played on mouse and keyboard, but Lost Ark isn’t a traditional game, is it? Before I get carried away, know you’ll probably have a better experience playing this isometric action RPG with classic inputs. However, Lost Ark is playable with a controller, if not entirely enjoyable. I’d even argue combat feels best on a controller, despite the general awkwardness of navigating menus, inventories, and action bars on a gamepad.
Regardless of how you’re playing Lost Ark, tedium will soon set in if you don’t learn its many hotkeys and controller shortcuts. With convenience in mind, I …]]></summary>

Dying Light 2 Stay Human is a fun and ambitious game, but it’s not without technical drawbacks. Earlier today, Techland dropped a patch for consoles and PC designed to squash various bugs while bolstering the adventure with some improvements. If you’re looking forward to running amok in Villedor this weekend, your romp should be smoother.

This tweet was sent at 2:15pm PT. Players were still experiencing issues with missing characters after downloading the new patch, however, and so servers have been taken offline "to get this resolved."
An earlier tweet from the Lost Ark account said that as compensation for the delays they "will add 3 days of Crystalline Aura to all players who log in to the game between launch and 9 AM PT [5 PM UTC] on 2/13 as a small thank you."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My last Elden Ring hands-on was illuminating, to say the least. As I got turned to mulch by a mechanical chariot, split in two by an ulcerated lizard, and bullied by a beast man, I simply... gave up. I said to myself, "I'll come back to this later. Yeah", with that final "yeah" escaping from my lips like a wisp of steam from a kettle.
The game boiled me alive, but its open world accommodated these feverish outbursts far better than previous Souls games. There were vast swathes of map to help bring my temperature back down from simmer to sparkling. One thing troubled me, though, and that was the rate at which I'd zip between bosses in-between distractions. It felt like I lacked the focus needed to keep up with Elden Ring's open world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's tempting to think that a city builder should focus on covering more ground, simulating a wider range of those elements in a bid for authenticity, or comprehensiveness.
Power To The People takes the other approach. You're the decision maker of an energy company, tasked solely with providing electricity to towns you have no control over. Do a good job and you'll make enough money to scale up alongside the village/town/city. For such a simple premise it's surprisingly good at engaging the part of your brain that covers strategy and puzzles. Considering that power lines are normally an annoying hassle in games that simulate them at even a basic level, I'm also impressed by how entertaining it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whenever a game like Lost Ark comes out, it shows the public is still hungry for something that looks and sounds and plays even a tiny bit like Diablo. Lost Ark does provide what is the crudest part of the appeal of something like Diablo - i.e. a thousand chittering enemies flying at you at once as you vaporise them with minimal clicking - but I wouldn't say it's a lovingly crafted version of it. Like the difference between the Wicked Witch in Snow White and a Halloween costume in a plastic bag labelled Legally Distinct Evil Magic Stepmother. But there are also things I appreciate about Lost Ark in general, and its version of [flaps hands] whatever this is.
In the spirit of Lost Ark's slightly older (one might even say dated?) sensibilities, I'm going to break it down like I'm reviewing the game in a 90s game mag, separating the game into its constituent parts - just as one can remove the egg from a cake after baking it. Although I should make it clear I'm not doing our proper Lost Ark review. That honour falls to Ed, who is more plugged in to modern MMORPGs than I am. I'm just here to talk about how Lost Ark does and does not compare to Diablo - specifically Diablo II, because that's the best one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just for a second, as you hit the apex of a particularly audacious jump, the bottom end of Dying Light 2’s audio drops out. It’s as if bass were a grounded concept you’d momentarily left behind - an earthy comfort for mortals. Then the tumble begins, and you’d better have already picked out a nice, safe spot to land. This is the irresistible dichotomy of the parkour game, as first defined by Mirror’s Edge in 2008 - an invitation to soar, with the understanding that true freedom doesn’t come for free. Height is earned, momentum is managed, and mistakes are punished with a 30 foot plunge.
Perhaps you’ve seen footage of Dying Light 2’s rooftop running and wondered, “How much of that is me?” In a medium where climbing systems are typically automated rather than simulated, and first-person control tends to end at the waist, it’s natural to suspect that what you’re seeing is a fancy set of animations, triggered by pointing your character in a given direction and holding down the parkour key. I’m here to tell you that Dying Light 2 is not that game: it’s the real deal. It is, among many other things, Mirror’s Edge.

Their version is mostly the same but players have noticed a few changes, supposedly including a few words being removed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When a new Telltale Games formed in 2019 from the purchased ashes of the fallen studio, one of their first actions was to announce they would make The Wolf Among Us 2. And that was about all they had to say for several years. Now, they've finally opened up, with a new trailer and 20 minutes of devchat. Guess which fictional character the Big Bad Wolf is giving a kicking this time!

XYZ Festival duels will tweak the rules, limiting the cards in your Extra Deck to XYZ monsters, and offer medals to those who take part. These medals will then grant you some unannounced rewards when the event ends.
This announcement comes alongside a promise to investigate reports of cheating, as Konami say they "strive to create a safe and enjoyable gaming environment for all Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel players".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by how much Matthew made me laugh with his withering assessment of the MacGuffin in the film Red Notice being an egg, this week the Electronic Wireless Show podcast is all MacGuffin, all the time. We discuss some of our favourite examples of the plote device in question to be found in video games, which of course leads to some interesting discussions about what even is a MacGuffin. Can a MacGuffin be intangible? No, probably not.
We discuss whether any MacGuffin is improved by replacing it with an egg (yes), why a lot of games have souls as MacGuffins, and what our own personal MacGuffins would be. Plus! Impressions of Henry "Vitamin H" Cavill, and sensational new character Sir Terence Plunder. Will Sir T become a podcast regular? Only time will tell. There is no Cavern Of Lies this week, but in a shocking turn of events it's because Nate forgot, not because I forgot. Hooray!

He may be referring to his own pockets, but it can't be a coincidence that he's perfectly summed up yet another of my early hands-on sessions with FromSoftware's action-RPG Elden Ring.
That's because I've now been able to return to the starting area of Limgrave, this time on PC and with unfettered access to all the nooks and crannies we'll be exploring in just a couple of weeks time - and I found it to be richer and more vast than, well, it had ever been. FromSoftware have tweaked some things and removed some barriers from last year's closed network test, so in a single six-hour excavation, I discovered just how ambitious this game really is. Limgrave is way bigger than I first thought. Here's what I found.

Some feared this hole might be present in Elden Ring too. Bamco now say that Elden Ring is fine, but those Dark Souls servers won't come back down until after FromSoftware's new game launches.

Originally released in 1999, the JRPG is coming to PC (and some consoles) as Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition with new updated 3D character models, some new 2D art, a "refined" soundtrack, and other tweaky bits. It looks better than many of the garbage PC ports they were releasing a few years ago. Check out the trailer yourself below.

Sadly, in both the review build I tested and at launch, even the highest quality DLSS setting looked uncharacteristically lower-res. It was still worth using, especially if you fancied clambering over Villedor’s rooftops at 4K or with ray tracing effects, but there was a nagging sense that DLSS can do better. And now it can, for Dying Light 2’s 1.04 update is live, and sharpens Nvidia’s upscaling tech to close that gap between the rendering and native resolutions.

But the series has seemingly petered out and now they're preparing to end support for the latest, America's Army: Proving Grounds.

As a 32in, 4K, 144Hz display, it does all it can to welcome Mini LED into high-end gamingland, and from what I’ve tested it’s a brilliant match. All you have to do first is spend what could well be several times the cost of your PC itself.

You haven’t witnessed the plucky determination with which he clambers up wall after wall, no matter how many times he’s climbed them before. You haven’t admired his gumption as he bounces atop each polar bear head, or upon the still bouncier belly of every (unwilling) crab.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lost Ark is a new free-to-play MMORPG that is notable because a) it is a hack 'n' slash grind that makes it a bit like a free version of Diablo, b) I have no idea what is happening at any given point in time while playing it, instead drowning in a soup made of words like 'destiny', and c) the player characters look like they work at a sex dungeon. Specifically work at, rather than participate in. They serve drinks and clean wipe-down sofas for minimum wage, and they don't particularly want to be wearing a latex catsuit, but here we are. 
For example, I'm pretty sure my gunslinger character works at a steampunk cowboy themed erotique parlour. I actually quite enjoy her attack style, a sort of hyper-aggressive DPS that allows her to switch between three different gun stances (pistols, shotgun and rifle). The dual pistols in particular come with a load of crowd-control AOE attacks like explosions and spinning  bullets firing smaller bullets, or something. And while there is some kind of story involving demons and a war and bits of stone (something something destiny), my gunslinger's quest is, currently, the single-minded pursuit of a pair of trousers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many ways, Semantle is hard mode Wordle. Gone is the simplified dictionary and five-letter limit, meaning words can be any type and length, and gone is any indication of correctly guessed letters or positions.

Instead, you've got two new helpers: the ability to make infinite guesses, and a neural network able to learn word associations telling you how close, conceptually, you are to the correct answer. I've yet to find the solution in fewer than 50 guesses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaking as a generally terrified person who curls up into a tiny ball whenever they feel threatened, the tower defence genre really resonates with me. Like a besieged castle, I am also in a state of constant high-alert and paralysing, teeth-grinding stress. I am incapable of any kind of meaningful conflict resolution, and embarrassingly vulnerable to being destroyed by hundreds of angry men with swords over the course of several helpless minutes. 


Diplomacy Is Not An Option doesn’t bill itself as a tower defence game, but it is a real-time strategy game about protecting your medieval settlement as wave after wave of attackers try to smash it up. Rather than have you traipsing around the map in search of trouble to make, there is a refreshing focus on defence – offence’s nerdy younger sister –  with victory determined not by how well you’ve conquered the surrounding land, but how capable you are of taking a beating and coming out on top.

Over the weekend, the former Irrational developer who placed the meme-ified Baguette Boy in Binfinite's Burial At Sea expansion explained why he's there. It's an interesting story about how weird game development it is, how weird games themselves are as technical objects, and about creativity within technical constraints.

The poor thing was clutching a Vox Stave, and so removing his arm removed the use of his scariest abilities - although in this case the dismemberment proved academic, because it also left him exposed to immediate melee execution. That left our Interceptor free to shoot a nearby statue down on top of a cultist before stabbing him and his friend to death, which in turn gave our Apothecary enough space to chuck a grenade at a bridge and send three Poxwalkers plummeting to their doom. 
I’m no Warhammermun. Those proper nouns are all cosmic Greek to me, but I’m relieved to report they didn't obscure the promise within the 30 minutes of Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters I was shown last week. This is fast-paced XCOM in space, with extensively destructible terrain, an intriguing dual focus on ranged and melee combat, and not a miss chance in sight. That should sound enticing to just about anyone.

The pitch suitably set for bathos, no series fan will be surprised by what happens next. No sooner has our protagonist left the tunnel than he’s launched skyward by a backhand from an ogre. In the match’s opening moments, he sees more airtime than the ball. And shortly afterwards, he’s a footnote, prone in the grass as much larger - and better armed - humanoids pound the earth around his limp form.

I've been meaning to play it properly for a while, ever since I was told that you can slice signposts in half and then when you try and read it there's only half of the text left. And so what better game, I thought, to test out the new cloud gaming beta on the Xbox this weekend? (In fact, I ended up downloading the game because it streamed fine at like 10am but at peak times it went all pixely, like someone had huffed on my glasses.)
Reader, I bloody love Death's Door. Like Katharine said, it's kind of a more gentle Soulslike, with a Studio Ghibli-esque flair to the character design and world. Also, there are fun jokes like a gravedigger being called Steadhone and stuff. But I also hate Death's Door, because it's still not an easy game, and I think I ended up playing it improperly this weekend.

It's tailing off now, but still averaging 60,000 Steam users over the last three months, a surge you'd think would be worth celebrating, right? I investigated and discovered that Mir4 is one bizarre game, with one soul-crushing USP: NFTs.
That's right folks. The game lets you mint your character as an NFT, and even mine cryptocurrency if you so choose. If this is the future, then it seems cold and strange and sad. Also, Mir4 is a terrible game.

Well, with Sifu, my childhood dream is now a reality. You don’t need to be a kung fu film fanatic to appreciate this action game, though. It’s not a tired bundle of tropes packaged together with an ironic detachment. It’s a passionate celebration of what makes the genre so good. It looks at the classics, then the modern descendants of that style, and finally puts its own unique twist on the whole thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta is adding a new system called "Personal Boundary" to Horizon Worlds and Horizon Venues, two of their virtual reality apps. It's designed to curb creepy behaviour within the company's much-hyped metaverse by preventing other player's from invading your personal space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wordle is a genre now. Its rapid success has caused a proliferation of browser games in which all players are presented with the same puzzle each day, limited guesses, and easy options to share their results.

My new favourite is Worldle. It meets all the criteria, including being free and playable in your browser, but instead of guessing a word you're attempt to identify a country by its silhouette.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My eyes unfocused partway through the trailer for Genshin Impact's 2.5 update. There was some sort of mystical calamity and it was all very dramatic. Then, almost after the real trailer was finished, there was a minute or more of the actual game, as a character gathered herbs in a pretty field at night, mixed a drink, and unlocked some items. 

I was immediately focused back in. Update 2.5, "When the Sakura Bloom", will launch on February 16th with three new characters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developers offer free weekends with their games all the time, but it feels more like a trap when the game is The Sims 4. Become immersed in EA's dollhouse creation kit and what awaits you is a world of costly DLC.

But then heck, I like the game and I've only bought a handful of content packs because I liked the look of the kitchen cupboards. So play The Sims 4 for free on Steam this weekend, and buy it at 88% off if you like it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nine years and over $434,000,000 (£320m) after starting crowdfunding, space sim Star Citizen and its singleplayer spin-off Squadron 42 are still very far from completion. They're sustained by fans' hopes and dreams of what the games might one day become but this is a double-edged sword. The developers, Cloud Imperium Games have now decided to make their public development roadmap for future updates more vague, because some players get dead narked about delays. I can see that happening after nine years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Ed wrote about how he wished Ian Hitman could skip in IO Interactive's big shiny assassin sim. Well, Agent 47 clearly needs to make the next stop on his international mission list a nice, relaxing retreat on the Mediterranean island of Pinar del Mar. Not to murder anyone, of course. But to hang out with Alba for some all important frolicking lessons. She's a pro at this skipping marlarkey. If she's not throwing her arms out like an aeroplane when she's running up and down the yellowing hills of this sleepy little island village, she's doing a jolly little skip that is probably the most delightful thing I've ever seen in a video game. In fairness, the whole game is just pure joy distilled into a chill wildlife photography adventure, but man alive, the skipping is something else. More of this please, developers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eight years after the launch of Grand Theft Auto V, Rockstar Games have finally confirmed yes, they really are making a new GTA. For eight years they've focused on adding new content to the MMO-y GTA Online mode, which seems a licence to print money by selling in-game cash for real cash. This has made some fans ornery, wondering if they'll just keep on plugging away at GTAO forever, especially with GTAV coming to next-gen consoles this year. But no, really, Rockstar say they really have been making a new one.

This week it's the FTL-inspired The Last Bastion that's making things difficult. You're the leader of a defeated army regiment, retreating across a series of regions to a stronghold where your king plans to make a last stand. It's sort of roguelike, with a hint of something like Reigns in balancing your forces and reputation, with light interactive fiction parts. I'm a little bit annoyed that I like it.
