        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Check out this guide if you are
There are just over 50 days left until the arrival of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom for Nintendo Switch. This game has been a long-time coming (though not as long as we've been waiting for Metroid Prime 4), and I'm already making plans to dedicate a least a week of my life to exploring the skies above Hyrule. With just under two months until it arrives, and a somewhat sparse release calendar between now and then, I'm thinking now is as good a time as any to revisit The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. And what better way to revisit a game I love so much than with a guide that'll help me experience everything this game has to offer?
For those looking to get back into the best-selling Zelda game of all time or experience it for the first time, Nintendo has uploaded the Breath of the Wild Explorer's Guide as a free PDF download over on the Zelda website. Originally released with the Explorer's Edition of the game, the guide gives players tips on what they need to survive their epic quest across Hyrule. Everything from the different runes to hunting tips is included. There's even a bit of history if this is your first time seeing what The Legend of Zelda is all about.
What's not included are several sections of the guide as, for whatever reason, more than a dozen pages from the back half of the guide are missing. It's a curious omission, but what's included is good enough to get you started on your adventure. I know in all my trips to save the princess, I didn't do too much hunting or cooking. With this guide, I just might make those a priority this time.
Hopefully, those missing pages are restored soon. Either way, I'll have this guide on my iPad when I finally jump back into Breath of the Wild. I'll just keep it in the folder alongside the Earthbound Player's Guide that was uploaded online last year.

The Netflix adaptation of Epic Games' blockbuster series Gears of War is now entering its pre-production phase, having scored Academy Award-nominated writer Jon Spaihts to pen its grim tale of the down-and-dirty conflict between the dwindling human race and the ruthless, subterranean Locust.
"We’re thrilled to partner with Jon and the Netflix team to bring Gears of War to life,” stated developer The Coalition in comments to Variety. "Jon is a master storyteller with a talent for creating epic, science-fiction universes, and he truly loves Gears of War. We couldn’t ask for a better partner to honor our franchise and deliver an authentic story to our fans."
Spaihts is no stranger to dark dystopias, having penned the 2021 adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune, alongside director Denis Villeneuve and co-writer Eric Roth, a role which saw Spaights up for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 2022 Academy Awards. Alongside Dune, Spaihts also wrote Doctor Strange (2016) for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as well as Alien spin-off Prometheus (2012). Along with the Gears of War gig, Spaihts also resumed work alongside Villeneuve for Dune: Part Two, which will premiere in November of this year.
Netflix' partnership with Gears developer The Coalition is expected to result in the initial live-action feature, to be followed by an animated series and further unannounced projects. This latest endeavor is the closest the sci-fi/action series has come to a live-action adaptation, following on from years and years of repeated attempts to bring the world of The COG and The Locust to the screen. Gears of War has a deceptively deep story and universe. Correctly executed, a big (or small) screen version of the original trilogy could be a genuine televisual event.

Visual novels have found a bit of a home on the Nintendo Switch. The combination of portability and easy pick-up, put-down feel of the Switch goes really well with long, involved, engrossing visual novels. Ever since I got mine, I've read a good amount of VNs on it, whether in a hotel bed, on the couch, or on a plane.
This harmony makes visual novels a bit more approachable, and it helps that the genre seems to be drawing in more and more interest. With mainstays like Ace Attorney or surprise hits like Paranormasight, there's a lot to find. But also a lot to sift through, especially if you're new and looking for a specific kind of story to ease you in.
So, I decided to throw together a list with that in mind. These are 20 fantastic visual nove…]]></summary>

If you've ever wanted a Slowpoke summoning circle or a Slowpoke crown, well then, we have the toy for you. Bandai has revealed it's releasing a plastic Pokémon model for Slowpoke, and it can latch onto other Slowpoke toys by biting their tails.
Shared by PokéJungle on Twitter, the plastic model (from Bandai Spirits via the Bandai Hobby site) is 120mm in length once put together and is slightly curved so that when you attach it to multiple Slowpokes, it will form a circle. It comes with four different eye stickers, so you can give it a handful of different expressions, too. It's pretty adorable, but it's only been announced for Japan so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer showcasing some of the impressive visual work going into its upcoming Lords of the Fallen sequel, The Lords of the Fallen. 
The Lords of the Fallen, previously known as Lords of the Fallen 2, has had a rocky development history thus far, but with Hexworks taking over development back in 2020, the sequel has begun to shape up.
We got a reveal trailer during Gamescom last year that showcased the game's darker, more gothic tone alongside word that this sequel will feature online co-op and a world five times larger than its predecessor. We got another look at the game's grisly world in a new trailer released during The Game Awards back in December, and now, thanks to Epic's State of Unreal presentation today, we get to see more of the game. 
Because it's a trailer released as part of today's State of Unreal presentation, it's less cinematic than previous trailers and instead, focuses on some of the visual design work going into the game.
Check it out for yourself below in this new trailer for The Lords of the Fallen:  


As you can see, The Lords of the Fallen continues to look great, and fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer to go hands-on with it because it's due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime this year. 
For more information about the game, head to our hub for The Lords of the Fallen and then read our thoughts on its predecessor in Game Informer's Lords of the Fallen review after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're on update 16 as of March 2023
With quite a few Dragon Ball games coming out on a yearly basis (including mobile ones of mixed quality), it's easy to get confused on what actually came out recently. Part of that is due to the unyielding strength of Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2: which came out in October of 2016, but is still getting free updates to this day, typically dealing with whatever is going on in DBZ related media at that time.
We're on update 16 somehow, which is coming out on March 23 on all platforms. The big focus of this update is Cell Max (from Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero): synergy! The below trailer showcases the Z fighters taking on the giant boss, while also detailing new costumes (including the Cell Max suit), skills, mascots, and loading screens.
Piccolo (Power Awakening form) is making it in as a playable character as well via the Hero of Justice Pack Set - Pack 2. That's "coming soon" and is separate from the free update on March 23 with all of the other aforementioned stuff. Yep, this game is super easy to follow!

Two new costumes and accesories
Five Super Souls

Since 2019, the Xbox-owned developer has released two instances of behind-the-scenes footage, with one revealing the game is not a direct sequel to 2017's Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. We did get some gameplay during a trailer at The Game Awards in 2021 but since then, not much. 
Now, thanks to today's State of Unreal presentation highlighting the current state of Epic's Unreal Engine, we get another tease of what's to come in Senua's Saga: Hellblade II; this time, it's a look at the impressive facial animation Ninja Theory has pulled off in the sequel. 
Check out this new Senua's Saga: Hellblade II teaser for yourself below: 


As you can see, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II continues to look impressive. Unfortunately, we still don't know when we'll be playing the game, though.

It's almost time to say goodbye to Ryza.

Switch fans are really spoilt for choice with the Atelier series, but the Ryza trilogy has — so far — proven to be excellent. Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout is a "newcomer-friendly" adventure with a heartfelt story, while we said Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends and the Secret Fairy was "the best game in the series yet". So Ryza's last outing has a lot to live up to.

There will be a Source 2 Item Workshop as well, and it will be available at a later time during the Counter-Strike 2 limited test. 
The official Counter-Strike 2 has plenty of more nitty-gritty details about the game so head there if you want more information.

We’re about a month away from Dead Island 2’s escape from development hell, so Deep Silver is getting us primed with a peek at the game's intro cinematic.
In the stylish intro, we’re shown various eerie scenes from “HELL-A,” the zombie-fied version of Los Angeles. While it’s no zombie-child being defenestrated in reverse, the intro is plenty moody, with a slow, reverb-laced song playing over top of familiar places in various states of dereliction. While it’s obviously trying to disturb you with its depiction of a vacant society, it does so in a pretty stylish way. The cinematic was done by ELASTIC, who has also had a hand in a lot of cool stuff, and their work for Dead Island 2 is not exception.
https://youtu.be/rCS3Faf2R1w
While I wouldn’t say I’m burnt out on zombies, the original Dead Island left me less than enthused about a sequel. I played it with a friend a number of years ago, and the standout moments for me were when a guy kept pestering us for empty bottles and when we had to go to a zombie factory. I don’t remember if it was actually a zombie factory or if it was just where the zombies came from, but I turned to my friend and wondered allowed what had happened to our plan of escape.
Maybe there was a good reason why we were going to the zombie factory; I don’t know. It just seemed like an odd detour for a bunch of rubes just trying to survive. Maybe I’ll play Dead Island 2. I don’t know. However, it will take more than a cinematic trailer to convince me to put my money down.
Dead Island 2 is lurching toward an April 21 release date on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.

Skyrim’s “I used to be an adventurer like you” is probably the most famous example of a bark. Ubisoft Ghostwriter has been met with passionately negative responses from some narrative designers, while others have been arguing for its use cases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Defusing Bomb…
Valve has officially lifted the garage door on Counter-Strike 2, the next evolution of the long-running franchise. To go along with the announcement, they’ve released three trailers demonstrating the improvements made.
The changes are going to mainly appeal to the people who care about the tech behind the game. Considering that big changes would be an affront to the Counter-Strike community, this is going to be what matters most to fans. One of the videos drops outlines the improvements made to maps, another to “tick-rate” (how the game tracks players and ballistics), and the last shows off the dynamic smoke. All of these are important, so long as you already know how the changes will affect the game.
https://youtu.be/ExZtISgOxEQ
While the engine overhaul is the most important takeaway here, it’s probably going to be important for current players to know that all your gear from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive will be carried over to Counter-Strike 2.
It’s amusing to me that they’re calling it Counter-Strike 2, as though Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive never happened.
I went through a stint of playing Counter-Strike: Source competitively in my high school days. I was pretty reasonable at it and spent time with a clan that ran in a couple of leagues, but eventually, I fell off the scene. I just found that competitive gaming wasn’t for me. It was too much stress and pressure, and I had a lot more fun just playing single-player games by myself.
That said, I cannot wait to see how de_rats looks in the Source 2 engine.
Counter-Strike 2 is a free upgrade to CS:GO, and will be available to some players today for limited testing.

2K Games has released the third DLC pack for its great strategy adventure Marvel's Midnight Suns — "The Hunger", now available on all platforms, sees the arrival of the sinister and conflicted nightwalker, Morbius the Living Vampire.
A masterful scientist of shifting morals, Morbius has been pushed to team with the Midnight Suns following a vampire breakout in New York City. In a related incident, Hydra has begun infusing its soldiers with undead DNA in an effort to create a form of unkillable soldier, Morbius is hoping to reverse-engineer this formula in order to further develop a cure for his own medicinal misgivings, while further preventing Hydra from dabbling in the undead arts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnav8pZSjoY&ab_channel=Marvel%27sMidnightSuns
The Hunger DLC adds Morbius as a recruitable hero, as well as new story missions, complete with their own bespoke enemies. A new "Laboratory" upgrade will be added to the Abbey, along with a fistful of Hero Skins, Abbey Outfits, and Swimsuits. Morbius himself sports 11 brand new Hero abilities, mostly focused around causing "Bleed" status on his enemies, (naturally). Morbius focuses on single-hit damage, and can also activate "Bloodlust", which applies the Bleed effect to all of his other skills.
While seemingly strange bedfellows, teaming Morbius with Blade will result in an assault pattern absolutely teeming with the red stuff — With Blade able to cause Bleed with his various chain attacks, before Morbius follows up with powerful, single-hit impacts to put their hapless enemies back in the dirt.
Marvel's Midnight Suns is available now on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We want more!
Whether it’s the eye-popping The Artful Escape or the music-driven masterpiece Sayonara Wild Hearts, Annapurna Interactive has put out more than a few must-play titles on the Nintendo Switch, so when we heard the publisher's next project was a little puzzle game called Storyteller, you can bet we wanted to check it out immediately. Developed by Daniel Benmergui, the man behind artful little flash games I Wish I Were the Moon and Today I Die, Storyteller has one of the most imaginative premises we’ve seen in a while.
It seems simple at first. Each puzzle has a title, a set of scenes, a handful of characters, and a bunch of blank spaces for you to fill. The title is key and might read something like ‘A Heartbreak is Healed.’ With Wedding and Death Scenes available, along with four characters to choose from – Edgar, Lenora, Bernard, and Isobel – solving this puzzle is straightforward. Placing Edgar and Lenora into the Wedding Scene locks in their love. Placing Lenora in a subsequent Wedding Scene with Bernard shows that she is indeed faithful to her true love from the first scene, and this in turn breaks Bernard's heart. With a broken heart, placing Bernard in another Wedding Scene with Isobel has them marry – healing his heartbreak and fulfilling the title requirements.

For each puzzle you're given a set of characters and scenarios (the Baron, the Knight, the Queen; a wedding, a kidnap, an execution) and are tasked with arranging them in a combination that fits the story title you're given (The Queen Marries). It's playful and cute, with surprising depth that draws inspiration from classic stories. It's also very short. I'd wager you'll have hunnerpercented Storyteller in two hours max, which will sound like mana from heaven to some, but may disappoint you if you've been waiting for Storyteller for over a decade.

Get yourself oiled up and squeeze into your spandex, Tic Toc games has revealed their turn-based RPG, Wrestle Story, via Gematsu. The only mentioned platform currently is PC, and no release window was given.
It looks great! You get to customize your look, backstory, and even your ring entrance. The combat includes a timing system à la Super Mario RPG or Paper Mario. There are tag team partners. Apparently, the plot involves saving wrestling somehow. I can think of a few existential threats to performance sports, but Tic Toc, no doubt, has a much better plot than anything I could come up with. They’ve dropped a trailer you can try to glean any narrative details from.
[embed]https://youtu.be/xdzimm8Ri4w[/embed]
I love the visual presentation of the combat system. Especially the snappiness of the one wrestle-man calling for a chair and it whizzing in from out-of-ring. While there isn't a tonne of details on offer right now, what's being shown off is enough to grab my interest.
Wrestling seems well-suited to the turn-based genre, and Wrestle Story is not the first to try. Mega Cat Studio is working on their own with WrestleQuest, and Kaiju Big Battel: Fighto Fantasy has been available since 2018. Even the WWE has teased that they might have an RPG announcement in the wings. I expect that they will all have different takes on the formula, but for now, Wrestle Story is looking like it might be pretty delectable.
Wrestle Story is slated for release on PC. No release window has been announced.

Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is probably the most anticipated game on most people's lists if we're talking 2023. I'd wager that it's going to be on roughly 90% of people's lists if we're talking "summer 2023." It's a big game is what I'm saying. And it was also recognized as such at the Famitsu Game Awards this past week.
After winning the award, legendary Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma gave a short acceptance speech, serving to both hype up Tears of the Kingdom and provide a little more info on what to expect for this still-relatively-mysterious-release. Here's the full transcript, with a translation courtesy of Twitter user Genki_JPN:
"In the previous title, 'Breath of the Wild', you were able to experience a new world of Zelda with the 'freedom to go wherever and do whatever you want'. In the sequel, 'Tears of the Kingdom', furthermore, the players free imagination will be filled with new gameplay that will bring about changes to the game world. I think that everyone who voted will feel pleasantly surprised and I hope you can enjoy the 'unknown' Hyrule as you like. Thank you!"
"Filled with new gameplay that will bring about changes to the game world" is the focus here, and while it could mean anything, I'm curious to see if it is indeed just hype, or something significant that they're trying with the sequel. You can find the full acceptance speech below (it starts at roughly 5:04:05 in).

With Octopath Traveler 2, Square Enix goes back to the formula of the first. Eight adventurers, each with their own small-scale RPG quests, link up for one overarching journey. Each one will have their own paths to walk, secrets to uncover, and nemeses to vanquish in a heroic fashion. And then, after everyone's had their origin story, a final chapter will bring it all together, forming the party that will tackle the greatest threat lurking just behind the curtain.
The road ahead was already laid out by its predecessor. But sometimes, it's as much about the journey as the destination. And where Octopath Traveler 2 doesn't just succeed but makes a mark is in how it takes you there while making the long journey feel worthwhile.

I remember a chill ran down my spine as I cast my mind back to Far Cry 6, where the tutorial island itself was longer than anything else I'd played that year. I was scared Redfall might succumb to a similar fate. I imagined it filling my head with map markers until my head swelled, popped like a balloon, and dropped grey rarity brain matter.
Well, having given Redfall a go for 90 minutes I was, perhaps, being a bit dramatic. The game may be open world, and may have some slightly jarring open world-isms, but I felt like Arkane's magic wasn't diluted by it all. Their talent for storytelling and level design bubbled to the surface constantly, making exploration a genuine joy. Sure, I have some reservations, but I can't deny that I'm itching to play it again.

        <updated>2023-03-22T13:47:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was dated today
So we've already gotten three waves of DLC for Fire Emblem Engage, all of which take place in the Paralogue Islands. Think of these like a "DLC paradise" of sorts, where you'll meet with more all-star members of the Fire Emblem cast and acquire more spirits to play with. Well, Wave 4 is a little bit meatier.
Instead of character DLC, this time Nintendo is billing it as a "new story scenario." Titled "Fell Xenologue," you'll acquire new party members, and will adventure through new locations and maps (plural), as you attempt to potentially wrap up this game's universal storyline. Thanks to a new trailer from Nintendo, we do have a date for all this: April 5.
This is a pretty quick turnaround, when everything is said and done! Note that Xenoblade Chronicles 3 came out in mid 2022, and still hasn't hosted its big story DLC release yet. That's still coming in late 2023. Granted, story DLC for a game like Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is going to be even meatier than a Fire Emblem game: but it's nice that Engage fans don't have to wait that long.
Provided the DLC is worth it, at least. Hopefully it delivers!
All the details you need for Wave 4 of Fire Emblem Engage's DLC:
It's a new story scenario called Fell Xenologue
It includes new characters, locations, and maps, as well as more class types
It's out on April 5

Wave 4 of the Fire Emblem Engage Expansion Pass lands on 4th April — or 5th April in Europe. And for Fire Emblem fans, this is likely the most exciting addition yet, as it brings in brand-new story content.
In an ominous trailer, which starts off with "your grave", the Fell Xenologue will bring more story content to the base game, which is separate from the chapter structure, and will introduce brand new characters Ned and Nil. The pair say there are seven 'Emblem Bracelets', and four are missing — meaning there may well be some characters coming back to the fray.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jill takes the number two spot
If you asked someone who their favorite Resident Evil character was, odds are it'll probably be a primary protagonist. Jill, Leon, and Chris would all be on the scoreboard, and I expect Claire to make the top 10. Beyond that, it's basically anyone's guess. Well, guess no more! There's a recent poll with a rather large sample size to draw from if you're curious how everyone stacks up in 2023.
As shared by ResetEra, Famitsu held a "favorite Resident Evil character" poll in honor of the RE 4 remake, and things are looking real good for that cast. Leon took the top spot as the number one most-liked character in the Resident Evil franchise, and it's not even close. Leon has a nearly 1000 point lead over the second most popular character: Jill. That's followed by Chris, Ada, Claire, Wesker, Ethan, Rebecca, Piers, and Hunk. Wow, I'm glad Hunk made it in!
There's a few takeaways from this: people still love Leon, the star of two of the most beloved Resident Evil games, both of which have modern era remakes. Chris and his rock-punching strength were clearly going to be in the top five somewhere, and Ada's effortlessly cool persona is going to make some waves. Claire similarly is riding high, and has multiple games to draw fans from.
The big surprise for me is seeing the polarizing Ethan on this list at a respectable seventh place, but Wesker, quite honestly, could be anywhere. After his appearance in the first game he's been an anime-like shadowy figure in the thorn of many protagonist's sides, much to the chagrin of a lot of the playerbase. Seeing Piers on the list is surprising too: I don't think a US-centric poll would have him so high.
Either way, Leon is king, and that hasn't changed.
Famitsu 2023 favorite Resident Evil character poll results:
#1: Leon S. Kennedy (2637 pts)
#2: Jill Valentine (1675 pts)

#4: Ada Wong (1019 pts)
#5: Claire Redfield (858 pts)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Editor’s Note: This story’s headline has been changed to better reflect that a voice actor from Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 hinted at a September release date, even though developer Insomniac Games has only said the game will be released this fall. 
News on Marvel's Spider-Man 2, the highly anticipated follow-up to Insomniac Games' Marvel's Spider-Man from 2018 and 2020's Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, has been light since the game's reveal in 2021. But back in December, PlayStation did reveal that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 would be out sometime this Fall.

Over the past few days, rumours of the Switch successor's SoC (system-on-chip) have been surfacing online, which has got people speculating once again which chip the upcoming console might use.
Initially, @OreXda, known for accurately leaking smartphone-related tech, claimed that the Switch successor would use an Nvidia Tegra chip for the next console that's "manufactured from 5LPP" (thanks, Notebookcheck). '5LPP' is a 5-nanometer process developed by Samsung and stands for '5nm Low Power Plus, if you're not up on your microchip lingo. Previously, the Tegra239 had been the popular rumour, with an Nvidia employee confirming its existence last year.

Spiritually rather than biologically, of course. If you’re not sold yet, Miasma Chronicles will be showing up to tomorrow's Future Games Show.

Low framerates, stuttering, lighting glitches, texture popping, wonky shaders... if you could think of a technical woe, it was probably already undermining this remaster’s efforts to rework and enhance the original RPG’s visuals.
Publishers Private Division have since promised a series of updates to get the Spacer’s Choice Edition up to code, with the first of these – v1.1 – releasing late last week. I’ve given it a test on various graphics cards and credit where it’s due, it has bumped up general performance significantly, although many broken parts remain unmended.

Ubisoft has revealed that it is working on a new A.I. scriptwriting tool, which the publisher claims will help the studio's writers by providing a "first draft" of the dialogue to be used by NPCs within its many, many, many open-world adventures.
Ubisoft Ghostwriter, for that is its name, has been developed by Ubisoft's in-house research & development department, La Forge, and is intended to auto-create various in-world chatter and "barks" utilized by the dead-eyed suburbanites that you bump into in titles such as Watch_Dogs, Assassin's Creed, and Far Cry. Ubisoft hopes that the tool will allow its writers to concentrate on "less repetitive" tasks — such as core scriptwriting and cutscene dialogue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In our sixth episode, the Indiescovery gang belatedly turn our attention to the question of just what the heck we're doing here anyway. The issue of "what makes an indie game an indie game?" is full of twists and turns, and nobody has ever really come up with an answer that covers all the bases. Lucky for us, that's not really what we're talking about here, although we do use that as a jumping-off point for our chat.
Instead, we try to come up with an Indiescovery Manifesto, one that will guide us in the future when we're thinking about what games we ought to cover on the pod. We achieve this through a lively discussion that mainly involves me playing devil's advocate by throwing out ridiculous edge cases until Rachel and Liam want to break down and weep. (What can I say, I never saw a fence I didn't want to touch just to see if it's electrified.)

Capcom has released the second episode of Leon and the Mysterious Village, the short-but-adorable anime series produced to help fan the flames of hype for this week's highly anticipated Resident Evil 4.
The second episode, titled "A Promise Between the Two", sees young Leon Kennedy come face-to-face with missing girl Ashley Graham, whom he must escort out of the strange town and, presumably, back to The White House. Of course, as Resident Evil 4 veterans will be more than aware, keeping Ashley out of the hands of the village's weird doomsday cult is easier said than done. Leon, Help indeed.

A ground-up remake of the 2005 GameCube classic, the hotly-anticipated release captures all of the creepy cult shenanigans. gory head-splitting chaos, and panicky damsel-in-distress action of the original title, spruced up with brilliant new visuals, alternate twists on the narrative, and sporting an overhauled approach to its movement and combat mechanics. You can check out our own Zoey Handley's review of the new title right here.
Resident Evil 4 launches on PlayStation, PC and Xbox platforms on March 24.

Capcom's survival horror series Resident Evil has been back in the headlines recently due to the upcoming release of Capcom's Resident Evil 4 Remake. In the lead-up to this launch, Japanese publication Famitsu has put out a call - asking readers to nominate their favourite Resident Evil characters of all time.
They've now released the top 10 list, and perhaps to no surprise, Leon S. Kennedy took out the top spot. Leon first appeared in the series in Resident Evil 2 (1998) alongside Claire Redfield, and later on in 2004 he was the protagonist of Resident Evil 4.

Level-5's JRPG is set long after the events of the first game, has a new cast of characters, changes up combat a lot, and adds a sizeable kingdom management element to the game. I know people who like it and people who hate it, which in itself makes it interesting.

There are also a bunch of games leaving Game Pass at the end of the month, including Chinatown Detective Agency.

[Update: Since posting this EA has removed Mirror's Edge from the list of games to be delisted. It was definitely there when the announcement first went out, which suggests that they've since decided against delisting. Our original story follows.]
EA has announced that it will be removing four titles from storefronts on April 28, 2023. The titles are Battlefield 1943, Battlefield: Bad Company, Battlefield Bad Company 2, and Mirror’s Edge, all of which are from developer DICE. The reasons for their removal are the discontinuation of online services for them, which is unusual, since three of those games feature single-player campaigns, with Mirror’s Edge in particular only using online for leaderboards. The online portions will stay active until December 8, 2023.

The remake of Resident Evil 4 is nearly here, and if you're like me, the release of a new entry in a storied franchise always gives you the urge to seek out context. Sure, you could just play Resident Evil 4—it'll probably stand on its own just fine—but why not dig into some earlier series entries to gain a fuller appreciation of what Resident Evil 4 represents?

Of course, nobody expects you to burn through every Resident Evil game over the next couple of days.

Back in 2019, LimboLane released Smile For Me on PC to rave reviews and a cult following. The Switch version was teased during last year's festive House of Indies, and now publisher Serenity Forge has revealed the game will launch on the eShop on 24th April. A physical version will follow in the summer.
Describing the premise of Smile For Me makes it seem innocent enough — the game is a point-and-click adventure where you can't speak, and your only way of communicating is by nodding and shaking your head. But watch the trailer and, well, we're not sure what to make of it. We're in love, intrigued, and a little unsettled, all at the same time

Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has revealed the publisher's plans to open its own in-house app store, selling and distributing games and other software directly to mobile devices.
Speaking to The Financial Times, Spencer noted that the EU's incoming Digital Markets Act — new legislation that will force carriers such as Apple and Google to allow third-party app stores to operate on the iOS and Android service — will offer Microsoft the opportunity to distribute its wares directly, rather than through current conglomerate app stores.
"We want to be in a position to offer Xbox and content from both us and our third-party partners across any screen where somebody would want to play," said Spencer in the interview. "Today, we can't do that on mobile devices but we want to build towards a world that we think will be coming where those devices are opened up."
"The Digital Markets Act that's coming — those are the kinds of things [Microsoft is] planning for... I think it's a huge opportunity."
Spencer also referenced the potential for Xbox Game Pass and cloud gaming services to appear in the hypothetical new store. Microsoft is, of course, hoping to get its hands on some of today's most popular mobile titles, including Call of Duty Mobile and Candy Crush Saga, through its intended acquisition of Activision Blizzard — an acquisition that still remains a long, long way from completion. The deadline for the EU Commission to decide whether or not it approves the merger has been delayed to May 22, but this remains one of numerous hurdles Microsoft must clear before the proposed purchase can be closed.

Team Fortune has announced that their anticipated retro-styled first-person shooter, Fortune’s Run, will begin its sprint on Early Access starting in September 2023. While a demo of the game has been available since September 2022, the team is ready to take the next step in offering it to FPS fans.
Inspired by E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy and Deus Ex, Fortune’s Run incorporates “undertones” of role-playing. To differentiate itself from other retro-styled FPS games, Fortune’s Run touts a unique and deep melee system that has you memorizing combos and learning their intricacies. The game will take you through “seedy dives” and distant space stations. The trailer also shows off a lot of environmental hazards to take down enemies with, inviting you to "kill with your imagination."
https://youtu.be/S3fenLLhMIo
Most importantly to me, the trailer touts that you can “hack a mainframe” using terminal commands. Terminal commands make me feel like a boss. Every modern console should make you jam some esoteric code into a command line to start up your games, just for that shot of accomplishment serotonin.
The retro-inspired shooter genre has become rather glutted these days, making it really important to stand out from the crowd. Fortune’s Run looks to be doing just that by wearing its influences on its sleeve while still bringing a heavy dose of personality and experimentation. Down with texture filtering. A hail the grainy, pixellated textures!
A demo for Fortune’s Run is available now, with the game slated for Steam Early Access in September.

Indie outfit Visai Games has announced that it has delayed the launch of its charming-looking cooking title Venba from spring 2023 to summer 2023 — In happier news, the studio also revealed PS5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox One ports that will launch alongside the previously announced PC and Nintendo Switch editions.
Set against the backdrop of the 1980s, Venba will tell the tale of an Indian mother and her family, who have recently emigrated to Canada. A top-tier culinary master, Venba's faithful cookbook — containing generations of family recipes, is damaged in transit, and it is up to the player to guide Venba's hand as she attempts to replicate each and every recipe from the tome, while perhaps discovering a few new dishes while en route.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM6qjSc-G2w&ab_channel=VenbaGame
But Venba will be more than a simple cooking game, as a strong, familial narrative will unfold within the family, with the player becoming involved in branching conversations between Venba, her husband, and their young son. Visai Games will blend interesting and compelling puzzle work with lovingly stylish visuals and heartfelt family interaction to create a narrative title that will warm your heart as well as your stomach. I'm looking forward to checking this out when it makes its eventual debut.
Venba launches this summer on PS5, Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

Today, the company announced the writer on the film project will be John Spaihts, known most recently for his work on Dune and Doctor Strange. In a press release, Spaihts had the following to say about the project:
 In the same press release, The Coalition called Spaihts "a master storyteller." The Gears of War developer will also be attached to this project as a producer. You can see their tweet about the announcement below.

@jonspaihts - a talented writer and fellow Gears fan - to adapt an authentic live action Gears of War film with @netflix. https://t.co/OQ3HtpiJkB
March 21, 2023
We still have no release window for the project, and given that they've only just attached a writer, it's probably still a few years out. While many are likely excited at the prospect of this movie's existence, there is perhaps nobody more eager to be in on the production details than Dave Bautista. The Guardians of the Galaxy star has been campaigning for years to be cast as the live-action version of Marcus Fenix, and was even available as a playable skin in a post-launch update to Gears 5.

Bandai Namco has dropped us a hot fresh trailer today showing off the amazing coat and metal shinguards of Lars Alexandersson. Lars made his debut in Tekken 6, and has been touting his self-righteous sense of justice ever since.
The illegitimate son of series veteran Heihachi Mishima, I’m not seeing the resemblance. He’s the leader of a rebel splinter group of the Tekken Force, Yggdrasil, and has been one of the main protagonists for both Tekken 6 and Tekken 7. Given his headlining status, he was pretty much a total shoo-in for the newest iteration.
https://youtu.be/gIt9kFe5QX4
The trailer shows Lars throwing down against big cyborg, Jack-8, as well as his half-brother and fellow coat-haver Kazuma Mishima. To highlight his skill of fighting in a long coat, he’s shown effortlessly dispatching the competition using all manner of glowing kicks. His choice of fancy white clothing shows his confidence, not only in his fighting ability but also in his eating ability. True bravery.
Lars Alexandersson joins Bandai Namco’s growing collection of character trailers that have previously covered Jin Kazama, Marshall Law, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, and Kazuya Mishima. That leaves Jun Kazama and Jack-8 still needing their spotlights.
Tekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch in early 2024.

We're somehow already nearing the end of March, and Microsoft is lining up a few late-in-the-month additions to its Xbox Game Pass lineup. MLB The Show 23 is gearing up for spring training on the subscription service, and two RPGs are on deck with it.
Out today on Game Pass for cloud, console, and PC is Ni No Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom - The Prince's Edition. This version includes all the DLC for the gorgeously styled RPG from Level-5. But did you really need selling like that? This is a game where you follow a young prince on his journey alongside the isekai'd president who has a sidearm on him. Seriously, the intro alone is worth trying out.

So last month, it was pretty big news to hear he was leaving Firaxis behind to chase a “new dream.” At the time, it was unclear what that dream was, but thanks to a podcast interview with My Perfect Console (spotted and transcribed by VGC) we now have an idea of what Solomon will do next. It involves opening a new studio and working on strategy games, unlike the ones he made at Firaxis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Virtual Insanity
Sega legend Yu Suzuki has announced that he is teaming with metaverse company OASYX to create a collection of NFTs based upon his legendary fighting series, Virtua Fighter. The dreadful idea is expected to be the first step in a series of metaverse projects for the iconic game director.
A total of 1000 NFTs are currently in the works, debasing the likenesses of 11 Virtua Fighters from the first three releases in the series, (so we at least know that Eileen is safe, for now). The new range of NFTs is expected to form the base for a future release of further "metaverse avatars"
"During my time as a director at Sega, I initially developed Virtua Fighter using innovative 3D computer graphics technology, which was cutting-edge and industry-leading at the time," said Suzuki in a statement. "Since then, the Virtua Fighter series has grown to be loved by many players and continues to be supported by numerous fans today."
"Through my work supervising the development of OASYX’s unique worldview, I am delighted to combine innovative technology in the form of blockchain-based NFTs, with three titles from the Virtua Fighter series to create new entertainment for a wide range of gaming fans."
Sega has been practically salivating at the prospect of diving into the metaverse, while simultaneously attempting to assure fans that it is wary of the controversial blockchain technology. As is the case with many other toe-dippers in recent months, both Sega and Suzuki seem completely unperturbed by the market's inability to find consistent success, demonstrated by the complete collapse of cryptocurrency company FTX, the embarrassment of Meta, the dropping Google Search numbers, or fan anger displayed towards Ubisoft, Square Enix, and other studios getting on board the rocket to nowheresville.

Lululu Entertainment has revealed their next game, Henry Halfhead. This sandbox puzzle game is looking to release next year.
Casting you as the titular half-headed Henry, Henry Halfhead gives you the ability to possess objects. The trailer demonstrates Henry possessing a pair of safety scissors to slice up an apple, which is impressive. I could never even cut craft paper with those. My second thought is wondering if I could jam those scissors into an electrical socket.
https://youtu.be/_tQWiIscf34
Henry Halfhead will have you play out the life of a person with only half a head, from making your bed in the morning to (I presume) feeding the ducks on a park bench. You expand and unlock new levels by solving puzzles and interacting with objects. The developer is touting over 150 interactive objects that you can tinker around with. There’s also a co-op mode, if you’d like to partner with your other half. Oh, and you can also put hats on Henry, which is pretty key.
Lululu Entertainment (I’m glad I’m just writing that and not saying it out loud) has only developed one game previous to this, the competitive, stick-flinging title Bamerang. Henry Halfhead is quite the departure from that style, but from the looks of things, it’s shaping up pretty well. It’s hard not to dig the crisp visual style they’re showing off.
Currently, PC is the only announced platform for Henry Halfhead. It’s set to release within the wide window of 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nice of the Aliens to wait their turn
Focus Entertainment has announced that Aliens: Dark Descent, a new video game adaptation of the terrifying sci-fi series, will officially launch June 20 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
The new game, which was first announced during Summer Game Fest 2022, will see a squad of hardened marines taking on an infestation on the dark planet, Moon Lethe. Aliens: Dark Descent is a real-time strategy title and will task the player with efficiently equipping, maneuvering, and affording their troops with the tactical advantage over hordes of Warriors, Face Huggers, Queens, and, of course, the soul-sucking capitalism of Weyland-Yutani. XCOM in the Alien universe? Eh, more or less.
You can check out a new trailer below, courtesy of IGN.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YilVs3-B42k&ab_channel=IGN
As the trailer spotlights, Dark Descent is not just another bug hunt, as players will also have to ensure that their squad is well-trained, well-maintained, and afforded some of the greatest weaponry that researchers can provide. The Xenomorphs will almost always have the speed and number advantage, so the marines will have to play the field a little wiser — setting up traps, pinpointing enemy movement, and heading into battle well-equipped for the nightmare that lies ahead.
As we all know, the Alien franchise has had a real rollercoaster ride when it comes to video games, but I think the visuals here are looking pretty authentic, and it will be great to head into the acid-dripping universe from a perspective that isn't first-person. There's no sign of Lt. Vasquez, or Lynn Kurosawa for that matter, but this new take looks promising, and here's hoping that it delivers come June.
But besides all of that, I only need to know one thing... Where they are.
Aliens: Dark Descent launches June 20 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

As someone who spent much of the late 2000s deep in the RPG Maker community, I can’t believe how far the engine has come. RPG Maker is typically associated with low-quality Final Fantasy knockoffs, but funny enough, it’s the non-RPGs that became breakout hits. To The Moon set the stage for narrative RPG Maker games that are worth both time and money, and Laura Shigihara’s Rakuen follows in that proud tradition. Given Shigihara's involvement with the former project, this shouldn't come as a surprise.
Of course, this is old news by now. Rakuen originally released in 2017 to critical acclaim from fans and critics alike. Sporting an Overwhelmingly Positive consensus on Steam, words like “beautiful” and “masterpiece” typically describe this title in reviews. Now, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision has revealed that Crash Team Rumble, the 4v4 competitive multiplayer game revealed at The Game Awards last year, will be released this June. 
More specifically, Crash Team Rumble hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 20, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Activision has also revealed that a closed beta will take place from April 20 through April 24 and anyone who preorders the game will get access to it. This beta will feature Crash Bandicoot, Coco Bandicoot, Tawna Bandicoot, Doctor Neo Cortex, and Dingodile. 


The game will cost $29.99 but a deluxe edition for $39.99 will also be available. Crash Team Rumble will also include a battle pass and both editions include the first season's pass. The deluxe edition will also include the Season 2 battle pass, a free 25-tier boost for Season 1, and the digital proto pack, which brings "Blocky" skins to the game alongside some equippable items, according to VGC. 
Previews released today mention three different roles in Crash Team Rumble: Booster, Blocker, and Scorer. Using these three roles in a MOBA-like fashion, players will need to collect as much Wumpa Fruit as possible and bring it to their zone. If you've played 2021's Pokemon Unite, you probably get the gist here. 

Crash Team Rumble will feature crossplay. It is being developed by Toys for Bob, the team that developed the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy collection and Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. 
While waiting for Crash Team Rumble to release in June, read Game Informer's Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy review and then read our review of Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. 
Crash Team Rumble hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 20.

Tchia’s island is a marvel to behold. Not only is it gorgeous, but it’s bursting with things to do: sailing, climbing, totem carving, gliding, pearl diving, sharpshooting, tree hopping, treasure hunting - the list goes on and on. 
Not only that, but there’s a 10-hour story to follow, quests to complete, and baddies to tussle with. It's a lot, but Awaceb seem to take it all in their stride. Never once does Tchia feel like it’s bursting at the seams; its balance of activities, exploration and story make it feel perfectly whole. The game's incredible scope doesn't feel like the debut of a nine-person team, but astonishingly, it is. We've had a good run of Bestest Bests on RPS this month, and I'm more than happy to extend it because Tchia is an absolute triumph.

One thing I can’t stop thinking about are the game’s piss-coloured walls. They appear right at the beginning of the game’s latest expansion Lightfall and I genuinely believe they summarise Destiny perfectly.

For the record, the P3 Plus is a PCIe 4.0 SSD, with up to 5000MB/s reads and 4200MB/s writes. It uses QLC flash in a DRAM-less design, but with HMB technology - so it uses your computer's RAM as its cache. That allows it to provide surprisingly excellent performance, although we'd still recommend a higher-end TLC drive with a DRAM cache for the most intensive workloads, like 4K video production. For gaming and regular use though, this is a great choice!

Some fresh gameplay clips are sprinkled in, too, as we see the now grizzled Cal duel stormstroopers, bounty hunters, and droids.

It's a tiny bit like a Stardew Valley or Gleaner Heights, or any of those "do chores until you run out of energy" games, but mostly it's a "hanging out and being slightly weird" game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Software celebrated the one-year anniversary of Elden Ring last month and now, publisher Bandai Namco has released some fun statistics covering what players have done in 365 days of Elden Ring. 
Starting with the least surprising statistic, players have attempted to defeat Malenia, Blade of Miquella, a colossal 329 million times. In second place, players have attempted to beat Margit the Fell Omen 281 million times. In third, Limgrave Tree Sentinel 277 million times, Radagon of the Golden Order in fourth at 148 million, and in fifth, Starscourge Radahn at 139 million. Across all bosses in Elden Ring, players have initiated 5.9 billion attempts. 
If you enjoyed those stats, there are all kinds of other ones in the infographic below – enjoy!

For more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring review to find out why we gave it a 10 out of 10, and then read about the game's DLC expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 3/22/24: 
Earlier this week, Capcom released a cute (and disturbing) anime short based on Resident Evil 4 and now, just a couple of days later, the company has released another one. The first saw Leon attempting his way through the Village section of Resident Evil 4 but this time, we see him try to rescue Ashley Graham from El Gigante...and it doesn't go well. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


Resident Evil 4 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this Friday, on March 24. We loved the remake and you can find out why in Game Informer's Resident Evil 4 (Remake) review. 
The original story continues below...
Original story, 3/20/23:
The remake of Resident Evil 4 is finally out this week and ahead of the game's launch, Capcom has released a cute (and disturbing) anime short based on the game. 
In it, we see protagonist Leon Kennedy attempt to get through the curiously adorable Spanish village that serves as the setting to RE4's opening while searching for the missing daughter of the president, Ashley Graham. Things don't go according to plan for Leon, unfortunately, and well, you can see what happens for yourself in the anime short below: 


Let's hope our own journeys through RE4 go better than Leon's did in the short above. 
Resident Evil 4 (remake) hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this Thursday, on March 24. 
For more information about the game, be sure to visit Game Informer's exclusive hub for Resident Evil 4, which highlights all of our February 2023 cover story coverage for the game.

More specifically, Trinity Fusion hits Early Access on April 13. You can access this Early Access launch via both Steam and the Epic Games Store. In Trinity Fusion, you play as Maya, a cross-dimensional warrior who is able to tap into three versions of herself across parallel dimensions. 
Check out the action all three versions of Maya must face in the multiverse in the new Trinity Fusion trailer below: 


"We have a ton of content in the works for Trinity Fusion," Angry Mob Games' Bogdan Iliesiu writes in a press release.

With the Early Access release, we'll be able to get that same great feedback on our new biomes, enemies, and bosses on an ongoing basis as we keep adding more for players to explore and fight through."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zack Snyder, the director behind "Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice," "Man of Steel," and more, has revealed that his upcoming Netflix movie, "Rebel Moon," is getting the game treatment. 
Snyder told The Nerd Queens podcast this alongside word that he was helping with the development of the game, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. As for the type of game, Snyder says it will be an RPG and apparently, it will have a "ridiculous scale." 
"The one thing that I'm having a really good time with – and I don't really know if I'm supposed to talk about it – is this RPG that we're doing that is just literally insane, and so immersive and so intense and so huge," he said on the podcast, according to VGC. "There's more coming, but all I'll say is that it was pitched to me – because I've always wanted to do an RPG – like, 'well, we could do it at this scale, or we could do it at ridiculous scale.'
"And I was like, 'ridiculous scale is clearly the scale that we should be doing it.'"
Snyder says the team behind the RPG said, "Well, it's going to take so much time, we've got to do all these brain dumps, you've got to tell us everything in the universe, what's happening, the science." And Snyder said he was happy to do that, telling them, "Let's go all the way." 
Snyder wrote and directed Rebel Moon and it hits Netflix this December. 
In the meantime, read about how Netflix is developing its own series based on video games, like this live-action Assassin's Creed show and this animated Gears of Wars series (alongside a live-action Gears of War film, too).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Father forgive me, for I have spent the weekend conversing with the damned. No, I haven’t gone all Alan Moore and grimoired up a demonic pal to go gallivanting around the big Tescos with. That is next weekend. Instead, I’ve been playing Diablo 4’s beta, closed to all except an elite cadre of press, pre-orderers, and, uh, chicken enthusiasts. And so, axe in hand, I set forth, confident that whoever I found myself temporarily adventuring with would at least be fortified with adequate protein to wield rippling gains against the lords of hell.


Mouse-clicking connoisseurs of a certain age may remember a time when the name Blizzard was synonymous with the most gorgeously impressive CGI cutscenes your tiny mind had ever been blown by, and while Diablo 4’s lengthy introduction comes at a time where there’s far too much widespread talent for any one studio to claim that crown, it is still a goshdarn treat to take in. Not just technically, either. This chronicle of a cursed expedition is a mission statement for Diablo’s new (old) tone, and it sets the scene for things to come spectacularly - even if that tone straddles the line between gripping and noticeably self-concious about past accusations of cartooniness.

It’s aiming for a PC release next year, and it just looks delightful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a neat trick: if you want a high-end gaming laptop but don't want to pay over the odds for it, consider the Corsair Voyager A1600. If you buy it from Corsair's US web store, add a PC case like this one and then use code NEWBUILD, you can pick up the laptop and the case for significantly less than the cost of the laptop alone. 
In fact, this $1800 laptop that debuted in December last year for $2300, complete with Ryzen 9 CPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, 2TB of NVMe storage, a 16-in 2560x1600 (16:10) 240Hz display and Radeon RX 6800M graphics card, goes down to just $1536. And you get a free case, essentially, which you can resell later if you don't need it. Or keep it and build a PC in it, because these Corsair cases are actually really lovely!

Though there are still some kinks to work out, 2K23 stands as a respectable follow-up. 
Control-wise, 2K23 is identical to the previous game’s revamped setup, but is a bit smoother. Legacy issues remain, however, such as how finicky picking up weap…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Editor's Note: This article was updated on March 20 to include statements from Bungie, Guerrilla, and Lance Reddick's wife, Stephanie Reddick. 
Lance Reddick, perhaps best known for his role in HBO's "The Wire" has died. He was 60 years old. 
At the time of this writing, the cause of death is unknown but according to TMZ, "law enforcement sources say it appears to be natural." Deadline was also able to confirm, through the actor's public relations representative, that Reddick has died.
Beyond "The Wire," Reddick also had roles in other shows like "Fringe," "Lost," "Bosch," and even last year's "Resident Evil" series on Netflix. His movie credits include the "John Wick" franchise (he was promoting the latest, "John Wick 4," which hits theaters soon, just this week), "Godzilla Vs. Kong," and more. 
On the video game side of things, you might recognize him as the voice actor behind Destiny 2's Zavala. He also provided his voice and likeness to Sylens in PlayStation's Horizon series and Martin Hatch in Remedy's Quantum Break. 
Below are statements from Destiny 2 developer Bungie, Horizon Forbidden West developer Guerrilla, and Reddick's wife, Stephanie Reddick:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between The Last of Us, The Mandalorian, and a viral TikTok audio, Pedro Pascal has been on a roll this month. Now, he's branching out into something he's never done before: mobile game ads. Following in the footsteps of actress Kathy Bates, Pascal has recently appeared in a series of promotional shorts for a mobile game called Merge Mansion, and Game Informer can exclusively reveal the latest installment. Check it out below:


In this series, Pascal plays a detective named Tim Rockford, who's trying to figure out what exactly is going on with the mysterious grandma in Merge Mansion. It's an enigma so elusive that he never even says exactly what he is he's investigating, though from the collection of knives he has in his evidence room, it seems an act of violence was committed.
In a press release, Pascal had the following to say about this role.
What exactly is Tim Rockford investigating? What is grandma putting in her pies? Will Pedro Pascal become a playable character in-game? You'll have to play Merge Mansion, available on iOS and Android devices, to find out.
Which extremely high-profile actor do you think will appear in a Merge Mansion ad next? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strayed Lights is out next month on consoles and PC, but you can play it today via a new Steam demo. 
Developer Embers announced the news of this demo today during the Mix Direct Spring 2023 Showcase that aired today alongside a new trailer for the game. Strayed Lights continues to look great visually, and the action looks awesome. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Strayed Lights gameplay trailer below: 


"In Strayed Lights, you travel through otherworldly regions of misty woods, glowing ruins, and corrupted cities while pursued by eerie shadow creatures," a press release reads. "You also take on boss fights with colossal creatures wrought with unbridled emotion. Your tiny light will grow, picking up new abilities and increasing in size, before eventually evolving into a pseudo-mystical entity imbued with vivid powers. 
"Meanwhile, you'll get a glimpse at the mysteries of the surrounding world, whether through other strayed lights like yourself, or different creatures entirely. The game is set to an atmospheric soundtrack that reflects states of feeling in creatures you encounter, by Grammy-award-winning composer Austin Wintory – whose previous projects include Journey, Abzu, and The Banner Saga Series." 
As for the new Steam demo, Embers calls it a "limited time" experience so if you're interested in checking the game out, do it as soon as you can because there's no word on when the demo will no longer be available. 

"We are thrilled to be able to share our new gameplay trailer and demo with fans of Strayed Lights," Embers co-founder and creative director Alexandre Arramon writes in a press release. "We've been working hard to create a game that is both engaging and visually outstanding, and we can't wait for players to experience it for themselves." 
Strayed Lights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 25.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Layers Of Fear — recently quietly renamed from its working title Layers Of Fears — is a game that requires a bit of explanation. It shares its title with the 2016 game of the same name, and is being overseen by original developers Bloober Team. But it's neither a remake nor a reboot; although, in some ways, it's both of those things. It's more a "reimagining" of the whole Layers Of Fear series to date, as well as its apparent swansong. It incorporates ground-up remakes of the two-and-a-half existing games in the series in Unreal Engine 5, alongside a new gaiden chapter complementing the first game, and a brand-new framing narrative tying the whole lot together. 
I recently sat in on an early preview presentation of Layers Of Fear, chatting with creative director Damian Kocurek. Listeners to one very specific episode of the EWS podcast might recall that I'm something of a Layers Of Fear lore theorist, so of course I was delighted to nerd out over what this new(ish) game is all about. Similarly detail-oriented horror fans out there will hopefully share my excitement when I tell them that yes, the rats are back, and you can even catch a brief glimpse of the Rat Queen.

Last year, the studio revealed Layers of Fears, a "psychological horror chronicle built upon the foundations of the original Layers of Fear, Layers of Fear: Inheritance, and Layers of Fear 2." This new game is essentially an Unreal Engine 5 collection of Bloober Team's Layers of Fear series, unified with new elements that tie the overall story together. 
Bloober Team revealed last month that Layers of Fears is now called Layers of Fear and will release sometime this June. Now, you can check out the game in action in the new Layers of Fear gameplay trailer below:

        <updated>2023-03-17T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last November, Game Freak released Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on Switch. The game quickly became one of the top-selling games in the history of the popular console, and now, it's time for the new generation to kick off within the popular Pokémon Trading Card Game. The inaugural Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion does more than just introduce the ninth generation of Pokémon into the TCG; it also implements a whole host of changes, not the least of which is a higher price tag for most items. 
However, along with that price increase come several benefits, including a new guarantee of three foil cards in every booster pack, plus the introduction of the silver border in the U.S. and other quality-of-life improvements with regards to the designs. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to crack open and see what we could pull. While I was less frequently blown away by the big cards I pulled, this is one of the most robust galleries of "the coolest cards" articles I've done in a great many expansions. Partially, that is due to me enjoying seeing some of the newer Pokémon from Gen IX getting their first cards, but I can't help but think the increase in foil cards was to thank.
In total, the Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion introduces more than 190 new cards, including more than 10 new Pokémon ex cards, more than 30 Trainer cards, new Tera Pokémon, and tons of special-illustration Pokémon and Trainer cards. You can see the coolest cards we pulled from this expansion in the gallery below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Perfect World and developer Black Wings have revealed Persona 5: The Phantom X, a new mobile spin-off game for iOS and Android devices. It will be free-to-play and feature in-game purchases. 
There's no release date for the game yet, but a playtest will begin March 29 in China, as reported by IGN. The visuals and gameplay look quite similar to Persona 5, which isn't surprising considering Atlus, the original makers of Persona 5, are supervising The Phantom X's development.
You can watch the game's reveal trailer below: 


IGN reports that the game focuses on the theme of "desire," and that much like in Persona 5, Phantom X members will be able to enjoy a day at school, take part in after-school activities, and of course, infiltrate various palaces by way of the Metaverse. 
Check out the Persona 5: The Phantom X gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailers above, Persona 5: The Phantom X is shaping up to be a pretty faithful spin-off to Persona 5. Here's hoping we all get to go hands-on with it soon. 

In the meantime, read Game Informer's Persona 5 review and then check out our review of Persona 5 Royal. Read our Persona 5 Strikers review after that.

There are two entirely different audiences for the Resident Evil 4 remake: those who have played the original game, perhaps multiple or even dozens of times over the last 18 years, and people who have never played it, but want to know what the fuss is all about. Let's start with the former: unequivocally, if you are a fan of Resident Evil 4, you must play the remake. It's not only one of the best action games in recent m…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the run-up to its original 2005 release, Capcom was refreshingly - and publicly - clear about their intentions for Resident Evil 4. Feeling that the classic fixed-camera formula that had seen the series thrive during the 90s had grown stale, this follow-up was to be a total reinvention of survival horror as a concept. Something fresh. Dynamic. Exciting. The slate was wiped completely clean, and from that blank canvas, something exceptional was created. A game that not only redefined the franchise, but third-person action games as a whole.
For eighteen tumultuous years, Capcom has tried to surpass the success of Resident Evil 4. The fifth and sixth entries doubled down on the action to mixed results, while seven and eight focused on scares as seen from a first-person viewpoint. Meanwhile, 2019’s Resident Evil 2 remake looked to the past for its inspiration, delivering a masterful retread that blended responsive third-person combat with the exquisite production values of the series’ more modern titles. But with the release of Resident Evil 4 remake, Resident Evil has finally come full circle. Whereas the original release was a rejection of the games that came before, this remake is instead a celebration of where the series went next. Action-focused combat. Photo-realistic environments. Gooey monsters, hammy characters, ridiculous storylines. What better way to remake the highest peak of the series, than to build it upon the foundations of the very games it went on to inspire? Resident Evil 4 is a rambunctious thrill ride that is as good - if not, dare I say it, a bit better - than the original game.

The RPG prequel to The Messenger arrives on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on August 29 alongside the other versions. The developer made the announcement on its Kickstarter page, writing, 
“Since the very beginning, we were secretly hoping to be able to cover all current and previous generation consoles. With production being a world of curve balls, we had to leave the messaging at 'PC and Consoles' to avoid having to walk some things back. With the big unknowns now in the rear view, we are delighted to finally confirm the addition of Xbox to the party!”
Additionally, Sabotage revealed that Sea of Stars’ playable demo, currently available only on Switch, will make its way to other platforms later this year.
You can learn more about Sea of Stars by checking out our cover story. Sea of Stars will also be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Dying Light 2 Stay Human studio, Techland, revealed the first look at its unannounced fantasy RPG that's now in development. Now, the studio has released another conceptual look at the game. 
Back when Techland revealed it was working on this game in May of last year, it referred to the unannounced game as a "AAA open-world action-RPG in a fantasy setting." Today's new concept art features some additional details, this time with more of a focus on how the game is a narrative-driven epic. 
"We never stop improving," Techland's tweet reads. "Our newest game is set to be a narrative-driven fantasy epic with an exotic open world ready to be explored. We strive to create a compelling story-focused AAA title that combines and refines the best aspects of gameplay that Techland is known for."

As you can see in the concept art above, this still-untitled game continues to look intriguing. Here's hoping we learn more soon!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fireshine Games, the publisher behind titles like Lies of P and Dredge, has revealed Toads of the Bayou, a new turn-based tactical game coming to Early Access on PC next year. 
Toads of the Bayou is the first game from La Grange, a new studio based in France, and it brings roguelike deckbuilding, settlement-building elements, and more to the strategy genre. In the game, players will control a band of toads looking for a place to call home in the swamps of the deep south. However, in order to protect your settlement, you'll need to fend off the evil Baron Samedi. Along the way, you'll grow your toad family, create more powerful decks, build a settlement, and more across each run. 
Check out the action for yourself in the Toads of the Bayou teaser trailer below: 


"Toads of the Bayou is about combining southern gothic spookiness and the sweet taste of cartoon memories into our own take on the turn-based tactical genre," La Grange game designer Alexandre Clement writes in a press release. "The goal for us was to allow the player to establish their place in this cursed environment and make them appreciate how hard they fought and what they stood for. Nothing is ever granted in the Bayou, and thriving against the Baron's evil forces is a real achievement." 
Toads of the Bayou will hit Early Access via Steam on PC sometime in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dodgy reseller listings aside, the Steam Deck has spent its entire life thus far without even a temporary price drop. That ends today, as the Steam Spring Sale has launched with the first official Steam Deck savings - a 10% cut across the range - alongside the more expected dealsplosion of discounted games.
What’s more, this sale could also be the last time that the Steam Deck joins in a Steam sale, at least for a very long time. Lawrence Yang, a Valve designer who recently spoke to us about the Deck’s first year in the wild, has also told me that the company are "looking at this as a one-time deal in celebration of Steam Deck's anniversary." You’ll therefore have until March 23rd, when the Spring Sale ends, to seize a saving on the handheld PC before it returns to base pricing – maybe for good.
All three Steam Deck versions are part of the sale, shedding exactly 10% apiece. The 64GB model is down from £349 / $399 to £314.10 / $359.10, the 256GB model drops from £459 / $529 to £413.10 / $476.10, and the top 512GB model falls from £569 / $649 to £512.10 / $584.10. Unlike the sad old days of 2022, there’s no lengthy waiting period once you put your order in, though I wouldn’t be surprised if it takes the full two weeks of Valve’s one-to-two week delivery estimate, what with the likely surge in demand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Bethesda Softworks and developer Arkane Studios have released a new story trailer for Redfall, and it features four of the vampiric big bads we'll be battling in Massachusetts this May. 
Running nearly three and a half minutes long, this trailer shows off quite a bit of the quaint (and vampire-ridden) town of Redfall. We see our heroes in action, utilizing special abilities like invisibility, as well as a healthy dose of vampires. We also get an introduction to The Hollow Man, Bloody Tom, Miss Whisper, and the Black Sun, four vampires who appear to be at the top of the food (blood) chain in town. 
Check them out for yourself in the Redfall story trailer below: 


As you can see, this new story trailer details quite a lot about what's going on in Redfall. There are hints at the corporation behind it all, the types of vampires we'll be facing off against, many of the locales we'll be shooting our way through, and much more. 
For more about the game, check out the Redfall developer deep dive held back in January, and then watch this trailer from October that invites you to a bloody night on the town. After that, read our Redfall preview for details on how you and your friends will take back the city this summer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Sumo Digital and publisher Gun Interactive announced its asymmetric multiplayer game, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, during The Game Awards in 2021, and we came away impressed with what we played of it back in September. However, when we'd all be able to play the game together remained an unknown – until today. 
Sumo Digital announced via an exclusive reveal with IGN that The Texas Chain Saw Massacre will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 18, 2023. The studio also announced that a technical test would be held on May 25, 2023, before the game's launch later this year.
Check out the official Texas Chain Saw Massacre release date trailer for yourself below: 


Eligibility details for the upcoming technical test will be released by Gun Interactive and Sumo Digital on social media, so tune in there if you're interested. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Texas Chain Saw Massacre preview to find out our thoughts on the game after going hands-on with it.

What are some of the bad launches we remember? What part do we play in this ecosystem? Are we just doomed to get bad PC ports for the next few years, or is this going to happen forever now.
Plus, a terrifying Tower Of Jocularity that challenges us to know when games came out (we do quite well, I think), the games we've been playing right now, and a trio of movie recommendations.

Since then, the studio have been tight-lipped about their current projects, an “online fantasy RPG” and their mysterious James Bond game - until now.

Cut to a couple of weeks after release and I’m having an absolute whale of a time in Endnight Games’ survival horror - and it’s all thanks to sweet, succulent blueberries.
It all started when I learned that Sons Of The Forest has a peaceful mode, which completely removes all the gross, yucky cannibals, leaving you to grapple with survival in relative peace and quiet. The first time I met up with Kelvin and we got to work, casually making our shitty shelter and stick storage, I perused the guidebook to see what’s next, and I spotted a planter. A planter? Okay, so I assume you can plant seeds and grow food, then? That’s really co-WAIT, wait, wait. You're telling me this is basically a farming sim?

        <updated>2023-03-16T13:06:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has revealed that it has acquired 12 classic arcade properties, including Berzerk and its sequel, Frenzy. 
Strangely, though, Atari did not reveal all 12 properties that it has acquired. In the press release announcing the news, the company only lists Berzerk and Frenzy. Atari simply says it has acquired a "dozen retro arcade games" so it's likely the other 10 properties are from the same era of arcade games as Berzerk and Frenzy. 
"Atari...announced today the acquisition of a dozen retro arcade games, including the '80s classics Berzerk and Frenzy," the press release reads. "Atari will seek to expand digital and physical distribution of the classic titles, create new games based on the IPs, and explore brand and merchandising collaborations."
Atari says Berzerk is "a top-down, multidirectional shooter designed by Alan McNeil that was released for arcades in 1980." It's perhaps best known for being the first arcade video game with speech synthesis. Following its arcade release, Berzerk was ported to the Atari 2600 and Atari 5200 by the console maker. Frenzy is actually a sequel to Berzerk first released in 1982. 
"Berzerk is one of those foundational games that so many people first encountered playing on an Atari console," Atari CEO Wade Rosen writes in the press release. "Berzerk, and the other titles included in this acquisition, are a perfect fit for our strategy of commercializing classic retro IP."
Who knows if we'll learn what the other 10 retro arcade properties Atari has acquired are – only time will tell. In the meantime, read Game Informer's review of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration.

At launch, Sims would go from nascent babies to walking, talking kids, skipping the infant years that teach them, for example, how to talk in Simlish, although that does sound like baby talk too. The new expansion adds a lot to Sim’s life stages, but the real show stealer here is a pesky bug that elongates babies. Yes, you read that correctly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Steam Deck client update has added Valve’s local network game transfers feature – previously only available in beta form – to the Stable branch, marking a full launch for one of the most useful Steam Deck feature upgrades in months.


If you missed the local transfers beta release last month, know that the name is quite literal: it lets you transfer Steam game installs between your PC and your Steam Deck over a local network, rather than having to re-download them onto every device you own. It also works when transferring between a Steam Deck and another Steam Deck, or between two PCs. Valve have a little explainer here, but it’s simple enough that – for example – hitting the Install button for a game on your Steam Deck will automatically detect if your PC is on the same network, and start transferring as much as it can from the desktop instead of downloading the whole thing from scratch.


You can even opt into sending/receiving game data from PCs and Steam Decks owned by other people, so long as they’re also connected to the same local network. The biggest benefit seemingly comes to those with monthly data caps (morning, Yanks), as these transfers won’t usually involve any extra downloads. Even so, it’s a helpful addition for anyone on all-you-can-eat data as well, since local transfers are much faster than old fashioned installs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heed my words, dear reader: Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo is best played if you go in knowing nothing about it. Zilch, zero, nada. Its twists and turns from the get-go have my brain doing mental gymnastics, not just in the game but in trying to figure out how to write around them for this review. I’m not going to spoil everything, but keeping your expectations completley wide open lets Paranormasight snake right on in and surprise you when you least expect it to. 
Here’s a quick elevator pitch: Paranormasight is a Squeenix-developed horror mystery visual novel about deadly rituals, ghost stories, curses, and the occult. Its subversive approach to classic visual novel staples make its puzzles feel smart and its horror scares hit hard. If you’re a fan of the thrills found in the Danganronpa and Zero Escape games, Paranormasight is like a bite-sized version of those two behemoths. It’s short, smart, and will keep you on your toes until the end.
So yeah, if that sounds like your thing, then have at it. From here on in, I'm going to be gabbing abut it in-depth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Need for Speed Unbound brought high-octane races chockful of adrenaline-fueled police chases to create the best racing game of the year, according to our 2022 end-of-year awards. Today, developer Criterion Games and publisher Electronic Arts announced Need for Speed Unbound – Volume 2, a title update that delivers new race types, rides, upgrades, events, challenges, cosmetics, and ways to interact with friends.
Need for Speed Unbound – Volume 2 aims to give players fresh ways to storm the streets of Lakeshore and compete. This update, which represents the first in a series of post-launch updates, introduces additional Endurance Events, new Rumble Races, and the ability to provoke cops into multiplayer chases with your friends. Volume 2 also adds 40 new challenges, including 3 new daily challenges to earn rewards like experience and money. 
New 30-second Hot Laps circuits are one way to race against the clock to earn new rewards, while Playlist Events offer more variety and major rewards like a Custom Lotus Emira Balmain Edition. Rewards in Volume 2 include new driving effects, poses, stickers, and more. You can see the trailer for the announcement below:


This update also adds the option to purchase the marked locations of all 100 Bears, 80 Street Arts, 80 Billboards, and 160 activities on your map for $5. That premium DLC unlock also includes an exclusive "Fury and Zen" clothing pack, which features a jacket, t-shirt, sweatpants, and cap.
Need for Speed Unbound – Volume 2 arrives on March 21 for all versions of the base game. For more on Need for Speed Unbound, check out our review here.]]></summary>

A mere week after being announced Before The Green Moon snuck past us and launched into full release. Just yesterday, in fact.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know you all like Hardspace: Shipbreaker, and I get that on paper it is very much my type of game. It is a manual job (slicing up spaceships for salvage) with an extra layer (unionism) to elevate it far beyond what it could have gotten away with. In this way it seems a lot like my beloved PowerWash Simulator (washing things; time travel).
The main thrust of the game I can really get behind - peeling apart big metal ships like clanky onions - but the more literal thrust, i.e. the moving around in zero gravity using a jetpack, is awful. I need you to give me a frame of reference for if you all felt this way at the start, because, genuinely, I am so bad at Hardspace: Shipbreaker that it makes me want to cry.

You know I have a tendency to get emotionally invested in games with photo modes (one might say too invested, in the case of my Death Stranding BB Boys road trip diary), and yep, you couldn't have predicted a more likely turn of events if you tried. Because yes, instead of bopping along to its excellent, punchy rhythm action combat and, you know, actually playing the damn thing, I've spent most of my early hours with Hi-Fi Rush fiddling about with image sliders and lining up Chai and best video game cat bot 808 into daft, stupid poses for the sake of a good screenshot. But hot damn, what a great game it is all the same.

The question comes courtesy of Fachewachewa, who asked: What's the worst thing you've done for an achievement? Or more generally, a time you were focused on a specific goal in a game, reached it (or gave up), and after, looked back and thought, "Why did I do that?" 
Why, indeed. Come and find out which achievements have spawned our biggest gaming regrets, and why not tell us about your own gaming follies in the comments? We can all wallow in our foolishness together.

That could still be the case in NCSoft's Project G, but it looks like it's delivering the kind of massive-scale warfare that should be inherent to the genre.

Long-running living games are complicated beasts to wrangle and expand in new directions. After so many years, game modes, prior changes, and unique audience groups, a game like Destiny 2 must cater to many masters. That challenge is keenly felt with Destiny 2’s latest expansion. Lightfall is the penultimate chapter in the storytelling arc that has been underway since the original game’s launch in 2014. It misses the mark as a narrative and in a few other key ways. But as a gradual evolution of what has come …]]></summary>

PlayStation and Citizen Sleeper developer, Jump Over The Age, who is actually just solo developer Gareth Damian Martin, announced this today in a new PlayStation Blog post. The game will launch with all of its DLC on PlayStation, including Episode 1: Flux, Episode 2: Refuge, and the upcoming Episode 3: Purge. 
I reviewed Citizen Sleeper last year, giving it a 9 out of 10 and calling it a Game Informer Must Play game. You can find out why in my review here. It was also in Game Informer's top 10 games of 2022, and you can read about where we placed it here.

For those keeping score, this announcement also acts as another delay, as System Shock had been scheduled to release this month. The game will be available first on Steam, The Epic Store, and GOG for $39.99, while the PlayStation and Xbox versions will release at an unspecified later date. 
System Shock has been in the works in some form since at least 2016, beginning life as a crowd-funded passion project that aims to revitalize the 1994 classic. The remake overhauls the adventure with modernized graphics and controls, a redesigned UI, and more, but the villainous A.I. SHODAN is still voiced by her original performer.

We've seen gameplay, the reveal of Nina Williams' return, and just last week, we learned Paul Phoenix would be riding into Tekken 8 as well. 
Now, Bandai Namco has revealed that Marshall Law will be in the Tekken 8 roster in a new gameplay trailer. Marshall Law was introduced to the series in the very first Tekken game and he's been in quite a few since, including the most recent release in the franchise, Tekken 7. If you're familiar with this fighter, his heavy-hitting combos return in Tekken 8, if this new gameplay trailer is anything to go on. 
Check out the Marshall Law gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


Tekken 8 does not yet have a release date but when it does launch, it will do so on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. For more information about the game, head to Game Informer's Tekken 8 hub.

Few games in recent memory etched a permanent smile on my face the way Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon has. This prequel to the Bayonetta series rewrites its mature-rated stylish combat within the whimsical pages of a storybook, spinning an endearing yarn of a young witch fighting to prove herself while forming an unlikely friendship. The result is an eye-catching, unexpectedly dense adventure that has more charm than it knows what to do with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft announced last year that the hit Norse survival game, Valheim, would come to Xbox last year, but it was then delayed. Now, Valheim is finally available on Xbox, and you can download it via Xbox Game Pass starting today, too. 
That means you can play Valheim on PC via PC Game Pass, Steam, Microsoft, Humble Stores, and Xbox consoles starting today. Valheim is still coming together in early access on PC, and that remains the case on console as it's part of the equivalent Xbox Game Preview program. The game became really popular in 2021 for its unique setting within the survival genre. And simply put, the game's a great time, too.
Check it out in the Xbox release date trailer below: 


If you're hopping into Valheim today, be sure to check out our list of the best Valheim mods and then check out this impressive magic mod that brings some Skyrim flavor to the game. After that, read about the aftermath of success as it relates to Valheim in this exclusive feature.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo IV, the long-awaited follow-up to 2012's Diablo III, will finally release this June, but it sounds like it won't be launching on Xbox Game Pass. 
That's because Blizzard's Diablo general manager, Rod Fergusson, recently revealed on Twitter that there are currently "no plans" to bring the upcoming game to Game Pass, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Presumably, people have been speculating that the game might come to Game Pass as Blizzard Entertainment and Xbox are close to teaming up by way of Microsoft's pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 
It's awesome seeing the excitement around the Diablo IV Beta, and our Wolf Pack puppy! We’ve been getting some questions about D4 on Game Pass and I want to let you know we have no plans for that. See you in Sanctuary during the Beta Early Access weekend starting on March 17!
March 13, 2023
As you can see in Fergusson's tweet above, there's no plans for Diablo IV to come to Game Pass. But Diablo IV is out June 6; perhaps there's time for plans to change (although I'm not betting on it, personally). 
In the meantime, if you preorder the game, you can hop into a closed beta starting tomorrow, March 17. That closed period runs until March 19 and then starting March 24, there will be an open beta that anyone can jump into. It runs until March 26. 
While waiting for these betas, read Game Informer's exclusive guided tour through Diablo IV's Sanctuary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To track the public understanding of modern-day indie gaming is to look at the small-scale independent development scene through an Anglo-centric lens. While it would be unfair to ignore the hobbyists programming experiences in BASIC on their ZX Spectrum or similar, it’s commonly accepted that indie gaming as we recognise it today has its roots in the early days of the internet and the Y2K boom, when Flash, Gamemaker Studio and similar tools allowed things like Cave Story and N to grow. With online distribution further helping games like Bastion, Journey and World Of Goo to flourish, the definition of the indie game became: a title with big ambitions and creativity grown from small budgets and teams.


It's not entirely wrong, but it has obscured decades of hobby development that was once at the forefront - not just the stories of BBC Micro solo-development stars, but similar ones of hobby development from around the world. In Japan, the doujin markets of Comiket and beyond serve as a home for hobbyists to make, sell and share their creations. It is the doujin gaming scene that helped major studios like Fate/ studio Type-Moon, and franchises like 07th Expansion and Touhou Project, flourish in a way that would never be possible otherwise.

Last week, I was given a preview build of the upcoming first-person zombie-smasher and played about the first five hours of it in single-player, taking in sights like a community of gated millionaire mansions, a slightly less palacious but still ridiculous neighbourhood, and an upmarket hotel styled after the famous Beverly Hills Hotel. They're all full of weird stuff.
There's a panic room where a guy turned into a zombie mid-demo tape recording. Actress Emma, who you're battening down the hatches with, has a truly awful full-length Burt Reynoldsian portrait of herself. A shared house called the GOAT PEN, where a team of influencers all live together, has a set for a video series called LIT OR SH!T, and a whiteboard with the script for an apology video. I ask the game director David Stenton if it's low hanging fruit, or if there's no such thing with Hollywood rich people. "Of course, it's low hanging fruit!" he says, laughing. "And also, there's no such thing."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fan-favorite fighter Paul Phoenix has punched his ticket (among other things) for Tekken 8, and he’s so excited that he’s let his hair down for the first time in years. 
A new trailer shows off Paul’s new look and familiar offense of dishing out powerful, flame-licked punches. At one point, he flexes his bicep so hard that it makes the sleeve of his leather jacket explode off of his arm. He also rides his motorcycle into battle, which is pretty cool and reemphasizes that he is, in fact, a biker. Paul joins previously announced fighters such as Kazuya, Jin, Nina, and others. 


Tekken 8 doesn’t have a release date, but there’s a solid chance it’s arriving later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year our project was accepted to the Google Summer of Code program for the eighth year in a row (and 16th time in total).
The intention of the program is to bring new contributors to open source projects, and the eligibility rules for participants are the same as last year, with both students and non-students welcome to participate. Check the  Google Summer of Code website for details of eligibility.
Participants can apply for either short tasks (about 175 hours) or long tasks (about 350 hours). The coding period typically runs from the start of June to the end of August, but there is some flexibility and the participants can opt to use a longer coding period if they are not available to work full time on the project during the summer.
ScummVM is looking for applicants! A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we’re open to your own ideas too. Please make sure you provide the required information in your application before submitting. We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, and get advice and help on getting started with the project and writing your application.
We have gathered some information to guide you, based on our previous 15 years of experience in the program. You may start your exploration from our Google Summer of Code miniportal.
We are looking forward to your application and participation!
