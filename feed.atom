        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It feels like it wasn’t so long ago that I was playing Duck Detective: The Secret Salami, but already we’re hearing of a new game from Happy Broccoli Games, Duck Detective: The Ghost of Glamping. It’s coming in 2025.


Oh, right. I just remembered what “glamping” is: glamorous camping. The opposite of roughing it. This time around, things get a little supernatural, as the detective investigates a haunting at the campgrounds. The trailer also makes a big deal about his bread addiction and related divorce. Poor guy. How else is he supposed to make sandwiches?




As the name implies, you play as a duck P.I. named Eugene McQuacklin, who investigates things. You gather clues, then put them together to make a clear picture of what went down and make some “deducktions.” Last time, it was an office theft that blew up into a bigger case, which is relatively mundane compared to hauntings. I’m wondering if it’s going to be one of those rubber mask Scooby Doo situations.


To be honest, I didn’t dig The Secret Salami all that much. It was fine. Mostly, I felt that the worldbuilding, characters, and dialogue could have been better, which is all things that can be improved in a sequel. It’s not surprising to see one so soon since it’s likely that Happy Broccoli Games have all their tools together and learned lessons from the last project. I’m just hoping that The Ghost of Glamping has a bit more meat on its bones.


Duck Detective: The Ghost of Glamping will release on PC sometime in 2025.

While he didn't specify what his new role at the studio is, he's most likely going to keep working as an artist, possibly even as an art director, in one of its upcoming games.

We also have a rule that each game can only be nominated for one category, so if you don’t see something here, we may have stuck it in with a console-specific one if it feels like a better fit.

This means you and many others might be entitled to receive a refund, so let's find out how to get it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pity the "relaxing" games which set out to blanket their players in a wholesome fog. These minimalist or slight experiences set their stall against the mainstream philosophy of video game design focused on action, rules, clear progression, and often violence. So it is with Naiad, a sometimes pleasant swim down a river in which you sing to make flowers grow and discover poems by interacting with birds, bees, butterflies and other fauna. 

Yet here's the cause of my pity. All those other games, with their decisive action, systemic consequence, and neck-snapping: I was playing those to relax, too. Why else would I have snapped all those necks? Being shorn of base pleasures does not make Naiad a restorative oasis amid a desert of stressful video games, and it doesn't make it more relaxing than its peers. In fact, it makes for an experience that left me restless, even a little anxious, when it made me feel anything at all.

Whichever it is, Little Rocket Lab is a factory-builder about efficiently placing conveyors and robot arms, and is drawn in the warm, pixel art small-town of a Stardew-like. That sounds like a fitting combination, although it does mean you're building a NASA-sized rocketship on the outskirts of your quaint hometown. That can't be good for noise pollution.

In my 30 hours spent so far on the full launch, I have decided to switch to the role purely because nobody else will. While Duelists and Vanguards have been getting all the love, Strategists can completely change the tide of battle if they know how to play the characters well. You can pick between seven characters at present, and here's how I will rank them based on their abilities and performance.

This fantasy co-op adventure launched on Steam back in September but will be making the jump over to Switch on 23rd January 2025. It looks to offer a more accessible entry point into the world of D&D, but it still has all the hallmarks of choose-your-own-adventure dice rolling to ensure that no newcomers miss out too much.

This is Beraldo's first special card in this year's Ultimate Team, and he will be a great fit in Ligue 1 based sides. To do that, you'll have to obtain the item first, and let's take a look at how you can finish both tasks without spending a lot of coins. 


EA FC 25 Lucas Beraldo Ultimate Succession SBC tasks


The Lucas Beraldo Ultimate Succession SBC has two tasks, and here are the conditions.


Task 1 - Top Form



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 82



Task 2 - 84-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 84



EA FC 25 Lucas Beraldo Ultimate Succession SBC solutions


Here's a set of solution you can use to complete the latest Ultimate Succession challenge in Ultimate Team. 


Task 1 - Top Form



Any 10 82-rated items


Any 81-rated TOTW item



Task 2 - 84-Rated Squad



Benzema 86


Lukaku 82


Smalling 82


Jonsdottir 82


Zubimendi 81


Sellner 82


Hagering 82


Lohmann 82


de Ligt 84


Reiten 88


Ake 84



The Beraldo SBC is well-worth the completion price. The card isn't 'crazy broken' by any stretch of imagination, but he's extremely affordable. He can play in a couple of positions, and also offers the Fullback+ role, but it's better to play him as a LB. 


He also offers the Anticipate, Jockey, Whipped Cross, and Pinged Pass playstyles, which makes him a really well-rounded choice. We are getting evolutions that often include 86-rated items, so there's a great scope to upgrade this card in the near future. If you can complete the challenge for free, you should look to get this card.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals, the free-to-play hero shooter from NetEase, launched late last week and is exceedingly popular. It's currently fourth on the Steam daily most played, right between Path Of Exile 2 and the evergreen Grand Theft Auto 5. I think there are three reasons for this enthusiasm: 1) it's free-to-play with the usual comet's tail of microtransactables 2) it's third-person Overwatch with Marvel characters, a straightforwardly enticing licensing sandwich, and 3) people want to have sex with a larger-than-usual proportion of the cast and especially awful tongue-monster Venom, who has a good butt in this one. No, I'm not going to share pictures. You'll have to google that filth yourself.


But perhaps you are a sophisticated soul who has no time for such salacious nonsense. You're more interested in hearing how they're patching the thing. Enough with the butts already, dang it - this is a new multiplayer game so there must, of course, be patches! Fair enough: here's what NetEase are changing or fixing in the first major update, out now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Manual labour.
Uncle Chop's Rocket Shop is a roguelite fix-'em-up that combines the frantic buttons-and-levers work of Space Team and the chaotic manual-flipping of Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes with the repetitive, greasy work of car mechanics. You are the sole useful employee of the titular Rocket Shop, a podunk space garage that looks like it would serve roaches in the instant coffee and use spit to polish headlights, and it is your job to fix the spaceships that come into the shop each day.
Every ship has a bunch of broken modules. Some are easy to understand, like Fuel, Oil, Headlights, and Star Maps, and some take a turn into absurdity, like Tomfoolery, VR, and the Rebreather, which sounds like it might be straightforward but is actually full of snails and pancakes.

Golden Fruit is one of the four major crafting materials that you’re going to need in order to craft the Wishful Aurosa Miracle Outfit. It is used when creating the dress of the Outfit, which is arguably the most important part, so you’ll need to track it down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel guilty about repeatedly comparing Nebulous: Fleet Command to Homeworld, inasmuch as it's an appalling bait-and-switch. It's like offering somebody a cake that is actually a cunningly painted hunk of torpedo fuselage. It's like offering to shake hands while wearing one of those comedy hand buzzers - except that the hand buzzer is an intricate simulation of zero-G physics, missile behaviours and comms jamming, featuring spacecraft with proper internal layouts that require you to think hard about attitude control if you don't want, say, your engines to become Swiss cheese about 90 seconds before you need to retreat from combat. 


Being a "true" 3D real-time space strategy game, Nebulous looks and sounds a lot like Homeworld on the surface, but it's nothing like as straightforward. It is systems within systems. It is a game in which you can, theoretically, plot the path of a single guided munition through an asteroid field, so as to catch an enemy cruiser in the back. I barely understand how to make a ship fire on another ship, using plain old armour-piercing shells, and now they're threatening to add carriers, fighters and bombers. Customisable ones! The humanity. Here's a trailer.

They're especially concerned because Rockstar still hasn't announced an official date for the game, and nobody is really sure if it's going to make its deadline or if the studio will delay it to 2026.

How to get Trial Coins in Path of Exile 2


The Trial of Sekhamas (Act 2) and the Trial of Chaos (Act 3) are both trials that require their own respective coin to enter. These coins are similar to the ones you used to go through each trial for the first time. The first one was given for free, but to enter either of these trials more, you will need to get your own. Fortunately and unfortunately, getting these coins is a very simple task, but they are quite rare.

It's that time of the year when in the middle of our personal GOTY list scrambles we sit back for a couple of hours to enjoy Geoff Keighley's annual round-up. For the last 10 years, though it's presented as a gong show and celebration, The Game Awards has essentially been a multiplatform conference, a platform for the big three, big third parties, and big indies to come together and get a trailer broadcast to the masses as holiday season approaches.
Say what you like, but you've got to give it to Keighley - it's a big production and pulling off a show of that scale is a hell of a job. Juggling all those names and trying to squeeze in enough variety to showcase the enormous breadth of the industry is no mean feat - and it's been a bumpy ride.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I received a penny for every time I did a post about a Doom or Doom 2 mod, I'd probably have enough to buy at least a loaf of bread. That may not sound impressive, but bread can be expensive these days, so that would easily equate to a couple hundred posts. It's still a fair amount for one person.


The point is that I've found another one. This one hits closer to home, as it pertains to a dystopian version of my home country, England. Also, the dystopian premise. That checks out as well. Over on ModDB, user chazlee is bringing us "Bolero," a dark take on ol' Blighty, with plenty of "urban dismay and raw insanity" to boot.


Image via chazlee/ModDB.


Taking on "Cannibals, Cultists, Nazi Bikers," and more in this Doom 2 mod, this is very much going for a leather-clad 1970s vibe, which is not quite my era, but I'm here for it all the same.


Dance, dance the Bolero


Sadly, "Bolero" is not yet out, with the download page simply having it down as TBD for its release date. For now, the images on ModDB will have to suffice, although it's hard to know what to expect from screenshots. But I do like the dark purple sky and biker gang vibe I get from what I assume is a title image.


Hopefully, it won't be too long until it's out. We all know the old Doom games inside and out by now, so it's always interesting to see the ways in which the fan base keeps tinkering with the original. It's no wonder we keep talking about the games. Or at least I do.


Add onto that all the bizarre ways Doom has been ported, which includes a version of it on Nintendo's Alarmo device and even placed within the cutesy world of Stardew Valley. Seriously, if I ever get sick of talking about the mods for these classic id Software games, know that I have been taken over by some sort of sentient amoeba*.


*"So what else is new!" Says the funniest person in the room.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After 12 years of waiting, fans must have been quite delighted to see Path of Exile 2 finally drop on PC and console the other day. According to the game's Steam page, Grinding Gears' follow-up to its popular action RPG is going down a storm so far. In fact, it's hitting some pretty big numbers, according to recent data.


As always, we turn our attention to SteamDB – the third-party website that tracks all things related to Valve's gaming platform. Despite the fact that Path of Exile 2 has only been out a few days, it's already racked up 578,569 players on PC, with over 498,000 getting involved in the past 24 hours.




This is even more impressive when you realize the game's out in early access. Of course, it's been on more than a few people's radars, so it stands to reason that hype may be part of the reason we're seeing such impressive figures so soon after the early access launch. To say nothing of the number of console players who must have logged in.


The path continues


At the time of writing, Path of Exile 2 is at the number two spot on Steam's Top Sellers chart, though this is pretty typical for new releases. However, I'm pretty sure I saw it at number one yesterday, having temporarily knocked the Steam Deck from its pedestal. But it seems normal service has resumed.


Work is obviously still ongoing, and the developer recently said in a post on X that a hotfix is on the way. This small update will make it so "Raging Spirits can only summon 5 Raging Spirits per cast at all levels." The team also says it will be "making adjustments to other Trigger Meta-Gems," so keep an eye out for that.


Another post on X says Grinding Gears has been keeping an eye on feedback, and has been pleased with how the launch over the weekend went. Keep doing what you're doing, I guess, if you're currently playing and enjoying Path of Exile 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the biggest power spikes you can have in Path of Exile 2 occurs when you properly equip your skills with potent Support Gems. At the start, you're limited to only two per skill, but it is possible to get more as you play through the game.


So here's how to get more Support Gem Sockets in Path of Exile 2. 


How to earn Support Gem Sockets in Path of Exile 2


Support Gems are special gems that can only be slotted into one of your equipped skills. They allow you to customize your skills, allowing for crazy and wacky setups that are actually quite potent when tested. You'll want to kit out your favorite skills that define your build, but access to only two slots makes that difficult. 


To get Support Gem Sockets, all you need to do is get lucky. Not kidding. A special currency called a Jeweler Orb can drop from any enemy you encounter. When used on a skill, it permanently unlocks an additional support socket for that skill only. You cannot undo this action, so think carefully before using one. Jeweler Orbs are not exactly common.


Depending on where you are in your socket progression, you will need to use either a Lesser Jeweler Orb or a Greater Jeweler Orb. Lesser orbs are for skills stuck at two slots, while Greaters are beyond that point. You'll start seeing Jeweler Orbs drop minimally starting in Act 3, and increasing in commonality as you progress (they are never 'common', however).

If you cast your mind back to earlier this year, you might recall that a man was arrested in Japan for selling modded data from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Well, it's clear that not everyone was paying attention to the repercussions, as last week, Japanese police announced that they had arrested a man on similar charges for meddling with Pokémon Sun (thanks, Automaton West).
In this instance, the culprit (a 32-year-old man from Saitama) was caught selling hacked save data from the Gen VII game for 5,200 yen (around £27 / $35) each, putting him in violation of Japan's Unfair Competition Prevention Act — which could earn him up to five years in prison or slapped with a fine of up to five million yen. Yikes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Set in a world where piracy is at an all-time high, it isn't surprising that One Piece has plenty of powerful warriors. While the addition of whacky Devil Fruit abilities makes the power struggle between the major factions far more intense, some characters rely on swordsmanship to dominate the high seas. This then raises the question of who the strongest swordsman in One Piece is.


Before jumping into the list, let's clear something up first. I only included characters who use swords as their primary weapons. Furthermore, their fighting style should be swordsmanship primarily. In that sense, Big Mom, while being one of the strongest characters who uses a sword, doesn't qualify for the list. For discussion's sake, the list will also include characters in their prime state.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[London Gatwick Airport is a rare shade of brown, known to neither science nor art. A brown that doesn’t appear on the light spectrum. No easel contains it. It is a dusty brown, a damp brown, a hot and earthy brown that hums with the stinging malodour of disturbed ancient moss where once old forests stood. Descending into Gatwick’s cloying brown from 33,000 feet is like flying under and up Gandalf’s wretched cloak and landing in one of the several horrible little magic pouches he keeps by his balls.
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 captures Gatwick’s brown perfectly. Next to the stupefying natural beauty of Yosemite, the imposing imperial skyscrapers of the Manhattan skyline and the surging majesty of the Alpine peaks, this local rot-tinged patch of West Sussex is the most impressively realistic depiction of a place I have seen in a game.

Last week, we saw what appeared to be the very first 'Switch 2' accessories appearing on the market in China. Ever keen to one-up itself, the 'Switch 2' rumour mill has today thrown up something even juicier: the first 'picture' of the console... if you really, really squint.
All this stems from accessory manufacturer Satisfye and its new trailer for the upcoming Switch grip, the 'ZenGrip 2'. According to the company's website, the upcoming accessory is designed "for Next-Gen Console", so how else would you showcase it in a reveal trailer other than by sticking a definitely real 'Switch 2' in there?

No, you don't have to spend any real money to activate this, and it's not something you have to unlock. This is just something the game has but doesn't tell you about.

It's basic physics. In this case, I was on holiday from Friday through Monday, and this fact and this fact alone appears to have coaxed some toy manufacturer into taking the internet's most cherished indie gaming platform offline by means of a "bogus" phishing report, sent by "AI-powered" brand protection software.
The situation has now been resolved, thankfully, and you can access Itch.io as normal, but I will never pass up the opportunity to cast shade on Funko Pop, whose NFT-garlanded bobbleheads I hate as I do veruccas and forest fires. So here's a quick recap if you, too, missed the drama.

In 2024, the Switch's transfer speeds leave a lot to be desired, but that might be one of the wrinkles Nintendo is hoping to iron out with 'Switch 2', if the speculation surrounding a new job listing is to be believed (thanks, Gameranx).
Yep, the latest chatter from the 'Switch 2' rumour mill is all about microSD cards, specifically, Samsung's upcoming 'SD Express' cards, which the company revealed earlier this year. Samsung claims that these microSDs can reach transfer speeds of up to 800 MB/S — a noticeable bump on the current Switch's 60 MB/S on the branded SanDisk cards and 150 MB/S max on the SanDisk SDXC card — and it looks like Nintendo is hoping to support it in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve got a strange relationship with the stealth sandbox murderbox that is Hitman: World of Assassination. If you were to ask me to list my favourite games, the latest Hitman trilogy would be in the top five, no question. And yet, I must have gotten intimidated at some point with the amount of new updates and all the spiffy unlockable suits I was missing out on, and just haven’t touched it in a couple of years now. Is the appearance of Jean-Claude Van Damme as the game’s newest elusive target enough to reel me back in? I'm not sure, but I will say that I doubt Sean Bean can stretch his legs like that, even with the legendary flexibility offered by O2's famously variable plans. Here’s a trailer.

In the writing of this single article, I will use them for links, HTML code, and other ephemera. I even copied McLuhan’s name across from a different tab, which I’m sure he’d appreciate/be horrified by. I love those shortcuts. I need them. They are the wind beneath my wings, and the crud buildup beneath the bottom left of my keyboard.
I cannot say how the first tailor to gaze upon a sewing machine felt, nor the first egg-abacus attendant to behold the sorcerous ticking of the automated egg timer. But I think now that when they saw those things, they were afraid. As I am afraid now.

Ahead of the grand opening of Super Nintendo World: Donkey Kong Country this week, some of the original Donkey Kong Country development team spoke to VGC about the IP being adapted to an entire theme park.
During the same chat, artist Steve Mayles - who helped co-found Playtonic Games (Yooka-Laylee) and create the Kong family, admitted he would "very much" like to work on another DKC game. It's now been "30 years" since he worked on the original entry. He also mentioned how happy he was to see the characters he created being "given such love after all this time".

Early stages soon lose any real sense of surprise, and later ones can feel low on real agency. I want a new roguelike run to feel vital and verdant; heady with grand plans and plan-shattering twists. But by having randomness influence each run so significantly, Mystery Dungeon feels fickle instead of emergent - less than the sum of some incredibly novel and creative parts.

Nintendo and The Pokémon Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the Palworld developer Pocketpair in September of this year.
In a notable development, Pocketpair has now released an update for Palworld which changes the Pokémon-like throwing mechanic in the game. As detailed in the latest v0.3.11 patch notes, "player-owned Pals" are now always summoned "near the player". In other words, you can no longer summon Pals with Pal Spheres in certain spots on the map.

We are barrelling towards the release date of Donkey Kong Country Returns HD on 16th January 2025 and, with a little over a month to go, Nintendo has revealed the game's opening cutscene in all of its remastered glory.

Well, you'll know by the end of the week, as the studio is planning to reveal this at Geoff Keighley's winter festival of expensive advertising, the Game Awards. However, there may already be some clues in a trailer they've just released, which suggests some sisterful slapping is overdue. The trailer also promises new moves for all characters in a Season 2 update next spring, along with some minor presents in a winter update due sooner than that. But yes, come see for yourself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not just because he's a Nazi. It's because he's a smartass Nazi. As the main antagonist in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, Emmerich Voss vacates the archetypal armchair usually reserved for secondary fascist goons, so that he can goosestep straight into the big boy seat himself. He smiles with all the sleaze of right-hand-man Major Toht, the grubby gestapo who gets that right hand burned in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet he also engages in the pseudo-intellectual trash talk of the main archaeological rivals to Jones, like Rene Belloq or Walter Donovan. He is a hideous grab bag of all the things that make an instantly detestable villain in the series. But there's something else. Voss is so immediately and gutturally hateable because he resembles a type of racist encountered not in the 1930s, but one you've probably met today: the asshole you meet on the internet.
Warning: Here be spoilers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The only sound that greets you upon booting up Eclipsium is a loudly throbbing heart. As one must when encountering horror media, the game and I immediately enter a spiritual staring contest, each of us knowing the real game here was it trying to freak me out. "It’s fine", I decided. "It’s just a heart! I’ve got a heart. It’s actually very useful. Nothing to be scared of". Thing is, Eclipsium’s menu heart is actually massive and sits, like The Eye Of Sauron, atop a giant obelisk. “Ah. That’s definitely a horror thing, that” I was forced to admit. "If my heart was on a giant obelisk, I’d be proper shaken up, I reckon."
So starts Eclipsium’s very first bit of aggressive disorientation, and it basically just escalates from there. I obviously can’t describe the vibes without slightly spoiling the vibes, so do pop over to Steam for a demo if you’re curious and, oh, there’s a potted plant, the sound of its rustling mixed in such a way that it sort of sounds like it’s shrieking at me. Well.

Haven’t I seen this exact genre of little guy before?” was my reaction upon encountering the yellow-eyed, hat-shrouded mage of isometric adventure Oolo. Some quick internet sleuthing turned up this lovely bit of art featuring Final Fantasy 9’s Vivi, Journey’s Traveller, and He-Man’s Orko. It’s a great feeling to begin your week identifying an archetype of diminutive magician, and I hope it becomes a regular occurrence. Another pleasant  discovery was Oolo itself, which you can discover yourself through the shrouded magic of this link to it’s free demo.
(Do I need to keep writing ‘free demo’, by the way? I tend to alternate. It’s obviously redundant but I feel writing ‘free’ gives it a certain gravitas. Free tax rebate. Free sunrise. Free oxygen. It makes things sound better.)

No, the Maw's penchant remains for new PC game releases, and thankfully, they are as thick on the ground as reindeer pelts.

U zrodu tohoto počinu stálo elektronické hudební duo Daft Punk, které v roce 2001 vydalo své album "Discovery". K písničkám z alba vyšly animované videoklipy, které produkoval Leidži Macumoto, což byl kultovní japonský výtvarník (zemřel loni), který měl na svém kontě mnoho animovaných seriálů, především ze 70. - 80. let (nejslavnější z nich byl asi "Space Battleship Yamato"). Daft Punk ho oslovili proto, že na jeho seriálech vyrůstali, takže výsledné dílo, včetně "jednodušší" retro animace a naivní zápletky zcela záměrně připomíná staré japonské televizní počiny (n…]]></summary>

The news warrants an informed conversation about creators' rights and how the judicial system has sharpened its response to piracy. However, until evidence is produced to the contrary, the story should be stamped "propaganda" and noted for an offense of its own: a distraction from genuine progress in the fight against piracy.

Escape Simulator 2 will explore "darker escape room themes", looks visually more detailed, and comes with a new editor for those who wish to design their own escape rooms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The protagonists of two of my all time favourite RPGs share something in common. Both (the best Final Fantasy game) Final Fantasy 8’s Squall and The Witcher 3’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.
The set contains "over 400 cards and a playmat" for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:

Why, I remember it like it was March, and not actually Summer, when the delightful free game about a mucky pomeranian was unleashed into the world. Yep, yep. It was definitely March. Roughly translating to ‘covered in mud doggy’, the game set you the task of racking up tangible financial damage to your owner’s house by getting mud everywhere - first by normal dog means, and then with giant mud cannons. You can grab it for free on Steam here.
It stole our hearts, it did. And talking of stealing things and having a good time doing it, it’s also releasing on the Nintendo Switch soon, which means the Steam version of Doronko Wanko is getting some free DLC to celebrate. It isn’t arriving until next Spring, but it’s bringing three new mystery dog breeds with it when it does.

And yet here we are, with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle loving its ray tracing so much that the effects can’t ever be fully switched off.

The Hitlerites and blackshirts of Indiana Jones And The Great Circle sneeze and cough as they patrol the dig sites of Gizeh, or the marble corridors of the Vatican. Although this is the Machine Games' clever way of letting you know where your enemies are at all times, it is also mildly funny, as if all the Nazis have been secretly kissing each other, spreading the same rhinovirus from Italy to Egypt to Nepal and beyond. More than that, it's a stubborn reminder that, despite the many hours of perfectly motion-captured cinematics that accompany all this, you are still playing a video game. A snotty tissue that separates the Indy of taut two-hour cinema and the Indy of a sweeping first-person punch 'em up that will take days to complete. All this is to say, you will notice the difference. But that might not matter; they're both still Indiana Jones.

At best. I’d successfully lured some bandits into the deadly lair of a bucket-tossing Poltergeist, but several attempts at more actively siccing mutated pigs on the Zone’s human baddies had all failed, even when I’d seemed to actually tame one.
Now, my only friend lay dead at my feet, and I’m in dire need of some new beasts to master. And some cash. It turns out that a fighting style that involves letting shopping trolley-sized swine creatures chew on my heels is bad for the ol’ HP, and having recently blown my savings on half a sausage, I’m forced to shift focus from my current debt collection mission towards a means to fill my own coffers.

Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of Condemned: Criminal Origins has my attention.
Total Chaos started life as a popular Doom 2 mod, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some day, somebody's going to make a cosy or wholesome submarine game, in which the submarine does not sprout leaks, does not run out of O2, and is never once invaded by any octopod-raddled zombies. That day is not today. Today there is only icy darkness and suffocation. Say "hello" and probably also "AIEEEEBLubLBBLBLBL" to Darkwater, a new co-op horror extraction game in which you brave the frigid oceans of an alien moon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightdive, you done good. The Thing: Remastered is an ultra-sharp and commendably playable update to a game that history will remember as ‘actually a pretty good pick at Choices when you really just popped in to get some Revels but got embarrassed when the till staffer said “is that everything?” in a tone that could have been neutral but equally could have been a damning indictment of your character’.
I’m being slightly facetious here, of course. History actually remembers Computer Artworks’s 2002 shooty horror game for how incredibly ambitious and conceptually inventive its proto-sus social squad system was. In homage to the body-snatching alien paranoia of Carpenter’s 1982 horror classic, The Thing tasks you with not just assembling and directing a squad, but keeping them from breaking down or turning on you - in fear you might be hosting the titular molecular stowaway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogubomb’s Blue Prince boasts my favourite shapeshifting house in a video game, which admittedly isn’t setting a very high bar. Perhaps surprisingly, most video game houses do not shapeshift. Despite being made out of pure imagination and carbon emissions, they remain nostalgically shackled to the limitations of brick, mortar and Euclidean geometry. Blue Prince’s abode is different. It is a house made of house. You’ll actually design the layout yourself every time you wander through it, picking from a selection of mismatched room types whenever you open a door.

Simply that I, personally, cannot resist a first person mech game where you have a fast food beverage inside your cockpit. It’s an extremely niche set of parameters and I’m elated it’s finally been fulfilled. Let’s chuffing gooooooooo!

It is, of course, very punk of me to recognise this. However, this hasn’t stopped every other videogame released in the last 74 years trying to coin their own punk subgenre. The latest to do so is ‘brinepunk’ FPS Abyssus, which seems to have mostly arrived at the terms by being ‘a bit Steampunk, but underwater’. Abyssus looks cool, and so with the power vested in me by the Greggs vegan sausage roll I had for lunch today, I hereby declare that this is the last game allowed to do this. Let’s see if it’s making the most of it, at least.

If you, personally, are reading RPS while falling off a mountain at this very moment, I’m afraid I can’t help you. Luckily, if you bonk your head on Steam on the way down, you’ll find a demo for stylish open world climbing game Cairn, which should hopefully distract you from your imminent pancaking.
Cairn is from The Game Bakers, of Furi and Haven fame. We first saw it at the Day Of The Devs this year. I was fresh off the lovely Jusant at the time. “Ah, another relaxing and whimsical French game about mountain climbing!” I thought. I was a fool. It’s far more intense, this one, although there are dashes of Breath Of The Wild and Death Stranding to add some whimsy and wonder to your Sisyphean struggle. Plus, it's very pretty. Here’s some new footage, or possibly some old footage depending on badly the embargo has messed up my schedule.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favourite anime shows is Sakura Quest. It's the story of an unemployed lady from Tokyo who accidentally gets herself appointed "Queen" of a struggling backwater village by the regional tourist board. From that case of mistaken identity proceeds 25 whole-ass episodes of Machiavellian haggling with crusty bigwigs over things like organising a concert. It's playfully dull, heartily mundane entertainment. No supernatural flourishes here - just the magic of paperwork and the thrill of bureaucracy.


I'm reminded of Sakura Quest by Danchi Days, a forthcoming cosy adventure with irresponsibly enticing Game Boy Advance-style visuals. It casts you as Hoshino, a teenage girl who's just moved to an old "danchi" housing complex and is trying to revive the yearly tradition of a summer festival. How will she do this? By means of haggling - haggling, and a bit of CSI.

Geopolitics are fractious and unnerving, environmental catastrophe seems more likely each day, and rampant digitally-disseminated disinformation further erodes our trust in one another. But I'll let lesser reporters tell you about that stuff. I'm here to report that Capcom have made the big bonk feel good again. They’ve heard player feedback on the missing weapon oomph caused by the lack of hitstop in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta, and they’re bringing back the bonk.
Here’s a handy breakdown of the issue by X user Blue Stigma, but briefly: hitstop is the brief pause in an attack animation the moment the weapon connects with an enemy, giving you a real sense of bonkitude and making say, a hammer feel different from a dagger.

I knew from some trailers that it was a free-to-play game about collecting pretty dresses and exploring a relentlessly positive open world. In those respects, I was correct.
I'd just missed the really big part - the fact it's a pacifistic Genshin Impact wearing a pretty dress. And as that realisation sunk in for the first time, my heart also sank with it. I really tried, I mean really tried to get into Nikki's gacha offerings; to delight in its menagerie of menus and cash in countless currencies for fun socks or glitzy tiaras.

What we can’t take credit for, however, is the 1.2 million quid they’ve raised already. If you want to make that number bigger, you can pick up the bundle here, and get 19 Steam keys for your trouble with a minimum donation of £35.
19 is such an annoying number in terms of the page layout that I’m almost convinced to never give to charity again, but there are some very nice games, including the aforementioned Shadows Of Doubt, Dungeons And Degenerate Gamblers, Citizen Sleeper, Another Crab’s Treasure, Two Point Campus, and Deathsprint 66.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indiana Jones And The Great Circle arrives soon, which will be exciting to many of you who like the guy who runs from large boulders and occasionally cracks a whip. It may be worth holding back that excitement, though, until you've had a glance at the just-released PC requirements. If you want to run it so Indy's hands are rendered at the recommended spec, you'll need quite the beefy rig. If you want his hands ray traced, you'll need something even juicier.

"[We’ve] not been able to attract and retain enough players in the long run to compete at the level we aim for in the very demanding free-to-play FPS market," said Ubisoft executive Marie-Sophie de Waubert in a statement to workers that was later posted on Ubisoft's website. Over half the team who worked on the game will lose their jobs at Ubi studios in San Francisco, Osaka, and Sydney. The remaining workers are "transitioning to other roles within Ubisoft."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I downloaded Creeper World IXE's demo, I had it pegged as a bizarre original. It is, in fact, the latest in a series of real-time strategy games in which you position turrets and terraform maps to repel surging, simulated tides of purple liquid. This is a war between flesh and mineral, solidity and fluidity that dates back to the age of Gillen. Alex Wiltshire (RPS in peace) interviewed creator Virgil Wall back in 2019 - amongst other things, we learn that the original Creeper World was based on a "failure" - and Sin has an  enthusiastic piece from 2021 about Creeper World 4, the first 3D instalment.
What does Creeper World IXE bring to the party? Well, 1) it ain't 3D, and 2) it's billed as an exercise in "dominating" the titular Creeper, rather than keeping it at bay. For too long has this sloshing, coruscating hooligan been allowed to wash over and corrode our precious starports. We will take the fight to it in the shape of an upgradeable 2D starfleet, equipped with lasers we can use to chisel away the geography and re-rout the flow of villainous Vimto.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tic-tac-toe, known to British people as noughts and crosses, is a famously boring game that is nonetheless often played by anybody with a sweet wrapper, a pencil and five minutes to burn while waiting for any form of public transport. It's boring because it's a "solved game" whose outcomes can be safely predicted regardless of where you place your first nought or cross, allowing the "perfect" player to at least draw their opponent. It gets played regardless because a lot of people don't know it's a solved game - specifically, young children you may wish to humiliate using your superior grown-up brain, because when you were a child somebody did the same to you. 
How many twisted adults were born from the experience of being bullied via the medium of tic-tac-toe? We'd be better off without this game. But look! Here comes Tic Tactic to shake things up with a touch of Balatro.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“If, two months ago, you’d been told to close your eyes and imagine a Two Point game about a museum, you’d come up with something at least 85% identical to Two Point Museum,” wrote James, previewingishly. After spending a few hours with a beefier build, I’m inclined to agree. But, much like Campus (which gave you real incentive to actually run a smooth operation that genuinely benefited the lazy ratbags stinking up your dorm halls) it’s that extra 15% that really makes all the difference.
James already covered the new exhibits system, and how acquiring and displaying them changes the way you run things, but such globetrotting adventures do little to rattle the pulse of a world-weary mapmuncher like me. No, what I’m actually most excited for when Two Point Museum releases next February is possibly the most ostensibly uninteresting feature added to any videogame ever - partition walls.

I have never been more grateful for this recurrent Quixotic daydream's mass market failure than when watching trailers for Urge, an open world survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss.


"But hold your horses, young Edwin," you sternly interject. "I do not wish to hear about, let alone play an open world survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss, on a website that children might read. It sounds like a cheap, taboo-jabbing gimmick." Friend, I once thought as you. But then I did a little research, as is my journalistic responsibility, and it turns out Urge's notions about piss - bladdergold, as they call it in the West Country, or Crusoe Cola, as it's known in the States - are rather in-depth. I'm still very glad I can't smell the game, but I definitely have the urge to play it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone with the need for a new CPU and even the slightest inclination towards tech envy is currently waiting for new stock of the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, the unbeatably powerful new chip that our boffin friends at Digital Foundry are calling the fastest gaming CPU ever. If, however, you’re hoping to switch to the 9800X3D from an older system with DDR4 RAM, you’ll need to upgrade that as well as the motherboard, as the entire Ryzen 9000 series only works with newer DDR5 memory.
Cyber Monday won’t help materialise more processors into retailers’ warehouses, but it can help you make this RAM switch on the cheap. Relatively speaking. And I can recommend a nice, fast 32GB kit of Corsair Vengeance DDR5, which is down by £43 in the UK and $22 in the US.

With each mech able to become another mech's worse nightmare, it becomes a game about stretching tight budgets to balance reactive counters with devastating offensives; about identifying the butterfly wings that can send tornados through your opponent’s ranks. It’s about the moments that eat up the hours like nothing else.

The developers of a heavily criticised mod for Half-Life 2 are intentionally blocking a small number of YouTubers from playing that mod, using Steam IDs to effectively blacklist and ban specific people from running it. Instead of launching the game as expected, these players will see the first-person shooter crash, alongside an error message that reads: "STOP talking SH1T about us". This is an act of revenge for previous criticism of the mod, say the affected videofolks, who are described in the mod's code as "anticitizens".

Yuck. If there’s one type of design that deserves the accolade, though, it’s RPGs that are assured enough in the richness of their worlds to not feel the need to signpost every discovery.
It’s a feedback loop of charitable feelings: the game is saying "we think you’re smart enough to find this stuff on your own". "You’re right!" you respond. "I am smart! And anyone who recognises that must be one smart cookie". Joy abounds, it rains Tunnock’s Caramel Wafers, hedgehogs jig gracefully in the street, and all is right with the world. So, I must say, I’m quite pleased to hear Avowed’s environment region director Berto Ritger sing the virtues of missable content to GamesRadar.

Glancing over that map as a newcomer to the game, my eye was caught by the creator's casual mention that Caves Of Qud is technically 2,147,483,646 levels deep.
"Is Caves Of Qud really 2,147,483,646 levels deep?" I asked Brendy, like a wide-eyed child asking whether there is such a thing as dog heaven. Brendy wasn't sure. (About Caves Of Qud, I mean, not dog heaven.) So I put the question to one of the developers, Freehold Games co-founder Brian Bucklew. In brief, the answer is yes, but with some significant caveats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the many high concept ludonarrative experiments I’d one day like to bring to fruition is an immersive sim in which the player has access to many guns, but their default arsenal selection is an open packet of crisps which they hold out in front of them, in first person, and offer to NPCs. Some NPCs wouldn’t be swayed by this, but some would lower their weapons at the offer of a prawn cocktail treat, and so you’d be constantly playing chicken with various guards: edging closer toward them, your shaking hands rattling the delicious disks inside the oily packet, mentally weighing up whether it's worth risking them turning hostile at the last second.
Obviously, I’d scan some real crisp packets and just alter the logos for maximum immersion. One game that’s already taken this scanned bricolage concept and run with it to beautiful effect is Hyperdrive Inn. It’s an avant garde point and click adventure from Finnish studio Horsefly, where the entire world is constructed from scanned fabric samples. Have a looksee.

Yes, that should work.

This is easier to shrug off while it's still in early access, but I will confess some relief when I read that the Trese Brothers (It's pronounced "Trese") nudged their estimated release date back to 2025. It needs a bit longer. But I'm about ready to start recommending it.
I'm a tad biased by my love for their previous Star Traders Colon Frontiers, an interest in mercenary management, and a wish for more turn-based tactics games that aren't bloody XCOM again. That I have reservations about what CKF hasn't yet nailed down is in part a symptom of high expectations. And because despite carrying over some design ethos from Frontiers, Cyber Knights is a very different kind of game.

Released in 2008, it's part of the fine tradition of post-Gears double-A actioners that basically consist of taking a gruff man, throwing him into a world of grit, gravel and burning oil drums, and handing him a murderous gimmick. Dark Sector's gimmick was the glaive, a pointy boomerang you could use to scoop up objects, solve puzzles, and kill stuff in third-person view.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To be clear, I still think the best graphics card deal of Black Friday week is that RTX 4070 Super offer and oh no wait that one’s gone now. But even if hadn’t been ecommerced to death, there’d still be a way to get the upgraded ray tracing and DLSS 3 frame gen tools of the RTX 40 series for less cash still: plucky 1080p contender, the RTX 4060, whose deals are still very much available and kicking.
In the UK, the best available prices are for the MSI GeForce RTX Ventus 2X Black edition, which is the partner card I happen to own myself – and has become the effective go-to GPU for RPS game performance tests. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Gaming OC is the most affordable of all; it’s a chunkier design than that of the compact Ventus 2X, though that’s mainly just the tradeoff for having an extra fan. These cards were already on the cheaper end of the RTX 4060 spectrum, and now they’re £30 / $35 off in the sales. Bargain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been working for a while on the next ScummVM release, and it is time for a call for public testing.
Support for a number of new engines and games for the existing ones was added, and we need your special attention to the following titles:
Orion Burger.
Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.
Thimbleweed Park.
The Space Bar.
Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)
Backyard Basketball.
Unrest.
Rise of the Dragon.
Castle Master.
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare. (Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца)
Mask Show. (Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat. (Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik. (Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday. (Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы)
Besides these newly supported games, almost half of the current 108 engines have notable changes. Thus, testing more games is always a good thing.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
We are looking forward to your reports about successful and unsuccessful playthroughs and bugs reported!
