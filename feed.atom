        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beyond balance patches
Hidden Variable has released the previously announced "major update" for the Nintendo Switch edition of cartoonish tag-fighter Skullgirls 2nd Encore. More than just a balance patch, the new update rebuilds much of the game's engine at a core level, in efforts to severely improve the Switch edition's performance.
The update, practically a full reinstall of the base game, features fully-rewritten code that increases the load times of the Switch port, while also tightening up online play, ensuring more stable performance, and wiping out a litany of small, troublesome bugs. Hidden Variable hopes that this new version of Skullgirls 2nd Encore will offer Nintendo players their best experience with the fighter to date.

In addition, the new update brings with it the addition of the Skullgirls Season 1 Pass. Switch players can now pick up previously released season one characters — such as Annie of the Stars and Umbrella — while bringing the game up to parity with the PC and console editions in regards to balance and tournament standard features. This update has been a long time coming, and finally sees the Switch Skullgirls community rewarded for their patience.
2023 promises to be a big year for the long-life fight franchise. The coming months will see the arrival of the sinister assassin, Black Dahlia, as well as new stages, character color palettes, webtoons, merchandise, and more. For a full report on Skullgirls' road ahead, be sure to check out our exclusive feature from last month — which includes some first-ever looks at character model sheets and animatics!
Skullgirls 2nd Encore is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile platforms.

Upcoming sci-fi Soviet FPS Atomic Heart seems chock-full of weird, mostly robotic things that want to kill you, and its latest trailer shows off all the ray-traced reflections and particle effects you can admire as they do so. We've seen a lot of this before, but it doesn't half look pretty - and now at 4K, if you can handle that. I worry for my poor 1080p-tier GPU, though at least there's also freshly-announced DLSS 3 support.

Publisher Prime Matter, in association with developers Starbreeze Studios and Overkill Software, have started off their 2023 with a bang — a block of C4, to be precise — with an update on the long-awaited multiplayer sequel Payday 3, which will be donning masks and raiding vaults later in 2023.
The studios released a short teaser video, debuting the shooter sequel's logo but sadly devoid of any actual in-game footage. Regardless, it was announced that Payday 3 would be launching on PC (via Steam) and unspecified console platforms later this year, in news that will no doubt cause a lot of itchy trigger fingers among veteran heisters. A new FAQ reveals that the title will be set in New York, and will see the return of gang members Dallas, Hoxton, Chains, and Wolf…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us turns 10 years old in June, and Naughty Dog plans to celebrate the milestone with an array of special announcements along the way. One of those updates involves a closer look at the upcoming standalone multiplayer title.
In a blog post, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann reflects on The Last of Us’ legacy as well as the franchise’s future. In addition to the HBO adaptation premiering on January 15 and the PC port of The Last of Us Part 1 hitting in March, Druckmann states fans will learn more about the long-awaited multiplayer experience that serves as a follow-up to the original game’s Factions mode. Druckmann writes,
“We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game. With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”
Naughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. 
Though we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we'll have to wait and see over the coming months. Until then, be sure to check out this feature on how The Last of Us Part 1 proves there's no such thing as a faithful remake.]]></summary>

Obviously, there's little point in me picking out specific titles, but a huge breadth of genres and releases are covered here, from retro classics to some of 2022's finest. Deluxe Editions and DLC are also up for grabs, along with a wide variety of indie hits and Japanese obscurities. I'm in no doubt that you might have already burned out your bank accounts over the past fortnight, but that's why the stagger the additions this way. Pretty sneaky, sis.

We're a few days into 2023 now, but many places are still looking back at last year's biggest and best games. And review aggregate site Metacritic is joining in, compiling multiple lists based on compiled reviews from multiple publications.
Today, the site has revealed the Switch's best-reviewed games of 2022. The top 40 has some real big hitters like Triangle Strategy, Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Splatoon 3, and Kirby and the Forgotten Land, and there's a real juicy mix of indies too like Beacon Pines (which one of us in particular really loved and wrote about), Infernax, and Citizen Sleeper.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had great plans for the games I was going to play over the Christmas break. Elden Ring! Tunic! Our game of the year Vampire Survivors! And I did try to play some of them, for a bit. Elden Ring and Tunic were both too hard for my state of mind, which was as robust as pink candyfloss. Even Vampire Survivors wigged me out because it's so visually busy by the end game, and I was in a more "Ferrero Rocher and jigsaw of the London Underground map" sort of place. My downfall was seeing PowerWash Simulator on sale on Steam. I bought it, and then played it for 40 hours.

The RPS Treehouse even named the bullet hell beast the best game of 2022 In a Steam community blog, developer Poncle celebrated the mega-successful year they just had, highlighting their accolades and the fact they were the most played game on Steam Deck over the last six months - half of that playtime probably came from me in my bed; you’re welcome, Poncle. But, despite their Vampire-y success, the devs have already begun to tease something "not exclusively related" to their big hit.

The ongoing battle between The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Microsoft over the latter's proposed purchase of Activision Blizzard rages on — And, according to recent comments by the former, it looks like neither side has been willing to give up a single yard, leading toward a clear impasse.
Speaking in a telephone hearing on Tuesday, FTC attorney James Weingarten noted that there has been no "substantive" settlement talks between the trade body and the publisher, suggesting that the two parties will have no option but to pursue the FTC's filed suit to legal trial, which is tentatively set for August of this year.

        <updated>2023-01-04T13:49:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wizards of the Coast, the company behind Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering, has reportedly canceled five unannounced games alongside layoffs affecting "fewer than 15 people," according to a new Bloomberg report. 
The people that will lose their jobs will be given a chance to apply for new roles within WotC, but this apparent business restructuring will affect others outside of the company as well. Bloomberg reports that this reorganization will hit Otherside Entertainment and Hidden Path Entertainment, both working on games for WotC, hard. News of this change follows the release of Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance's release last year, which didn't fare too well with critics and players, amidst Larian Studios' continued development on Baldur's Gate 3 (which does not seem to be affected by this reorganization despite WotC serving as the game's publisher). 
These two games, in part, represented WotC's bigger forray into the video game space as Bloomberg reports that the company had signed contracts with several studios to make games. WotC also "built at least six of its own game studios," according to the publication. 
One project in the works that is now canceled went under the codename "Jabberwocky," according to Bloomberg, and two more externally developed games early in development are no longer moving forward as well. These cancelations and layoffs comes as parent company Hasbro's shares fell 40% last year. 
Wotc told IGN that it remains "committed to using digital games as a cornerstone of our strategy for bringing our games to players around the world," adding that it has "made some changes to our long-term portfolio to focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing our existing brands and those which show promise in expanding or engaging our audience in new ways."

Thankfully, one chronicler of modern English culture is brave enough to capture this moment.

Roughly 300 QA workers at ZeniMax voted to indicate they wish to join this union, equating to a supermajority vote, and Microsoft has opted to recognize it. This lines up with what Microsoft said last month, where it announced that if these workers vote to unionize, it would voluntarily recognize the union. ZeniMax is the first studio in Microsoft's umbrella of teams to unionize and it's also now the largest group of unionized QA testers at any US-based studio.

Last year's Switch port of the Pokémon-like creature catcher/battler Temtem may not have taken the world by storm quite as rapidly as some expected, but it is fair to say that the team at Crema are working hard to consistently bring improvements to the game (thanks, Go Nintendo).
This progressive eye is continuing into the New Year as the developer has announced that a small update will be coming to the game next week (9th January) and will focus on patching some of the problems that arose with the addition of ver.1.2. These problems included issues with the Switch memory and game crashes amongst others, so it is good to see that the team are working on a solution.

The QA department of ZeniMax Media has voted in favor of establishing a union within its office walls. Some 306 workers within the company's U.S. gaming division sought unionization within a recently held ballot, overseen by the Communication Workers of America (CWA).
ZeniMax Workers United has already been officially recognized by company owner Microsoft, following a deal made with the CWA in June 2022 where the union regulator offered their approval in regards to the Microsoft/Activision Blizzard acquisition in return for Microsoft on any proposed union action — And thus, MS offered no resistance and full cooperation regarding the ZeniMax team's motion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Percy Jackson fans are quaking
It's time for another limited-time event from Overwatch 2, and this time they're going for a Greek mythology-themed romp with Battle for Olympus. The free-for-all deathmatch mode will be available to play January 5-19, and will give seven heroes on the game's roster a whole host of new god-like abilities. Some of the affected characters will include Widowmaker, who will turn enemies to stone, Junker Queen, who will call lightning down during her ultimate to do devastating damage, and Roadhog, who will turn into a giant cyclops.
Blizzard released a trailer as part of the event's announcement, which revealed a good number of details about what we can expect from Battle for Olympus. Players will be able to earn "divine rewards," and while they don't specify what that entails, it's likely to be the usual roundup of voice lines, sprays, victory poses, and hopefully the skins that we can see in the trailer, because they look sick as hell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbI57nJsAkU
The epic free-for-all battles will take place on what I consider the best arcade map: Château Guillard. But the fun doesn't stop there, because after the event is over, whichever hero has secured the most eliminations throughout the event will get a marble statue of their likeness added to the control map Ilios. Looks like our favorite heroes have a chance at immortality.
While Overwatch 2 hasn't exactly been my favorite game as of late, I am a sucker for Greek mythology. I'm not alone here, and Blizzard knows exactly what they're doing in getting some more players back into the game. It looks like the game's second Season is gonna be chock full of events, because even before Battle for Olympus concludes, we'll be into the Lunar New Year event that runs from January 17-February 6 this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get a closer look at the Lands Between
For super fans, buying an art book can be one of the most gratifying pieces of merch you can collect, whether it's for their favorite show, film, or of course, game. I'm someone who really loves to see how the sausage gets made, and having a book I can flip through from time to time and get a peek at the artistic process behind one of my favorite things is weirdly important to me. If you're a fan of Elden Ring and feel the same way, you're in for a treat, because FromSoftware has opened the pre-orders for the game's two-volume art book.
As the best books usually are, these volumes are both oversized hardbacks at 8.25" x 11.75". There's plenty of content for FromSoft to show off, because the first volume is 432 pages, and the second is 384 pages long. The former will feature art of the game's opening cinematic, as well as key art, concept art, and development design documents focused on the Lands Between, its dungeons, characters, and armor designs. The latter volume will highlight the game's enemies, items, and weapons.
[caption id="attachment_356578" align="alignnone" width="1200"] Image via FromSoftware[/caption]
It's looking like Amazon is the only place to pre-order the books in the western regions as of now, but there's a chance that they'll be available from other retailers once we're closer to the July 25, 2023 release date. As of now the books are also both listed for $59.99 a pop, so they'll be an investment for sure.
For a game as big and beautiful as Elden Ring, it would be a real shame for any of the development work to go unnoticed, because the team clearly worked hard to bring its world to life. Like I said, I love art books on principle, but I truly can't think of a property that's more deserving of one.

The game started to change, my life got busier, and I simply moved on to other things. Every few months I would log back in for a match or two to reminisce, but I had to admit to myself that the best of my Overwatch career was behind me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Make your matches extra super
Fall Guys has always had a great lineup of themed costumes, from Sonic to Ratchet & Clank to Portal. Their newest collaboration with yet another fan-favorite franchise is dropping January 5, and this time fans will get an opportunity to don skins from one of the most beloved animated series of recent memory: Invincible. Skins for Mark, Omni-Man, and Atom Eve will be available for purchase in the Fall Guys store in collaboration with Skybound Games, so don't be surprised if you see some new super-friends soaring through your matches soon. Of course, Fall Guys is a family friendly game, so we won't be seeing quite as much blood and gore as we're used to from these characters.
https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1610290021478580227
Amazon Prime's acclaimed animated series Invincible is based on a comic series of the same name, written by Walking Dead comic author Robert Kirkman. Season one was a massive success when it dropped in 2021, even spawning a series of popular memes, and while we know another season is supposed to drop sometime this year, it's anyone's guess as to when we can expect it. Some fans are hoping that this Fall Guys collab means we'll be getting an update soon, and I'm certainly in that boat myself.
Fall Guys has also seen a resurgence since it went free-to-play last year, and rightfully so. I returned to the game recently after not having touched it since 2020, and it's probably even more fun than I remember due to all the new stages and content that they've added. My backlog has been keeping me plenty busy as of late, but Fall Guys is one of those games I know I'll be coming back to when my schedule clears up a bit. Certainly as a fan of the Invincible series, it'll be worth logging on to see if I can't secure some of these new skins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're off again, lil' buddy
Skunkape Games has announced that it has begun development of Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse Remastered, following on from its previously released remasters of Telltale Games classics Sam & Max Save the World Remastered and Sam & Max: Beyond Time and Space Remastered. This latest retread will launch on unannounced platforms later in 2023.
First released on PC and PS3 way back in 2010, The Devil's Playhouse was the third of Telltale Games' Sam & Max adventures, and sees the Freelance Police investigate a series of strange phenomena linked to the powerful psychic machinations of the mysterious "Toys of Power". The original release of The Devil's Playhouse sported a fresh new game engine, and allowed the player to take direct control of both Sam and Max independently — allowing for a shakeup of the title's puzzle elements and adding an extra emphasis on synergy and teamwork between the two characters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYPuWAQvRyw&ab_channel=Skunkape
While Skunkape Games has not offered any official information on the new title, we can likely expect The Devil's Playhouse Remastered to feature updated character models and environmental textures, tauter controls, and slicker U.I. integration. If we're lucky, we might also see the new release include additional artwork, voicework, and music, as was the case for both Save the World Remastered and Beyond Time and Space Remastered. We'll be sure to give you a heads-up when more information — including platforms and a release date — is forthcoming.
Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse Remastered is currently in development at Skunkape Games.

If I could do it all over again, I wouldn't get out of shape, I would've gotten into this gig at a younger age, and, above all, I would've learned to drive as soon as I was out of school. And this holiday — as the frosted winter air and expensive hotel prices keep me from a fun party — I'm reminded of how much freedom the open road allows those with four wheels and a tank of gas. No clock checking, no canceled buses, and no overnight stay necessary. Just you and the road...
...And a thousand misanthropic, angry people in huge metal death machines.
In addition to freedom, having your own vehicle provides some with a sense of identity, even purpose. These are the people for whom the car is like a trophy lover, to be gifted with expensive presents, treated with lo…]]></summary>

With season 2 of Invincible set to premiere on Amazon Prime sometime this year, Fall Guys is whetting fans’ appetite with skins for Mark, Omni-Man, and Atom Eve. The outfits hit the in-game store on January 5, and that hopefully means a release date announcement for the series won't be too far behind.

Fall Guys enjoyed a bit of a renaissance in 2022. In addition to its usual deluge of seasonal content updates, it went free-to-play in May and launched on Xbox and Switch, gaining a larger player base of contestants and renewed interest in general. We look forward to seeing what 2023 brings for the title, but this is a pretty good start.

Developer Nightdive Studios has announced that its troubled, long-in-development remake of sci-fi horror classic System Shock is entering its final development phases, and is officially expected to launch on PC, via Steam, this coming March.
One can forgive fans for eyeing this news with suspicion, as the System Shock remake has been through a helluva lot of delays and licensing troubles ever since its initial announcement way back in 2016. Since then, System Shock has been tentatively announced for several release windows, from 2017 through 2020 and into 2021. In a new update on the project's Kickstarter page, however, Nightdive Studios openly acknowledges the remake's delayed development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polish developer The Astronauts have revealed a new trailer for their upcoming rogue-lite shooter Witchfire. In addition to showing off some new gameplay clips, it announces that the game will use NVIDIA DLSS3 technology, which a press release says will "massively boost performance." You can watch the trailer below.


Announced by NVIDIA last September, DLSS 3 can boost a game's performance by a significant margin. One demo on NVIDIA's site shows two instances of Cyberpunk 2077 running at 96 FPS with ray tracing still enabled. "DLSS 3 allows the seemingly impossible, high framerate without compromising the visuals," Adrian Chmielarz, creative director and co-founder of The Astronauts says in a press release. "A no brainer for a game like Witchfire, which is both action and beauty."
Witchfire is a dark fantasy first-person shooter from the creators of Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Set in an alternate reality, players are caught in the middle of a war between witches and the Church, and must use weapons and powers from Vatican sorcerers to defeat their enemies. 
The game is set to enter Early Access in the Epic Games Store sometime later this year, though that wasn't always the case. It was delayed last October because the team decided to overhaul the world's design and make it more open. This trailer is a good indication that the studio is still hard at work, though; here's hoping that "early 2023" ends up being as soon as possible.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whoa
Pocket Card Jockey remains one of my all-time favorite games for the Nintendo 3DS. I absolutely adore that little mash-up of solitaire and horse racing. In fact, it's one of just two games that I still play with some regularity on my New Nintendo 2DS XL (the other being Fantasy Life). That'll change later this month when Pocket Card Jockey comes to Apple Arcade. Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! revives the Game Freak classic for iOS devices as an Apple Arcade exclusive. The game will feature races rendered in 3D along with the classic gameplay that made it so addictive.
You might remember Game Freak had ported the original Pocket Card Jockey to Android not long after the game launched for 3DS, but that version was never localized outside of Japan. While this version of the game is different than the Android port, it is yet another long-lost mobile title that has been rescued for the Apple Arcade service. You might remember PlatinumGames' World of Demons disappeared from app stores after its original soft release only to pop up as an Apple Arcade exclusive many months later. The same thing happened with Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls.
While the Apple Arcade release calendar isn't as exciting as it once was, it is comforting to know that Apple is sticking with the service and bringing fun new titles like Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! to subscribers. Ride On! is one of a few games announced for a January release, with the others being Episode XOXO from Pocket Gems, the jigsaw puzzler Illustrated, and physics puzzler Squiggle Drop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New year, new content: Cult of the Lamb is getting a "major content update" sometime in 2023. According to a Twitter thread posted to the official Cult of the Lamb account, this update will introduce features many players have requested, including accessibility improvements, quality-of-life features, new difficulty options, and more depth.
This Major Content Update will release in 2023 and be FREE to all players!
pic.twitter.com/FWFW7sC7F0
December 30, 2022
The biggest change they showcase in this thread is the introduction of heavy attacks, which can be activated by holding down the attack button. These are more than slow swings that do more damage; in Cult of the Lamb, every heavy attack has a unique effect. For example, the sword's heavy attack smashes the ground, doing an explosion of damage that harms any enemy caught in its range. Meanwhile, the dagger creates a line of knives that fall from the sky, and the axe can be thrown around like a boomerang. This is just the tip of the iceberg; developer Massive Monster says it's "just one small tidbit" of what's still to come.
The update should come soon, but not that soon. The last tweet of the thread clarifies that the developers are currently working on a patch to fix some console bugs and that the major update won't be released until after that. Their release window also isn't any more specific than "2023," so it could come out any time this year.

Cast your mind back to the hazy days of 2013. In that year the Game Boy Advance SP was celebrating its 10th anniversary, we contemplated the squareness of the Nintendo 2DS, A Link Between Worlds brought us back to the glory days of Zelda. All of this, weirdly, took place in 'The Year of Luigi'.
This official year-long event (actually lasting for 13 months, if we're being really picky) was nominally about celebrating the 30th anniversary of everyone's favourite player two since his debut in 1983's Mario Bros. with a host of Luigi or Luigi-adjacent games and content launching across the year. This fun little marketing stunt had a distinct whiff of whimsy, which helped divert attention from a relatively sparse calendar as Wii U stumbled out of the gate and Nintendo ran into issues transitioning to the HD era that left some sizeable gaps on the schedule.

"We're drastically simplifying the purchase experience for new players. Hitman World of Assassination will be the single experience option to start playing." 


This update makes it so that all Hitman 3 owners will have the same base content ownership, and it attempts to eliminate confusion over which edition to buy to obtain certain levels by making it so that there is only one purchase option. The other DLC will apparently still be available for purchase, but owning all the IO Interactive Hitman trilogy levels will be easier than ever now. 
Hitman World of Assassination will cost $70, and it includes Hitman 3, the Hitman 1 Game of the Year Access Pass, and the Hitman 2 Standard Access Pass. You can also purchase the Hitman World of Assassination Deluxe Pack for $30 to get the Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack, the Hitman 3 Seven Deadly Sins Collection, and the Hitman 2 Expansion Access Pass. 
"Those are the only two products that new players need to consider when buying any Hitman game digitially as of January 26, 2023," IO writes in a blog post. "The changes have also been made with the Freelancer game mode in mind, where being able to easily access all locations from across the World of Assassination is parmount to maximizing your enjoyment." 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Hitman 3 review and then read about the new Hitman 3 Freelancer mode.

This echoes Matsuda’s New Year’s message from last January, where the company first expressed its enthusiasm for an NFT-fueled, metaverse future. More recently, Squeenix partnered with the “environmentally friendly” blockchain firm Oasys, probably to sidestep potential controversies about, y'know, the environmental impact of the technology.

When I was a kid, a lot of my friends matured earlier than I did. While I was still watching cartoons and playing with stuffed animals, they moved on to more “mature” forms of entertainment, like WCW or In Living Color. For whatever reason, I was determined to stay a kid for as long as possible, even if that made me uncool. One show that absolutely kept me in that adolescent state of mind was Rugrats. I know I’ve written about my adoration for that show on this site before, but I can’t overstate what an impact that Nicktoon had on me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No alien wars, thankfully.
Over the years, narratives in pop culture mediums have hypothesised over how the future might turn out for the human race: in James Cameron's Terminator 2: Judgement Day, 1997 would have seen Earth decimated by Skynet's new-found sentience; Back to the Future Part II visualised a 2015 in which we'd all be cruising around on hoverboards and rocking self-drying jackets; Blade Runner went wild and thought that the year 2019 would see bioengineered replicants roaming about Earth after escaping off-world colonies.
Now, it's the turn of Perfect Dark. Released back in 2000 for the N64, Rare's first-person shooter depicted a world set in the year 2023 during which two alien races - the Maians and the Skedar - are locked in an interstellar war. On Earth, two rival corporations known as The Carrington Institute and dataDyne are both in league with the Maians and the Skedar respectively. Joanna Dark, the game's protagonist, carries out multiple missions including the elimination of a clone of the President, and the destruction of the Skedar leader on the alien homeworld.

Maybe Gloria Estefan was right, and the rhythm is, in fact, gonna get you. Melatonin certainly thinks so.
This debut from indie studio Half Asleep is named for the brain hormone that helps you sleep (starting to see a pattern here). It’s a pretty pastel rhythm game where you enter an insomniac’s puzzling dreams to press or hold buttons in time with a beat. But the dreams are not really a story so much as a loose structure for a series of minigames. Because, for a game about relaxation and sleep, Melatonin really requires you to be wide awake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Starbreeze Studios and publisher Koch Media have released a new teaser trailer that calls 2023 "the year of PayDay 3." Presumably, this means the co-op shooter is still on track to release sometime this year. 
Koch gave PayDay 3 a 2023 release window way back in March of 2021, detailing the game's new publishing deal alongside news that there is at least 18 months of post-launch support planned for the title. Later that year, in June, Koch released a new piece of concept art, citing that PayDay 3 will feature a "fully-fledged social heist universe" set within a Hollywood-like setting. That was the last we saw of PayDay 3 until yesterday, when IGN revealed the "official reveal trailer" for the game, although considering how little is shown in it, it's less of a reveal and more of a teaser. 
Check out this new PayDay 3 trailer below: 


As you can see, there's not much to this trailer other than it calling 2023 "the year of PayDay 3." Here's hoping that holds true.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield, the new and upcoming sci-fi RPG from Skyrim makers Bethesda Softworks, was originally due out in November of 2022, but it was delayed to the first half of 2023 last May. Starfield was then a big part of an Xbox showcase last summer and during that showcase, Microsoft revealed that every game shown would be coming in the first half of 2023. 
Now, a new Bethesda support page for the game has reconfirmed this "first half of 2023" window, as spotted by Klobrille on Twitter.
"Starfield arrives exclusively on Xbox Series X/S and PC in the first half of 2023," the support page reads.
This isn't the biggest surprise; Xbox has discussed this release window for Starfield on two occasions before this support page, but it seems the company is really dedicated to getting it out in the coming months. 
While waiting for an official release date, read about why Bethesda's Starfield delay is key to its new-gen success and then check out this story about how your Starfield character will not have a voice. Read about how Starfield's ambitious scale might be worrisome after that and then read about how Xbox Series X/S first-party games will cost $70 starting this year.

Devolver Digital has announced that one of the sleeper hits of 2022, Massive Monster's Cult of the Lamb, will receive a free major content update later this year, bringing a selection of new features, options, and accessibility functions to the super-cute, super horrifying anthro roguelike.
While details are a little bit on the thin side, a tweet from the eccentric publisher notes that the update will be bringing a selection of tweaks to add more overall depth to the title, with a short clip teasing an all-new "heavy attack" mechanic. In addition, new difficulty settings will be added to the sacrificial adventure as well as several unspecified accessibility options and "quality-of-life" tweaks. Neat!
https://twitter.com/cultofthelamb/status/1608891710570106884?s=20&t=P8Tt1BpocaS1mmEYZs46xA
Released in the summer of 2022, Cult of the Lamb blends cutesy visuals and ultra-dark humor in its tale of a young lamb who, having seemingly had their life saved by a sinister deity, goes about preaching the word of this supposed savior and building an ever-growing cult around its teachings. Cult of the Lamb would itself amass a huge fan following, eventually making its way onto several Game of the Year nomination lists, (including our own), and even taking home several gongs at the Australian Game Developer Awards.
Cult of the Lamb is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

2023 is going to be a pretty big year for the Switch. It's only the start of January, but we already know that we're going to be playing the likes of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Fire Emblem Engage, Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and Pikmin 4 within the next 12 months, and that's all while being fully aware that Nintendo likely has a boatload of other surprises up its sleeve. Phew!
We are, however, a sentimental bunch here at Nintendo Life, and we love our 3DS consoles. The problem, though, is that most people have understandably moved on and are now taking their Switches out and about on their travels. What the Switch lacks, however, is the excellent StreetPass feature from the 3DS, and we reckon its about time we start getting those sweet dopamine hits from the green StreetPass notification light once again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[But will it make it out West?
For most of us Nintendo fans, Level-5 holds a special place in our hearts. Between the Professor Laytons, Inazuma Elevens and Yo-Kai Watches, the chances are that we have all come across the studio at least once or twice in our gaming days. Now, it looks like a new IP is on the horizon.
Shared in the company's 'Happy New Year' card (one of the many compiled by Famitsu), Level-5 announced that 2023 will see us receiving a whole lot of fresh news. This will include details on the upcoming Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road of Heroes (if this title hangs around, that is), as well as the inclusion of a brand new IP.

2023 is underway, and, like clockwork, all of the studios and publishers are taking to the airwaves to offer non-descript teases for their new year's wares — Perhaps the most notable of these has come from Square Enix producer Yoshinori Kitase, who has teased a "big announcement" concerning the legendary Final Fantasy franchise.
Interestingly, however, Kitase notes that the announcement is unrelated to the ongoing Final Fantasy VII Rebirth project, which Kitase is helming alongside the team at SE's Creative Business Unit I. While it is believed that the second chapter of the epic remake series is scheduled to launch in the winter of this year, the mystery announcement seemingly concerns an entirely different project.

It's a brand new year and we have the latest UK charts to kickstart 2023 (although technically this covers the last week of 2022). There are no major surprises this week and no new entries, but simply a minor reshuffling of the top ten games. At the top spot is Santa Monica Studio's God of War Ragnarok, climbing two positions to beat out FIFA 23 in second place.
Interestingly, the Switch version of FIFA 23 came joint first with the PlayStation 4 version in terms of the platform split, making up 28%. It just goes to show that EA's lack of effort with Nintendo's platform is seemingly paying off, at least in the UK.

Lots of time was spent as a lowly tarnished, getting smacked around by big fucken madlads with a dragon for an arm, sure. But I also got lost in a thrilling narrative adventure, laughed at flatulent renditions of our national anthem, swept up loot in Al Mazrah, and became enamoured with a lil gator. Here's to 2022, everyone.

I'm very grateful to all of you for showing up this weekend, and hopefully you've recovered from the festive carnage of last week in time to wreak further havoc this evening.
I myself had a fine and quiet Christmas, which was exactly what I was looking for. I ate too much and re-visited No Time to Die and Gremlins. So, in a sense, I spent my Christmas with Ana de Armas and Phoebe Cates and nobody can tell me otherwise.

We're each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he's away, we've prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.

After all, it's the time of year when a lot of us will set new year's resolutions to help us introspect and change our habits as the clock ticks over into 2023, and I want to do the same when it comes to my favorite hobby. I'm someone who benefits a lot from structure in my life, so anything I can do to create expectations and goals for myself I think will help me be more of the gamer that I want to be in 2023.

There's a small chance you're spending the next several hours at a bacchanalian rager, but I'd bet that you're not. You're more likely enjoying a few hours of peace and quiet after a week with family and wishing Jools would hurry the whole thing along.

That sounds like a perfect time to peruse your gaming library and wonder what you could play. Look at all those games you haven't got round to yet! Maybe 2023 should be the year you really commit to learning Dwarf Fortress, now the Steam version is out. Maybe this is the year you finally give an MMO a try or see your first JRPG to completion. Or maybe this year you're going to uninstall your backlog in its entirety and just accept you're only ever going to play Spelunky from now on.

As the year closes out, the retro enthusiasts over at Hamster Corp have one more offering for 2022, bolstering the Arcade Archives range with nothing less than one of the most iconic video games of all time: Taito's Bubble Bobble.
Released to the freshly rejuvenated arcade scene in 1986, Bubble Bobble practically needs no introduction. This single-screen platformer sees one or two players step into the scaly suits of bubble-blowing dinosaurs Bub and Bob, as they descend through 100 levels of monsters and mayhem on a quest to rescue their abducted sweethearts. Facing off against a plethora of strange and instantly recognizable villains — including the notorious Baron Von Blubba — Bubble Bobble provided aracde goers one helluva challenge, and remains a fun and compelling experience decades down the line.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber AL82 Longplays.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTR0xqRCfUk&ab_channel=AL82RetrogamingLongplays
Thanks to its super-cute characters, colorful world, and instantly recognizable theme tune, Bubble Bobble would become one of the most financially successful arcade games of its day, leading to a series of home ports, various sequels and spin-offs, and a place in the annals of game history. Bub and Bob would go on to continue their adventures in 1987's Rainbow Islands, and would make a notable comeback with the block-busting smash hit series Puzzle Bobble. This is not to speak of a multitude of remakes, remasters, and rereleases, or Bub and Bob's frequent cameo appearances in many of Taito's other hits.
Bubble Bobble is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

Smallville. Kal-El. The Man of Steel. Supes. The Last Son of Krypton. No matter how many different ways there are to say his name, there is only one Superman. Since his first appearance in Action Comics #1, Superman has delighted comic book fans and the public at large for more than 80 years, appearing in everything from movies to cartoons to radio serials, some of which were actually pretty good. He’s also shown up in a wide array of video games. Sadly, these games really aren’t worth playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As both a parent and the resident news lad here, I probably spend way more time talking and writing about games than getting hundreds of hours to actually play them. While most of the games I've snuck the odd minutes with – I hesitate to say hours – made it onto our Advent Calendar for Horace’s approval, the three below were a few that made me and my family smile at different points throughout 2022. Roll on 2023 - and even more games.


Possibly my most magical Christmas as a kid was in 1997, aged 12. I got a Saturn and an issue of the UK’s Official Sega Saturn Magazine that had a Christmas NiGHTS Into Dreams disc on the cover. I reckon that it was my favourite, most unabashedly fun time for gaming ever (outside my decades fiddling around on PC, obvs). Indie platformer Lunistice is a blatant love letter to the 32-bit era, and the kind of game that largely skipped the poor old Saturn.


You guide Hana the Tanuki about as she dreams, aiming to get her to the Moon. Hana properly speeds along, bouncing and spinning her tail to thwack enemies with a lovely splat effect. Devs A Grumpy Fox have really nailed the classic 90s platformer vibe, thanks to all the different dreamworlds that Hana gets to careen through. Don’t expect something open-world like Sonic Frontiers, because Lunistice is deliberately meant to be a linear, short experience. Good grief, could we use more of those.

We're each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he's away, we've prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

Hot on the heels of the 7-Star Charizard Tera Raid, Cinderace is the second 7-Star challenge introduced in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. If you thought Charizard was hard, you’ve got another thing coming.
Just like before, you can only catch one Cinderace during this event. However, you can farm the encounter as much as you’d like for sky-high drop rates of Tera Shards and other rare items. Cinderace will always have the Fighting Tera-Type and the same movepool, so building a Pokemon to counter it specifically is essential.

Every December, I, like many others, take a look back at the biggest games of the year. Usually, I limit myself to the games that I actually liked, but this year, I dipped my toes into Horizon Forbidden West, a sequel that I don't care for to a game that I don't care for. I also watched a few YouTube videos of God of War Ragnarök. I was going to play it in full, but Horizon Forbidden West put me off of paying full price for sequels to games I dislike (and 2018's God of War left me pretty cold). I just wanted to get a feel for the year's big trends. What I discovered was one major through-line: distressingly talkative characters.

I hold no side-scroller in higher regard than the original Castlevania on the NES. It’s not the flashiest or more feature-stuffed game, but what it does, it does almost perfectly. The bosses could be better, I guess. However, perfection is a constantly shifting target, so I’ll take Castlevania as the closest we’ll ever get to it.
It’s probably why I prefer the classic formula of the Castlevania series over the later “Metroidvania” approach. Not that I have any distaste for it, but my preference is that tough-as-nails, level-by-level setup. It makes my thumbs feel like they’re flexing.
However, I’ve never met a Castlevania I love more than the first, and I’ve played most of them. The closest I’ve come to the same admiration was actually with Castlevania: Bl…]]></summary>

2022 was my best year for games for what feels like a good, long while.

I know I'm not alone in saying that it was really difficult to narrow down my choices for my favorites games of the year. I wanted to have a clean top ten, but I've had so much fun this year I had to make way for a few extras.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a weird year at RPS for me. After eight years as news editor, I started the nebulous new role of associate editor. This brought a broad mandate to cover indie games and PC Game Pass and to do, like, whatever else I think might be fun or good. It has been weird to not clock in and just Do News, and to have responsibility only over myself. This freedom has felt great when I've had ideas, and terrible when I've not. I'm still feeling it out, settling in, and making mistakes, but I'm quite enjoying myself. Hopefully you have enjoyed some of it too. Here are a few of my favourite things I've written this year!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Images of what appears to be a special The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED model have leaked online, but it's currently unclear if this is a real console or a believable fake. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that the images of this console appeared on the Famiiboard forum last night from user Kysen. The user didn't provide many details about the potential special edition Switch, but as you can see in the images below, the photos are quite believable. There are pictures of the console, the packaging, the Joy-Con, and more.
Check out the possible leaked images of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED special edition for yourself below:

As you can see, it appears that this model of the Switch is real. However, elaborate and well-done fakes have been done before so there's no telling if this is actually real until we learn more information. It wouldn't be the most surprising thing ever, considering Nintendo tends to release special edition OLED models for big releases like this year's Splatoon 3 and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. 
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom hits Switch on May 12 so it might be a while before we learn if this special edition OLED model is real. In the meantime, check out our list of the biggest 2022 games delayed to 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metal Gear Solid creator and Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima and Metal Gear Solid publisher Konami parted ways with each other back in 2015 and since then, there hasn't been a mainline entry in the famed MGS series (although there was the not-so-great Metal Gear Survive in 2018). 
While there's no reason to believe Kojima and Konami are teaming up again anytime soon, it seems the latter might be preparing for some kind of return to MGS. Longtime MGS producer Noriaki Okamura wrote in a recent issue of Famitsu that "2023 will be a year of many announcements," as reported by Gematsu. 
In this special end-of-the-year issue of Famitsu, multiple Japanese developers and producers wrote quick teases about what 2023 might hold for them. It's here where Okamura teased that 2023 will be a year of announcements for Konami Digital Entertainment. More specifically, he said "Other than [the educational edition of Momotaro Dentetsu announced last year], 2023 will be a year of many announcements," and that his keyword for 2023 is "long-awaited," as noted by Gematsu. 
Now, this could just be his way of saying that Konami, as a whole, will make some announcements and that maybe some of them will be long-awaited by fans. However, given that it's Okamura – a longtime MGS producer – saying this, there's reason to believe that maybe he's teasing a return to the MGS series. Perhaps we're getting a remake of one of the games, or maybe a new mainline entry. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of the Metal Gear Solid series.

The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us.

This non-X variant performs more or less identically, with a slightly low rated boost clock that translates into one or two percent worse performance in CPU-limited scenarios. Given the fact that the 5600 is £13 cheaper on Amazon right now, we'd recommend it over the X any time.

Now there's a new trailer which shows combat against humans and mutants, scavenging in the Zone, comforting inventory management, and dialogue from several high-strung NPCs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is still on track to release sometime next year, and developer GSC Game World has released its first trailer in six months, showcasing gameplay with some narrative trappings along the edges.
Courtesy of IGN, the new video shows that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is looking pretty darn good. The narrative-driven shooter is set in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in a post-apocalyptic world laden with dangerous mutated monsters. Players must fight their way to the heart of the zone while steering the non-linear plot through choice-driven gameplay. 


Formally confirmed in 2020 after years of start and stop announcements, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has had a tumultuous development. After announcing and quickly canceling NFT plans due to fan backlash in December 2021, the project came to a screeching halt in February due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC is based. Many employees were forced to evacuate their homes in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Other designers chose to defend the city. One of GSC’s designers who volunteered to fight, Vladimir "Fresh" Yezhov, was recently killed in combat. 
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is slated to arrive on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) and PC in 2023. It was one of the many titles to get bitten by the delay bug and pushed into next year, a list you can check out here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On February 25, 2022 Valve quietly premiered a trailer for a game called Aperture Desk Job. The video intentionally didn’t explain what the game was, but beyond including the word Aperture in the title, it was clear it took place in the Portal universe. The end of the trailer revealed it would be releasing only a few days later, and it would be free.


As promised, the game released on March 1 and it feels like nobody played it, which is a shame because it is a fantastic, “Playable Short,” as Valve refers to it.
Aperture Desk Job doesn’t have portals in it, but it is a Portal game. It features an established Portal character, as well as a new character named Grady, voiced by one of my favorite comedians (and maybe yours after you watch the clip below), Nate Bargatze.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two of the year’s biggest open-world games, Elden Ring and Pokémon Scarlet have been Frankensteined into one tantalizing entity thanks to the work of one talented modder.
The modder in question goes by the handle Arestame, who tweeted a trailer of their handiwork that drops Scarlet assets into the Lands Between. The mod outfits the Tarnished in the significantly less protective garb of Pokémon trainers, who cruise the dangerous landscape atop the motorcycle-like Koraidon. The video highlights how Elden Ring would be an even better game if it had Lechonks and Quaxlys roaming about, though that doesn't make it any less dangerous, as evidenced by one particuarly brutal Pokémon ambush. Check out the video by clicking the embedded tweet below.

It’s unclear if this mod will be publicly available to download or if this video is only a proof-of-concept showcase. We’ve reached out to Arestame for clarification and will update this story if we receive a response.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a well-documented fact here at RPS that I love a good spreadsheet. Specifically, my spreadsheet that lists all the lovely games I manage to play each year. I've been looking at that spreadsheet a lot in recent weeks, and I'm pleased to report that most of my top game picks from this year have successfully made their way into the RPS Advent Calendar. There were plenty that didn't, of course (pouring one out for you, Dorfromantik, Flat Eye, Dome Keeper and Lost In Play), but such is the way of things when your current list of completed games for the year is teetering on the verge of 50. 
No word of a lie, I would probably be here all day if I laid out my entire long list of honourable mentions for 2022 (additional shoutouts to Railbound, Cursed To Golf, God Of War, Weird West, Jack Move, Hard West 2 and The Kids We Were), but for the sake of all involved (and poor Alice Bee's editing pencil), I've narrowed it down to a shortlist of three. (Do still go and check out those other games, though. They're all absolutely rad).

The thing is, though, when it comes to GOTY lists like our Advent Calendar, it’s a much bigger task to convince your fellow voters of the merits of your new favourite game when it’s the third, fourth, or maybe even sixteenth in its series. I’m adamant that those games deserve their share of recognition at the end of the year, which is why my honourable mentions celebrate 2022’s new entries into some of my favourite ongoing series.

We're each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he's away, we've prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.

You might already be familiar with one, and that's Jacob, the Lenny Kravitz-inspired character featured in the re-reveal trailer for Dead Island 2. During my cover story trip, I played roughly seven hours of Dead Island 2, but I didn't go hands-on with Jacob. I did, however, play a few hours with both Dani and Ryan, two very different survivors that add their own flair to the story of this zomb-pocalypse. 
I came out of this cover story trip convinced Dani is the survivor for me, but Ryan is great, too. And there are still the other four survivors I didn't get to play. Nonetheless, I want to tell you about Ryan, and Dambuster Studios does, too (read about Dani here)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Each mainline entry of the Street Fighter series is an important milestone in the fighting game genre. Though every numbered entry received critical acclaim, Street Fighter V sticks out among fans as the outlier of the series; the game experienced perhaps the most tumultuous launch of any Street Fighter game to date. But out of that trouble emerged something great. Thanks to the team’s persistence, post-launch roadmap, and an injection of new blood into the project's leadership, Street Fighter V drastically improved its core gameplay, online play, content offerings, and more throughout its six-year lifespan.
With the benefit of those lessons learned, many team members that righted the ship are back to develop Street Fighter 6. The latest entry delivers myriad improvements, new features, and a sleek new aesthetic while simultaneously acknowledging and paying homage to each entry before it. Street Fighter 6 feels like yet another evolution of the fighting game genre ushered in by the franchise that pioneered it in the first place. Read more...]]></summary>

Recovering from this high would become a personal struggle for the remainder of the year.
Elden Ring dominated my life. When I wasn’t playing it, it was the only thing I wanted to do. When I chipped away at other games for work or pleasure, tasks like gaining access to Raya Lucaria Academy or conquering Malenia were in the back of my mind. I stopped eating Red Lobster because it caused me to suffer terrible flashbacks of getting relentless…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just in time for the new year, Sony has revealed the next batch of free games coming to PlayStation Plus. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Fallout 76, and Axiom Verge 2 will be available to download for all tiers of PS Plus starting Tuesday, January 3. PlayStation has not announced the new titles coming to the Extra and Premium tiers, but says that they'll be "announced soon." You can read the full blog post here.
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a notable inclusion because its sequel, Jedi: Survivor, is set to come out in March. This PS Plus offering is an ideal opportunity for players to check out the first before visiting the second. If you played the game at launch, this is also a chance to check out the updates that introduced upgraded graphics and performance for PS5, as well as updates that added New Journey+ and challenge modes. You can read our original review here.
This is also a friendly reminder to claim December's PS Plus titles: Divine Knockout, Biomutant, and Mass Effect: Legendary Edition. They'll all be available until January 3, the day the new games are added, so be sure to grab them before that.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking back over an entire year of RPS reviews and, well, we've written a lot. Over the past twelve months, the RPS treehouse and our merry band of freelancers have reviewed 168 games in total - and that includes early access reviews, PC-port reviews, group reviews, reviews-in-progresses, and your common or garden fully-fledged reviews. 168! Damn. Even though game releases are still suffering from pandemic pushbacks, 2022 has been a busy year for games. There wasn't a huge number of big name releases - although the ones that did come out were plenty big enough - but, as always, we've had a wealth of wonderful indies releasing all year round, and we scooped up as many of them as we could.
Out of all the games we’ve given any kind of review treatment throughout the year, only a handful of them recieved RPS’s coveted Bestest Best badge; just 23, to be exact. I've gathered them all in one big round-up bundle below (there are round-ups of our favourite bits from other sections of the site, too), and they make a great collection of games. Have a scroll and click on any that take your fancy for the full review. Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat was not supposed to die. Many regard Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe as one of the lowest points of the series. Its minigame-centric fights and awkward movement were damning, but it also lacked the silly, over-the-top violence Mortal Kombat is known for – a sad reality for appeasing license holder Warner Bros. Batman can cripple impoverished criminals, but he can’t be cut in half by Tarkatan blades.
It would have been disappointing to end on an ill-fated crossover, but Midway’s untimely demise could have made that so. Layoffs, uncertainty, and publisher implosion aren’t how franchises live; it’s how they die. But the then-newly formed NetherRealm Studios reinvigorated the entire franchise after its darkest period with one of its most beloved entries: the 2011 reboot, Mortal Kombat 9. Read more...]]></summary>

I will click on any Trombone Champ video I come across online, however. Armed with some community-made modding tools, creative players have added custom songs to the game, with custom models and backgrounds. At their best, these videos turn a good joke into a complete comedy sketch. And the person making them at their best is Gloomhonk.

I have vague memories of seeing a TV commercial for the original PlayStation game when I was young and remember playing the game’s first few hours in a friend’s attic between Mat Hoffman’s Pro BMX sessions. It wasn’t until much later, when I found an inexpensive green label copy at a Circuit City, that I gave it another shot, but, again, I only made it through the first few hours. When Square Enix released it in such a way that I could play it on my PlayStation 3 and move it over to my PSP, I made it the furthest. I left Midgar, saved my game, and turned off my PSP, fully lying to myself that I would pick it back up again soon. That was more than 10 years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you walked into an arcade in the 1990s, it undoubtedly had a Street Fighter II cabinet. If you went at the right time, you probably even saw a crowd gathered around it. As one of the most profitable games in arcade history, Street Fighter II drew more than its fair share of quarters and tokens during the arcade heyday. But the franchise transcends that one moment in time. To say that Street Fighter has sparked multiple revolutions in its genre throughout its history is not far-fetched.
Arcades aren’t omnipresent the way they once were, but the Street Fighter name has endured the ever-shifting grounds of the games industry. The fierce fistfights made the leap from mall game rooms to the living room, the internet, and even tournaments broadcast to massive, international audiences. As the franchise turns 35 years old, we met with the people involved to understand the series’ origins and how it remains relevant three-and-a-half decades later. Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft’s road to acquire Activision Blizzard has been a rocky one, to say the least. The most recent (and significant) roadblock comes from the American Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which filed a lawsuit a few weeks ago to prevent the deal from going through. Now, Microsoft has fired back with a response, saying the FTC is violating their fifth amendment rights to due process. 
The full document (which you can read here) claims that the deal should be allowed to go through for several other reasons as well, stating that Xbox and Activision Blizzard are “just two of hundreds of game publishers.” The claims that the FTC violates the constitution are listed on page 34 and are just a handful of defenses against the lawsuit in a list of two dozen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The story of Cuphead is indie gaming legend. Brothers Chad and Jared Moldenhauer worked for years, risking their finances founding Studio MDHR and hiring a host of talented artists and animators to bring their tough-as-nails run ‘n’ gun game to life. The gamble paid off in spades. Inspired by both 1930s animation and classic games like Contra and Gunstar Heroes, Cuphead has sold more than six million copies, amassing critical acclaim, legions of fans, a TV show, and multiple world records along the way.
With Cuphead’s staggering success, it’s not too surprising the team at MDHR wanted to deliver one more serving of sharp shooting excitement and aggravation. Opting for DLC as opposed to a full-on sequel, the Cuphead developer set about outlining The Delicious Last Course, released in June 2022. Early in production, MDHR decided that a boss concept from the original game, one scrapped due to time constraints, would be the perfect starting point for this newest outing.

I joined team Arpus all the way back in February, and to say the last 11 months have been a whirlwind is a bit of an understatement. In less than a year I’ve made just under 90 videos covering a wide range of topics from major releases to international gaming events and brand-new hardware. My first year at RPS has been busy, basically. So when Katharine asked me to pull together a few of my personal highlights, I was kind of stumped. It's hard to pick favourites! It's even harder to celebrate my own achievements, but that's beside the point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don’t look at me, I’m just the hardware guy. But I do recommend looking at these, my favourite also-ran games that weren’t quite team-impressing enough to win a spot on the RPS Advent Calendar 2022. Out of everything I played this year, these are the avatars of adequacy, the sultans of satisfactory. The prime ministers of pretty good. 
I’d probably also tip a hat to Warhammer 40K: Darktide, but Alice0 already nabbed it for her honourable mentions, and frankly there’s enough shootybang stuff here as it is. But, also: toilet build quality testing, pushing Nazis into cement pits, and more than a hint of 70s funk. Check ‘em out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little known fact is that all of the RPS staff are complex clockwork automata, designed and built by a little gnome with the kind of inch-thick glasses that make your eyes look comically large. We're each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he's away, we've prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

You might already be familiar with one, and that's Jacob, the Lenny Kravitz-esque character featured in the re-reveal trailer for Dead Island 2. During my cover story trip, I played roughly seven hours of Dead Island 2, but I didn't go hands-on with Jacob. I did, however, play a few hours with both Dani and Ryan, two very different survivors that add their own flair to the story of this zomb-pocalypse. 
I came out of this cover story trip convinced Dani is the survivor for me, but Ryan was great, too. And there are still the other four survivors I didn't get to play. Nonetheless, I want to tell you about Dani, and Dambuster Studios does, too (read about Ryan here).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though it’s a remake of a game released in 2013 for the PlayStation 3, The Last of Us Part I is, in most respects, the same game as the original The Last of Us. Players first experiencing the game through the remake will understand the plot in much the same way. They follow the same story to the same conclusion, meeting the same characters and feeling many of the same feelings. They experience the same vision of a post-apocalyptic United States, where one traumatized man, Joel, reckons with his inability to part with his surrogate daughter, Ellie.
But even a remake sticking as close to the original script and general design of its original as Part I is, ultimately, a new game in its own right. By making a game look “better” than it did before, it’s changed into something else. Whether in small or large ways, it is altered. Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nier: Automata is coming to the small screen. Beginning next month, NieR:Automata Ver1.1a will begin airing in the United States on Crunchyroll.
You can check out a brand-new trailer for the show below: 


From the looks of it, Ver1.1a will stick close to the storyline from the video game, released in 2017 as a partnership between publisher Square Enix and developer Platinum Games. Series creator Yoko Taro is also involved with the project. 
The series is in production at A-1 Pictures, a subsidiary of Aniplex. In the past, the production house has worked on series such as Black Butler, Your Lie in April, Fate, and Sword Art Online. Ver1.1a is being directed by Ryoji Masuyama, who's previously worked on KILL la KILL, Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance and Evangelion: 3.0+1.01 Thrice Upon a Time, as well as Gurren Lagann.
NieR:Automata Ver1.1a will begin airing in Japan on January 7, 2023. As of right now, it's not entirely clear what day it will hit Crunchyroll. However, the streaming service does often have the right to begin showing anime in the west within 24 hours of their original airtimes, so time will tell if Nier gets the same treatment.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guides work is a very strange beast, and one that we don't talk about as often as we maybe should. By its nature, we here in guidestown can feel a bit isolated from the rest of RPS. Our guides aren't very visible to our regular readers. No one hops onto a website like this and says to themselves, "Well now! I wonder what guides have been written today that I can spend my time reading through!". The vast majority of people who read our guides come straight from a Google search into something specific like "Can I romance Yennefer and Triss at the same time?" (spoiler alert: you can, but it may not end well for you).
Because we operate so much behind the scenes, it's easy to miss some of the amazing stuff that the team did in guidestown this year. It ain't easy, writing a walkthrough or how-to that's useful for the reader while simultaneously appeasing those nebulous and mercurial SEO gods. But 2022 has been a stonkingly good year for guides, and I'd love to take a little bit of time to shine a light on some of the things we're most proud of having achieved this year - and to toast what will hopefully be another smashing year for guides in 2023!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The line between an amazing video game name and a terrible one is nebulous. Some game names try so hard that they loop back around and become good, despite being objectively bad. Some game names are good only in that they use cool words, but the vibe screams, “I was created in a vat overseen by a focus group.” And…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Radeon RX 6700 XT is an excellent 1440p graphics card, offering strong rasterised performance, a good image upscaler in FSR 2 and relatively cool and quiet operation. The card is much stronger pound for pound than its closest Nvidia competition, the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3070, with the latter remaining at surprisingly high prices due to the ultrapremium RTX 4080 and 4090 Team Green has launched so far. 
Today, the best price we've spotted for the RX 6700 XT is for a Gigabyte Eagle model, selling on Amazon UK for £389.99. That's nearly 40% below its RRP and an overall great value for this level of performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima has claimed his upcoming Death Stranding movie is "taking a direction that nobody has tried before with a movie adaptation of a game", arguing that other attempts to wring movies out of game-ies have failed because they "cater to gamers". His will be different, he says, because he's "taking the approach of changing and evolving the world of Death Stranding in a way that suits film well".
He also says there's "no real need" to turn games into films, which is a true and enjoyable acknowledgement from someone who is doing that.

        <updated>2022-12-23T17:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sports Story is available now, Nintendo and developer SideBar Games announced during a special Inside the House of Indies holiday video. The surprise launch comes a month and a half after the developer gave us a December 2022 release window for the long-awaited follow up to its 2017 smash hit, Golf Story.
Golf Story provided players a retro-styled RPG with a zany story centered around golf of all kinds: regular, disc, and more. Sports Story sees SideBar Games expand the formula to include various other athletic events, including BMX, tennis, cricket, soccer, volleyball, fishing, and more. If you loved the golf of Golf Story, don't worry: That sport carries over to Sports Story, bringing with it eight unique golf courses. 
You can see the full video, which also provides updates for Sea of Stars, Undying, and Dust & Neon, below.


Golf Story, SideBar Games' predecessor to Sports Story, arrived on Switch on September 28, 2017. In our review, we called it "a breath of fresh air for sports, and another fun story to follow for role-playing fanatics," awarding it a 9 out of 10. Sports Story was initially announced by SideBar Games in December 2019, with long stretches of silence from the development team. Then, during last month's Indie World Showcase from Nintendo, the developers finally announced that the game would arrive at some point in December 2022.
Sports Story is available now for Switch.]]></summary>

Gran Turismo: The Real Driving Simulator was released on PlayStation in Japan on December 23, 1997, meaning that the series has officially crossed the quarter-century mark. To celebrate 25 years of Gran Turismo, PlayStation released a special blog post and a retrospective video.
The blog post comes by way of Kazunori Yamauchi, creator and producer of the franchise and CEO of Polyphony Digital. In the post, Yamauchi recounts how the series came to be, with his original plans for the series stretching as far back as 1992.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit is a playable teaser released to promote Life Is Strange 2, the first episode of which followed on three months after this surprise p.t. dropped during E3 2018. Not to be confused with Silent Hills P.T. (it's like… the exact opposite of that), Captain Spirit is free to play, takes two to three hours to complete, and manages to perfectly encapsulate the Life Is Strange experience without giving anything away about the main (read: paid-for) games in the series. It also features possibly my favourite LIS protagonist in adorable wannabe superhero Chris, which is quite a high bar to clear, considering how much time I spend banging on about what great characters Chloe and Sean are.

Brothers Tarn and Zach Adams have spent the past 16 years relying on donations, so actually selling their game has now allowed to expand their team and hire someone from their community to help with the programming. They say "Putnam" will be the first non-Adam to ever see the code behind the curtain. Cue the Indiana Jones face-melting gif.
An update yesterday also added Steam trading cards, as well as giving you the option to flick between classic and premium graphics.

It is interesting to consider that I could try to wipe the website, delete loads of articles, do something to burn down my job. I don't particularly want to, but the coiled potential to do it exists, because I am unsupervised. There is no other member of staff between me and all of you. The great filter is removed. Any typos are on purpose. How you doin'?
This gives me a great opportunity, because I get to have, in a sense, the final word on RPS this year. There are a lot of posts coming up (if we include the Advent Calendar posts that have already gone, we have 50-ish bits of hashtag seasonal hashtag content this year, which I think is the most I've had to schedule for a Christmas break yet), but almost everything after this point is a scheduled post, made of time travel words written days or weeks ago. I'm live and uncensored, baby. I'm going to fire up Among Trees. Let's go and be alone together. But don't worry, I take my responisbility seriously, so I'll make sure the final word is a joke.

I have not done the maths, but I've seen enough graphs, tweets and analysis from people who have crunched the numbers to know there are more games coming out on Steam every day than a site like RPS could ever possibly hope to cover a single month, let alone every week. But gosh darn it if we don't try our hardest all the same. 
Inevitably, though, time does get the better of us sometimes (or, in my case at least, maybe my eyes are just too big for my gaming stomach), and certain games end up slipping further and further down our to-do lists until they eventually fall away entirely. Not through any fault of their own, mind. Just... time. But as a final parting shoutout for 2022, I wanted to memorialise all the games that fell of my personal to-do list this year and say, "I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN IT, I PROMISE!" (For real, though, I still want to talk about all of these at some point. Maybe January...? Please don't hate me)

If the goal is to repeat a course 20 times to trim 0.2 seconds off a number, and not to cackle like a petty chaos gremlin as you slam someone off the track at a tight corner, I am probably not going to enjoy myself much.
Rush Rally 3 isn't all that serious, but it's still on the wrong side of the tracks for me, I thought, before accidentally playing it for 3 hours. This is an excellent bundle of rally trials, challenges, and simple circuit racing with a cheerfully mid-2000s feel. I might prefer the messy nonsense of Trail Out, but if you value actual driving skill more highly, this is well worth your time.

But also it was December the 16th, so I saw fit to waste his time asking a bunch of fun seasonal questions that blended the love and goodwill of Baldur's Gate 3, with the companion-wrangling and clutch strategy of Christmas. D'you see what I did there?
My questions are in bold, and Vincke's answers are undeneath - and they are both amusing and instructive. I for one hope that Wyll's romcom visit home becomes a future winter DLC.

Perhaps it's because Christmas and VR headsets go together like mangers and Messiahs, or perhaps its because virtual reality is the only place I'm likely to see sunlight before March. In any case, if you're giving or receiving a pair of magic goggles this festive season, I'll be recommending a couple of stocking fillers to go with it at the end of this article.


First though, it's time for a more general bit of stocktaking. 2022 was a big ol' shrug of a year for VR gaming. Which is not to say it was bad, plenty of fun and interesting games launched in the last twelve months, one of which I'd probably put in my personal top ten. But from both a hardware and software perspective, nothing released this year is likely to shift the needle.

This news comes by way of a Steam blog post for the game that reveals this new update is available to download right now. It includes a new custom arcade mode, CRT and VCR filters, and additional fixes and changes to the game. 


"The update implements Custom Game options, granting ninjas greater control over their tubular battle against the Foot Clan through 11 mix-and-match modifiers reminiscent of the dip switches found on old school arcade machines," a press release reads. "Retro-themed filters and an extra large serving of refinements round out the surprise update, which reaches PC, PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox players today." 
Here is a look at the Custom Game options dip switch board: 
As you can see, it looks like there's plenty to mix and match to make each custom arcade session feel unique. If you're interested, be sure to boot the game up today and get the update downloading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Santa Monica Studio has announced that God of War Ragnarök, which hit PlayStation consoles last month, is getting a New Game Plus mode in spring. 
This news comes by way of a short and sweet tweet posted today by the studio that says Spring 2023 is when fans can expect the feature to hit Ragnarök. As for what to expect, though, that remains unknown – Santa Monica Studio says it'll "share more details once we get closer to the release." 


While many had hoped Ragnarök would launch with a New Game Plus mode built-in, its arrival after the game's release isn't surprising. God of War (2018) received its New Game Plus mode after launch as well. For now, we wait until next spring. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's God of War Ragnarök review and then read about how the game's director fought to keep its most unexpected and cartoonish character in the game. Check out this story about how Kratos voice actor Christopher Judge originally quit when he learned someone else was directing Ragnarök after that and then read about how Amazon Prime Video has ordered a God of War TV series set during the Norse era. 
Are you going to replay God of War Ragnarök using this New Game Plus mode next year? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chained Echoes is a retro Japanese-inspired RPG set in a world of dragons and mech suits. It seemingly already has the scope of the 16-bit games that inspired it, but that doesn't mean there aren't post-release updates to come. Its developer is now working on a New Game Plus mode.

By contrast, Sail Forth looks more my speed, with its enormous sea creatures, secretive faction of frogs in submarines, and a wind system itd developers claim is "deeply accessible". It's out now and there's a launch trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nope, you don't need to get your eyes tested. Alt254 is a minimalist action adventure game that plays out on a small (albeit greatly enlarged) map that measures just 21x26 pixels. In this tiny space, you, a black dot, must venture forth, solving puzzles, deciphering the strange, colourful world around you and piecing together your broken memory along the way. It's a very enigmatic little game, but one that's instantly charming in its old-school vibes and artfully constructed world. Its soundtrack is a bit of a corker, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 3 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
Episode 1 - The Harry Mason Shuffle
Episode 2- When Doves Cry
Episode 3 - Bible.
Episode 4 - Age Seven, Short, Black Hair


In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.
If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

I was wrong. Don’t look shocked, it happens. Today sees three of the earliest Fallout games being offered up for nothing. They’re Fallout: A Post-Nuclear Role-Playing Game, Fallout 2, and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood Of Steel. I already own all three elsewhere, as you might well too, but if you don’t then it’s a good way of picking up three classics of 90s PC gaming.

Have a watch of the trailer below to see just how bizarre this crossover is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tradition is a transformative power. Often unintentionally, something happens during an event and, if people want, it becomes more than an occurrence, it becomes part of the event. They repeat it, and they share it with other people in their lives and hearts, and the tradition grows. Often the original food/game/gesture/saying/joke/whatever had nothing to do with the event's core, and that doesn't matter. Sometimes it simply brings joy and feels right. For example, the use of 1956 pop song Green Door in free festive indie game Dracula Cha Cha feels so right that to me, it is a Christmas song. Green Door has run through my head for weeks, and it is once again time for the annual go on Dracula Cha Cha.

You can expect some extra stability compared to the previous version of the update, something that’ll always be welcome on my PC. Along with Roach’s early Christmas present of some stabilisers, the hotfix also tackles the annoying bug that caused toxicity to be stuck at max level, along with some minor tweaks to photo mode, and unexplained improvements for The Witcher 3’s performance on Steam Deck.

But given the game's subject centres on the depiction of women on film, and their exploitation in the film industry by male creators, it felt appropriate to examine it from the extremely talented femme members of the team. That means not just the star Marissa Marcel herself, played by the award-winning Manon Gage, but other women and non-binary creatives who played different roles in bringing this game to life.

Maybe that’s why I’m not one – Portal with RTX is a gorgeous return to Aperture Science, a borderline must-play for anyone with a premium GeForce RTX GPU, and a mightily impressive demonstration of the Nvidia RTX Remix tools that built it.
Admittedly, that’s in spite of some shortcomings, including utterly broken performance on even the strongest Radeon RX graphics cards. Equip yourself with RTX hardware, however, and this free mod is a real Christmas treat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!
Published in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. 
A new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.
Solve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!
Our reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are pleased to announce that ScummVM now supports Adibou 2, a popular educational game developed by Coktel Vision in 1996.
Designed for children from 4 to 7 years old, the world of Adibou is warm and full of surprises. It offers an intelligent and appealing introduction to essential knowledge like reading and math.
Whether you have young kids in your family, or are keen on reliving your childhood memories for a while, fetch the latest daily build of ScummVM, your own copy of Adibou 2, and start learning having fun with Adibou, Plop, Robitoc and Kicook!
You must copy the content of your Adibou “Environment” CD into the game directory added to ScummVM. Then, for any Adibou Application you want to add, just copy the content of their CD into a freely named subdirectory of the main game directory.
Only Read/Count 4-5 years, Read/Count 6-7 years applications are supported for now, but we hope Science, Music and English will come soon.
Currently ScummVM is aware of several Adibou versions in French, German and English, let us know if you own any language/version not yet registered. Please also report to the issue tracker any glitch you may encounter.
