Evil Dead has been a fascinating franchise to follow, with a unique blend of elements ranging from the truly gory and gruesome to raucous comedy and creativity. Since its horrific beginnings with Evil Dead, the brand has blossomed into a true multimedia empire, spanning multiple films, a TV show, and more. Today, Saber Interactive and Boss Team Games look to enter the emergent asymmetric horror market with Evil Dead: The Game, which operates in a decidedly different fashion than other options out there.

Each one has a particular flavor, which you can learn about in our preview of the set from last week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a years-long wait, Stranger Things’ penultimate fourth season kicks off this summer. Releasing in two parts, the season's first full-length trailer sets the table for dangers new and old the heroes of Hawkins must contend with. 
The story picks up several months after the events of 2019's Season 3. A powerless Eleven and the Byers family have moved to California. Hopper is being held captive in Russia. Our remaining friends must pick up the pieces while starting high school. Naturally, the ongoing supernatural menace and the sinister government conspiracy attached to it continue to haunt the world’s unluckiest small town. Per a warning to Eleven in the trailer: “a war is coming. Your friends in Hawkins are very much in the eye of a storm.”

Stranger Things 4 consists of nine episodes, each with a runtime twice as long as before. Because the episodes are supersized, they’ll be divided and released in two batches that are five weeks apart. Volume 1 premieres on May 27, and Volume 2 arrives on July 1. It's unknown how many episodes are in each volume, but one would imagine it's a clean split, so four/five each. 
Earlier this year, Netflix renewed Stranger Things for a 5th and final season. The last season currently has no premiere date. For more on Stranger Things, you can read about its recent crossovers with Far Cry 6 and Magic: The Gathering.]]></summary>

A new update for Halo: The Master Chief Collection is now live and it includes a number of bug fixes and improvements for the overall experience. Perhaps more exciting, though, is the addition of new Halo 3: ODST firefight variants such as Floodfight, which pits you against Flood enemies, and Halo 3 cross-platform co-op. 
Clocking in at roughly 22 gigabytes on Xbox consoles, this update is one of the biggest in recent memory for MCC, especially as much of 343 Industries continues its focus on the latest Halo game, Halo Infinite. Here’s what’s …]]></summary>

Publisher 505 Games and developers Rabbit & Bear Studios and NatsumeAtari announced a release date for their upcoming game, Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising. If you're an RPG fan, that's probably made your ears perk up a bit, hasn't it?
You might remember the Kickstarter and announcement for Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes back in 2019. This game is pitched to be a successor to Konami's long-abandoned Suikoden series and is being created with the franchise's creator Yoshitaka Murayama at the helm. Originally slated for a 2022 release, that game has been pushed back to next year, and not only that, we still don't know whether we're getting it on Switch.

It's one of my gaming shames that I've never touched Square Enix's hallowed RPG series, and I've been wanting to dig into something really meaty for many months now. Sure, I've got about 30 unplayed RPGs ready and waiting on Switch (now organised in a neat 'Backlog' folder), but 3DS games have been on my mind of late, so it seemed prudent to snap up Dragon Quest VII and VIII before they skyrocket into silly money like the DS entries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Plus multiple routes. Which will you go for?
Swords, spears, and axes at the ready! Nintendo has dropped a brand new action-packed Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes trailer. We got a sneaky little look at the game over the weekend courtesy of an Amazon Japan listing, but this is the first big look since the game's reveal during the February 2022 Nintendo Direct.
This trailer is absolutely feeding Fire Emblem: Three Houses fans and finally gives us a proper look at our new protagonist, Shez. This purple-haired warrior - who you can choose to be male or female - seems much cockier and self-assured than Three Houses' Byleth. Given the trailer's name, 'Mysterious Mercenary', and Shez's declaration during the trailer that his "pockets have been feeling awfully light, lately", it sounds like they will be the titular mercenary. Though Three Houses fans will remember that Byleth and their mentor Geralt were also originally mercenaries.

We're in an era where exclusives are typically timed, which is a wonderful thing for those of us that don't have every console at our disposal. Eventually most fascinating and fun games make their way around to Switch and other platforms, especially in the Indie space - now we can add former PlayStation / Epic Games exclusive Bugsnax to that list. It's confirmed for Switch and will be arriving, along with a free DLC expansion called The Isle of Bigsnax, on 28th April priced at $24.99USD.
One of the Indie highlights of the PS5 launch in late 2020 and included in PlayStation Plus for the new system (it arrived without inclusion in PS Plus on PS4, as well), it was a much talked about and streamed game at the time. It's the creation of Young Horses, the studio that first came to prominence with Octodad: Dadliest Catch. The hook in Bugsnax is that you're trying to capture an assortment of creatures that are (yep) walking snacks, with all sorts of quirky methods and requirements to do so. Its humour and creativity were certainly key contributors to its buzz.

Not, like, groundbreaking or anything, but hey, not everything needs to be. Biota has some platforming, some shooting, some bits where you drive mechs and submarines. It keeps things simple and it largely works, making for a game that's an inoffensive 8bit romp with flashes of greatness.

Nintendo has released a new Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes trailer that showcases the “mysterious mercenary” players will control when the musou hits Switch on June 24. 
Aptly titled the “Mysterious Mercenary Trailer,” it begins with a spar or all-out fight between the female version of Byleth and a purple-haired male warrior. Byleth clearly has the advantage here and later in the trailer, it’s revealed they’re the Ashen Demon, presumably helping the game’s main antagonist, the Ashen Dragon. However, before that reveal, we learn that the purple-haired warrior is Shez, the protagonist players will control in Three Hopes. Like Fire E…]]></summary>

One thing I've been playing recently is Ghostwire: Tokyo, a ghost huntin' action game that's a bit less weird and a bit more "kind of like an Ubisoft game" than I was expecting. But I like Ubisoft games just fine, so I'm having a blast - plus there are still some clutch ghost fights to be hand when I run out of finger-ammo for my magic hands.
I am extra delighted by the animals, though. For whatever reason, they are unaffected by the evil fog that has swept through Tokyo and turned everyone into spirits, so there are a few dogs and cats just sitting around and (and this is the good bit) you can read their thoughts.

It's actually where the company was making playing cards and began exploring going into toys and gadgets. So it's a significant site for Nintendo's history, having been there since 1889.

We were hoping we'd have a brand new Breath of the Wild game to explore this year, but as you'll likely remember, the sequel was delayed to Spring 2023 just a few weeks ago. But in the UK, at least, it looks like a lot of people are more than happy to wait.

But I can tell you that they're clearly trying to evoke Annihilation vibes, with the trailer channeling that blown-out synth sound and scattering humanlike inhuman mineral figures across the landscape. Annihilation is a good mood to channel. I hope the third-person explore-o-melee game does turn out a bit like that when it arrives in 2023.

Spike Chunsoft. Inc has released new information regarding the two separate game modes that you can expect to sample in Made in Abyss: Binary Star Falling into Darkness when it launches on Switch later this year.
The first is called 'HELLO ABYSS', which essentially allows you to relive the anime while learning the basic systems and how to progress the game; think of it like a substantial tutorial for the other game mode. You'll control the anime's main protagonist Riko, who - alongside the human-like robot Reg - must navigate to the bottom of a colossal hole known as the Abyss.

        <updated>2022-04-12T07:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Nacon has announced Rogue Factor's newest title in the works is called Hell is Us, with former Eidos Montreal Art Director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête on the project as creative director. Jacques-Belletête has previously worked on games such as Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Mankind Divided and worked on concepts for Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy before transitioning over to Rogue Factor. The debut teaser trailer for Hell is Us can be seen below.
Hell is Us is described as an action-adventure set inside a country in the midst of a civil war where the main character will fight against creatures caused by a mysterious event the locals call "the Calamity." He'll have to use special weapons and equipment to take on these monsters that resemble monuments scattered across the nation in order to survive and learn more about his history in this land.

"Our goal with Hell is Us is to bring back true adventure and exploration," says Jacques-Belletête in a press release provided to Game Informer. "There's no need for a detailed quest log or precise waypoint on the map: we want players to feel the thrill of adventure, guided by their feelings and instincts."
 The first game from Rogue Factor since we acquired it is also one of our most ambitious projects, and we can't wait to reveal more about it in the coming months."
We'll have more on Hell is Us soon, including an exclusive preview where we speak with Jonathan Jacques-Belletête about his vision for the project. Hell is Us is being developed using Unreal Engine 5 and is planned for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2023.]]></summary>

I've become a big fan of it in that time - it's spacious, easy to build in, cool and clean - and the only real downside is the price.
The case debuted late last year for a princely £240, expensive even for a large form factor case, but now it's down to £175 - a more reasonable ask given its full tower size and laundry list of features, which I'll tell you about presently.

To the delight of many a fan, Square Enix announced Kingdom Hearts IV yesterday. The tantalizing cinematic trailer showed off a more mature-looking Sora exploring a realistic human city invaded by Heartless. Naturally, the video raised countless questions, but it also led us to gush about the things we want to see in the hotly-anticipated sequel.
That’s why we, the Kingdom Hearts fans in the Game Informer office, couldn’t help but share our personal hopes and dreams for the next game. Let us know what you think of our wishlists, and be sure to share your own desires and expectations down in the comments!

2017's Hello Neighbor gained a bit of a cult following thanks to its popularity in streaming and on YouTube, and since then, fans have been clamoring for a sequel. With that sequel now announced and a release date in sight – December 6 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC – developer tinyBuild has released a beta to tide fans over until later this year.

Anyone can access the beta, so long as they preorder the game, and what you'll find is not a look at the final version of Hello Neighbor 2 but instead a look at what the game is shaping up to be. tinyBuild has promised that the beta is spoiler-free and does not contain story elements from the final game. It's more like a scenario meant to showcase what the game looks like today, what some of its mechanics feel like, who some of the people in Raven Brooks are, and more. Game Informer editor Wesley LeBlanc went hands-on with this demo, and today, he's joined by fellow associate editor John Carson to discuss the first 11 minutes of it. 
For more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for early looks at Cult of the Lamb, Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers, Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong, Forspoken, and so much more! Thanks for watching today's video.]]></summary>

SonSon will be the game available for free when downloading the collection. Those who preorder or purchase the upcoming Capcom Fighting Collection will recieve a bonus copy of Three Wonders when Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium launches.
The original Capcom Arcade Stadium included 32 arcade titles that were purchasable piecemeal after downloading the base game along with 1942 for free. Other games in the first collection include Final Fight, Ghouls 'n Ghosts, Strider, Street Fighter 2: Hyper Fighting, Bionic Commando, and Captain Commando. Games cost $1.99 apiece or can be purchased in various bundles. Capcom has not talked about whether pricing will remain the same, but given the wording in the announcement tweet, the individual sale of games will remain the plan for this iteration as well.

They say that the true definition of madness is repeating the same action and hoping for a different result. Well, good news! OXIDE Room 104 won't make you do that. Instead, you'll be repeating the same action and hoping against all hope that something new will happen — something new that isn't your legs getting sawn off or some awful mouth-beast trying to eat you. Fun!
If you're not a fan of gore and body-horror, this is most definitely not the game for you, as you'll have to work through tough decisions and quick-time events to try to avoid all the horrible fates that await you, and if you fail, you'll wake up in the same bathtub in Room 104, and you'll have to start fresh... but the motel you're trapped in will change with every new escape attempt. Oh, and you're being stalked by a "hideous creature" who really wants you dead. Double fun!

The PlayStation maker, which already has a minority interest in Epic, has thrown $1 billion at the Unreal and Fortnite developer to create “new social entertainment exploring the connection between digital and physical worlds," according to a press release.

The press release states that today's investment would bring Epic's estimated valuation to 31.5 billion.

The Switch library has most genres and game types covered, including titles that encourage us to slow down, assess clues and solve mysteries. Frogwares is a developer well known in this area for its Sherlock games, though it made its Switch debut with the very solid port of original IP The Sinking City in 2019. In more recent months the company has been busy bringing two Sherlock Holmes titles to the system, a series that has done a great deal to establish the studio for over a decade.
It was only in February that we had Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments, and now the latest arrival is its successor Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter; in terms of game entries of the last few years, Switch is now only missing the studio's latest work - Sherlock Holmes Chapter One. In the here and now there are plenty of crimes to solve for Holmes fans on Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake processors are among the best gaming CPUs you can buy, but certain owners have noticed a seemingly worrisome trend: their LGA 1700 motherboard socket puts so much pressure on the chip that its IHS (integrated heat spreader, the big grey bit on top) starts to bend. This isn’t so much a concern for the CPU’s structural integrity as it is a cooling issue, as a non-flat IHS will struggle to transfer heat to the CPU cooler plate as effectivity.


In a statement to Tom’s Hardware, however, an Intel spokesperson has essentially said it’s not as bad as it sounds. The statement does acknowledge the warping (or “deflection”, to use Intel’s more engineer-y term), but says there’s no evidence thus far to suggest it drives load temperatures up to unsafe levels.

Kingdom Hearts 4 was surprise-revealed yesterday during a 20th Anniversary announcement trailer for the series, which is where Square Enix also revealed that it was developing Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link, a new mobile game for the franchise. 
The reveal of Kingdom Hearts was quite extensive and you can read Game Informer’s full breakdown of it here, but one thing that couldn’t go unnoticed was the new visual style. Featuring a much more realistic look, especially compared to the cartoony nature of previous Kingdom Hearts games, this new sequel looks beautiful.

Wii Sports solidified the power of motion-control gameplay and catapulted Nintendo’s seventh-generation home console to immediate superstardom (it’s no wonder the cartoony sports simulator cracked our Top 25 Wii Games). And while the Resort follow-up garnered critical and commercial success, the magic of its predecessor remained unmatched. Fast-forward 16 years and Switch Sports’ launch is finally on the horizon. I tried my hand at the activities (old and new) scattered throughout Spocco Square, and here are my thoughts on each.

Kingdom Hearts 4 was surprise-revealed yesterday during a 20th Anniversary stream for the series, which is also where Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link, a new mobile game for the franchise, was announced. 
Now that fans have had a days’ time to pour over every shot in the Kingdom Hearts 4 trailer and speculate on what this or that means, some people are beginning to think the Forest Moon of Endor, the fan-favorite Star Wars location from Episode VI, is teased in it. If you recall, the Kingdom Hearts 4 reveal showcases some beautiful shots of nature – lots of green foliage, a small creek, perhaps some Redwood trees. That description sounds a lot like Endor, right? That’s probably not enough to call the shot, though, but some fan…]]></summary>

I am mildly distressed to see KH4 lean towards a 'realistic' art style in parts, though I would be curious to see a Kingdom Hearts Mickey Mouse that's just a wee mouse wrapped in leather, plaid, buckles, and zips. While KH4 is largely a mystery for now, eagle-eyed viewers think the announcement trailer hints at a crossover with the Disney Princess world of Star Wars.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2D bullet hell game Vampire Survivors is surely one of the most interesting success stories of the year, as what was a simple mobile game became popular almost overnight. Its very minimalistic roguelike style captured players looking for something casual, but still engrossing. You pick one of several characters and move them around the screen as they auto-attack. As enemies are disposed of the player levels up, along with changing weapons and gaining power-ups, with the ultimate goal being to keep the ever growing mob of enemies under control. On death you unlock new weapons and characters by spending coins gained in battle.


While the game currently sits on Steam with an “overwhelmingly popular” based on almost 70k reviews, success is definitely not what solo developer Luca Galante was expecting when he first started working on it.

Now that Season 3 of Video Gameography is complete, and the Uncharted series has been, well...charted, we're diving below the depths and soaring above the clouds to spotlight the Bioshock series in Season 4. This week we welcome our guest Bryan Vore back on the show as we take to the skies and explore the last game in this unfortunately short trilogy, Bioshock Infinite.
Bioshock Infinite started pre-production around the same time as Bioshock 2, but while 2K Marin was exploring the depths of the seas once again, Ken Levine and his team at 2K Boston/Irrational Games had their heads in the clouds. Focusing on American exceptionalism, Bioshock Infinite introduces players to the floating city of Columbia, an engineering feat inspired by the World's Fair attractions of yesteryear. We discuss the troubling development that miraculously came together late in the process as well as the main characters, Booker DeWitt and Bioshock's first constant companion in Elizabeth. And listen until the end as we reveal what's in store for the next season of Video Gameography!
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), and former Game Informer Editor Bryan Vore (@Bryan_Vore) as we unpack the history and narrative of the final Bioshock released to date!
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

The Quarry is an upcoming game from Supermassive Games, and it’s a spiritual successor to 2015’s Until Dawn. Unlike Until Dawn, which puts players in the roles of multiple characters stuck in a winter mountain cabin, The Quarry is riffing on the classic “teenagers without supervision at summer camp” trope. 
It’s doing it with an impressive voice cast, too, including the likes of David Arquette (the Scream series), Lin Shaye (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Insidious), Ted Raimi (the Evil Dead Series, Candyman, The Grudge), Ariel Winter (Modern Family),…]]></summary>

Pokud jde o digitální zařízení, Parlament upozorňuje, že aktualizace softwaru by měly být vratné a neměly by vést ke snížení výkonu například chytrých telefonů.

A few weeks ago, spring's annual crack of the bat was in question as MLB's lockout dragged on. The players and league eventually came to an agreement, and the season was delayed slightly, but no games will be lost. As of this writing, we are just a week away from the first pitch being thrown on April 7. Sony's MLB The Show series usually hits a few weeks in advance of the MLB season starting, but this year's installment hits the streets just two days before it on April 5 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation …]]></summary>

Following a disastrous debut trailer, in which the iconic blue hedgehog looked far removed from his appearance in every other form of media, the studio went back to the drawing board. Instead of discouraging the filmmakers, the backlash motivated director Jeff Fowler and the rest of the team to pay more attention to the enthusiastic fan base.
“They were absolutely right to request us to work harder and to make adjustments,” Fowler says. “And then to come out the other side and for everyone to be able to high five and celebrate, it felt like we ended in a place where they were happy, and the film was a film that they could embrace. Now, moving forward, it just feels like we have this really wonderful relationship with the fans…]]></summary>

The Halo series has been a wild ride through the first two episodes. We've seen a maskless Chief, beautiful Reach and High Charity recreations, and everything in between. But after last week's rough episode, the show could only get better, right? Join us on a special episode of The Game Informer Show as we review "Emergence," the third entry of the new Paramount Plus show starring Master Chief and company.

Starscourge Radahn is easily one of Elden Ring’s hardest bosses, especially now that he’s back to his usual high-damage output following the fix of a recent bug. There are tons of great strategies to defeat him but what if you could have Radahn just defeat himself. 
Well, one Elden Ring player – izuoku_ on Twitter – discovered a way to have Radahn defeat himself with just one of his own moves, as reported by IGN. Now, before you scoff at this method and call it a “cheese,” one, who cares? If From Software wanted to remove cheesier elements from Elden Ring, it would, but i…]]></summary>

While we all await DLC for it that Capcom announced was happening last June, prominent and well-proven Resident Evil leaker-insider Dusk Golem has revealed some new information about Moreau’s swamp area in Resident Evil Village. 
More specifically, Dusk Golem reports that Moreau’s section featured mermaid-like enemies at one point before a lot of content was cut from this area of the game. The content cuts happened because Moreau’s ar…]]></summary>

Xbox and 343 Industries announced last month that Season 2 of Halo Infinite’s multiplayer is called Lone Wolves and would begin on May 3. Now, the studio has released a quick trailer to showcase some of what players can expect in it. 
Titled “Season 2 Announce – Lone Wolves,” this trailer is short and sweet. It’s less a trailer highlighting all that awaits players in Season 2 and more a trailer meant to build some hype for the new season, which is now less than a month away. However, there are some things that stand out in it, like new cosmetics and most excitingly, new …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we were putting together our most anticipated games of 2022 list back in January, there was one game I knew had to be on it: Mojiken Studio’s A Space For The Unbound. It’s a slice of life adventure about two Indonesian high school students set in the late 90s, and the demo (which has recently been expanded to include the first chapter in addition to its short prologue) instantly captivated me when I first played it a couple of years ago. There are some light supernatural elements that will be instantly familiar to anyone who’s watched the films of Japanese anime directors Makoto Shinkai and Mamoru Hosoda (including a giant, ominous Your Name-style comet, no less), but for the most part this is a much more grounded game than Mojiken have made in the past, such as the fantastical point and click puzzlers She And The Light Bearer and When The Past Was Around. 
Indeed, the only game in their back catalogue that has a recognisable, real-life setting is their short, free browser game Banyu Lintar Angin. Born out of an internal game jam project in 2017, Banyu Lintar Angin once again draws inspiration from the studio’s home country of Indonesia. It only takes a couple of minutes to play, but speaking with its creator Dimas Novan, it was vital in sowing the seeds for what A Space For The Unbound would eventually become.

Nintendo just added a new Dread Mode and Rookie Mode to Metroid Dread last month alongside news that a Boss Rush mode would be added to the game in an April update. That update is now live in Metroid Dread and it brings not just one boss rush mode, but three to the game. 
Marking the second free update for Metroid Dread, this new April update adds Boss rush, Survival Rush, and Dread Rush. Plus, it adds a Practice Mode that lets you practice battles against the many bosses found throughout Samus’ latest journey.

Earlier this summer, the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise turned 30 years old. Sega marked the occasion by holding a Sonic Central stream that teased three new projects (Sonic Colors: Ultimate, Sonic Origins, and an untitled mainline Sonic game) in May, followed by a special 30th-anniversary concert featuring an orchestra playing classic Sonic music.
With the bulk of the celebrations in the rear-view mirror, we caught up with five longtime developers from Sonic Team. Ranging from directors and producers to composers and artists, we covered the spectrum to learn about each individual's unique experiences with the franchise, as well as what 30 years of Sonic means to them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Sonic the Hedgehog 2 launched on Sega Genesis in 1992, it took the foundation laid with the Blue Blur's debut entry and expanded it in myriad ways. In the 16-bit sequel, Sonic had new moves and a two-tailed fox friend to aid him, but with those upgrades came more significant threats from the evil Dr. Robotnik. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 on Genesis was immediately regarded as a definite upgrade over the already strong first entry in the series. Similarly, Paramount's Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie expands the universe established by its predecessor and delivers a better overall film thanks to bigger action setpieces, laugh-out-loud gags, and some terrific fanservice moments.

Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog has long been one of the most recognizable names in gaming. Whether you're talking about multiple long-running comic series, the multitude of animated shows, or the recent live-action universe, it's hard not to know who Sonic the Hedgehog is. However, no matter his omnipresence in multimedia, Sega's mascot will always be known, first and foremost, for his gaming legacy.
The Blue Blur has had his shares of ups and downs, but when Sonic games are at their best, they rival the best the platforming genre has to offer. …]]></summary>

Cellar Door Games has revealed that Rogue Legacy 2, its upcoming roguelite sequel to Rogue Legacy that hit Early Access in 2020, will launch into 1.0 this month. 
More specifically, Rogue Legacy 2 will hit Steam and the Epic Games Store on April 28. If you haven’t yet played the first Rogue Legacy, you can do so now as it's a free game on Epic Games Store from April 7 through April 14. To celebrate today’s news, Cellar Door Games has released a new trailer on IGN showcasing some of what awaits players in the roguelite.

“Rogue Legacy 2 is finally reaching v1.0 and we couldn’t be happier with how it turned out,” Cellar Door Games writes in a press release. “Our goal for Rogue Legacy 2 was always to make ‘Rogue Legacy 3’ because we didn’t want to settle for just more. It had to stay true to the original, but also stand on its own as something new. After nearly four years of development, bringing it to the fans is the final step in this long journey, and we hope they find it as special as we do.” 
The sequel features a new art style – namely, 3D characters set against hand-drawn 2.5D backgrounds – new weaponry, abilities and classes, environments, and more. It also introduces Heirlooms to the series and Cellar Door Games says this pushes that “unique Metroidvania feel by permanently giving heroes new abilities.” 
“Alongside this, Rogue Legacy 2 vastly improves traits to bring greater value to their risk versus reward gameplay, as well as making significant strides in accessibility to let players succeed even when they’re struggling.” 
Be sure to check out these new screenshots from Rogue Legacy 2 while waiting for its 1.0 release on Steam and Epic Games Store on April 28.

The newest Magic: The Gathering set brings Planeswalkers to a whole new plane and the bustling city of angels and demons called New Capenna. The city is run by five families, each with a demon at the head of the table, controlling various aspects of the metropolis' economy. Streets of New Capenna harnesses the golden-age feel of the roaring '20s full of glitz and glamor juxtaposed by a nefarious criminal element, all vying for control of a mysterious magical substance called Halo.

When Gran Turismo 7 launched, it marked the release of another great entry in the long-running simulation racing franchise. However, after some time, players began to realize that cars in GT7 cost a lot more in-game credits than previous games. 
Furthermore, after an update that decreased credits and rewards earned for some races took the game offline for more than 24 hours, players grew even more frustrated with some of the decisions developer Polyphony Digital made. So much so that Polyphony Digital president Kazunori Yamauchi published an apology that contained promises to fix the game’s econ…]]></summary>

Previous Sega Genesis and Nintendo 64 titles that have become available with the expansion include Paper Mario, Banjo-Kazooie, F-Zero X, Alien Soldier, Super Fantasy Zone, and Light Crusader. Mario Golf was well-received when it initially launched in 1999. A bevy of playable characters, including the titular plumber and his mainstay companions (Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, etc.) alongside several courses rendered in 3D for the first time in the golf-centric series impressed and excited a large swath of fans. 
Get into the swing! ⛳

April 7, 2022
Moreover, wind strength, weather, and direction added nuance to the loop, making shots more rewarding. This success continued with the recent Mario Golf: Super Rush, released on Switch in 2021. Nintendo aficionado Brian Shea reviewed Super Rush and gave it an 8.25, saying:
“Despite the underwhelming nature of the story mode, Mario Golf: Super Rush delivers plenty of golfing greatness. With a strong foundation and multiple fun avenues of play, Mario Golf: Super Rush carries on the long-standing tradition of Nintendo sports games by being a good time regardless of your fandom of the actual sport.”

Now, players that might’ve missed out on one of the definitive entries in the Mario Golf series will be able to get a hole-in-one on the blocky prairies of the Nintendo 64 title on April 15. Hopefully, more Camelot Software Planning games will become available or even remastered (we’re looking at you, Golden Sun!).]]></summary>

Cult of the Lamb debuted during Gamescom last year, and it quickly grabbed our attention due to its unique art style, fantastic score, and mix of fast-paced action roguelike gameplay with Animal Crossing-style base-building mechanics. Game Informer editors Alex Stadnik and Wesley LeBlanc recently went hands-on with Cult of the Lamb, playing through the game's first 20 minutes. 
In this installment of New Gameplay Today, Alex and Wesley discuss everything about those first 20 minutes, including how the gameplay feels, how well the two disparate gameplay mechanics in base-building and roguelike action come together, the score, the visual style, and more. And today's New Gameplay Today is extra special because they're joined by Massive Monster creative director Julian Wilton, who discusses the game's development and answers all the questions they had for him.

If you're excited about Cult of the Lamb, this New Gameplay Today can tide you over until the game's release, which is set to happen sometime this year when it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This past Wednesday (April 5) marked the end of Ghost Recon Breakpoint updates. A tweet posted on the game's official Twitter account states, "We will continue to maintain our servers for both Ghost Recon Wildlands and Ghost Recon Breakpoint, and we truly hope you will continue to enjoy the game and have fun playing in solo or co-op with your friends." Despite Breakpoint's end, a new Ghost Recon game has entered development. 
According to Kotaku, the next bombastic chapter in Tom Clancy's illustrious military universe is codenamed OVER. The title has reportedly been in the works for over a year now and could launch in 2023. As far as the fandom is concerned, this fast turnaround could be a good thing. Recent Ghost Recon experiences haven't found the same success as other Tom Clancy titles like Rainbow Six and The Division. Breakpoint, for instance, might have alienated its players after Ubisoft implemented its NFT-based Quartz beta into the shooter's cosmetic rotation.
The only announced and showcased mainline Ghost Recon game around the corner is Frontline, "a massive first-person PVP shooter with epic 100+ player battles" throughout a sandbox called Drakemoor Island. You can read more about the live-service game here. With XDefiant also on the horizon, it's worth pondering if the live-service model might also be a focus for the mysterious OVER project. Only time will tell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The makers of Lego are teaming up with Fortnite creators Epic Games to build some sort of "metaverse" play space. I think that means they're making an online Lego game, a concept which has existed many times before, but they don't really say what it is they're up to. In lieu of explanation, they repeat the word "metaverse".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You’d be forgiven for getting excited about the AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT. A brand new RDNA 2 graphics card, with ray tracing support, that’s both easy to find in stock and available at a comparatively approachable £200 / $230? In the midst of a years-long components shortage, exacerbated by all manner of price-gouging bollocks, it’d be entirely understandable if upgrade-starved PC owners went for this like my cat goes for unattended crisp packets. Especially if they’re happy to stick to playing at 1080p.


Alas, the RX 6500 XT isn’t just an inferior low-end option to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 (one of the best graphics cards, and perhaps the outright best for budget builds right now). It’s an offputtingly slow, sometimes bizarrely-designed GPU in general; instead of providing long-overdue relief to a truly fudged hardware market, it ends up feeling like more an attempt to just sell any old second-rate kit to an audience that’s been left desperate for something, anything that’s new and somewhat affordable.

Warner Bros. Games and Turtle Rock Studios have released a new trailer for the upcoming Back 4 Blood DLC expansion, Tunnels of Terror, and it features a look at two new Cleaners, new Warped Ridden, and more. 
Back 4 Blood was released last October, and it offered a Left 4 Dead-like experience that tasked players with working together to defeat hordes of Ridden through multiple levels. Those who have completed the base campaign might be hungry for more content, and fortunately, the game’s first expansion, Tunnels of Terror, laun…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video game movies have a relatively checkered history. The highs and lows have been well-documented, but the Sonic movie franchise has been a source of happiness for gamers looking to see their favorite titles on the big screen. Sonic The Hedgehog 2 continues that trend of good video game movies, and we're sitting down with the cast and crew to find out how they did it.
Click here to watch embedded media
Join Brian Shea as he sits down with Ben Schwartz, James Marsden, Colleen O'Shaughnessey, and director Jeff Fowler to discuss all the things fans should look forward to in Sonic The Hedgehog 2. To kick things off, Ben and James chat with Shea about what it was like to film the live-action scenes when the former basically had to imagine his furry companion being alongside him. Ben also discusses some of his favorite Sonic games of all time and what moments he'd want to see in a future film.
From there, we move to Colleen to discuss what it's like joining the stacked cast for the first time. She has been the voice of Tails for years through the games and TV series, but this is the first time she's getting to bring her character to life on the big screen. Finally, we sit down with Jeff Fowler to discuss bringing all those pieces together and delivering an experience Sonic fans are hoping for.
Did you enjoy today's video but are curious if Sonic The Hedgehog 2 is actually worth seeing? Our own Brian Shea has seen it, and in his review, he says:
"Paramount's Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie expands the universe established by its predecessor and delivers a better overall film thanks to bigger action setpieces, laugh-out-loud gags, and some terrific fanservice moments."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment is returning to the franchise that made the studio a noteworthy name in the game industry and will remake Max Payne and Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne. The announcement comes with word that Remedy has struck an agreement with Rockstar Games to develop the remake.
The deal is for Remedy to make one big remake encompassing both classic Max Payne titles. The game will be targeting a release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC and will utilize its Northlight game engine. Rockstar will be fronting the bill for development, which will be budgeted to be "in line with a typical Remedy AAA-game production," according to a press release provided by Remedy. Remedy will collect royalties on the game after Rockstar has recouped its funding from development and publishing. No release window for the project was given. 
Remedy CEO Tero Virtala remarked on the agreement, saying, "We're hugely excited to be working with our partners at Rockstar Games once again for the chance to bring the story, action and atmosphere of the original Max Payne games back to players in new ways." 
Take-Two, the parent company of Rockstar, owns the rights to the Max Payne IP, and Rockstar itself developed Max Payne 3, which was released in 2012. Remedy and Apogee Software sold the rights to the series for $10 million in cash and stock shares in 2002, a year prior to the release of Max Payne 2.  
Remedy Entertainment's most recent games include Control, the campaign of Crossfire X, and Alan Wake Remastered. The studio is currently developing Alan Wake 2, a multiplayer game with Tencent codenamed Vanguard, and a multiplayer Control spin-off.]]></summary>

Today, Scan's selling both models at RRP, with the 3080 Ti costing £1049 and the 3090 Ti costing a cool £830 more than that. These are both high-end cards with a price tag to match, but the Founders Edition models are generally the cheapest you'll find - so we thought you should know about this unprecedented stock situation!

It's a life sim set in a post apocalyptic world where, instead of punk metal bikinis and murder, the vibe is regrowth and bright colours; a sort of juicy 3D Stardew Valley with an emphasis on crafting. 
But now the sequel My Time At Sandrock is launching into early access on May 26th, bringing a whole new region to restore. Sandrock may look more traditionally post-apocalyptic, being as it is a sandy outback populated by cowboys, but it's still got a helping-hands community feel at its core, plus an interesting eco-friendly angle and an all-new multiplayer mode. But its origins were much more modest. As Pathea Games' executive producer Zifei Wu tells me, Sandrock originally began life as a My Time At Portia DLC pack.

Well, yes and no. The game is charming and breezy, offering plenty of locales and set pieces fans of the force will fawn over. Yet its episodes are wildly inconsistent, with stories told at lightspeed and open world hubs filled with so many collectible bricks it solidifies your brain to a lump of mortar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Regular readers will know that I have been complaining about moving to another country for some time. This move has now happened, but if you were hoping for an update on how I am getting on with a massive virtual jigsaw, you will be disappointed. Everything I own (bar the suitcase of clothes Mr. Ryanair allowed on the plane) has been held by customs. More monstrous is that my stuff actually cleared customs, but some absolute head-melter unrelated to me or my boxes of pens - and who, I am choosing to assume, tried to ship a load of high grade cocaine into Ireland - got the entire container stopped in Dublin.
This means that I have been without any TV for two weeks. Nor any books, video games, or even my big bag of crochet. We didn't get internet until two days ago. It is only by the grace of a technician looking at an HDMI cable stuck in our wall jack, stroking his chin, and then yanking the cable really hard that I'm talking to you now. In those two weeks, I discovered I am weak. But by a stroke of complete luck the new flat faces an busy shipping lane in an estuary. So I have also discovered a deep love for big boats and VesselFinder.

Teardown's a cracking game, about carefully poking holes in destructible environments to prepare for a madcap high-speed heist once an alarm's triggered. I'm excited for it to be done. For now, check out a new trailer show off some of the newness they've added across early access.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam Deck makers Valve are looking to avoid any further delays in getting their portable PC to the waiting hands of reserve order holders.  The Deck, which launched in February after missing a planned release in December 2021, has only just finished its first round of shipments; now it’s moving into the Q2 2022 phase, Valve are “ramping up shipments” to make sure everybody gets theirs within their current order availability estimate.


That’s according to the Steam Deck Twitter account, from which Valve also announced that they’re clarifying what these availability estimates actually are. So far these have been given purely as Q2 2022, Q3 2022 and so on, but the Deck’s Steam store page will now list the actual months in that quarter – including your personal delivery estimate, if you’ve already got a reservation waiting. This change won’t affect when the handhelds are ready, it just saves a Google search for anyone less familiar with the business-speak of quarterly codes.

        <updated>2022-04-05T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chrono Cross was one of those Square JRPGs that never made its way to Europe at its original time of release. Heck, the first time I got to play time-travel classic Chrono Trigger was when the Nintendo DS version came out in 2009, almost 15 years after it first came out on the SNES. Chrono Cross, its semi-related but not direct sequel, has taken even longer to get here. First releasing on the original PlayStation in 1999 in Japan (and 2000 in the US), it's finally arriving on PC and modern consoles on April 7th as Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, which bundles the original game with its accompanying text-based side story Radical Dreamers that only ever released on the ill-fated Satellaview. The latter's original 4:3 pixel art looks mildly ropey blown up on today's screens, but the main game has received all the modern conveniences you've come to expect from Square Enix's recent run of retro PC ports: new HD character models, re-orchestrated music, multiple font options, and the holy grail: a fast-forward button.
I'm nowhere near the end yet, but from what I've played so far, Chrono Cross is a rollicking good time. There are dozens of characters to meet and recruit to your party that can tangibly change your path through the story, the turn-based battle system offers oodles of depth and variety, and Yasunori Mitsuda's revamped score is right up there with the Final Fantasy greats. For all its buff and polish, though, Chrono Cross has, sadly, also been struck by the same curse as other Square Enix PC ports. The lack of settings options makes it hard to pin down exactly what the problem is, but there's something about the performance and inconsistent frame rate of my review build that's so fundamentally borked that it's like those 22 years haven't even happened. If you, too, have been looking forward to Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, I'd strongly advise waiting for a few patches to arrive before dipping your toes in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo Infinite officially launched last December, receiving rave reviews from critics and fans - including Brendan’s review here at RPS. It peaked with over 200k viewers on Twitch. And for many content creators like Kevin Lynch, aka KevinKoolx, December marked their best month ever in terms of engagement on YouTube and Twitch. Halo, after a decade of somewhat divisive releases, was back. It’s hard to overstate how impressive a feat this was, since the Halo fanbase is almost as divided as the Star Wars one - a seemingly trivial topic like the inclusion of sprint is just one of many decade-long points of contention. But somehow with Halo Infinite 343 Industries created an experience that almost every type of Halo fan could rally behind. But now, just four months after launch, Infinite is struggling to retain its playerbase.

 Now the Twitch peaks are below 10k and dropping, with the averages even lower. Lynch says February was his worst month views-wise in over a year. You'd expect some tail off after launch for any game, but every content creator I’ve spoken to echoes this sentiment: engagement for Infinite is abnormally low for a live service-game at the beginning of its multi-year journey, especially for a franchise as big as this. The game plays great, so what’s the problem? I spoke to a number of different streamers and content creators to get their point of view.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My brain is slightly breaking with the news that: 1) a new Monkey Island game is coming; 2) it's led by Ron Gilbert, the designer of the first two piratical comedy adventure games; and 3) it's a direct sequel to Monkey Island 2, a game which already has a sequel. Remarkable news. Come watch the trailer announcing Return To Monkey Island.

There’s nothing particularly remarkable about that - I’ve encountered the same thing dozens of times in games - but what comes after is a real doozy.
Not content simply with nudging the fella into giving in to his worst impulses, I then proceeded to persuade him to wipe the very memory of his nemesis from the galaxy, up to and including hunting down his friends and family members.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And breathe... We did it! We made it through the first three months of 2022, potentially the busiest first quarter of any year to date. By comparison, April 2022 almost seems a little light when it comes to new PC releases. Only one AAA blockbuster launching this month? How quaint. 


Still, this relatively quiet period finally gives indie games a chance to breathe again. There are a ton of super interesting, smaller titles launching on PC this month that I’m excited to share with you all today. From epic turn-based RPGs based on English mythology to offbeat walking simulators about free will, there’s something for everyone launching on PC this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The main consolation of disliking a genre is the childish fun you can have by describing it badly and pretending you don’t know its name. For example, there's probably a generally accepted term for RPGs about traipsing around dungeons killing rats, while turning and moving strictly at 90 degree angles. But I actually typed out "Dungeons of Gridlock" because I genuinely thought that's what Legend Of Grimrock was called. For once, I am not trying to annoy fans of a thing I generally hate.
That's because I've been playing Potato Flowers In Full Bloom, which is very much one of those games. And it’s the first I’ve ever enjoyed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck’s battery life isn’t one of its best qualities. While this weakness is outweighed by the pleasures of playing PC games in bed or on the bus, most such games will drain the Deck quickly, requiring a degree of foresight if you want to entertain yourself on a long trip away from mains power. At the same time, different games will drain at different speeds, with some allowing Valve’s handheld to last hours longer than others.


Ultimately, I think the only truly accurate way to measure and judge the Steam Deck’s battery life is to test a bunch of different games to see how long it lasts with each. So I have! Here you’ll find a list of games with how long they took to empty the Deck’s battery from full. I’ll be coming back and adding more to the list as I test them, so you can see for yourself what uptimes to expect from your favourites.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The comedy of Borderlands is like a high-recoil submachine gun. Hit and miss. In poorer moments, it falls into the trap of the sketch show, flogging a perfectly fine jokehorse to the point of putrefaction. In richer moments, it flips your expectations with a huge scene-changing gag that solicits a hearty giggle. Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is more mix for the bag. It's a loots-be-shoot with a moreish loop urging you onward, boasting characterful art design and thick-lined scenery goading you to pause for yet another snap in photo mode. For Borderlikers, the gun compulsion and farty japes will be enough. It exists as a handsome world to roam through with pals, half-listening to dialogue while Paula chews toast and Jeremy complains about work. As that, Tinalands is fine. It is also 100% not for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[April Fool's Day mostly exists to demonstrate that marketing people are not funny, but I do like when developers follow through and actually make daft jokes reality. Case in point: renovate 'em up House Flipper has added two apartments from F.R.I.E.N.D.S. for you to fix up. You can refresh the 90s vibes of Rachel & Monica's flat, and make Chandler & Joey's flat at least somewhat resemble a place fit for human habitation. I approve of this April Foolishness.

It's a pretty big leap from their usual fare, but based on a 40 minute demo I got to play this week, it's worked out a treat. There's a hint of Sekiro in there, with katana clashing combat, combined with a mysterious story that has me itching to know more. This is rare for someone like me, who often cares more for the action than the characters. Hey, keep an eye on this one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember when Diablo 3 was released. One of the (many) talking points around the game was its art style, and the perception that Blizzard had made the art style lighter and friendlier versus the gothic greys of the previous two games. The criticism seemed a little overblown and silly at the time, but here we are reading the latest quarterly update on the development of Diablo 4. It focuses on the new game's art, and the phrase "return to darkness" is used repeatedly.

Alice Bee is away this week, adapting to life in a brand-new country, leaving Nate and Matthew to dwell on the merits of The Mandalorian, and whether a show following the life of a Halo grunt would be better than big flashy Master Chief quips.
Matthew puts forward the idea of a Hitman TV show in the vein of Succession, focusing not on Agent 47, but the elite corporate villains he assassinates, as they deal with various cast members being offed in mysterious circumstances. Nate, meanwhile, wants to go all-in on a Dungeon Keeper sitcom, and The Office-like monster relationships therein.
