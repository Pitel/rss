With the PS5 version of Baldur's Gate 3 out, players stuck on that platform now have a means to venture across the Sword Coast.

Created by EA Dice, overseen now by Respawn CEO Vince Zampella, recently worked on by EA's founded-and-shuttered Ridgeline Studios, and now EA Motive are the latest to be stuck with the beleaguered milsim.

In an update announcing that seasonal updates for Battlefield 2042 were drawing to an end, EA say that Motive Studio - best known for the Dead Space remake - are "building a team focused on Battlefield at their studio."

One such challenge is "flip a Troll's club," which is incredibly vague. Here's how to do it and how to complete the similarly cryptic "hit a Troll with its own boulder" challenge.


How do you flip a Troll's club in Hogwarts Legacy?


To flip a Troll's club, you must use the quite literal Flipendo spell. You'll acquire Flipendo through Professor Garlick's second assignment after you complete the initial tutorial for the herbology class in the main story. There are, however, timing considerations.

        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-shiny-croagunk-in-pokemon-go/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=how-to-get-shiny-croagunk-in-pokemon-go"/>
        <updated>2024-04-09T19:59:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many Pokémon Go events boost the chances of obtaining Shiny creatures to help trainers complete their collection. One, in particular, is the Shiny Croagunk, a Poison and Fighting Type that doesn't appear too often. We're here to get you one step closer to this Pokémon by giving you the latest details on its whereabouts. 


Where to find Shiny Croagunk in Pokémon Go


The Shiny Croagunk can be captured during its Spotlight Hour, set for April 9 from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. local time. Croagunks appear more frequently throughout this short duration, giving you some time to capture a lot of them. The event starts just after Sizeable Surprises and provides double Evolution XP for the creature.


If you aren't successful with its capture during the Spotlight Hour, try the following methods to get a Shiny Croagunk in Pokémon Go:



Complete Field Research tasks


Fight in Raids


Use Lure Modules or Incense


Hatch eggs


Use Cloudy Weather Boost


Capture during special events



While the Spotlight Hour is probably the best route for the Shiny Croagunk, it's still possible to find it outside of the duration. Croagunks tend to spawn during cloudy weather, so look out for these boosts to better your chances. Occasionally, the Pokémon appears for battles, but it all depends on the current Raid schedule. 


Other events, like Season of Go and Fashion Week, have included a Shiny Croagunk in their lineup. These celebrations typically last longer, providing trainers much more time than the limited Spotlight Hour. 


Image via Niantic


Keep in mind that the Shiny rates for Croagunk are fairly low, with a one-in-500 chance. Again, if you want to increase your chances, your best bet is the Spotlight Hour or a possible Pokémon Go Community Day event. Once Croagunk Spotlight Hour is up, more critters, such as Trubbish, Clefairy, and Weedle, will take over the spot shortly after.

        <updated>2024-04-09T19:45:40.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Renetti currently dominates Warzone's short-range meta in Season 3, but Raven Software plans to end that brief reign of terror. 


On April 9, Warzone and Modern Warfare 3 received minor updates, addressing a few bugs and weapon balancing issues. In Warzone, the devs made minor tweaks to the FJX Horus, MORS, and TAQ Evolvere, but community members expected a Renetti nerf as well. Raven Software heard the pushback and responded, "We are working on adjustments to the Renetti which will be released in the near future."


A nerf for the Renetti was long overdue. Image via Activision


As part of the Season 3 update, the RAM-9 had its damage and sprint-to-fire values nerfed, leading to players annointing the HRM-9 as the new king of Warzone's short-range meta. However, that assumption proved to be false, as the Renetti pistol with the JAK Ferocity Carbine Conversion Kit equipped currently leads all SMGs with a 490 millisecond time-to-kill speed. On average, it should only take around 8.5 bullets to down an enemy. In comparison, the HRM-9 has a time-to-kill speed of 612 milliseconds and can only down opponents in around 10.5 bullets.


Additionally, the Rennetti had a leg up on the HRM-9 because players will be able to use the pistol in underwater combat, but that's not possible with the SMG. Sidearms usually don't have better stats than primary weapons, so it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that Raven Software plans on making adjustments. 


It also doesn't help that the community has picked up on just how strong the Renneti is, either. According to WZ Ranked, the pistol has a 19 percent pick rate, which ranks second in popularity rankings by a wide margin. Only time will tell, if the upcoming nerf is enough to put the beast down for good, but it's clear that a change was long-overdue.

However, sometimes you're forced to use specific Stratagems, whether that's because a mission or planet calls for them or you have a Personal Order to complete. The Gatling Sentry is, mercifully, a Stratagem that's easy to use and complete missions with.

However, Epic stresses that they're getting away from the seasonal concept in favor of more generalized updates. It all sounds like typical "seasonal" content to me, but they might be trying to maintain content expectations.


If you haven't had a chance to check it out, Rocket Racing is essentially it's own game within Fortnite. Made by Epic and Psyonix, the team behind Rocket League, it's an energetic racing mode reminiscent of the Cruisin' series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mantine offers many advantages on the battlefield due to its dynamic type as a Water and Flying Type. To make things even better, trainers can get a Shiny Mantine in Pokémon Go to increase its rarity. This feat is no easy task, but we're here to help you narrow down the search. 


Where to find Shiny Mantine in Pokémon Go


You can get a Shiny Mantine out in the wilds during the Sizeable Surprises Pokémon Go event. Mantines appear more frequently, so you can continuously catch them to increase your chances. Unlike the Shiny Wimpod and Shiny Kartana, this Pokémon is not associated with any Raid or Field Research tasks, meaning it all relies on luck. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


Use Lure Modules and Incense to attract more Pokémon near you, which may result in the Shiny Mantine's appearance. Thanks to the critter's type, it also helps if you have a Rainy or Windy Weather Boost. 


Other than catching a Shiny Mantine in Pokémon Go, it is possible to evolve a Shiny Mantyke for it. Give the creature 50 Mantyke Candies to evolve it to a Shiny Mantine. This technique still requires a bit of luck, but it is an option, nonetheless. 


I suggest catching as many Mantyke and Mantines as possible before the Sizeable Surprises event concludes on April 9 at 8 p.m. local time. Other Shiny variants, such as Diglett, Wailmer, Joltik, and Cutiefly, are also available during this time. If you happen to miss the event, more Pokémon are expected to come for the upcoming Bug Out event on April 12 at 10 a.m. local time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is no official end date for Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone Season 3, but based on the battle pass and patterns from previous updates, it's possible to estimate a time frame. 


MW3 and Warzone Season 3 delivered on all fronts. In multiplayer, the devs plan to introduce six 6v6 maps throughout the season, with various sizes and locations. Additionally, four new weapons enter the fray, including the MORS and BAL-27, first introduced in 2014 for CoD: Advanced Warfare. As for Warzone, battle royale fans finally get a chance to jump back into Rebirth Island, and the devs made sweeping weapon and equipment balancing changes. Even with so much to enjoy currently, there is no harm in looking at what's coming in the pipeline. 


When does MW3 and Warzone Season 3 end?

The Season 3 Battle Pass ends on May 28 at 9 a.m. PST, so we expect Season 4 to start on May 29 at 9 a.m. PST.  It's still too early to tell what Sledgehammer Games and Raven Software have up their sleeves for the upcoming season, but leaks point toward an exciting slate of content. 


Reliable CoD leaker BobNetworkUK claimed the SPAS-12 and Kar98k appeared in MW3‘s game files in a post on Twitter. Weapon names appearing in the game files don’t guarantee they will be added to the title, as plans could always change. But Bob has a proven track record of these data mines being accurate. Additionally, Insider Gaming reported that Verdansk will return to Warzone with the release of Treyarch's mainline release, tentatively dubbed Black Ops Gulf War in 2024. 


But there are community members that are still holding out hope that the beloved map will return in Season 4 instead. As for multiplayer, MW3 players should also expect another healthy dose of content. In Season 3, the devs introduced six new maps, the most we have seen in several seasons.

The demo of Yellow Taxi Goes Vroom suggested to me that it was going to be kind of the same. The difference is that, while some of the platformers I had played I just didn’t really like very much, this one was at least going to be a hyperactive good time.


Weirdly, while the mechanics of Yellow Taxi Goes Vroom are somewhat unique to the genre and the sugar-charged movement system seems contrary to what is typically expected, the flavor of early-3D platformers is one of the things it gets down perfectly.

As always, the composition of your team is going to be based heavily on what you’ve accumulated in playing AFK Journey. You might not have a particular character, and if you do, it’s possible that they aren’t at an effective tier. I’ll give you the best-case scenario, but if you can’t meet it, maybe check out our tier list for substitutes.

Earlier today, developer Arrowhead Game Studios pushed out Helldivers 2 Patch 01.000.202. Not only does it fix mission and snowball crashes that have been plaguing the game for weeks, but it also brings a slew of fixes for weapons and minor issues that players have been struggling with. It's worth reading through the patch notes in full if you want to see everything that's been fixed and all the known issues. 


However, fans are guarding themselves against the worst because they feel the developer might just have added a surprise in the form of a new enemy faction.

While the structure itself still thrives, it's hard to ignore the fountain of live service-focused, always online games dominating the scene like Genshin Impact, Warframe, and even Helldivers 2. 


“Sales success has become a severe issue in recent years due to the rising costs of development," said Kim.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The CoD devs launched an investigation into an issue preventing players from landing their shots with the MORS sniper rifle in Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone. 


On April 8, the CoD support staff confirmed, "Our team is aware of an issue causing a slight optic misalignment with the MORS Sniper Rifle, which may cause shots that appear on-target to miss." As for when community members can expect a fix, the developers scheduled the fix for a future game update but did not provide a specific date. This isn't the first time the player base has dealt with aiming issues. In the season three update, the devs rolled out an update to remove the randomness as ADS Idle Sway, because there were instances where a player would aim down sights, but the crosshair wouldn't be aligned with the center of the screen. It's unclear if that's the same issue this time around with the MORS.

 Since its introduction in season three, some community members have already crowned the MORS as the best sniper rifle in Warzone. The MORS has a faster aim-down sight speed than the KATT-AMR and XRK Stalker, better bullet velocity, faster fire rate, movement speed, weapon swap speed, and reload time. Additionally, the new sniper rifle is able to one-shot kill an enemy from any range with the Anti-Material Slugs equipped. An added benefit of the quick rifle is that there is no need to reload, as the sniper automatically rechambers after each shot. 


When the optic misalignment issue gets sorted out, we fully expect the MORS to be one of Warzone's best, if not the most used weapon. According to WZ Ranked, season three's latest weapon is already the seventh most popular gun in the battle royale, and that usage rate will only improve when players no longer have to worry about missing their shots.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although the Ultra Beasts are already powerful in their original forms, their Shiny versions prove most rewarding through their high rarity. So, if you want to know how to catch a Shiny Kartana in Pokémon Go, here's what you need to do. 


Where to find Shiny Kartana in Pokémon Go


Trainers can get a Shiny Kartana in Pokémon Go by participating in 5 Star Raids. While the Sizeable Surprises event is active, this creature appears during these battles, specifically in the Northern Hemisphere. If you're not in this area, use a Remote Raid Pass to access it. The Shiny Celesteela is also available in the Southern Hemisphere for those who want more Ultra Beast variants.

5 Star Raids aren't the easiest fights to achieve, so prepare beforehand with a powerful team. Kartana has a weakness against Fire Types, including the following Pokémon:



Reshiram


Mega Charizard


Heatran


Incineroar


Arcanine


Moltres


Blaziken



To get the Shiny Kartana in Pokémon Go, you may need to complete several 5 Star Raids. Similar to the Shiny Wimpod, it's not always guaranteed, but some trainers have gotten lucky enough to obtain it in the first Raid. After winning the battle, the Shiny Kartana can appear for the Bonus Challenge. Use a fruit like Silver Pinap Berry or Golden Razz Berries to easily get it on your side. 


Unfortunately, the event for the Shiny Kartana will come to a close shortly. It will end on April 9 at 8 p.m. local time, so make sure to get through as many 5 Star Raids as possible.

Love or hate fishing minigames, there’s no denying they’re a staple of the cosy set. But Moonglow Bay aims to blow that hook-and-line mechanic into a full game. This fishing sim from Bunnyhug and Coatsink launched in 2021 on Steam and Xbox to mixed reviews. The new Switch port (and starboard) starts out as a tranquil few days out on the water, but with bugs and some frustrating gameplay it becomes quite a stormy journey.
The game begins with your partner being declared deceased after they went missing three years ago (you can choose pronouns and appearances for both). Your adult daughter, River, moves in to care for you and help you, alongside your cute dog, Waffles, who you can pat and take for walks. You open a present left for you: a fishing journal. And so begins your character’s healing and fishing journey.

It really feels like they're keeping a lot of the headline Star Wars stuff at a respectful distance for this one: yes, Jabba the Hutt makes an appearance, but there's nary a whiff of The Force, Jedi or Sith in the trailer and not once does anybody build a Death Star.

In Terraria, your bed is for more than just sleeping, it also serves as your spawn point for when things go bad and you die an embarrassing death. This is how you make one.


There are different types of beds in Terraria, and all of them can be used as spawn points. For simplicity’s sake, I’m just going to tell you how to make a basic bed.


How to make a bed in Terraria


Not to sound obvious, but the first thing you need when making a bed in Terraria is a workbench. This takes 10 pieces of wood, which you mostly get from trees.


Step two is to make a furnace. This requires 20 stone, 4 wood, and 3 torches (Made with 1 wood and 1 gel, which is dropped by slimes.)

It's a satisfying Sniper Elite meets Superhot puzzle of ultraviolence, and it's neat.

Now the sequel, Sucker For Love: Date To Die For has revealed a release date of April 23rd, and seems to be leaning into horror even more, while also still being a dating sim featuring an eldritch goat god with massive cans. Yet the presser also says "no scares this time". I am confused, which is why it's probably good there's a demo on Steam to sort of give you a taster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega and Creative Assembly have released the first proper trailer for Total War: Warhammer 3's forthcoming Thrones of Decay expansion, which pits the human Empire, Chaos Nurgle faction and industrious Dwarfs against each other in what the press release terms "a showdown of mohawks, maggots and machines". Alliteration, is it? Well, two can play at that (strategy) game: the new expansion explodes upon the extensive environments of this elaborate ex-tabletop experience with an eccentric... ensemble of new legendary lords, battle units and campaign features, plus various free bits for owners of the base game.


9-3 to me, Creative Assembly! Find the Thrones of Decay trailer below - sorry, I just need a few minutes to massage my temples.

Publisher Good Shepherd Entertainment and developers LEAP Game Studios and Tiny Ghoul have today announced that the monster-collecting, deck-building roguelike Dicefolk will be rolling onto Switch later this year.
There's a dash of Pokémon in Dicefolk's creature catching, sure, but the combat system is far from anything that you would see Pikachu and co. pull off. As the name suggests, dice play a big part in this one, with your moves all being decided by what you roll. The added tactical layer comes from your ability to control both teams, so you'll have to think ahead to get the best match-up possible.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they've been chewing over. Today, Alana is talking about a Vanillaware oldie — Muramasa: The Demon Blade, a Wii title that is celebrating its 15th anniversary. And, in the wake of 13 Sentinels and Unicorn Overlord's success, it's time to give Vanillaware's older title some love.

Vanillaware has been pretty much everywhere. It's visited magical, mystical storybook worlds in Odin Sphere. It's returned to a medieval, warfaring world many times with Grand Knights History and Unicorn Overlord. It's been to 1980s Japan in 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim. We've even been able to go to witch school thanks to GrimGrimoire. But despite the wide variety of softly painted and gorgeous worlds, I always find myself looking back to Edo Japan the fondest.

      <p>In March 2023, Dredge became one of the most talked-about games of the year thanks to its combination of engaging fishing mechanics, an enthralling atmosphere, and a fun story involving sinister secrets buried at sea. Ahead of the BAFTA Awards on Thursday, at which Dredge is nominated for four awards, developer Black Salt Games has announced a collaboration with production company Story Kitchen to adapt the critically acclaimed title into a live-action feature film.</p>

<p>In the game, players explore a mysterious archipelago as a fishing boat captain. However, the longer you play, the more unsettling the water surrounding the collection of remote islands becomes. The press release pitches the Dredge live-action film, saying, "Think&nbsp;<em>The Sixth Sense</em>&nbsp;on the water. A grounded atmospheric cosmic horror blend of HP Lovecraft and Ernest Hemingway."</p>

<p>"We are excited to partner with such an experienced studio team to bring the world we created to live action and ignite the imagination of audiences across the globe," a joint statement from the Black Salt Games team said in that same press release.</p>

<p>Story Kitchen was founded in 2022 by&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2&nbsp;</em>producer Dmitri M. Johnson, former APA Agent Mike Goldberg, and their production and development executives Timothy I. Stevenson and Dan Jevons. "Dredge is a captivatingly eerie and profoundly rich story that had us completely hooked from the very beginning," a joint statement from Story Kitchen said in the press release.</p>

<p>Dredge currently has an 80 out of 100 rating on the reviews aggregate website Metacritic. If you missed it, it is currently available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Last summer, we sat down with Sonic Team Creative Officer Takashi Iizuka to discuss his multi-decade career at Sega. We learn about his childhood fascination with becoming a manga artist, the transition from college life to working at Sega, and his early career developing games like Devi and Pii, Golden Axe 3, and Sonic the Hedgehog 3. Iizuka remembers the excitement and challenge during the transition from the Sega Genesis (known as the Sega Mega Drive in Japan) to the Sega Saturn, which allowed the team progress from 2D pixel art to 3D polygonal modeling.</p>

<p>Notably, the Sonic the Hedgehog lead reflects on the early Dreamcast days, moving to the United States to better implement western culture into Sonic Adventure 2, and finally, describes his emotions after hearing Sega was exiting the hardware business and ending production of the Dreamcast.&nbsp;</p>

San Diego Studio returns for a third season of baseball action on Nintendo Switch and it's another fairly solid job all round for 2024, giving fans yet another feature-complete port that manages to get the most important stuff right during its deep and addictive matches.
Indeed, whilst MLB The Show 24 has seen plenty of technical issues at launch — which we'll get into — and there's not much new or exciting here over what you'll find in the previous two outings, there's no denying that this is probably about as good as we can realistically expect these sorts of enormous sports games to run on Switch at this point. It works, but you can almost hear the seams popping.

Putting the game out into early access at the end of 2020 - multiple years before it was ready for a full release - worked out very well for Larian though, so it’s maybe no surprise that they plan to do exactly the same with whatever comes next.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft might be taking this whole stealth thing a bit far when it comes to their remake of the original Splinter Cell. News of Sam Fisher’s return first snuck out at the end of 2021, with little more spotlight than a brief blog post to confirm that, yep, it’s a thing. After over two years of near-silence, it now looks like it might finally be time for Sam to emerge out of the shadows.

Having beat them myself, I didn't find them a fun or interesting challenge as much as an annoying one that required too much to go right. I'm glad to hear that they're being tweaked in an upcoming patch, which you can now test in a public beta on Steam, and even the lowest difficulty setting will be tweaked. Other changes include improved (hopefully) Steam Deck performance, balance tweaks, and better Joker-related Tags.

        <updated>2024-04-08T16:03:54.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bethesda was working out how to turn their popular Elder Scrolls RPGs into an online behemoth to rival World Of Warcraft back in the late 00s, the initial pitch was "Elder Scrolls with friends," creative director Rich Lambert tells me. A simple idea on paper, perhaps, but one that proved to be a lot more complicated in the realisation of it. Zenimax Online Studios was founded in 2007, a year after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion landed to universal critical praise, but it wasn't until seven years later that The Elder Scrolls Online finally released for PC in 2014. At launch "we were walking this weird line between 'online game' and 'Elder Scrolls game'," Lambert says. "We didn't do either of them particularly well."
Ten years later, though, The Elder Scrolls Online is thriving. At last count, the game has over 24 million players galloping about the plains of Tamriel, and later this June, it will receive its eighth major Chapter expansion, Gold Road, which adds Oblivion's West Weald to the game and wraps up the mystery of the new Daedric Prince that arrived at the end of the previous expansion, Necrom. But the path ESO has taken to get here hasn't been nearly as glittering, with its PC launch in particular generating "a lot of feedback", as studio director Matt Firor told press at the game's tenth anniversary event last week. In fact, it wasn't until ESO came to consoles in 2015 that the game really found its voice, says Lambert. "We had to really figure out what we wanted to be, and we chose 'Elder Scrolls'. As soon as we hit that core pillar of 'It's Elder Scrolls first, online second,' then it really just helped inform everything we've done since." Trouble is, when the thrust of ESO's development straddled the launch of two very different Elder Scrolls games, even nailing down that first part of the pillar proved to be more challenging than expected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomin' lovely.
When cosy and wholesome games first stepped onto the scene, they were counter-culture — created in response and in resistance to an industry that churned out violence, conflict, and a particular type of masculinity that wasn't keen on things like emotions or intimacy. Some people were tired of this monolithic and exclusionary idea of what a game 'should' be — and so, as a direct contrast to all of that, the cosy game movement was created, prioritising stories that minimised conflict, and focused instead on growth and creation. That's part of the reason why so many cosy games are about farming and relationships, because the themes of cultivation and creation are almost the exact opposite of violence and conflict.
But these days, cosy games have become a dominant part of gaming culture, and the conflict-free alternatives they once offered as a respite from the status quo are now a lucrative part of the status quo. This is what happens when counter-culture becomes culture: it forgets its roots and its purpose, and instead becomes about aping what's already popular. In the process, many cosy games fail to understand that a player's desire for softness and kindness does not mean that they want a completely toothless game. Challenge is not conflict. Challenge is fun.

It's a puzzle game about growing plants. Holy Strange Horticulture, Batman! But Botany Manor is much less eldritch, and much more gentle historical feel-good movie starring Emma Thompson in the lead role. That role - which in this case is played by you in first person rather than La Thompson - is of Arabella Greene, a retired botanist who, thank God, is the childless inheritor of a huge manor and ancestral wealth, and so is able to spend the sunny days of 1890 pottering around the house and grounds researching weird, slightly fantastical plants almost wholly untroubled. So in this respect it is also a fantasy game. It's quite delightful, which is the sort of phrase I am confident Arabella would use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to one unofficial tracker created by video game artist Farhan Noor, there have been 8000 layoffs in 2024 so far, following an estimated 10,500 layoffs in 2023. The leaders of Microsoft, Embracer Group, Epic and other industry giants have made swingeing cuts to their workforces. While larger companies have inevitably seen the largest reductions, many smaller developers and publishers have also cut staff or even closed their doors. Circumstances vary by company, of course, but as regards the biggest publishers, there are some broad overlapping causes: reckless or, if you prefer, "overambitious" expansion and overhiring during the pandemic lockdown gaming boom; lower-than-hoped returns on new technologies and business models such as NFTs; and rising global interest rates, which have scared away potential investors.
The carnage was uppermost in Larian CEO's Swen Vincke's mind when he accepted Baldur's Gate 3's Best Narrative gong at the GDC Awards last month. According to Vincke, the layoffs can be traced straightforwardly to a pattern of executive greed that sees company leadership betting the livelihoods and stability of their workers on whatever new idea seems capable of delivering instant growth for shareholders.

Details were practically non-existent at the time, but YouTuber Glitching Queen recently interviewed Gummelt about what the game could've become. Fun surprises: It would've been a free-to-play live service game featuring coliseum battles. Unsurprises: microtransactions, seasons, general background shenanigans between Treyarch and Raven.

Cast your minds back to February of this year and you might remember that Nintendo updated its Japanese website URL from 'nintendo.co.jp' to 'nintendo.com/jp'. Well, the Big N is continuing this trend with its European domains and has announced that the URLs for each website will be updated on 9th April 2024.
The update essentially aligns each domain into the same format, ensuring that each one starts with 'nintendo.com' before requiring users to input the specific regional abbreviations afterwards. So what does this look like in practice? Well, Nintendo UK has the answer over on X:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Total Eclipse, a real-time, curse-breaking, 3D adventure (with a dash of Indiana Jones flair), is ready for public testing!
Originally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.
Step into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.
Embark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). 
Can you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?
Our modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

Martin’s goal is to rescue his pet dog, which doesn’t sound like it’ll take too long – the “concise and delightful” story mode boasts just three bosses. But lurking behind that all-too-innocent story mode there is a Biblical terror in the shape of a 50-floor tower, made up of increasingly challenging trials. Link’s Awakening with a sort of Bloody Palace component? Yeah, I’ll take that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fulqrum Publishing have just released a story trailer for New Arc Line, a new steampunk fantasy RPG in which dragons rub shoulders with zeppelins, and dwarves are as abundant as air pollution. I hadn't heard of it before and am quite interested, partly because the game sports some wonderfully mangled and colourful dystopian maps, and partly because it's a story of immigrants trying to find their way to an inevitably deceptive "shining city of progress", rather than the typical Chosen One fare.
Your family specifically are afflicted by a fatal disease. Your initial and perhaps overall goal in New Arc Line is to find a cure, of course, but who knows, along the way you might have to "get your hands dirty", "rise from the bottom" and become some sort of absolute bastard.

They are sure to be swiftly rebuked by their fellows for playing dice with fate, those still of sound mind rightly afeared that the name may echo through the brine and tickle the ears of the dread captain himself. On the seas he calls kingdom, Noctilus is without equal, without mercy, and utterly without hesitation. For what has a dead man left to fear?
He has but one fatal flaw; he is deathly afraid of ever leaving his comfortable ship to touch ‘pon the verdant grass of land. I intend to honour this. Do you hear me, lubbers? I will show my strategy game mastery by conquering Total War: Warhammer 3’s world, and I will never touch grass.

Although faux-medieval games are common, there aren't all that many about regular people and regular concerns. Even LotR was increasingly about battles and armies as it went on, rather than the unique management parts.
But in Under The Yoke, you're just a serf. You want to make something of yourself, but it's about a regular person managing his life, not some unlikely "adventurer", whatever that means. So you'll mostly be toiling, and foraging, and genuinely having way more actual skills than us superior modern folk. And despite some UI issues and rough edges, it's weirdly compelling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friends! Jaegers! Evas! Lend me your radar dishes or cybernetic ear trumpets. Developers Storm Trident and publishers Forever Entertainment have popped up a Steam demo for their Front Mission 2 remake. Tucked within its coils there are two whole levels, Rimian Base and Batari Forest, together with a Garage where you can customise your Wanzer and access to the in-game Network menu.


"Who are you calling a Wanzer?" you bellow. Calm down and stop waving that chair. A wanzer is a mech, in short. And Front Mission, by the way, is a 90s tactical RPG series from G-Craft and Square, both of which have since been assimilated into the terrifying robot octopus that is present-day Square Enix. Much as with Final Fantasy Tactics games, Front Mission games are stagey political thrillers about countries and corporations and other factions waging perpetual war upon each other, with players thrust into the mix as mech squad leaders.

And it’s not just USB connectivity that gets a boost – external displays, rock-solid Ethernet connections for game downloads, and power delivery all make dock usage a preferable alternative to simply hooking up Bluetooth accessories. Along with a microSD card (and possibly a better case), these stand/hub combos are definitely among the tools that any regular Steam Deck wielder should have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, if you can believe it, marked the tenth anniversary of The Elder Scrolls Online. That's a whole decade of tromping across Tamriel with your mates, and a whole decade in which I've watched tentatively from the sidelines, thinking about dipping my toes into the MMO pool, but never quite building up the courage (or lining the walls of my bank account) to fully take the plunge. I've heard all the horror stories about starting a new MMO from other members of the RPS Treehouse - particularly when it comes to the lore-laden shackles of World Of Warcraft and the bloated MMO-service-hybrid Destiny - and quite honestly, it's enough to put me off them all entirely. But The Elder Scrolls Online might just be the exception to the rule.
I spent a portion of the game's tenth birthday yesterday playing Gold Road, its upcoming eighth Chapter expansion. In it, you're whisked over to the West Weald, an autumnal, sun-dappled region whose main city hub, Skingrad, will no doubt feel familiar to seasoned Oblivionites. Seemingly overnight, a strange jungle has sprung up on the city's outskirts, uprooting the nearby villages of the neighbouring high elves and causing havoc as strange beasts pour out of its curling root beds. There are more mysteries to unravel here, too, including the emergence of the new Daedric Prince, Ithelia (revealed at the end of last year's Necrom Chapter), and much more besides - too much to realistically take in during a 90-minute preview session, or for this MMO newbie to fully comprehend the significance of. But there's something about Gold Road and its gnarled-up jungles, strange cults and fantastical beasts that's definitely made me want to make a return journey here when it launches on PC on June 3rd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-serving top producer of legendary RPG series Dragon Quest has stepped down from the role, according to sources that spoke to RPS Maw tribute site Bloomberg. Yu Miyake, who has been involved with numerous DQ games since he joined Enix in 1989 as marketer on DQ books, is moving on to head up Square Enix’s mobile games.
The change comes as part of shake-ups at Squeenix under new President and blockchain enjoyer Takashi Kiryu, who Bloomberg point out has committed to reverse SE’s flagging sales of both big releases (like Final Fantasy 16) and mobile titles (like Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis), possibly so he can profit handsomely enough to construct himself an arm-mounted Australian Shepherd launcher (like Final Fantasy 8.)

Update 1.2 will also tweak and fix and fiddle with heaps of other things. Our System Shock review called it "a breathtakingly beautiful and astonishingly faithful remake that proves the enduring power of Looking Glass design" when it launched last year, though I would say System Shock's final battle is one of the most dated parts, so I'm curious to see the new form.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thrones of Decay, the upcoming expansion for strategy game Total War: Warhammer 3, will now be available to purchase as either three separate faction packs, or as a bundle at a discount. So, if you don’t fancy shelling out the full £19.10 for all three factions, you can grab new bits for either Nurgle, the Empire, or the Dwarfs for £7.49. If you do buy just one to start off with - say, to get a feel for the quality of Thrones of Decay as a package - you’ll get a 15% discount on the remaining two packs in the future.

The case was backed by IP address evidence and a financial investigation, but things didn't go exactly to plan. A court of appeal decision handed down Thursday couldn't alleviate the disappointment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Roblox Studios have responded to Eurogamer's report, in particular addressing the quote that they "hired some teenagers" to clarify that they do not hire minors. You can find Roblox Studios' full response over on Eurogamer.
Original story
Roblox allows its players to create and monetise their own creations within its ecosystem. Across the entire breadth of Roblox game makers, a lot of money is made. At the individual level, however, the vast majority of creators making work within Roblox never earn enough to cash out their earnings - and some of those creators are children. This has long led to allegations that Roblox is exploiting child labour, generating value for Roblox Studio and its shareholders in the process.

"I don't know, you can say this for a lot of things, right?" said Roblox Studio head Stefano Corazza at GDC, when the allegation was put to him by Eurogamer. "Like, you can say, 'Okay, we are exploiting, you know, child labour,' right? Or, you can say: we are offering people anywhere in the world the capability to get a job, and even like an income. So, I can be like 15 years old, in Indonesia, living in a slum, and then now, with just a laptop, I can create something, make money and then sustain my life.

Genuinely, I've been humiliated on this count in RPS morning meetings, with certain "colleagues" whose names rhyme with "Malice Knell" making references I don't understand and laughing at my expression of hurt and confusion. My grasp of reality TV basically ends with the finale of the very first season of Big Brother, feat. Nasty Nick. But you could argue that you don't need to watch reality TV to understand and enjoy reality TV, because the basic reality TV thrill of forming weird parasocial attachments to people who are role-playing as themselves is now the golden rule of digital society generally.


"'Reality' stuff is huge now, and it's not just reality TV," says Nicole He, designer of The Crush House - an enticing, absurdist and engrossingly unpleasant new sim from Reigns and Card Shark developers Nerial. "It's any kind of celebrity or influencer or streamer or something like that - there are so many parasocial relationships in that way, and I think that really started with reality TV, and then [continued] in the era of social media. It's one of those topics that we don't talk about in an explicit way, necessarily, but it's something that you hopefully think about as you're playing the game."

Especially not the one you get with the 1TB Steam Deck OLED, which adds a neat mini-case in the form of a removable liner. Still! As you’ll see here, you do have a choice of worthwhile upgrade options, ranging from conventional hard cases with extra accessory storage to clever protective sleeves that combine impact resistance with improved handheld grip. The best way to avoid Steam Deck damage is to not drop it in the first place, as Sun Tzu probably said.

Is this how the internet is going to work from now on? Plus, what are some of our favourite free games? There are a bunch.
We also talk about the science that suggests people process visual information at wildly different speeds (I know I shouldn't have said that some people just 'see more fasterer' or whatever reductive thing I said, please don't email me), Nate teaches me about some weird cryptids, and we recommend some sweet non-video game stuff, as per usual.

This time, it's leaning into crime, jaunting across the galaxy to resurrect a game of legendary outlaws, the Wild Bastards. Allow me to repeat that name: the Wild Bastards.

It was the afternoon of day four at GDC, my adrenaline reserves were spent, and there I was, in a warm, shuttered hotel room, with two men gently bombarding me with French-accented details of synergies, stackable trinkets and i-frames (I'm aware that the scenario I've just described is probably somebody's kink - let's move swiftly on).


Windblown itself is an airy, bright fusillade of Saturday morning cartoon vibes, a series of breakneck arena fights waged on procedurally generated island chains floating against a whirlpool sky. It's all shaping up very nicely, and if I'd been playing the demo, I'm sure it would have woken me up better than any emergency deluge of instant coffee. But watching somebody else tear through this stratospheric world simply overloaded my depleted senses, and I came perilously close to nodding off.

When people complain about something being 'tropey' I think often what they're complaining about is that the work isn't putting any kind of interesting spin on the tropes. Great God Grove is a weirdo puzzle game where you have to stop the world from ending, and the only way you can communicate is by sucking up things people say to you and then firing them back out of your news cannon. It's coming to PC in 2024. Jolly good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m not saying that Zuzu, the star of melancholic 2D adventure Skaramazuzu, is definitely inspired by that Adventure Time bit where the deer takes off its hooves like gloves. But I am saying that if it were, it’d have my full support, because the freak deer deserves to live on forever, even as a shadow wandering a gothic purgatorial landscape in an unrelated game. 
We got a trailer for this one a few weeks back, and the game itself just dropped on Steam yesterday. It’s got that specific blend of Hollow Knight: Silksong -esque maudlin and whimsy that I personally love, skirting around the edges of both without slipping too readily into Tim Burton territory. The artstyle is crisp and wintery, the writing is goofy, and everything that moves looks like it evolved from the same dead tree branch. Feast your hooves on the trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pocketpair have released a new Palworld update, Steam version v0.2.0.6, which introduces the monster-catching survival game's first Raid Boss, a gloating Gothy squid-lady by the name of Bellanoir. She'll be available to conjure by using slabs at new Summoning Altars. Be prepared for a tough fight, especially if you opt for the "extreme" version of the boss. Bellanoir can't be captured, but she does drop a Pal Egg on defeat.


This is a chunky update, with a bunch of new items and tweaks to the building system, Pal falling damage, shop prices, player drops on multiplayer servers, and the user interface - for example, you'll now see how many of a Pal you own when you aim a Palsphere at one. You can also now cancel a Pal's break simply by picking them up and throwing them at the worksite - truly, a scene from Dickens. All the new stuff is in addition to the usual bugfixes, fresh anti-cheating measures and quashing of exploits: no longer will you be able to massively increase your attack power while riding Pals under certain conditions.

For the English Premier League, a £43m deal with Match TV was suspended but Russians wasted no time exploring other options. Pirate IPTV services, web-based streaming portals, and streams on betting apps filled the void. HD presentations on the social networking site VK also hit the spot, complete with homegrown commentary teams and custom graphics.

      <p>Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, the popular free-to-play Star Wars collectible turn-based strategy RPG mobile game, is coming to PC with cross-save functionality and improved performance. Speaking with the developer over e-mail, the team says, "We have been able to double the frame rate to 60 fps, added anti-aliasing, and implemented higher resolution settings so that players can take advantage of the power of a high-end PC." The game's layout has also been adjusted for the PC version.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier today Tom Betts - founder of Nullpointer and former lead programmer at The Signal From Tolva developers Big Robot - emailed me about his new game The Horror At Highrook. In the space of a single, rollercoaster paragraph, Betts earned my curiosity by describing himself as a fellow Soul Reaver enthusiast, lost it again by criticising Soul Reaver’s camera - such insolence! - and earned it swiftly back by mentioning that he’s from Yorkshire. Then, he upgraded my curiosity into attention by describing The Horror At Highrook as a “clockwork narrative” horror experience that takes inspiration from Poe, Stoker and Lovecraft on the one hand, and from boardgames, wiki-hunting and escape rooms on the other.
This is a heady brew indeed. Also, there appears to be a cat in the game called Mr Tubbs, described as a “portly grey barrel of fur”. I entertain suspicions of Mr Tubbs. What fell secrets lurk behind his perfectly groomed exterior? Anyway, here’s the trailer.

It’s also, I’ll admit, overdue some consideration on RPS. Between the lack of cheap graphics cards among the desktop RTX 40 series, the year-and-a-bit that DLSS 3 has had to grow its compatible games library, and the Steam Deck reminding everyone that portable, low-end gaming can still be pleasurable, now seems like the RTX 4050’s time to shine.

The victors of that particular forum skirmish were probably DICE's Battlefield games, with their woozy Frostbitten cinematography and dependable multiplayer tactic of having a whole team focus fire on a single capture point, gradually reducing it to stumps of foundation. But leftier souls may have preferred Volition's (RIP) Red Faction series, the third of which, Red Faction: Guerrilla, featured a granular demolition engine that you bash apart whole bases with a sledgehammer.
Well, Guerrilla's lead tech designer Luke Schneider is still in the architecture-ruining business: his and Radiangames's latest, the hopefully self-explanatory Instruments Of Destruction, leaves Steam early access on May 10th, 2024. Here's the 1.0 trailer.

      <p>Newcomer developer Nagai Industries Inc. has revealed its debut game called inKonbini: One Store. Many Stories, and it's a love letter to one of the best parts of Japan: convenience stores. No seriously, Japan's convenience stores, whether it's a local mom 'n pop place, Lawson's (best chicken), Family Mart (best desserts), or 7-Eleven (best egg salad sandos), entering one of these is a treat.&nbsp;</p>

Surprise record-setters like Palworld, which I don't especially like, Helldivers 2, which I rather enjoy, and now Content Warning, which I'm still figuring out. If you missed it, the co-op horror game released on Monday with a temporary free promotion, and racked up a 200,000-player Steam concurrency last night. Published by Totally Accurate Battle Simulator outfit Landfall, it's sort of like Lethal Company in being about venturing into horrible places as a wibbly-wobbly defenceless explorer, but rather than gathering scrap for resale, you're filming yourself and the monsters in a bid to publish a viral "SpookTube" video, with tuber celebrity translating into cash for new equipment. 
Each video is edited together automatically from your footage and accompanying voicechat, once you return from each trip to the Old World, and you can watch it all on an in-game monitor with a mocked-up chat feed and viewcount. It's a pungent, potted commentary on the machinations of Youtube celebrity, with heady notes of "cautionary tale about algorithmic content generation" and "cautionary tale about people endangering or hurting themselves being a dependable source of views". Urgh, I can feel an op-ed coming on. In the meantime, here's how the developers - a team of only five - are updating Content Warning following its launch success.

It's a cracking little game, parkouring about with the help of supernatural powers and a grappling hook, but ends right as it feels like it's getting started. I'd certainly be up for three hours of this, so how splendid to hear that the developers are planning to make a "complete" and fancier experience.

However, here’s some slightly more worrying news, depending on how much you value new ideas: Of all the game time that gamers spent gaming in quantifiable Big Year for Gaming 2023, just 20% of that time was gamed on games other than the 66 specific games mentioned in the report.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Elder Scrolls Online is the elephant in the room where discussions of The Elder Scrolls 6 are concerned, though calling it an elephant is obviously missing the opportunity for a banger lore joke – “dragon”, perhaps, or even “Numidium”? Launched back in 2014 after seven years in development, ESO's hybrid of deceptively single-player-ish Elder Scrolls presentation with MMO fixtures attracted a lukewarm response, initially. “At its best The Elder Scrolls Online looks like a faithful addition to the lore,” intoned Brendy in our own launch impressions. “At its worst it is a derivative and uninventive anachronism.”
ZeniMax Online have made big strides with the game over the years, however - binning off monthly subscriptions and introducing a “level-free” format in the One Tamriel update in 2016. ESO has also swelled and sprouted steadily as a work of geography and history, with major chapters introducing areas hitherto only mentioned in dusty collectible tomes, or creatively reintroducing locations from the single player series – the forthcoming Gold Road expansion, out in June 2024, takes us to the West Weald in Cyrodiil, an area last seen in The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion.

It’s reckoned to have been in development for the last four years or so, and supposedly came about after a talk between Evil Empire and Ubisoft at GDC 2019.

As ever, this isn't really a joke, but it also wasn't exactly a lie, because you can actually play Tiny Wars for real now.

      <p>MechWarrior is a video game series that has been going strong since 1989, and was even a tabletop wargame before that. Clans, however, is the first time in a long time the video games have leaned into the universe's fiction in a big way. The single-player (or cooperative) campaign features a full narrative complete with cutscenes and characters, which is quite different from the recent entries which have primarily been focused on competitive online action.</p>

<p>Join Charles Harte and me as we take a look at gameplay for Clans, which is coming this year to consoles and PC.</p>

Eternal Strands is third-person adventure pitched as a mixture of Shadow Of The Colossus and Monster Hunter with Tears Of The Kingdom's physics powers. The trailer, which you'll find below, certainly has giants you can clamber across and spray with goop.

      <p>Fast travel is an extremely common and welcome quality of life improvement in modern open-world games, but it's a mechanic Dragon's Dogma 2 heavily deemphasizes. It sounds annoying, but to my surprise, it's made me enjoy the game even more than I already did.</p>

<p style="margin-top:13px; margin-bottom:13px">It's worth noting there are some fast travel options in the game, but they're limited. Oxcarts are the easiest, most affordable option, but they're only available in certain cities, and each route only has one of two destinations. They're …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Keepsake's co-op four-player space game Jump Ship, née Hyperspace, you can scuttle your own vessel by overcooking a pizza. There's a cooking minigame in your ship's canteen which grants a health boost if you nail the timing, and sparks off a fire if you don't.
It's a pretty minor fire, mind you. A combusting deep dish doesn't place very highly on the list of possible ship emergencies next to, say, your reactor coughing up nuclear rods, or your engines running out of juice because some oaf hooked up too many turrets to the aforesaid reactor. But if you leave the fire unchecked, perhaps because you're busy disposing of radioactive waste or vengefully unplugging half the point defences, it'll eventually singe your ship's health to nothing - insert appropriate Steam achievement pun and/or Klingon proverb. It's an agreeable little note of idiocy in a game that takes cues from Valve's timeless anecdote generator Left 4 Dead, Sea Of Thieves, FTL and, perhaps most surprisingly, Diablo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like an aggressively competitive thane at a reindeer-piss guzzling contest, 2D tac-and-slash roguelite Sons Of Valhalla never lets up the pace for even a moment. Whether you’re charging across its pixel-art battlefields slashing and burning increasingly tough-to-crack strongholds, or making quick decisions to get the upper hand in its tug-of-war tactics, the only times Thorald is not doing cool violence, commanding others to do cool violence, or upgrading his camps so that he may act in cooler and more violent ways, is when he’s restoring stamina with a cool slug of mead or violently gnawing at health-boosting meat.
Viking Thorald Olavson is a man possessed. A rival Jarl burnt his village and nicked his wife Raya. In his quest to find her, he’s prepared to do anything - even visit England. As Thorald, you’ll butcher your way up a chain of command in your search for Raya across six stages, each of which sits somewhere between the side-scrolling tactics of Kingdom Two Crowns, the lane strategy of a Warpips, and the slashy/blocky/shooty/dodgy of any 2D ARPG you care to name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, how was everyone’s long weekend? I don’t want to alarm anyone, but I think I may have even sensed the fading ghost of an immeasurably whisper-thin ray of sunshine at one point. Enough! Says a new patch for co-op shooter Helldivers 2. You know who else enjoys basking in the pleasant glow of mildly enjoyable weather when there’s freedoms that need fighting for? Bug sympathisers, that’s who. As such, the developers have gone and added new planetary hazards in the form of blizzards and sandstorms, alongside the usual balance tweaks.
Alongside these reminders that the war for democracy is never comfortable, the efficiently-named Patch 01.000.200 also includes a host of tweaks. Notable among these are balancing changes to the mission type ‘Retrieve Essential Personnel’, which now sounds more manageable. Enemy spawn points have been placed further away from the objective, “to give players a fairer chance of defending the location.” Additionally, fewer civilians are needed to beat the mission on higher difficulties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Internet provider Frontier Communications asked a New York bankruptcy court to dismiss several piracy liability claims brought by movie and music industry companies. Citing a recent Supreme Court decision, the ISP argued that merely providing Internet service shouldn't invoke liability. The court agreed that liability isn't automatic but it denied the ISP's request, ruling that there are other copyright-specific factors at play.

In this spooky co-op treat from Landfall Publishing, you play a bunch of amateur filmmakers - or tubers, as the kids possibly still insist on calling them - who must board a spaceship, travel to another planet and film anything monstrous they stumble on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s usually better when writing about games to defer to personal experience before regurgitating marketing, but in the case of bizarre and deeply intriguing 90’s FPS PO’ed, the trailer that STAR WARS: Dark Forces Remaster studio Nightdive released over the long weekend contains a quote that sums up my memories perfectly: “First game I ever owned and played on my PS1,” says quote-ee matt.baller, “In hindsight, I’m surprised I’m not more messed up.”
PO’ed, in which you play a Pissed Off space chef crash-landed on an alien world, was not the very first game I owned for my PS1, but it was certainly one of, and it left a very strong impression. Probably because the first weapon you get is a frying pan, which you then use to batter horrible chicken-leg aliens. If you’re as lost as I imagine anyone hearing of this for the first time might rightly be, here’s that trailer.

It's another mercifully brief four day week in the UK due to reasons of religion, so let's roll with an appropriately snappy intro that avoids any extended digressionary preambles about, oh, I don't know, magpies fighting outside my flat this morning. Did you know that European magpies are great mimics? Second only to the Northern Mockingbird, apparently, though many ornithologists contend that the Brown Thrasher is sorely overlooked. You certainly hear their vocal range when they squabble - I reckon somebody should train up a ChatGPT AI on their calls and no, stop it, I'm doing an anecdote!
Those new PC game releases, without any further ado about birds: Minish Cap-esque shmup Minishoot Adventures (2nd April); Cuban fantasy metroidvania Saviorless (2nd April); culinary defence game Kitchen Crisis (3rd April); Dorfromantikal world builder Planetiles (3rd April); rhythmic robo-dystopian roguelike Beat Slayer (4th April); 90s biker's delight BMX Streets (5th April).

      <p>Harold Halibut has been in development for more than a decade. It has a fascinating and unique style set in a well-realized future where a portion of humanity has relocated to an underwater planet. It's a bit like <em>Interstellar</em>, but if things had gone how they were supposed to. Ahead of the game's release on April 16 (on Game Pass as well as other platforms), Charles Harte and I decided to take a look at an early portion of the game, discuss the developers' intentions for the narrative and gameplay, and detail how the game was made.</p>

<p>For a whole lot more on Harold Halibut, you can <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/02/07/the-stop-motion-adventure-11-years-in-the-making">read this feature where I interviewed game director Ole Tillmann and art director Onat Hekimoglu</a>.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh MMy — a new ScummVM release!
Please welcome the first ScummVM release of the year: ScummVM 2.8.1.
ScummVM 2.8.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on fixing bugs that were uncovered since our last stable release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines: AGI, AGS, GRIM, SWORD2, MM (which is now enabled — yes, we really skipped it in 2.8.0 by accident), mTropolis, NANCY, SCUMM, TWINE, Ultima, and V-Cruise.
The Android, Atari and macOS ports received multiple bug fixes, mostly for improving overall stability and preventing some crashes we’ve seen under certain circumstances.
The detailed list of improvements is available here.
As always, you can find the latest release on our Downloads page.
Go grab it while it's hot — enjoy!
