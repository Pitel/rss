Undaunted North Africa

One of my favorite games, Undaunted North Africa employs the staggeringly innovative deck-building mechanics from Undaunted Normandy and adds to it a whole load of new features and asymmetry. Honestly, I'd recommend the entire franchise, but if you could only pick one, I'd choose North Africa.

It’s hard to believe, but it’s been a few weeks shy of 16 years since the original World of Goo barged its way onto Wii and PC back in 2008. Its wacky physics and endearing presentation stole the hearts of practically everyone who played it, and a re-release on Nintendo Switch back in 2017 reaffirmed its lofty status, but can its sequel reach similar, gooey heights?
The basic premise and structure of World of Goo 2 is essentially identical to that of the first: you have to get enough Goo Balls to the pipe to complete each level, and that largely means building a structure using said Goo Balls to shepherd as many Goo Balls as possible to the previously mentioned pipe. We’re going to be saying ‘Goo Balls’ a lot in this review, so buckle up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first World Of Goo was a cheerful parade of goopy engineering with a sense of never-ending novelty (well, never-ending for about four hours). Every level would introduce a new goo type or a twist on the basic bridge-building puzzle that challenged you to get a gaggle of gurgling balls to the nearest pipe. World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes. That pursuit doesn't always result in pleasing new levels, though. There is a "hit and miss" feeling to things this time around. But those hits are hits. For anyone who has spent the last 16 years yearning for more sticky structure-building: I hope you like comically unpredictable fluids.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny 2 has a lot of different combat buffs you can get depending on your build. So many in fact that it can sometimes not display them all, seeing as there are only four buff slots on the left side of your screen. This is great since it means you're getting a ton of free bonuses, though what they do isn't always clear. Here's what Frost Armor is in Destiny 2.


What does Frost Armor do in Destiny 2?


Image via Destructoid.


Frost Armor is a buff exclusively associated with the Stasis subclass and requires certain Aspects or Fragments to trigger. This is a stacking damage resistance buff, granting 4.5% damage resistance per stack going up to five stacks with 22.5% damage resistance. In PvP, this effect is dropped to 2% per stack for 10% maximum damage resistance. Each stack you get lasts 10 seconds, though additional stacks refresh the timer. With the Fragment Whisper of Rime, this can be increased to 10 stacks maximum for 45% damage resistance.


To put this into perspective, Woven Mail, which is acquired through various means in the Strand subclass, provides 45% damage resistance. This may sound woefully imbalanced, and to some extent it is, but it heavily depends on your subclass and build since both have other strengths.


How can you get Frost Armor?


Image via Destructoid.


Frost Armor has a few ways of being acquired. Namely, the Whisper of Fractures Fragment provides you with a stack of Frost Armor when meleeing a Frozen target to shatter them. However, the more consistent sources of Frost Armor are the Glacial, Tectonic, and Grim Harvest Aspects, providing a stack of Frost Armor when picking up Stasis shards. These spawn frequently, so getting 5-10 stacks shouldn't be a problem on the right setup.

The world of Zelda: Ocarina of Time speedrunning is a wild one. The best of the best have Any% runs down to under four minutes these days, but there's still hope that it can be done faster. And so we reach the latest discovery, one that utilises a Wii U GamePad and a rubber band to shave three to four seconds off the current world record — if it's deemed legal (thanks, GamesRadar).
First, some background. OOT speedrunners make use of a Stale Reference Manipulation (SRM) called Lightnode SRM to alter the game's code and memory through specific characters in the save game's filename. Such manipulation makes the end credits roll after the player completes a series of specific inputs in the opening Kokiri Forest section. It might not be the full-game experience, but hey, that's an Any % speedrun.

This time, though, we're looking at one of the biggest crises the company's ever had, as it continues to lay off some of its most valuable talent, even after Destiny 2: The Final Shape ended up being way better than expected.


More specifically, Bungie recently announced that it's losing about a third of its staff. Some of these folks are being rolled over into Sony, while others outright lost their jobs, but the really surprising bit is how many veteran developers have been booted from the studio. According to the latest developments in a Gamespot report, senior executives Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy have also been affected by these layoffs, which comes as a pretty big surprise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All hail NoE SE.
In addition to its usual financial shenanigans, Nintendo has announced that its plan to merge its European subsidiaries under one banner is now complete.
The merger - the details of which were originally divulged back in November 2022 - saw the likes of Nintendo France, Nintendo Benelux, and Nintendo Ibérica effectively cease to exist as separate identities, instead continuing to operate under the larger Nintendo of Europe label.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced that the Game Boy Advance classic Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team will be coming to Nintendo Switch Online on August 9, 2024. This is a great excuse for those of us who never had a chance to play this spin-off series to dive in like it's launch day. 


Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team was the last Pokémon game to be released for the Game Boy Advance. Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team was its counterpart on the Nintendo DS, but the only differences outside of hardware were six exclusive Pokémon on each version. The game focuses on the turn-based combat elements of the series and pits you against groups of enemy Pokémon as you work your way through randomized dungeons, trying to complete jobs for clients and rescue those trapped inside.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite has many named and unnamed locations, from well-known landmarks to random gas stations and small spots at the edges of the map. However, while Davy Jones' Locker sounds like another unnamed area, getting here is easier than you think but requires some sacrifice.


How to visit Davy Jones' Locker in Fortnite X Pirates event


Visiting Davy Jones' Locker means being eliminated during your Fortnite match. It doesn't matter how you do it as long as your character dies somehow. While having a player defeat you is the easiest way, NPCs, fall damage, or even fire from campfires will do the trick.

It also doesn't matter which location you choose to eliminate yourself and visit Davy Jones' locker. If you want to finish it quickly, you can drop out of the Battle Bus, land at the nearest landmark, and wait for another player to appear. Alternatively, you can focus on other quests and naturally obtain this one if you don't get a Victory Royale. How you do this is entirely up to you. Personally, I chose to drop down and let someone knock me out with their pickaxes before starting another match a few minutes later.


Once your character dies, you'll officially visit Davy Jones' locker and receive Cursed Gold toward the Cursed Sails Battle Pass. You'll also gain progress toward finishing all eight Pirate Code Eight quests to receive your last map piece and unlock Captain Jack Sparrow's ship. It's up to you whether you want to hop back into a match and show off your glider or take a break if you just finished a long game.

Well, we weren't expecting this. After crunching some of the numbers from Nintendo's latest financial report, it turns out that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - which was a launch game in 2017, mind - actually sold better than its direct sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, during Q1 of FY2025 (cheers, Mr. Jon Cartwright).
Now, for a sequel to sell fewer copies than its predecessor over its lifetime isn't paritcularly surprising (in fact, it's usually the norm), but for the first game to sell more over a period of three months in 2024? That's wild.

File this one in a box labelled "Huh, makes sense", because Nintendo has confirmed that its selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose by 2.4% year-on-year during its latest financial report.
"Okay, so?", you might ask, and it's a fair question. While certainly not a particularly noteworthy announcement on its own, Nintendo has confirmed that one of the main reasons for this is due to a rise in research and development costs. As we know, the successor to the Switch will be revealed at some point before the end of FY2025, so it's not unreasonable to assume that the company is now all-in on development for the new console.

The latest cuts were necessary to prevent continued losses, says the report, after Bungie missed Sony’s targets following the release of last year’s Lightfall.

Paper Mario shifted a sweet 1.76 million units since its release in May and the Luigi's Mansion remaster hit 1.19 million in just a few days after launching on 27th June (these figures only count up to 30th June).

The order stays the same with some minimal additions to the total sales figures, but there may be a shift in the coming months.

There are no surprises here if you've been keeping up with release date news, but following the June 2024 Nintendo Direct, this is the first one of these on which Metroid Prime 4 has shaken its dreaded TBA label in the last seven years — and it's still scheduled to arrive sometime in 2025.

The Superdrop celebrates the 50th anniversary of D&D with a whopping five Drops that culminate in this colossal Superdrop. Each one will be available on the Secret Lair website on August 27, 2024. 


The announcement for what will undoubtedly be the most sought-after Secret Lairs of 2024 was made on Twitter and required a thread for all the information despite only two cards having been shown so far. You'll be pleased to know that the cards play into your deepest desires and will feature characters from Baldur's Gate 3. At the time of writing, Karlach and Astarion have been revealed. However, I hope there's a callback to classic D&D artwork and characters from the past five decades somewhere i…]]></summary>

The game has been in development for years and is itself a resurrection of an even older title, but the work is far from over. 


Through 2024, Predecessor has been released in beta for Xbox and PlayStation consoles, and Omeda Studios has introduced Brawl and Ranked Modes into the roster for players to enjoy. Even before then, though, starting in 2020, the game has been in the works, with new heroes and skins being added to the roster on a regular basis. Having played it for a while now, I believe its the link to the community that's given this game the momentum to reach this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a deluge of criticism (including from yours truly), World of Warcraft's Radiant Echoes pre-patch event is getting some big tweaks today. In a blogpost over on the forums, community manager Kaivax breaks down the changes.


Less waiting, more rewards


Long story short, the event is going to have less waiting around and, when you do complete it, you'll get more rewards. 


Before the patch, you'd have to show up at the beginning of the 90-minute window to complete the event within a rotating zone. Once this event was finished (which took anywhere from 5 to 8 minutes), you were out of luck if you missed it. With this patch, the event will continuously refresh throughout the entire duration. In the active zone, scenarios will appear and, after defeating them, a boss will spawn. Rinse and repeat.

If you do want to farm the lesser mobs that appeared in the zone once the event was over, those will be available in the other, "inactive" zones. 


Furthermore, rewards are being increased, and the weekly quests that rewarded 1,500 Residual Memories will now be daily across your account (to cut down on the urge to run the event across multiple alts). With bosses spawning so much more quickly and dropping the same loot, you should be getting a lot more event gear from drops alone, so those memories can be put to good use buying the event's mounts and pets. 


Leave it to Blizzard to outdate my blogpost in just 24 hours, but as Kaivax says, "we hear you!"

Developer IO Interactive added the Mystery of the Unicorns challenge to Hitman World of Assassination as part of the game's Summer 2024 update. It gives you a new reason to revisit Dartmoor, though not as you might first think. Instead, this challenge is firmly locked to The Dartmoor Garden Show mission. This is the game's only main Escalation Mission type, which is a staple part of the story and not a smaller chunk of a standard location because it contains a completely revamped version of the main map.

It features Jockey+, Anticipate+, and Aerial+, which are all really good options to have in the current power meta.

      <p>Squirrel with a Gun is an evocative title, and this wacky sandbox platformer by Dee Dee Creations lives up to its namesake. You do, in fact, control a seemingly ordinary squirrel who wields human-sized guns (and other weapons like a rocket launcher) to blast shady government agents while bouncing around a physics sandbox. It's a strange and silly game, and you can watch editors Marcus Stewart and Charles Harte attempt to rationalize this exclusive gameplay montage.&nbsp;</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That one guy in the group always doodling a dingus will be pleased, as the Jackbox Naughty Pack seems to be encouraging it this time around with three new games. Fakin' It All Night Long, Dirty Drawful, and Let Me Finish will likely leave us in stitches when they launch sometime in September. 




Yes, you will be Fakin' It All Night Long!


The social deduction game Fakin' It returns in this All Night Long version as the faker tries to blend in as the participants tell the truth and perform a secret task. The idea is that you have to become the best liar in your group. This naughty version of the game will have new categories and an all-new remote play mode. 


Dirty Drawful marks a return to the popular Jackbox game over the years but adds spicier prompts into the equation. Described as "both terrible and titillating," to the point in which an undo button has been added to the game. If you haven't played Drawful before, it's like Pictionary, but everyone tries to fool other players into choosing their guess/answer. If another player chooses your option instead of the real answer, you'll get points.


Image via Jackbox Games


The only new game added to the Jackbox Naughty Pack is Let Me Finish. It's a debate-style presentation game, in which you're answering odd questions, such as which "meat" most likely wants to be called daddy, for example. In the trailer, seven different meat sticks are shown and you have to choose which one is the daddiest. Another question asks, "How does this avocado get aroused?" I've got nothing, but surely know someone that'll bring the snark. 


The Jackbox Naughty Pack is heading to consoles and PC sometime in September 2024 for $21.69. Ahhh, we see what you did there, Jackbox.

Well, I got up this morning and made a small suburban village with a hospital, school, police station and a cafe in the space of 20 minutes. This is the backwater burg of Edwitherington. Population: 8 - one for every non-residential building in town. Major imports: ornamental lampposts, because I like to cultivate an old-timey mood. Major exports: traffic jams, because I've laid out my village in the form of a small crescent leading back to the freeway, which means that there are two traffic light junctions about 100 metres apart.

Can you believe it, Ace Attorney fans? We're almost at the end of the incredible journey that has been the AA Switch remakes, and honestly, we never thought we'd see the day – let alone so soon. The Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, comprising the first and second games in the Edgeworth-focused spin-off, is coming out in September, the same year as the Apollo Justice Trilogy – and we've got a tasty little preview-slash-Q&A to whet your appetite.
We've been playing the games for around a month now, and we're about halfway through each one. We've played Investigations before, when it came out on the DS in 2010, but this is the first time that Investigations 2, now known as Prosecutor's Gambit, has been translated officially for a release outside of Japan.

It got shut down last year as Activision focused their efforts elsewhere, making the map unplayable. But you can now revisit those bullet-strewn beaches. In theory, anyway. Activision have released it as a 4GB open-source project that can be explored in a 3D model-viewing tool. That's cool. But among their reasons for doing so, there lies a predictably grubby logic: they want people to use the data to train AI.

When Nintendo launched Metroid Dread in 2021, there was no doubt in our minds that it would inspire more fast-paced, gritty Metroidvanias later down the road. MARS 2120 is one such title; a sci-fi romp that attempts to capture the same magic that made Dread so special, but ultimately falls at almost every hurdle.
It starts off strong, taking place on the surface of Mars where you’re fleeing from an avalanche of rocks and rubble. It’s exciting stuff, but even during this introductory sequence, something about the controls just felt off. You’re blessed with a double-jump ability right from the start, but executing it never feels quite natural enough considering how often you’ll need to use it throughout the game. It’s not bad, as such, but it feels a bit too floaty for our liking.

In my brief time with massive Fallout 4 mod Fallout London, I’ve read a delightful terminal entry about a scientist who named his favourite radiated shrew “Big Dave,” thwacked several of said Radshrews with a walking stick, gulped down some expired pink wafers, and been informed of train delays due to “leaves on the track.”
“A British transport joke!” I said to myself, marinating in the sufficient amount of crown-mandated mild amusement. “Our organ-floggingly expensive yet vital public services are crap!” I was having a good time.

I actually cannot remember when the beef started, but my mum reliably informs me that I was terrified to tears by this bear as a child. He yet survives, but mark my words: when the Woody Copters finally fall from their rusted hinges, I will salt the earth.

      <p>The 2002 Star Wars: Bounty Hunter video game is being updated and making its way to modern consoles and PC, and we decided to give it a look.</p>

<p>The original game, now more than 20 years old, was released on GameCube and PlayStation 2, and this new version adds all kinds of interesting bells and whistles. According to developer Aspyr, this version is a native port of the GameCube version of the game, as opposed to an emulation. The game also features contemporary controls and and overhauled camera system.</p>

<p>You can watch the video for our full impressions and play (or replay it) on August 1 on PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Series X/S, Switch, and PC.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't think I'm capable of rivalling Nic's enthusiasm for Promise Mascot Agency, the new open world game from Paradise Killer devs Kaizen Game Works, so I'll settle for saying "EEEEE". The developers have just released a nine-minute explainer video, which teems with scenes of gimp suits, winged vans, rocket-propelled pinkies, vicious card battles against small excited dogs, and a surprisingly in-depth management component.

This has less to do with GTA in itself, Vermeij says, than with the fact that changes in computing capacity today simply aren't as dramatic as in the days of the very first PlayStation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Garry Newman has confirmed that the DMCA notice was sent last year, and has since been "all resolved", in an email to IGN.
Original story:
Earlier this month it was reported that Skibidi Toilet, the YouTube phenomenon, may be heading to film and television via director Michael Bay. Now Invisible Narratives, a production company co-owned by Bay, has apparently sent a DMCA takedown notice to Garry Newman, citing the large number of Skibidi Toilet games and assets advertised within Garry's Mod.

</p>


      <p>A new trailer for Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero takes aim at Dragon Ball Z’s earliest story arcs, the Saiyan and Namek sagas. New characters from both eras will be joining the roster.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New fighters include members of both the Ginyu and Frieza Forces (remember Cui?), the Namakian warrior Nail, and every form of Frieza during the Z era. Perhaps most hilariously, you can even play as one of the Saibamen, meaning we get to watch it blow up Yamcha all over again, which never gets old.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's the full list of new fighters joining the roster:</p>

<ul>

      <p>Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus launched to generally solid reviews on July 18, but those playing the hand-drawn action platformer on consoles will have to wait longer for any post-launch updates. Developer Squid Shock Studios revealed that last week's sudden&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/humble-games-devs-told-company-is-shutting-down">closure of publisher Humble Games</a> has adversely affected its ability to provide timely support to those versions of the game…]]></summary>

Whereas AMD’s first take on driver-level frame generation – the same kind of framerate-roiding image generation trickery that FSR 3 and DLSS 3 are based around – came yoked to a barrel of jittering, stuttering, and visual artefacting issues, Fluid Motion Frames 2 is as smooth and you’d like. Without compromising on the ability to deploy it in theoretically any DirectX 11- or 12-based game, too.

      <p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/after-15-years-visions-of-mana-revives-the-series">Visions of Mana</a> is a month away from release, but anxious players can get an early taste starting today, thanks to a free demo. Available now on PlayStation consoles, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, this playable slice lets players experience the game’s first chapter and a big boss fight.</p>

<p>The demo begins in the middle of Chapter 1 at Rime Falls and takes players through areas such as Fallow Steppe and Rhata Harbor. The chapter’s final boss, the Kraken, awaits the playable party of Val, Careena, and Morley.&nbsp;</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHIJtLufSsM" width="640"></iframe>

<p>Unfortunately, save data will not transfer from the demo to the full game. Square Enix states this is because the final version of this section has been altered “for a more satisfying experience.” Instead, those with save data from the demo who purchase the full game will receive three weapons for Val upon reaching Chapter 1: Gladius, Falx, and Horn Lance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First revealed at The Game Awards 2023, Visions of Mana marks the first original Mana entry in 15 years. Set in a vibrant, semi-open, fully 3D world, the adventure stars Val, who travels to the Mana Tree alongside his lifelong friend Hinna. You can watch the game’s most recent trailer <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/12/visions-of-mana-gets-august-release-date-in-new-trailer">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Visions of Mana launches on August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.</p>]]></summary>

Peel back the curtains of American cultural hegemony however and you may find the true pulsing core of British comedy that lies beneath: innuendo. No American network is in a bidding war to import Vic and Bob or remake Bottom, and Carry On and Benny Hill are assumed to be anachronisms in our modern times, but Thank Goodness You're Here! enters the conversation with a nudge and a wink. It's a cheeky 2-3 hour adventure through a small northern town, and it's here to educate the entire world of our nation's obsession with sausages and bare bottoms.

Whew, that's a lot. Potentially too much. But hey, I am here for something ambitious and interesting, of which it ticks both boxes.

I'm not sure how much the demo offers, as we're only told it includes "a section of the story, battles and exploration." But that's better than nothing, and with a full month before release, you have plenty of time to scope it out.

I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation. There are sprawling underground ecosystems to discover, yes, weird plants to harvest, fractious clumps of tentacles to appraise, avoid or slaughter. But all of these things are contemptible details to be swept up and bagged and thrown in the dumpster.

</p>


      <p>Last month, we learned Sega and Amazon had partnered to create a <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/04/like-a-dragon-yakuza-live-action-series-hits-amazon-prime-video-this-october">live-action series based on the Like a Dragon</a> (formerly Yakuza) series. Over the weekend, during the San Diego Comic-Con, the studio unveiled the first teaser trailer.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza</em> centers on Kazuma Kiryu (played by Takeuchi Ryoma) and follows his life during two time periods: 1995 and 2005. Set in the series’ fictional Tokyo district of Kamurochō, the trailer’s synopsis states the show “depicts the lives of fierce yet passionate gangsters and people” and will explore stories the games haven’t been able to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The six-episode series will be released on Prime Video in two parts, with the first three episodes premiering on October 24 and the last three arriving on November 1. It will be subbed and dubbed in 30 languages. <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> is directed by Take Masaharu (<em>100 Yen Love</em>).</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller has posted a lengthy blog on Steam about the transition from 6v6 player matches in the first Overwatch to 5v5 in the poorly received free-to-play sequel. It's a juicy read for armchair designers and lapsed Overwatchers like myself, packing in analysis of class roles and the shift from the free choice of heroes to single hero picks and enforced team compositions.
In broad strokes, Keller summarises how the Overwatch experience has drifted away from "player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players". It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now "exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.

They often feel like a casualty of Marvel movie bloat. Mortal Kombat 1 was marketed as a "reboot", for example, but is really just a continuation of previous nonsense, with developers NetherRealm saying "I don't know, stick a multiverse in it." Yet from that multiverse now arrives another bad guy, bringing new story chapters for the fighting game's first big expansion, as well as extra characters like the liquid metal murderer from Terminator 2, a Conan of the barbarian persuasion, and the masked killer of the Scream movies.

The free iOS music streaming tool has millions of happy users, but is branded a parasitic threat by the music industry. Behind the scenes, music industry group IFPI has been working hard to get it removed from the App Store. Apple hasn't taken action thus far but further escalation involving the major labels, YouTube, and a potential lawsuit, were proposed earlier this year.

"If you play that right now," he said, "there is no compass, no map, literally the quests are like 'go to the third tree on the right and walk 50 paces west'... And if you did that now, no one would play it. Very few people would play it." Well sir, have you heard of a little open world RPG called Dread Delusion? It's pretty good. And what's more, it has just added a whole new area with - let me see - a giant floating squid creature with an entire town of citizens living inside its shell.

</p>


      <p>In Date Everything, those looking for romance don’t need to look any further than their refrigerator, smoke alarm, or dining room table. That’s because this wacky sandbox dating sim by developer Sassy Chap is all about forming relationships with everyday household objects that, it turns out, are actually pretty hot.</p>

<p>The game bestows players with special “Dateviator” glasses that allow them to speak with objects and see them in their true, absurdly attractive forms. Dozens of objects await your affection – even elements like air and water can be courted – and branching dialogue can lead to three relationship resolutions for each character (Love, Friend, Hate). Whatever you decide will be reflected in the ever-changing 3D overworld that is your house.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Date Everything boasts over 100 voiced characters played by performers that include Felicia Day (<em>Critical Role</em>, <em>Supernatural</em>), Johnny Yong Bosch (<em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</em>, <em>Bleach</em>), and Grey DeLisle (<em>Scooby-Doo, Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>). Given the huge amount of speaking roles, Date Everything boasts 1.2 million words and 70,000 voiced lines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Date Everything looks delightfully silly, but it unfortunately doesn’t have a release window. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.</p>]]></summary>

Yes, the arrow of time is inviolable. We are all marching steadily towards our graves, I know. But at least now 7 Days To Die has finally released its fully baked version 1.0.

As we take a closer look at the report, which suggests that the personal details of millions could be at risk, the irony is unavoidable. Information on how to spot this scam is readily available, yet the scam itself relies on a steady stream of people eager to research on Z-Library, having done no research at all on the potential pitfalls.

</p>


      <p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is one of the year’s biggest RPGs, and now players will be able to take it on the go. BioWare has updated the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/">Steam page</a> to confirm it’s been verified for Steam Deck.</p>


<blockquote class="tw-align-center twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We're making great progress towards our fall launch date, and can confirm early that <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DragonAge?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DragonAge</a>: The Veilguard is going all-in on <a href="https://twitter.com/Steam?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Steam</a> features!<br />
⚔️We're verified on Steam Deck.<br />
⚔️We'll be Steam native - meaning the EA App will not be required to play the game.<br />

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/Hrungry/status/1816450818658500668">Hrungr on X</a>, this means that The Veilguard will be fully functional on Valve’s handheld, which has not been confirmed until now. Consider this a quick PSA for PC players who enjoy playing their role-playing games on the small(ish) screen.&nbsp;</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl, the beautifully grotty sci-fi shooter sequel from Ukrainian studio GSC Game World, has been delayed once again. It’s a relatively good-spirited delay, though: first off, it’s not that long, with the previously planned September 5th launch pushed back just a few weeks to November 20th. There’s also clever little in-universe announcement video (one which gives the fourth wall a study kick on its way out), and an accompanying promise of a meaty "developer deep dive video", set to reveal much more of the game’s radioactive hellscape on August 12th.

      <p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl has suffered yet another delay. The long-awaited post-apocalyptic shooter was slated to arrive on September 5 but will now launch on November 20 to give developer GSC Game World more time to address technical issues.</p>

Not only from larger studios like Arkane, keeping the faith alive with their time loops and space stations, but also from a bunch of smaller developers bravely exploring a typically ambitious genre. RPS has always had an affinity for these systemically luxuriant simulations, historically lauding the likes of the original Deus Ex as the best game ever made. But given everything that has come since, is that still the case? Only one way to find out: make a big list.

There, got it right in the end. We've known about the development of this terror-heavy tourist attraction since its announcement early this year. But now the upcoming horror sim has been given an autumn release date in a new trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apex Legends developers Respawn Entertainment have announced that poorly-received plans to overhaul the battle royale's Premium Battle Pass will be partially walked back. Most crucially, the new passes – set to launch alongside the upcoming Season 22 in August – will no longer be sold exclusively for real-world cash; as with previous BPs, players will still be able to buy them with accumulated in-game currency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grit And Valor 1949 certainly evokes the tactics of Into The Breach, with its stompy machinery and floating tile battlegrounds. But, despite all appearances, this one isn’t actually turn-based at all. A tiley, tiny real time strategy then? Aye, and one that’s actually pretty frantic as it happens. Missions are snappy, intense skirmishes. You’ll fight off waves while trying to protect your useless, freeloading command vehicle. This threat, combined with on-the-fly tactical consider-me-do's like utilising cover and keeping rock-paper-scissors matchups in your favour ends up spawning something quite distinct. Please, do stomp on, preferably with less hypens for all our sakes.

</p>


      <p>We’re not far off from the August 9 premiere of <em>Borderlands</em>, and Lionsgate is giving the final hard sell for the upcoming adaptation in the form of a new trailer.</p>

<p>Like the first game, <em>Borderlands</em> centers on a group of gun-toting Vault hunters searching for treasure on the planet Pandora.&nbsp;They also get roped up to save a mysterious girl who holds the key to a great power. If you’re still not sure what to make of the film after watching its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2024/02/21/the-borderlands-movies-first-trailer-looks-as-ridiculous-as-the-games">first trailer</a>, hopefully, this last preview will help you decide whether or not you’ll be making the trip to theaters in a couple of weeks to see it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Borderlands</em> is directed by Eli Roth and stars Cate Blanchett (Lilith), Kevin Hart (Roland), Arianna Greenblatt (Tiny Tina), Jack Black (Claptrap), Edgar Ramírez (Atlas), Florian Munteanu (Krieg), Gina Gershon (Moxxi), and Jamie Lee Curtis (Tannis).</p>]]></summary>

And for some, it'll deliver what's needed: a fairly good time. A time marked by a loop that does hack 'n slash, management, and a dash of base repairs to an average degree. For me, though, and possibly many others, I simply don't think this mix ever truly captures what makes even the simplest of tower defence games so captivating.

Of course I want to put a chainsaw on the front of my bike, Motördoom. Obviously I want a rougelike-able upgrade that perchance may set my demonic enemies on fire. Yes, I’d like to combine a sick manual with an action game killstreak for a very large combo, Motördoom. Is this what overly concerned parents thought PS1 games were actually like? If I got a disc with this demo on as a kid, I’d be significantly radder than I am today. Gnarly, even. Made of gnarls.

      <p>Last year's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III will be available on Xbox Game Pass tomorrow, July 24. This marks the next big Activision Blizzard title to join the service.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The move comes less than a year after Modern Warfare III launched last November and represents the fruit of Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year. It’s also the biggest AB title to appear on Game Pass since <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/19/marchs-xbox-game-pass-line-up-has-diablo-iv-and-cars-galore">Diablo IV was added to the library</a> in March.</p>

<p>This gives subscribers a chance to check out last year’s entry before 2024’s installment, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/09/hoping-to-sprint-in-the-right-direction">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, launches on Game Pass on October 25.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the heyday of Sierra's adventure game years, there was a series called Space Quest that featured an intergalactic janitor named Roger Wilco. The series was more satirical than King's Quest, less preachy than Police Quest, and not quite as adult as Leisure Suit Larry. Spearheaded by Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe - a pair of devs who called themselves "Two Guys from Andromeda" - Space Quest was renowned for its humour, and there was a nice sense of progression throughout most of the series, with Roger Wilco leveling up from working class spaceman to the head of his own Star Trek ship.

      <p>Dead by Daylight (DBD) has been one of the most popular multiplayer games (and horror titles in general) since its launch in 2016, but fans have dreamed of experiencing its universe in a single-player format. Developer Behaviour Interactive agreed and enlisted the cinematic storytelling expertise of Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, The Quarry) to create an original story in the DBD universe. That game became The Casting of Frank S…]]></summary>

Even if the fallen culture you’ll defend against waves of gribblies offers fascinatingly few concrete details on its origins, there’s a lithe and impressionistic otherworldliness and use of colour in Cataclismo’s art that evokes unearthed layers of history. Also, everyone is just so gosh darn likeable, with their foppish hats plopped atop stretched bodies, and dialogue that remains resolute, chirpy, and eager, even when you’re click-marching these poor folk straight to their deaths.
Still, none of this will stop me will sacrificing every last man, woman, and child of these beleaguered warriors if it means preserving a single one of my immaculately crafted staircases.

What does this mean as a layperson who sort of plays the game sometimes? More than you might think!

It's a singleplayer game in which you control not one but both carriers of a stretcher. You have to ferry a sick man over the hilly countryside, past muddy lake banks and over snowy mountains, all without dropping him on the ground. I can only imagine it controls a bit like Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons, but with added ragdoll jollity. We'll know next week, when it releases on Steam.

And the developers of upcoming Japanese folklore 'em up Otoshi No Shima seem to understand this, having created a monstrous creature with a gaping mouth that follows the player at every turn.

I even went to so far as to create a chap named Karrot King in Stardew before quitting in disgust because I couldn’t easily access carrot seeds.
I cannot in good conscious claim that I manifested such a videogame - that was the work of Skyreach Studio. However, this is the internet, so I will both take credit for it and offer you an exclusive discount on my course. While I’m waiting for your membership fee to arrive, I’ll be playing Critter Crops. It’s a witchy farming sim in which you grow odd pets and cast spells from flesh-bound grimoires. One of the verbs it offers on its Steam page is 'noodle'. Apologies to all the other games on my wishlist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3’s latest patch was due to launch in closed beta yesterday, but Larian have decided to give it a bit more time in the oven due to bugs. Namely, a bug that caused passive rolls - like those that detect traps - to stop working.
Happily, if you hadn’t already registered to take part in the beta, you now have more time to sign up. Scroll down a bit on the RPG’s Steam page and click the ‘Request Access’ button.

That would be charming enough on its own, but your agricultural endeavours are set inside a Polly Pocket-style toy, with crops also able to be exchanged for furniture with which to decorate your diorama home. After blowing past its Kickstarter target, there's now a playable demo.

</p>


      <p>Perhaps the most unexpected announcement at EVO 2024 was the reveal that 2003’s SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos is being re-released. Not only does this make it available on modern platforms with new bells and whistles, but you can play it right now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game was originally launched in 2003 for the Neo Geo arcade before it was ported to PlayStation 2 (in Japan) and Xbox in the U.S. It pits 36 fighters from SNK franchises such as The King of Fighters, Samurai Shodown, and Metal Slug 2 against Capcom fighters from series like Street Fighter, Mega Man, Darkstalkers, and more.</p>

<p>SVC Chaos now features quality-of-life updates such as a hitbox viewer, rollback netcode for online play, and an art gallery. It also makes formerly secret characters Athena and Red Arremer available from the start. The game's surprise launch on Steam on July 20 followed its reveal, and it comes to PlayStation 4 and Switch today. You can pick it up now for $19.99.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>On an almost weekly basis, Fortnite announces new crossover events, adding characters to its Battle Royale, Lego, and Festival modes. Whether it's a fictional character like Jack Sparrow or a real person like Ariana Grande, it's hard to find a corner of pop culture the game hasn't touched. These crossovers, however, are almost always exclusive to characters, but Fortnite players don't always have to traverse the Battle Royale map on foot – there are vehicles as well. Today's crossover comes in the form of a particul…]]></summary>

</p>


      <p>Tekken 8’s next Season 1 fighter was revealed during Evo this weekend, and it’s none other than Heihachi Mishima. The mainstay villain has apparently survived his presumed death (again) and is ready to reclaim his throne.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A cinematic trailer rolls out the red carpet for Heihachi, setting up his return after he was seemingly killed (i.e., tossed into a volcanic lava river) in Tekken 7. The video doesn’t explain how Heihachi managed not to melt into goop, but he does sport a Kazuya-esque scar on his chest now, so he didn’t walk away completely unscathed.&nbsp;</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QZWDIKKvNrc" width="640"></iframe>

<p>Heihachi becomes available sometime this fall. He follows<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/01/15/eddy-gordo-is-tekken-8s-first-dlc-fighter-opening-cinematic-released"> Eddy Gordo</a> and <a href="http://sobieska">Lidia Sobieska</a>, who joined Tekken 8 in the spring (i.e., July 25) and summer, respectively, leaving one fighter left for the winter season. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions automatically receive these fighters, and each can also be purchased individually for $7.99.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arranger is a puzzle game about moving, in both metaphorical and literal senses. Movement is the entire basis for the puzzles in Arranger, and is hard to explain without showing you (if you're able to watch the trailer that will be helpful). The world of Arranger is divided into a grid, and you don't move the main character, feisty misfit kid Jemma, across the squares. Rather, imagine that the row or column Jemma is on becomes a travelator, and you control the direction and speed of it. Jemma stands still and you move the ground, and anything on it left, right, up or down - like How To Say Goodbye but with more squares. It's one of those things that makes sense when you're doing it, trust me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heihachi Mishima, the mustachioed malevolence of the Tekken series, is going to be the next DLC character for Tekken 8. He was last seen with his loving son Kazuya, who threw him into a volcano. Of course, to be fully submerged in impossibly hot liquid rock is merely a long-running family prank for the cast of this 3D fighting game, sort of like forcing your granddad to do the ice bucket challenge, but with lava. Nobody truly expected the horn-haired headbutter to be fully removed from the series. But I am a little surprised to see him back so soon.

Now FlatOut, FlatOut 2 and FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage have all received an update on Steam to add Workshop support, Steam Deck verified status, improved performance, and in the case of FlatOut 2, re-enabled online multiplayer.

Deep in the Dark Place of Alan Wake 2 there is a forest that is not a forest - a zig-zag tunnel adorned with murals of a grisly woodland scene. Entering that tunnel, you find yourself sealed in at either end. But the mural suggests a way out: it changes when you turn around, following an unspoken narrative. It's a device as delicate as the graffiti elsewhere in the Dark Place is obnoxious. In hindsight, it feels like an example of "metsänpeitto", a concept from Finnish folklore about forests which, as writer Sinikka Annala explains, saturates the design of Alan Wake 2. It's a fascinating idea I'd love certain much larger, less intriguing video game worlds to learn from.

Katharine called it "a real grower" before the early access release in January, likening it to both Dorfromantik and The Banished Vault - a chalk and cheese comparison if ever I heard one. Well rejoice, perverted chalk-and-cheese mixers, because Roots of Yggdrasil now has a 1.0 release date - 6th September 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edwin’s been appreciating the acrobatic twist that Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn puts on the Soulslite formula, but not everybody’s magical zip-zooping has been going as smoothly. Following the Steam and PC Game Pass releases yesterday, there are widespread reports of heavy stuttering spoiling the fun; I’ve given both versions a test, and indeed, Flintlock does have a serious case of the framerate stammers. Especially the Game Pass build, which is significantly worse for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am burning the Bishop while he sleeps. I'd say it's nothing personal, but quite a lot in medieval management sim Norland is personal. He shouldn't have slept with the Queen's sister, for example. He shouldn't have insisted his lover subsequently pay him for a confession to absolve herself of the guilt accrued from sleeping with him. He shouldn't have felt safe in a room next to the Queen, a woman described as "reckless" in her character traits, and who is perilously close to having a nervous breakdown. This, my holy friend, is how your bed chamber becomes a raging inferno. 
By the end of my first game of Norland, the village of Nandos (you can name your own settlements) is covered in more blood than the back end of the bard's best work. In storytelling terms, it is a tragedy. In terms of fantasy management games? It is great fun. The failure cascade as waterslide.
