The weekend is finally upon us and it's time to play some games!
There has been plenty to talk about this week in the world of Nintendo. Yet more 'Switch 2' rumours trickled in with a fresh batch of supposed codenames, Playtonic announced Yooka-Replaylee (maybe our favourite title of the year, so far) and we finally got a release window for Metal Slug Tactics.

Having done little to convince the court that infringement wouldn't continue, DoodStream's operators and associates are now banned from running the site.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After months of requests from the community, FC Mobile Training Transfer will finally arrive in Ultimate Team as part of the upcoming update.


The new system could be a complete game changer, as it will help players reduce a lot of grind. Anyone who has played the game will know how important it is to train cards, but the process isn't infinite. After a certain point of time, the resources become scarce, which also hinders squad development. The FC Mobile Training Transfer, as planned by EA Sports, will help to reduce many headaches.


FC Mobile Training Transfer Guide


The FC Mobile Training Transfer process will be pretty straightforward, and a new currency will be introduced for the same purpose. You'll be able to earn Training Transfer points, which will be used to shift the XP from one card to another.


Image via EA Sports



Select Training Transfer from the menu.


First, select the card from which the training will be transferred.


Second, select the card which will receive the XP.


Click on the 'Transfer' button to complete the process.



There are still going to be a lot of strategies involved with the transfer process. First, the training transfer will be limited if the target player has a lower rank. In such cases, the extra XP will remain with the original card, and you can transfer it once the rank of the target card is high enough. Additionally, ranks of the cards won't be affected by any transfer of training. 


You should also remember that 10% XP will be lost in each transfer. Training Transfer points, required in every exchange, won't be infinite either. However, there will be plenty of in-game activities from which players can earn these points.


FC Mobile Training Transfer will be available after the update on June 11. This update will also introduce a new Euro 2024 tournament mode in Ultimate Team. You can select any of the qualified nations and write your own history.

Summer Game Fest 2024 is finally up and running following yesterday's Opening Showcase. Geoff Keighley's two-hour show featured a good variety of games, big and small, starting off with a surprise for Switch owners in the form of a flagship Sony series making its debut on a Nintendo platform. Sure, LEGO Horizon Adventures is a fun, tongue-in-cheek spin-off of Guerrilla's series, but we were still a little taken aback to see that Switch logo at the end of the trailer.
Elsewhere, Switch gamers saw announcements and trailers for Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, Neva, Civilization VII, Battle Crush, Monster Hunter Stories, and Sonic X Shadow Generations, plus the 'Outersloth' indie dev initiative from Among Us dev Innersloth will surely yield some fruit on Nintendo's console, too. Not a huge amount of Switch news, then, but we've come to expect as much.

According to the Automaton report and translation, Gainax acknowledged a May 29 Tokyo District Court filing had been accepted.

Those troubles reportedly surfaced when management and executives began operating the company to suit their private goals, which involved various unprofitable ventures and taking out risky loans.

Set to release on PC on July 11, players will finally be able to lace up and start kicking down the doors of anthropomorphic enemies that plague the menacing city.




I've been excited about this one since it was announced back in 2022. It looks like the fast-paced reckless fun you'd expect from a Devolver-published title, where I'll probably die a lot and end up slamming the restart button to get right back into the madness.


Players will navigate various levels using their...Anger Foot...to kick down doors to surprise and eliminate enemies as they move through each level as quickly as possible. While your primary weapon is your foot, you'll also be able to pick up additional weapons and power-ups as you progress.


Anger Foot is set to release on PC on July 11.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Computer Artworks' 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic "trust" and "fear" systems.
Sadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They've just announced that they're making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.

Set in the year 1999, players take on the role of a new producer named Jae tasked with filming the hottest happenings in The Crush House to keep viewers glued to their screens. Failure to keep the audience entertained however will result in the show's cancellation.


Players will have to choose between four of twelve personalities to cast for each season of the show, trying to mix and match personalities and attractions to create the most entertaining segments of reality TV.


I'm still a little confused about how the actual gameplay will work but based on the trailer it looks like a good time. There's just something about 1990's reality TV shows.


Those interested in checking out The Crush House can download the demo currently available on Steam. The Crush House will be released on PC on August 9, 2024.

Based on the trailer, M-Corp has now gone as skaters infiltrate San Vansterdam. The corporation previously had a hold of the city, but their misdeeds have finally caught up to them. Fortunately for the skaters, they can now safely travel around San Vansterdam, showing off a few gnarly tricks. 




Sign-ups for the console playtest are now available via the Skate. page. It'll give you a chance to see what the studio has been working on, even though it's still in its testing period. Users can then provide any feedback on the game to help shape Skate.'s official launch. 


Previous Skate. playtests only centered around PC and mobile versions, including the EA App. Nevertheless, the game will continue to expand with its console iterations. You may also get the chance to participate in other playtests, where Electronic Arts may invite you back for another round. 


Since Skate. is still in development, there isn't a set release date as right now. However, we do know that it will be available to play on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and PC. Additionally, cross-play and cross-progression will be available, allowing you to experience it on any platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's not-E3 weekend video game events have begun, starting with Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest showcase earlier today. Shortly after that, though, perhaps the zaniest publisher, Devolver Digital, took to the digital airwaves to showcase six of its games in the 2024 Summer Devolver Direct presentation. 
If you weren't able to catch it, or if you missed the name of the game you're excited to check out (or even its release date maybe), we've got you covered. 
Here's Everything Announced During Today's 2024 Summer Devolver Direct Presentation

        <updated>2024-06-08T00:33:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heart Machine, the team behind Hyper Light Drifter and Solar Ash, has revealed Possessor(s), a side-scrolling action game coming to consoles and PC next year. Revealed during today's Devolver Digital presentation and teased earlier this week, Possessor(s) features action combat inspired by platform fighters like Super Smash Bros. set in a quarantined city destroyed by interdimensional catastrophe. 
In Possessor(s), you control Luca, the host, and Rehm, her less-than-cooperative counterpart as the two venture through a sprawling metropolis filled with collapsed skyscrapers to explore and secrets to uncover. Devolver says the narrative features multiple paths in an "open-ended world structure" as players attempt to learn the truth behind the catastrophe that has wrecked the city (and seemingly the world). 


"Gameplay is centered around tight, fast-paced platforming with a range of unique movement abilities that extends to its tense, precise combat," a press release for Possessor(s) reads. "Balance ground and air attacks, replete with combos and juggles as you encounter a variety of deadly enemies and challenging bosses."
Throughout Possessor(s), players will discover upgrades that allow Luca and Rehm to explore previously inaccessible areas, nodding toward a potential Metroidvania-style city layout. 
Here are some Possessor(s) screenshots: 

Possessor(s) hits consoles and PC in 2025, presumably after Heart Machine's other in-development game, Hyper Light Breaker, hits PC this year.

Day of the Devs is here once again! This bi-annual celebration, from Double Fine Productions and iam8bit, of the weird and wonderful world of indies is always a delight, and at Summer Game Fest 2024, the showcase didn't disappoint.
We got a look at 20 games, including seven World Premieres. These range from the sweet to the silly to the spectacular. Some highly-anticipated indies — including Mossmouth and The Game Bakers' next games — might have stolen the show, but everything here is worth a look. The big question for us is, "Are these coming to Switch?". That's always difficult for these bigger showcases, but we've got all the answers.

In Cult of the Lamb's next update, Unholy Alliance, you can sacrifice folks with a pal. The upcoming free update will add a co-op goat character so a friend can indoctrinate and stab alongside you. The developers have shown off the two-player update amid the summer news plague that is threatening to tear entire branches off the RPS treehouse this week. "Summoned by blood and born in corruption, this wicked new ally can join the holy Lamb in local co-op," say publishers Devolver. Ah, local co-op. Not online then. I guess this is for real-life people with real-life friends and a proper real-life sofa. Well. Good for them. I'm happy for them. Couldn't be happier. Happy happy happy.

Philosophy-obsessed puzzler The Talos Principle 2 is getting a big three-part DLC expansion, and some of the environments look lush. Not least this humongous cube sticking out from the sands of a tropical island at a jaunty angle. It is called the Hexahedron, and its interior constitutes a “large, continuous puzzle cluster” that the player will navigate. As one of those dweebs who has walked around London saying “aha, brutalism” at every insignificant piece of concrete he sees, this pleases me. Come and see it up close in the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Devolver Digital kicked off Volvy's 15th Birthday Party by showing off developer Massive Monster's next major update for the popular base-building action roguelike Cult of the Lamb. Titled Unholy Alliance, the update is set to release on August 12, 2024 and will add local co-op to Cult of the Lamb.




Players will have the ability to play as the Lamb or the Goat when the free update releases, joining forces to tackle new dungeons, slay heretics, build their cult, and more.


I haven't played Cult of the Lamb as much as I would like to, but co-op seems like a great fit for its gameplay loop. Hopefully eventually it expands to online co-op as well, for those of us that don't have local friends to play with.


Cult of the Lamb: Unholy Alliance is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC on August 12, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tenjutsu is a jujutsu-inspired action roguelite from Sébastien Benard, lead designer of Dead Cells and solo developer at Deepnight Games, and it's coming to consoles and PC sometime in the future. Revealed during today's Devolver Digital presentation, Tenjutsu is a fully fleshed-out version of Tenjutsu (48h version), which Deepnight released back in 2022.
Devolver describes the game as a "fast and fluid rogue-jutsu," leaning into the game's jujutsu roguelite action. In it, you control a renegade yakuza "hellbent on defying her former associates and loosening their grip on the Secret Garden City." To do so, you must fight four powerful crime syndicates. To defeat them "you must master a brutal brawling system and build a diverse arsenal of weapons, upgrades, and martial arts techniques, breaking their hold on the streets in a flurry of violence." 
Check out the Tenjutsu trailer for yourself below: 


While you must take down all four crime syndicates, the order you do so is up to you. As you take more and more down, you gain control of Secret Garden City and can seemingly upgrade its districts and more for rewards. Doing so will unlock new weapons, combat moves, and additional areas for exploration. However, the longer you spend doing this, the stronger your enemies become. 
Here are some Tenjutsu screenshots: 
There is no release date for Tenjutsu just yet, but it's coming to undisclosed consoles and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Massive Monster still isn't done with its 2022 hit game, Cult of the Lamb, as it's bringing full campaign co-op to it this August. Revealed during today's Devolver Digital presentation, the Unholy Alliance update hits Cult of the Lamb on August 12 and adds a new playable character: the Goat. 
With the Goat joining the titular Lamb, players can now experience the entire campaign in local co-op. Devolver says this update includes two-player twists on existing minigames in Cult of the Lamb, like fishing and kuncklebones, as well as additional corrupted weapons, tarot cards, curses, and relics. 
Check out the two-player action in the Cult of the Lamb: Unholy Alliance trailer below: 


While playing in co-op, players can swap weapons, deal extra damage when fighting back-to-back, and deal critical hits if their attacks are in sync. Plus, solo players get some new powers and abilities to play with, too. 
Elsewhere in the update, Unholy Alliance adds new buildings, fleeces, follower traits, follower quests, and more secrets to discover. 
Here are some Cult of the Lamb: Unholy Alliance screenshots: 

Cult of the Lamb's Unholy Alliance update hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC for free on August 12.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the Summer Game Fest 2024, Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero received a confirmed release date. The game will be available to play on Oct. 11, 2024, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. 


In the trailer, we see plenty of iconic Dragon Ball universe characters, from Piccolo to Frieza. Based on the snippets in the latest debut and the official page, the game will follow along with the franchise's classic storyline. This includes one of the most beloved arcs with Dragon Ball Z's Cell Games saga. We also got a look at Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero pre-order bonuses showcasing exclusive Gogeta and Broly forms. However, one playable character still remains a mystery. 




Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero will continue on the fan-favorite Budokai Tenkaichi series. It will carry on the gameplay of past iterations, only this time in the modern gaming age. You can essentially think of Sparking! Zero as the fourth installment of Budokai Tenkaichi. 


The last time we saw a BT entry was back in 2007 with Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3. Given that it's now 2024, a new entry has certainly been a long time coming. It will also be very different from its predecessor with its online play, where players can test their skills against other Dragon Ball fans. 


Mark your calendars for Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero's Oct. 11, 2024 debut. It's currently available for pre-orders and offers Standard, Collector's, and Deluxe Editions.

Put on by several companies in games to spotlight up-and-coming independent developers, Day of the Devs has traditionally been a showcase full of fresh and vibrant ideas in the space. This year's SGF Day of the Devs was no different; in fact, I'd venture to say this is one of the better ones in recent memory.


From competitive match-3 puzzling to horror, mountains, and more, there is a lot here. Here's all you need to know from today's showcase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Among Us train continues with the latest trailer debut of its highly-anticipated animated series. Although the TV show has yet to get an official release date, the snippet provides an exciting "Coming Soon" teaser.   


The trailer begins with Among Us characters making a delicious pizza until a monster decides to disrupt the peace. This creature seems to be on the hunt for them, similar to all the murderous takedowns the game is known for. 




CBS Studios and Innersloth Production are behind the show, featuring a star-studded cast. This includes many notable actors, including Elijah Wood, Patton Oswalt, Ashley Johnson, and Randall Park. I'm a big fan of the entire cast and Among Us, so it'll be exciting to see them blend together in the animated series. 


In addition to the Among Us TV show, we also got a look into Innersloth's indie game fund, Outersloth. The funding will help other indie studios, catering to a lineup of several games. For instance, the Summer Game Fest 2024 mentions entries like Shape Shop's Mars First Logistics and Midnight Munchies' One BTN Bosses. 




SFG also provided an inside look into a new entry with Project Dosa. It's made by Outerloop Games, the studio behind Thirsty Suitors. While it would've been great to hear about a possible Among Us sequel, the animated series will at least fill that void. 


We'll still need to wait on a release date for the Among Us TV show, but hopefully, it will come out sooner rather than later.

Simpsons jokes from three decades making up most of my sense of humour, I of course thought it was brilliant. And yet, I couldn’t shake a singular, burning question: What if this, but not joke? Enter Tides Of Tomorrow. Ok, so I actually don't know if it has anything in common with Waterworld aside from having lots of water everywhere. Still, I'll never pass up an opportunity for a crispy Simpsons reference.

Furniture & Mattress' delightful puzzle game, Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure, has a release date. During today's Day of the Devs stream, the hand-drawn, story-driven adventure will be coming to Switch (and other platforms) on 25th July 2024.
Originally announced during a Nintendo Direct back in February 2024, Arranger is the debut game from Furniture & Mattress, which combines the indie might of David Hellman (the artist of Braid), Nick Suttner (writer of Carto), and Nicolás Recabarren (designer of Ethereal). With music from Ethereal composer Tomás Batista, it's an all-star development team aiming to bring some hand-drawn magic to the world.

If you're a toy car fan who didn't get your fill from the two (rather good) Hot Wheels games currently on Switch, we've got good news: Matchbox Driving Adventures is pulling up on Switch on 20th September.
However, the premise of this one is a little different, as it's not just a straight racer. This spin on Mattel's die-cast vehicle line has a Competition Mode, which delivers your standard races (with local split-screen multiplayer for up to four people), but also Adventure Mode, which lets you explore six environments in a more sandbox, playroom-style.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Summer Game Fest 2024 revealed a horrific gameplay trailer for Slitterhead, featuring several battles that are to die for. In addition to the gameplay, we also got a confirmed release date of Nov. 8, 2024. 


Slitterhead's gameplay trailer features a plethora of grotesque monsters, from a mantis-looking fiend to a slimy worm. The trailer then moves on to its playable characters, who take the enemies down one by one. In particular, a character can be seen initiating a claw-like attack that brutally slices up the creatures. 




Other playable characters are shown in the trailer, but this time with a new slot of weapons. Slitterhead seems to feature a variety of fighters to choose from, each with their own robust power. One character is shown to have a powerful shotgun, while another wields a powerful light machine gun. You can even teleport to other locations to make a quick getaway from the monsters. 


Slitterhead was first introduced during the Game Awards 2021 with a short teaser. Bokeh Game Studio is behind the project, which was established by Silent Hill's creator, Keiichiro Toyama. So, if you're a Silent Hill fan, you should definitely give this one a try for a brand-new horror experience. 


Be sure to tune into Slitterhead's release on Nov. 8, 2024. It will be available on various platforms, including Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Steam, and the Epic Games Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before we get to the latest trailer for S-Game's soulslike Phantom Blade Zero I have a couple of complaints to lodge about the title. Firstly, this game clearly contains a non-zero quantity of blades, from whacking great axes to katanas. Secondly, I do not accept the premise that these are phantom blades. They are very obviously non-spectral, going by the amount of stabbing and clanging on show in the video. With these potentially ruinous caveats out of the way, I am now free to tell you more about a game that looks like it's out to eat Sekiro's lunch.

This mission isn't too much of a challenge for the most part. However, its second half is definitely more tricky than its first.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Game Fest 2024 came to an end with the first gameplay reveal of Phantom Blade Zero. This is the first we've seen from Phantom Blade Zero since it was revealed at the PlayStation Showcase last year. The action RPG focuses on deep fast-paced combat in a fictious world that meshes Chinese martial arts and Steampunk together.




With how ambitious Phantom Blade Zero looked in 2023 followed by a year of nothing new, I was starting to get a little worried. However, this gameplay trailer alleviated all my concerns. It looks as though Phantom Blade Zero is pulling in elements of a ton of successful titles including Elden Ring, Sekiro, and Ghost of Tsushima. 


I know that any trailer can be intentionally designed to look a certain way, but the fluidity of the combat in this gameplay trailer looks absolutely insane. The player quickly weaves in attacks while jumping over attacks and parrying or dodging others. I can't wait to hear more about how some of the more RPG-centric elements work.


Developer S-Game confirmed that there will be hands-on experiences to play Phantom Blade Zero throughout the year, including at Summer Game Fest 2024, Tokyo Game Show, and Gamescom.


Phantom Blade Zero does not yet have a release timeframe but will be released on both PlayStation 5 and PC.

Battle Aces is the debut title for Uncapped Games, a team comprised of developers with RTS-specific experience. In Battle Aces, players will create a preset loadout of units and bases of over 50 units before dropping into quick fast-paced battles.


Due to its quicker games, Battle Aces streamlines the systems behind typical RTS features like resource gathering, unit spawning, and base expansion. Featuring both 1v1 and 2v2 matches, both options aim to have the match over in ten minutes or less due to more streamlined systems such as being able to switch between creating and controlling armies by pushing a single key.


Battle Aces does not yet have a release window but will be holding a closed beta test later this year on PC.

Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions will be available on Day 1 on PlayStation Plus. Additionally, the trailer revealed a Bonus Legacy Pack for Hogwarts Legacy players, offering the exclusive Moontrimmer Broom skin. It also comes with a Sebastian Sallow skin and wand, as well as an Ancient Magic Emblem. I'm not too surprised to see Sebastian get his own cosmetic in this game, given how much attention he got from HL. 


As a longtime HP fan, I'm certainly looking forward to this one. It takes me back to Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup, which launched in the good 'ole PS2 days. Now, it will undoubtedly be different in the modern age of gaming, so make sure to mark your calendars for September!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grid-based puzzler Grindstone was a favourite of Katharine’s, who found it to be her go-to during regularly scheduled moments of “cat-based paralysis”. I didn’t spent quite so many hours of feline enforced stasis with it, but I too was drawn in for a respectable time chunk. It’s those detail-stuffed visuals and caffeinated animations that tipped it for me, and it’s the same art that have me excited for Capybara’s follow-up. Battle Vision Network is an online puzzle battler that pits you head to head against real-life humans (boo those guys). The conceit here is its a televised space sport, in which you’ll steer the fate of its ongoing story arcs by winning or losing as your chosen team.

Now, the game is getting its first expansion in the form of the Sakurajima Update. This update will finally add a new location for players to explore, as well as a host of other highly-anticipated new features. 


The Sakurajima Update will hit Palworld on June 27, 2024. In addition to the new island, presumably called Sakurajima, the update brings new Pals into the fray, a new raid, a higher level cap and new structures for Pals, and even an oil rig Stronghold for players to test their combat skills in. It takes everything that was already great in the game and improves upon it, giving us just a little bit more of what we need to see us through the next 100 hours of playtime.

According to Riot, the console versions of Valorant features custom-built gameplay in order to uphold the competitive gameplay it is known for. A beta will be available to global players on both platforms soon, with a more limited beta kicking off for certain regions on June 14, 2024.




World's most popular shooter is about to get bigger


Despite already being the most-played FPS in the world, Valorant is about to get a lot bigger by coming to consoles. Even though the PC player base is massive, there are still a ton of potential players who simply don't like playing with mouse and keyboard or don't have a PC to play on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer S-Game has released a new trailer for its upcoming action game, Phantom Blade Zero, which features plenty of gorgeous (and gory) fast-paced action. Though we still haven't received a release date, the game is looking great, and it will be playable at Summer Game Fest's Play Days this weekend, so we could soon hear how it feels to actually play. 
It will also be playable at a few other locations this year, including Gamescom in August and Tokyo Game Show this September. 
Check out the latest look at Phantom Blade Zero gameplay in the trailer below: 


Revealed as a new entry in the Phantom Blade series during a PlayStation Showcase last year, Phantom Blade Zero is inspired by Chinese martial arts and steampunk. In it, you control the Dark Raider, who is out for revenge against a group called "The Order."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of Summer Game Fest’s most intriguing reveals is Killer Bean. This upcoming action roguelite puts you in the boots of a bean who seemingly embodies every awesome trait of every action/spy hero you've ever seen.


The game's Steam page provides the following synopsis: "After being betrayed by the Shadow Agency and learning the truth about their evil ways, Killer Bean has made it his life goal to destroy them. Yet this is easier said than done, as Killer Bean will face armies of enemies, and mysterious Shadow Beans who are better trained and more powerful than him."
The humourous gameplay trailer shows the game's ever-changing open world, which morphs each time you begin a new single-player campaign. As rogue assassin Killer Bean, you can blast apart enemies (in both 1st and 3rd person), which range from soldiers to giant, Metal Gear-esque walking mechs, suplex them with wrestling moves, blow them up with rockets or just plow them with your sports car. The world is your oyster, and the game seems to be a physics showcase, with copious amounts of ragdolling characters and objects. 
Killer Bean is slated to launch into Steam Early Access this summer.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The once-unlikely sequel to Alan Wake has even more surprises on the way, as Remedy just announced Alan Wake 2 DLC, Night Springs, launches tomorrow on June 8. That's also when pre-orders for a physical run of Alan Wake 2 open up, too. 


In Alan Wake 2's additional saga, three characters will contend with the Dark Place again in self-contained episodes. According to its PlayStation Blog description, those tales play out with familiar,  but new, faces in a TV show the tortured artist once wrote for, Night Springs.




Notable Remedy/Alan Wake characters include likenesses to Jesse Faden, Rose Marigold, and Shawn Ashmore / Sheriff TImothy Breaker.


The Alan Wake 2 Expansion Pass  —  included in the digital deluxe edition — covers the Night Springs DLC. However, if you're looking to pick it up separately, Night Springs runs $20. If you're ordering the new physical deluxe or collector's editions of Alan Wake 2, those also include the expansion content.


Tomorrow's big updates also include a free Photo Mode, taking inspiration from Alan's wife, a professional photographer, and adding settings like f-stop, focal length, and other effects you'd find in similar, dedicated modes. But this is Remedy, so of course, I've got loftier expectations for how I want my Alan Wake 2 photography to shape up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher EA and developer Full Circle have released a new trailer for their long-in-development Skate, the fourth mainline entry in the Skate series and the first in more than a decade. Revealed during today's Summer Game Fest 2024 showcase, EA announced with the trailer that "console playtesting" for the game will begin this fall; there's still no release date for the game, though. 
In the trailer, which begins with a live-action segment starring comedian Tim Robinson (who actually shreds in real life, by the way), we see him as an employee of the fictional M-Corp before transitioning to a look at pre-pre-alpha gameplay of Skate. The gameplay admittedly looks early, but players can check it out on console this fall when "console playtesting" begins. 
Check it out in the Skate. trailer for yourself below: 


EA announced in 2020 that it was working on a new Skate game, and we later learned it will be called "Skate." instead of Skate 4 like many presumed. We also learned in 2022 that it will be a free-to-play title as well. 
For more, read this behind-the-scenes look at Ful Circle, the newcomer studio making Skate, and then check out this early look at Skate's fluid movements and awesome bails after that.

This means the studio wants to retain the kind of experience where the game has a strong tactical foundation that caters to the competitive crowd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warframe-like “Next-gen looter shooter” The First Descendant releases this Summer, July 2nd 2024. The ‘next-gen’ part probably refers to Unreal Engine 5, and fair’s fair, it’s a real looker this one. The below trailer is mainly scripted or edited bits, but having played a chunk of the last technical test, there’s some genuinely impressive sci-fi vistas to behold, as well as some absolutely massive bosses. Click on the trailer below, until the purple hat or whatever it is you kids grind for these days, pops out with a synapse-tickling noise workshopped by psychologists for eighteen months.

Regardless, I’ve been won over by the upcoming video game of the same name from original creator Jeff Lew, which looks to blend together Just Cause stunt shenanigans, John Woo slo-mo gunfights and the energy of a third-person action game you would’ve found in a bargain bin for the PlayStation 2 in 2002. It’ll hit early access this summer, courtesy of a fresh look from tonight’s Summer Game Fest showcase.

Ivy Road, an outstanding development team full of talent, lead by the creator of The Stanley Parable Davey Wreden, is making a 




In Wanderstop players will take on the persona of Alta, a fallen fighter, tasked with managing a tea shop in a magical forest. Players will tend to customers passing through the forest, making their tea and cleaning up and decorating the shop. But there's a catch: Alta doesn't want to be at the tea shop.


If you've played The Stanley Parable, you'll know that Alta's wandering mind and thoughts have her questioning why the world's greatest championship warrior is toiling away at a Tea Shop in the middle of the forest.  In the trailer, Alta sits on a bench, trying to convince herself she's happy running the Tea Shop before having a bit of a panic attack.


Quickly what looked like a happy cozy Tea Shop management title changed into something more. I'm not sure what exactly players will have to contend with as playing Alta, but I'm very ready to find out.


Wanderstop is coming soon to PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam.

More specifically, a new gameplay trailer Sega released during today's Summer Game Fest 2024 showcase confirms it's launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 25, for $49.99. 
In the new trailer, we get a look at some of the Generations gameplay as well as some of the new Shadow the Hedgehog gameplay, which is brand new as part of this release. Not only can you play as Shadow, but Sega has created new levels to play through as the hedgehog. 
Check it out for yourself in the Sonic x Shadow Generations release date trailer below: 


Sega revealed Sonic x Shadow Generations during a January PlayStation State of Play earlier this year, revealing it's a remaster of Generations with 60 frames-per-second performance, a playable Shadow the Hedgehog (with new levels, too) alongside Sonic, and more. It looks great, and we can't wait to replay one of the Blue Blur's best games. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too long because Sonic x Shadow Generations hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on October 25. 
For more, read Game Informer's Sonic Generations review, and then read Game Informer's reviews of Sonic Superstars and Sonic Frontiers. After that, check out this story about how Keanu Reeves is reportedly voicing Shadow in the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 movie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Game Bakers, the developers behind 2020's Haven, have revealed Cairn, a climbing game all about exploring (and surviving on) a mountain. Revealed during today's Summer Game Fest 2024 showcase, Cairn appears to be about a woman attempting to climb a very high (and difficult) mountain, only to die several times in the process. 
However, if the reveal trailer is any indication, dying isn't the end of her climb – just a part of the process. Though not confirmed, this premise seems to point toward Cairn being a roguelite, or at least a game where dying is part of the process. Rockclimbing treachery aside, the game looks beautiful. 
Check it out for yourself in the Cairn reveal trailer below: 


"Reach a summit never climbed before in this survival-climber game," the game's description reads. "Climb anywhere and plan your route carefully, managing pitons and resources to survive the unforgiving Mount Kami. Discover what Aava is willing to sacrifice to achieve the ascent of a lifetime."
Cairn is due out on consoles and PC sometime next year.

Blumhouse Games was established last year and announced plans to bring horror titles to major platforms without having much to show off. During Summer Game Fest 2024, we got a look at everything it's planning to publish, and every title looks unique. The most interesting thing about them all is that they don't look like Dead Space or The Callisto Protocol. They're not AAA titles. They're all indie games with a distinct look and feel that makes them stand out.

Made by first-time developer Jason Houdei and his team, the game introduces us to its beautiful world, which is already preparing us for a story filled with hope and heartbreak.




Throughout the trailer, we see the protagonist and his young deer companion embark on a journey through the world as they navigate various obstacles, discover the beauty of nature, and lay their eyes on some rather horrifying supernatural creatures.


Not much else was revealed in the Summer Game Fest's announcement, but one thing is certain: We're in for quite the ride, and I could not be more intrigued by what lies in store.


Dear & Boy is available to wishlist now on PC via Steam. No release date is currently known.

Coming in late 2024, Rita's Rewind is an all-new adventure with an original Power Rangers storyline that mixes franchise lore with retro gameplay.




In Rita's Rewind, players face off against a robotic reincarnation of the Power Rangers' long time nemesis. Robo-Rita conjures a portal to send herself back in time to stop the Power Rangers by forming an alliance with her younger self. Together, Robo-Rita and Rita Repulsa will rewind, rewrite, and remix the past in attempt to stop the Power Rangers once and for all.


It looks like classic arcadey Power Rangers beat-em-up and I'm all for it.


Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam in Late 2024.

It has you run an up-and-coming movie studio, submerges you into a pool of complicated and morally bereft staff, and allows you to deal with problems using underhanded methods. Just like real life (maybe).


The only thing that keeps me from claiming Hollywood Animal as my most anticipated game is that it seems like it might be attempting too much. There are so many variables at play and so much customization that it feels it would be complicated to ensure everything works together without a litany of bugs, cuts, and feature creep.


If the rather hefty demo shows anything; Weappy Wholesome has managed to do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Game Fest 2024 gave us the first look at the new Power Rangers game, and it’s looking like a blast from the past.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind comes to us via studio Digital Eclipse, and the project appears to be a sidescrolling brawler beat-‘em-up at its heart, with multiple players working together to beat up baddies as they move right across the screen, echoing other favorites of the genre like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or X-Men. But the game also appears to feature other vehicle sequences, including what looks like first-person Zord punching sequences.
The game features online and offline co-op for up to five players.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/sgf-2024/2024/06/07/silent-hill-creators-slitterhead-gets-first-gameplay-look-in-new-trailer-out"/>
        <updated>2024-06-07T21:58:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama founded Bokeh Game Studio back in 2020 to work on a new horror game that we later learned is called Slitterhead. After a teaser trailer and a behind-the-scenes look at the game's development, we finally have our first look at gameplay. Plus, the studio announced Slitterhead launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on November 8.
Revealed in a new trailer during the 2024 Summer Game Fest showcase, Slitterhead's debut gameplay trailer starts in a Chinese city, with a police detective searching through a trashed ally. He finds what appears to be a mangled body in a trash can before the trailer shows more of the neon-lit Chinese metropolis, with shots of (presumably) our playable protagonist jumping from high above to the ground below while using some spectral power that allows them to possess bodies of pedestrians. We also get a look at Slitterhead's monstrous creatures and third-person survival action gameplay, which features both guns and melee combat. 
Check it out for yourself in the Slitterhead gameplay trailer below: 


As you can see, Slitterhead is looking quite action-packed, especially compared to Toyama's Silent Hill efforts. However, the lineage is clear. 
Slitterhead has largely remained a mystery since its reveal. We know in 2021, Toyama said he was working on a choice-driven game, and we assume that's Slitterhead. Toyama also told IGN Japan his next project (presumably Slitterhead) would be released in 2023. Obviously, that didn't happen, but now we know it's releasing this November. Outside of that, a behind-the-scenes video diary showed a few clips of Slitterhead, including training room-esque encounters, a neon-lit Chinese city, and even a dog that appears to be playable. 
Slitterhead hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on November 8. 
What do you think about this first look at Slitterhead's gameplay? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two of Fatal Fury's finest are joining the roster for Year 2 of Street Fighter 6. Terry and Mai are heading to SF6, alongside series mainstays Elena and M. Bison, as DLC fighters.


It's a pretty surprising move to see two SNK mainstays cross over into a mainline Street Fighter, especially this early in its DLC rollout. There are surely a few fighters left from Capcom's history to pull in. But in another way, this is the closest we can get to a new Capcom vs. SNK, so I'll take it.




Here's the rough schedule for Year 2 of Street Fighter 6's character rollout:



M. Bison - Summer 2024 


Terry - Autumn 2024 


Mai - Winter 2025 


Elena - Spring 2025



They'll likely be available as either individual purchases, or one big bundle. Either way, you'll be able to check in on your friends and ask them, "Are you okay?" in Street Fighter 6 sometime this year.

Tears of Metal features co-op gameplay where you'll play as Scottish warriors taking back their land after a dragon meteor invasion struck. You'll prepare your forces and rally your warriors alongside four other players while following the war's story. Think of it as Scottish Dynasty Warriors with cartoonish charm.


In classic hack 'n' slash fashion, you'll also find yourself using swords, axes, and other weapons at your disposal to take out your foes, with more available to purchase as you progress through the game. The trailer introduces mechanics for strengthening your troops, optimizing your army, and obtaining various abilities to launch special attacks. Above all else, you'll charge right in, slicing away at your enemies, and take back the land that's rightfully yours. 


Tears of Metal will be available on PC via Steam. No official release date is currently known, but it is live on the Steam storefront, where you can add it to your wishlist and keep up to date on its latest news.

The teaser implied Batman would be tussling with the Rat King (not to be confused with Ratcatcher, we think) in VR, and it would be canon to the Arkham universe that Rocksteady created, but little else was revealed beyond that. Today, we received another pre-rendered trailer, so while we're still not sure how the game will look and play, we at least have a better idea of the game's tone and characters. The dramatic cover of a popular song chosen for this cinematic trailer? "Bullet With Butterfly Wings" by the Smashing Pumpkins A.K.A. the rat in a cage song.


The trailer shows Gordon, The Rat King, seemingly in a prison cell, and what appears to be a still-sane version of Harley Quinn. Here is the story outline from the trailer's press release.
It’s the Fourth of July, and Gotham City is besieged by a new threat: the mysterious Rat King and his cultish devotees. Public officials have been abducted, including Batman associates Commissioner Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. The Rats have pledged to execute them in one week’s time for “crimes committed against the people of Gotham City.”
As widespread rioting engulfs the city, Batman races to prevent this so-called “Day of Wrath,” but it all goes wrong.
Set between the events of Batman: Arkham Origins and Batman: Arkham Asylum, you’ll experience the origins of such iconic characters as The Scarecrow, Harley Quinn, and more, as Batman grapples with the contradiction at the core of his identity—the use of force in pursuit of

The press release for the new trailer promises the game will have a "blend of exploration, stealth, and free-flowing combat the series is known for." The game is coming exclusively to Meta Quest 3 next year.]]></summary>

Gris was notable for its beautiful art direction, and Neva is no slouch in that department. It looks beautiful, as do the animations of the woman, Alba, and Neva, her canine companion. In addition to platforming, Alba can gracefully cut down foes with her sword as Neva backs her in combat. It's also worth noting that Neva appears to age over time, growing much larger than Alba indicating the game unfolds over a substantial passage of time.

After a few fairly major announcements during Summer Game Fest 2024, host Geroff Keighley highlighted Cuff Bust, a multiplayer game from a solo indie developer that looks like it can offer all sorts of silliness for up to 20 players online. Players take on the role of Jailiens, creatures locked up in a facility somewhere on Earth, and must work together to escape their prison. The trouble is, they're not the most coordinated bunch on the planet.

Sony's Horizon series is coming to Switch in Lego form. As rumoured before today's Summer Game Fest's opening showcase, LEGO Horizon Adventures does indeed exist, but the big surprise is that it's coming on day one to Nintendo's Switch.
Scheduled to launch Holiday season 2024, this game is co-developed by Guerrilla, the studio behind the Horizon series, and Studio Gobo. Described as "a playful and light-hearted story inspired by the events of the world of Horizon," you'll control a Danish plastic version of series protagonist Aloy in a game "designed for two-player action without the need for split-screen."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2K Games has revealed Sid Meier's Civilization 7, the next iteration of its long-running 4X turn-based strategy game. Revealed during today's Summer Game Fest 2024 showcase, Civilization 7 is coming to consoles and PC sometime in 2025. 
This reveal follows Geoff Keighley's teasing back in May that 2K will reveal the next iteration of one of its "biggest and most beloved franchises" at SGF. Many assumed it might be the next BioShock or Mafia game, but it turns out it was Civilization 7, the first entry in the series since 2016's Civilization 6 by Marvel's Midnight Suns developer Firaxis Games. In the reveal trailer, we get a look at various eras of history in a stylized cinematic trailer, but there's no gameplay to be seen. 
Check it out for yourself in the Civilization 7 reveal trailer below: 


Civilization 7 will launch simultaneously on consoles and PC in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Torn Banner Studios, the team behind Chivalry 2, announced the launch of No More Room in Hell 2 during The Game Awards' Summer Game Fest 2024, a sequel to its 2011 Source mod. Originating from a Half-Life 2 mod, the original No More Room in Hell became its own game in 2011, with the sequel arriving this Halloween.




No More Room in Hell 2 is an eight-player co-op horror game featuring permadeath mechanics, where you'll enter its world and search for your friends while surviving in its brutal environment. As you search for resources and your friends, you'll constantly fight hordes of zombies on your heels to end your run. Once they take you out, your character's death is permanent, at least until the round's end. 


As highlighted during the Summer Game Fest, No More Room in Hell 2 will launch on PC in Early Access on Halloween 2024 via Steam and the Epic Games storefront. It's unknown how long it'll stay in Early Access; we'll likely find more information about this after its initial release later this year.

Like Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West, Aloy returns in Lego Horizon Adventures as the protagonist of the exploration-based adventure game. It's releasing simultaneously on PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC this holiday. 
Revealed during today's Summer Game Fest 2024 showcase, Lego Horizon Adventures seems to take the fun, action, and robot dinosaurs of the Horizon series and turn it all into bricks (literally). However, instead of world-ending threats, Lego Horizon Adventures has a much more comedic and tongue-in-cheek vibe to Aloy's journey, with an emphasis on two-player co-op action. It's being developed by Guerrilla and Studio Gobo.

Indeed, documents suggest that injunctions are up for negotiation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

Inasmuch as can be told in the absence of dialogue or a text preamble, the naked man wants to murder you because you, and not he, are in possession of a hat. The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It's the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman's too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you're trying to fend him off with.


There are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of the Half Sword demo - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kill Knight has a simple, bloody premise. As an undead knight, you must slaughter waves of monsters using guns and a sword in pursuit of the last angel. This wave-based arcade-style shooter has a potent "one more run" hook as you try to ascend five levels while climbing the leaderboards, and we're intrigued to see more of it. Watch Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hillard battle hordes of beasts in this upcoming shooter.

Have you ever wondered how much it would actually cost publishers to showcase a trailer at Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest Opening Showcase? Well, probably not. But you're here now, which means you're likely just a little bit curious, right?
Thanks to Esquire (via Eurogamer), the costs for game trailers have been revealed, and it ain't cheap, folks. Basically, publishers looking to showcase a one-minute trailer will need to fork up $250,000. Add 30 seconds and you're looking at $350,000. Two minutes is $450,000, and two-and-a-half minutes is $550,000.

        <updated>2024-06-07T14:02:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given Mega Man’s enormous presence on classic Nintendo consoles, it’s surprising that the only game available on the Nintendo Switch Online libraries has been Mega Man: The Wily Wars…for Sega Genesis. That has been remedied somewhat thanks to the addition of five Game Boy titles starring the Blue Bomber.
Right now, Switch Online subscribers can enjoy the following Game Boy titles:
Mega Man: Dr. Wily’s Revenge
Mega Man II
Mega Man III
Mega Man IV
Mega Man V


For those unaware, the Game Boy series of Mega Man aren’t just ports of their NES counterparts. Rather, they’re a separate series of original games and are differentiated by the titles’ use of Roman numerals instead of numbers. You can more or less think of them as Mega Man’s versions of the Super Mario Land series, and while they feature their own plots, levels, and bosses, they incorporate some mechanics and enemies from the NES entries. While these aren’t the original NES games fans likely would have hoped for, it’s cool to have the lesser-known Game Boy titles accessible on modern hardware.

There’s at least one level in it that feels like essay-bait, so I’m obliging. The centerpiece of Mars Core - the FPS’  best level - is a comically massive superweapon called the BFG-10000. Oh, Chekov. If only you could see what we’ve done with your wisdom. The literary subtlety to gun-big-enough-to-scar-planets pipeline will eventually subsume all of pop culture, and those of us who chose to specialise writing about headshots will alternate between grins and tears from the wreckage.

And Nintendo will make a few of them. What do you say we make an educated guess about which games Nintendo makes, and when each one will launch?

Ahead of Antonblast's launch later this year on 12th November 2024, developer Summitsphere has released the game's opening cutscene, and it's pretty great.
It showcases Satan (naturally) who, after conversing with a magical mirror, discovers that there is a 'red guy' who happens to 'shine more crimson' than he. This, of course, is our protagonist, Dynamite Anton, so poor ol' Satan decides to take what Anton loves the most, coax him into his lair, and 'siphon his delightfully rosy tone'.

So, when a game like horror tower defence Bella Wants Blood comes along and uses some odd nouns, I get all excited. Here, that’s because I get to recklessly spaff out terms like ‘Blood Gutters’, ‘The Rattler’, and your friend and mine, ‘The Stabber’.

Last year, we caught our first glimpse of Sky Oceans: Wings for Hire, an upcoming JRPG from PQube and Octeto Studios which wears its Skies of Arcadia inspiration proudly on its sleeve. Well, it popped up again at yesterday's Guerilla Collective. This time with a brand-new gameplay trailer.
The fresh footage gives a pretty good idea of what this one will have in store for us when it lands on Switch later this year (a more precise date still hasn't been revealed). We get to see the turn-based sky battles in action, catch a glimpse of the crew recruitment process and check out some of the ship customisation options.

        <updated>2024-06-06T17:19:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Sobaka Studio has revealed Kiborg: Arena, a roguelike that looks like a cyberpunk Sifu. Revealed during today's Guerrilla Collective showcase, Arena is a prequel to Kiborg and it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam) sometime this summer. 
In the full game – Kiborg – players must fend of waves of foes as Morgan Lee, the leader of a ragtag group of resistance fighters on the prison planet of Sigma. "Strike with punishing hand-to-hand combat skills, blast mechanized soldiers with firearms, and deploy cybernetic-enhanced abilities to devastate bloodthirsty baddies. Learn to dodge, block, and parry adversaries to set them up for the killing blow." It sounds and, given how it appears in the trailer below, looks a lot like Sifu, which is a great combat-centric brawler from 2022. 
Check out the Kiborg action in the trailer below:


In Arena, players find "Morgan Lee, who sends the clones that fight on his behalf out on missions, fighting in Sigma's Colisseum. Here, Morgan's clones will square off in bloody battles against other denizens of the prison planet for the cash to help keep his resistance going." Arena also features an Endless Mode, which Sobaka says spawns an infinite amount of increasingly difficult enemies to overcome.
In the full game, players will gather resources to unlock permanent upgrades, form alliances, and research forbidden technologies to gain the upper hand. 
Here are some Kiborg screenshots: 

Arena launches this summer on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. The full Kiborg game does not yet have a release date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Playtonic has revealed Yooka-Replaylee, a remaster of its 2017 platformer Yooka-Laylee. It revealed this during today's Guerrilla Collective 2024 Showcase with a new trailer that highlighted the game's new visuals, improved camera and gameplay controls, remixed challenges, and more. 
"Embark on an epic open-world 3D platforming collectathon adventure with Yooka and Laylee," the game's description reads. "The search for Pagies starts anew in Yooka-Replaylee, the enhanced definitive version of the beloved indie darling with all new challenges, secrets, mechanics, and accessibility options." 
Check it out for yourself in the Yooka-Replaylee reveal trailer below: 


Yooka-Laylee launched in 2017 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, Wii U, and PC, and we had a great time with it – you can read why in Game Informer's Yooka-Laylee review. Though the game is a 3D collect-a-thon, it got a sequel in 2019 called Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair that played more like Donkey Kong Country. 
Yooka-Replaylee is coming to PC and unspecified consoles. It has no release window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We got our first look at Firewalk Studios' upcoming 5v5 first-person shooter Concord last week during a PlayStation State of Play, which is where we also learned it will launch simultaneously on PlayStation 5 and PC on August 23 after a beta this July. Now, thanks to a new PlayStation Blog post detailing the game's preorder contents, we know it will cost $39.99. 
That same blog post says Concord will launch with 16 playable characters known as Freerunners, 12 unique maps set on various in-universe worlds, and six distinct team-based modes. And that content will "expand shortly after launch with regular, post-launch updates" for all players at no additional cost. 
Here's a look at the Concord box art: 
Alongside the standard $39.99 edition of the game, PlayStation and Firewalk are releasing a Digital Deluxe Edition for $59.99 that includes additional cosmetics to customize your Freegunners and 72-hours early access to the game's August launch. Preordering the game, regardless of edition, also gets you (and up to four friends) beta access and the Monarch cosmetics pack. 
Here's a look at the Concord Digital Deluxe Edition: 
"Seeing Vale and other Freegunners in action in gameplay footage is one thing, but there's no substitute for experiencing the game for yourself," the blog post reads. "That's why we're hosting a pre-launch beta, simultaneously on PS5 and PC with cross-play support. Those that pre-order will have an opportunity to be among the first to play Concord." 
That beta is set to happen this July before Concord launches on PS5 and PC on August 23.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Angry Birds Movie 3 is officially in production. The threequel to the hit animated films is being produced by Rovio Entertainment, creators of the Angry Birds franchise, in collaboration with Sega and Prime Focus Studios.
Red and Chuck are back, with Jason Sudeikis and Josh Gad reprising their roles, respectively. It will be directed by John Rice (The Angry Birds Movie 2, Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe) with a screenplay written by Thurop Van Orman (The Angry Birds Movie 2, Adventure Time, The Misadventures of Flapjack). DNEG Animation will bring the film to life, as opposed to being handled by Rovio and Sony as with the last two films. Prime Focus Studios, which co-produced The Garfield Movie, is set to produce. 
A press release provides no details on the plot nor a release window. If you’re wondering why Sega is now involved, the company purchased Rovio last year. Given that the two previous films were box office successes and have grossed a combined $500 million worldwide, it’s a little surprising we haven’t gotten a third film already. 
While we wait for more information on the film, you can read our review of The Angry Birds Movie 2 here. You can also read the latest news on other upcoming video game films, such as Sonic the Hedgehog 3, Nintendo's live-action The Legend of Zelda movie, Mortal Kombat 2, Minecraft, and Borderlands.]]></summary>

If I’m having a good week, give me Fear and Hunger and horrible films like Speak No Evil. If, like this week for some reason, I feel like bursting into tears at inopportune moments, I need silly little guys doing whimsical activities. Enter Dungeon Clawler. It’s a vaguely Slay The Spire-ish roguelite where you grab weapons from a claw machine while you fight. It's got lazy Steam Deck depression nap written all over it. The main theme reminds me of Zombies Ate My Neighbors, and the character I picked is named Sir Bunalot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, the live-service multiplayer game from famed Batman: Arkham series developer Rocksteady Studios, hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC back in February to middling reviews and disappointment from players. Now, a new report from Bloomberg details the game's behind-the-scenes troubles, including a culture of "toxic positivity," shifting visions, and more, ultimately resulting in the game being a $200 million loss for parent company Warner Bros. Discovery. 
Bloomberg reports that following the release of DC's Suicide Squad in 2016, which made $750 million at the box office on a budget of $175 million, Warner Bros. wanted to build on that IP's success. Warner Bros. Montreal, which developed 2022's Gotham Knights, was working on a Suicide Squad game …]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-06-06T12:34:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year's Octopath Traveler II is now available on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One, Square Enix has announced. Plus, Square Enix has released the first Octopath Traveler on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, meaning both mainline Octopath Traveler games are now playable on all console platforms. 
If you're on Xbox, Octopath Traveler II is also available on Xbox and PC Game Pass alongside the first game. If you've been waiting to jump into this series – whether on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, or PC – now is the best time. And both games are great; read why in Game Informer's Octopath Traveler review and Game Informer's Octopath Traveler II review. 


To celebrate the series being available on all current platforms and PC (via Steam and Windows), developer Team Asano has released a free update to Octopath Traveler II that includes an "Extra Battle" mode that becomes available after defeating the game's final boss. In this mode, players can test their skills against newly added extra-tough opponents – including the main characters from the first game. This mode has been available on Xbox consoles since launch but is now available on PlayStation, Switch, and PC. 
"Since its launch in 2018 with Octopath Traveler, the Octopath Traveler series has sold over four million copies worldwide, popularizing the unique HD-2D art style: a striking blend of 2D character designs in beautiful 3D worlds," a press release reads. "Both games are a standalone experience set in different worlds with eight distinct protagonists, each with their own stories to explore and Path Actions to use. Players will embark on a grand adventure and steer their own journey, depending on whom they choose to play as."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taipei’s annual Computex event is always a big, circled, triple-underlined mark in the PC gaming hardware calendar. Whereas CES splits its focus across tech, cars, and the occasional overdesigned white good, Computex is all computing, all the time, making it a prime source of reveals and showcases for the hardware bits that make games happen.
Sadly, Computex 2024 is unlikely to go down as a classic, largely because this year’s show has been mesmerised by AI and the most tedious applications thereof: search, but different somehow! Run art-stealing generation tools faster! Oh, Computex, what have they done to you, and why do you have seven fingers on one hand?
Granted, AI is a broad field, and not everything about it is necessarily gross or creatively bankrupting. But it also doesn’t deserve to overshadow all the other useful, unexpected, and curiosity-piquing gaming tech that Computex has to offer, from new Steam Deck alternatives to resurrected CPU lineups and promising graphics card updates. Here are those highlights of the show so far...

But for those who never owned a Windows PC in the 90s, Fucksweeper is a free, titillating, revolting, beautiful, apocalyptic new version of classic avoid-the-bombs grid puzzler Minesweeper that incorporates elements of dating sims and a vast quantity of generative AI filth.

First up, I need to name my studio (I settle on Horace's Revenge) as well as my crack new team of business bastards. There’s my chief legal officer, Jebediah End. My CCO, Anne Egg, and CFO, Rummy McLastdrink. He doesn’t have a sauce problem, because obviously I wouldn’t put him in charge of money if he did. In the wreckage of the studio, we find an unedited film reel hidden in the waffles n’ cocaine cupboard. It’s a noir thriller named ‘Messenger Of Death’. Whatever influential critic is currently directing this era’s discourse has chosen to categorise each film as genre percentages (‘60% detective/40% thriller’), and setting (‘modern American city’.) Let’s just hope those pigs in the stands recognise a solid gold picture when they see one!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us Season 2 is on the way but it won’t be last for the series, nor will it cover the entirety of the sequel it's adapting. A new interview with Deadline reveals the season’s 7-episode count, the likelihood of a third and even fourth season, and how the showrunners plan on telling its story.
The Last of Us Part II is a long game. So much so that showrunners and directors Craig Mazin and Naughty Dog president Neil Druckmann realized it would need to tell its story across more than one season. 
“The story material that we got from Part II of the game is way more than the story material that was in the first game, so part of what we had to do from the start was figure out how to tell that story across seasons,” Mazin said. “When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the natural breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes.”
Even though Season 2 will be shorter than Season 1, one of its episodes is said to be "quite big" in length. The showrunners also tease that a potential Season 3 will be much larger in scope. Despite this, Mazin doesn’t believe they can tell the whole story in two seasons because they want to take their time. “And indeed, the story may require Season 4,” he says.
HBO has not yet renewed The Last of Us for a third or fourth season, but Mazin believes it will happen, “as long as people keep watching.” 
For those worried that Season 2 would rush through Part II's events, it seems you can relax. We'll see where the story stops when The Last of Us Season 2 kicks off in 2025. To get a look at what the season has in store, you can take your first looks at Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey’s Joel and Ellie, and read about the castings for Dina, along with Manny, Mel, Owen, and Nora. Actor Jeffrey Wright was recently cast to reprise his role as Isaac.

Hauntii drew me in immediately thanks to its striking illustrated art direction and enchanting jazz noir soundtrack. A powerful opening sees the protagonist, an adorable ghost who recently died, attempting to ascend to a heavenly plane hand in hand with an angel-like guardian, only to be shackled and pulled back to the depths of Eternity. It’s an emotionally effective moment, and while the gameplay doesn’t always prove as captivating, it provides enough thrills to propel through an eye-popping…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silkbulb Test is a game in which, going by its demo, you are strapped to a chair and made to answer questions projected onto a screen. You answer the questions by looking ponderously down and pressing the big red and yellow buttons on the desk in front of you. The questions begin with relatively innocuous, CAPTCHA-style inquiries, such as "is this a door?" accompanied by a picture of a face. A few minutes later, there's stuff like "Are you alone?" and "Is it safe to be alone?" and "You are alone" and yep, time to smash Pause or better, throw the Steam Deck behind the sofa and go stare out the window for a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roguelike FPS Wild Bastards is the space western follow up to 2019’s Void Bastards. It takes some of that game’s ideas, mainly those related to shooty and looty, and reforms them into a largely different can o’ campfire beans. This time, it’s less focused on exploration, more on individual, tense shoot-outs. You collect a cast of weirdos, each with different guns and abilities, and form the deadliest dang posse this side of the last tactical overworld map you descision'd your way through. I like what I've played so far, although I think a lot is going to hinge on how much evolution the mid-game offers. As always, here’s a Steam demo, if you want to be all contrary and 'form your own opinions'. Pah.

It's like the hammer of Hephaestus himself was put to work on the entire armory. The Moonstone Axe's heavier attacks now channel faster, for one thing, which could make the most sluggish of the weapons a little more viable. I haven't had a go at the re-jigged bashing yet myself but I trust from these patch notes it will be subtly noticeable.

My pal Liam suggested we play this evening because Bungie's servers would inevitably go up in flames the moment it launched. And what do you know? The right decision was made. Are we smug about it? Yes. Anyway, the good news is that Bungie have put out a few of those fires, though there are still a few bugs to fix.

Or at least “it’s complicated”, to channel a bit of antique Facebook coyness. The Alters is a complicated game. It is a moody sci-fi extravaganza in which your character, beleaguered offworld miner Jan Dolski, has to create new versions of himself by branching off his own past timeline using a "quantum computer", splitting the chain of events at trigger points by, say, having his younger self stand up to his domineering father rather than leaving home.

Back in 2015, I sat down with fighting game community staple and former Capcom employee Seth Killian for a demo of the first game from Radiant Entertainment – his then-newly founded indie studio – Rising Thunder. The title, which featured robots fighting one another, aimed to give players a 2D fighter with simple controls and little barrier to entry. Rising Thunder showed a ton of promise, so much so that League of Legends developer Riot Games acquired Radiant Entertainment in 2016. This led to the cancellation of Rising Thunder, which was at that point in alpha, with many of the core tenets transferrin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just Cause creators, Mad Max developers and Rage 2 co-developers Avalanche Studios have announced that they will lay off 50 developers - nine per cent of their global workforce - and close their New York, USA and Montreal, Canada studios in order to "ensure a stable and sustainable future for the company". 


The announcement post doesn't go into much detail about either the reasons for the layoffs or how exactly Avalanche will be supporting the departing staff, adding only that "our focus is now on supporting all Avalanchers through this challenging time" and that "we're grateful for the invaluable contributions of those leaving and remain committed to creating incredible gaming experiences for our players."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Devolver Digital has released an intriguing teaser for what appears to be a new project by Solar Ash and Hyper Light Drifter developer Heart Machine. The reveal is advertised for June 7, the day of the Devolver Direct showcase.
Heart Machine is currently working on Hyper Light Breaker, a 3D third-person co-op action game that is the spiritual successor to Hyper Light Drifter. Gearbox is publishing that game, confirming Devolver's teaser is for something different. Based on this brief clip, it’s hard to gauge the nature of this game. It shows a sunset cityscape with a silhouette of a figure, the scene emblazoned with Heart Machine's logo. But given the studio’s impressive pedigree, we’re excited and surprised to see a new title so soon.


The Devolver Direct airs on June 7 at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET. You can keep up with the other summer showcases with our evolving schedule of events. For more on Heart Machine, check out our extended preview for Hyper Light Breaker and our reviews of Solar Ash and Hyper Light Drifter.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was a diehard WipeOut player as a kid. Seriously, me and the boys used to roam the streets of Bradford looking for F-Zero players to bully, at least till the RollCagers rocked up and stole our lunch money. Mind you, I think I was probably less interested in WipeoUt's racing than its trackside landscapes, which remain exquisite decades on - all those sweeping album-cover facades with their animate fixtures that thickened and solidified into full-blown peripheral cities as the series progressed. 


I am similarly hooked by the worlds of Ghosts Ehf's Phantom Spark, which are a million lightyears from WiPeout in terms of their influences and atmosphere, much as the underlying hover-jockeying is a million lightyears away from WipeouT in terms of its gentleness and lack of combative elements. But these spaces are just as mesmerising to fly through and think about when not focussed on finding the perfect line through the next corner, or avoiding a patch of grass. Small wonder, given that the game's art director is Joost Eggermont, whose streaking astral contraptions and "small interactive moments" I've long admired, but never managed to write about until now.

Life In Jars is this YouTuber I've followed for a while. He makes videos that might involve, say, scooping up some puddle water, leaving it in a sealed jar for a while, then coming back to it a few months later. He'll report on the results, which are often tremendous. Look at the LIFE in that jar! The little wriggly lads just wriggling around. The blobs whose job is to float and squidge indiscriminately. A lovely bit of fauna sloshing about there, like a forest dwelling for those who implement the five-second rule. It's a reminder that bog water is rather beautiful, actually.
Having spent three hours with Elden Ring expansion Shadow Of The Erdtree's opening area, I can't help but think of Life In Jars. What resides in the shadowy dome of the Big Tree is horrendous! Miserable! The forgotten creatures and their crumbling homes are grim. But oh my word, the shadows have spawned a beautiful disasterpiece. Just, errr, those other jars? The fun guys with the scoopy arms and little legs? Yeah. I have bad news.

I love Elden Ring. I played it for more than 150 hours. It was also my 2022 game of the year by a nautical mile. I loved it so much that I wrote a whole piece on having what I dubbed “post-Elden Ring depression.” That’s why its upcoming expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, has been among my most anticipated games of 2024 and why I couldn’t wait to fly out to Los Angeles to play the first hands-on demo. Taking place in a special venue in the heart of the famous Hollywood Forever Cemetery (you read that right), I spent three hours freely roaming a po…]]></summary>

Please feel free to try any of these on for size: Grunn’s shear sound is the Wilhelm Scream of gardening equipment, sure to be referenced for decades to come. Grunn’s shear sound wormed its way past my eyes and into parts of my brain I’d previously assumed could only be accessed by either masterful ASMR or irresponsibly long Q-tips. I used to have anxiety, but now, my only fear in life is that Grunn’s grass will run out, so I no longer have a reason to click away with its shears. Play Grunn, innit. There are, by the way, lots of other things to like about it, although I cannot hear them over the wonderful sound of these shears.

The hardest track ever created in Trackmania was published by a team of mappers on May 4th, bringing an intimidating 16-floor tower called Deep Dip 2 into the racing game. It became a magnet for competitive drivers after a prize pool of over $30,000 was offered to the first three players to conquer its hellish heights. The prize has yet to be claimed. Even today, determined racers continue to bang their heads against the brutally designed course, featuring icy surfaces, curving rails, and perilous loop-the-loops that hang kilometres about the ground. Some players have parked their hopes and given up. But others persevere. The top three players have reached the final floor and currently stand shoulder to shoulder, eyes focused on the prize.

Engineering a mech is a Herculean labour whose completion eludes today's puny scientists, and Mech Engineer doesn't aim to make life easier, whatever its putative status as a "means of fun". Mech Engineer is a game with an attitude problem, frankly. I realised this on in-game day two, when the interface coughed up a bunch of damage reports presented as pieces of paper, which I then had to crumple up and toss away individually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ll never know exactly what sort of fiction Tom Clancy would have written if he was less interested in the calibre of specific bullets and their effiency at dismantling burgeoning socialist governments, and more so in the specific sigils required to blast a riot cop through a third story window. While charity shops across the land mourn this devasting loss to their paperback shelves to this very day, we do at least have a glimpse into what such a literary venture may have looked like. Oh, did you like that door? Was it your favourite door? Soz, pal. Strategy game Tactical Breach Wizards just hexed right through it with a new demo as part of Steam Next Fest. I’ve played it, and it’s very exciting stuff, not least for how differently it plays than what I’d expected.

"You" being the players who completed the metagame's last Major Order and successfully pumped the Terminid supercolony of Meridia full of an experimental "Dark Fluid" - which Super-Earth, incidentally, pinched from the Illuminate faction during the First Galactic War, aka Helldivers 1.
Now, Meridia has imploded and become a radiant, wailing, purple-fringed disc of pure nothingness, with triumphant players rudely ejected from orbit via emergency hyperspace jump, but subsequently allowed to return and gaze into the dark heart of their victory. Great work, Inferno-plungers. I'm sure the consequences of this will be neither cosmic nor horrible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Card Bard appears to be a copy of a game by another developer, Dire Decks by kindanice. Dire Decks was released in 2023 on itch.io and was well received there. Kindanice has pointed out the direct likeness between their game and the one released on Steam under another name. Yikes. Thanks to our diligent commenters for catching this. We'll try to find out more. 
Original article: The onslaught of fun Steam Next Fest demos you can play right now continues and will not relent. Card Bard is a deckbuilding roguelike shooter in which your wee gunman is seemingly frozen in abject terror as little pill-shaped baddies creep towards him like bacteria on a petri dish. Good thing you have a hand of cards, each one showing how many bullets will bop forth from your body when you select it. It's surprisingly tough for something so pastel-paletted. I'm 10th on the leaderboard. You can probably beat that, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In EA's Desert Strike - released way back in the dim salvages of 1992 - you are a helicopter pilot scooting around a Sylvester Stallone reinvention of Iraq, shooting down tanks and fighters with guns and missiles while rescuing VIPs and fretting constantly about your wafer-thin armour and espresso-sized fuel reserves. It was a no-frills piece of Gulf War fanfic, complete with George Bush ending cameo, and a well-made shooter that used to drive me nuts on Sega Mega Drive.
Megacopter: Blades Of The Goddess is Desert Strike, but heavily Blood-Dragonified and with a big dollop of Airwolf to boot. Here, the enemy troops are naughty Reptoid aliens, the writing is scattershot-satirical (upgrades are bought with pizza tokens) and your helicopter houses the soul of a blood-drinking "AZ-TECH" goddess. Is it a nuanced parody of the Strike series? It doesn't feel like it. Did I enjoy the demo? Yes. Does it have a crawling tentacle boss called Queen Oildusa? Also yes, and will you please stop asking questions so I can write the rest of this article.

Summer Game Fest has emerged as a hub for a lot of developers seeking eyes. The 2-hour show hosted by marketing man Geoff Keighley will be broadcasting on Friday, blasting you in the ocular nerves with, probably, a lot of games. However, most of these games will not be brand new, exciting reveals, said Keighley himself in a fresh Twitch Q & A. "There will be, definitely, new announcements," he said, "but the show is largely focused on, I think, existing games that have new updates for fans." He's mentioning this ahead of time, he said, to set expectations.

Not just a bottomless pit, but a conveniently portable, Looney Tunes-esque hole into which you could seemingly chuck everything from items and equipment to characters. Speaking to me during the same interview in which they discussed long-abandoned plans for bringing back Baldur’s Gate 1’s Candlekeep, Larian CEO Swen Vincke and Baldur’s Gate 3 lead writer Adam Smith (RPS in peace) touched on the subject with tantalising brevity. Argh, if only I hadn’t had to run off and catch a taxi, I’d still be there now, discussing the many applications of a portable hole. Bypassing carrying capacity limits would just be the start of it.

It's a creative building game like The Sims 4 but with none of the fuss of actually controlling lives - and no quests, combat or arbitrary challenges of any kind.

Instead, Tiny Glade simply offers a meadow and tools with which to build. The vibe of the game is cottage-core at its finest, with enough whimsigoth finery that you'll soon lament that you can't actually live inside your glorious creations. I've played the charming demo as part of Steam Next Fest, and you'll find some thoughts from my time with it below.

The mechanical monster is jury-rigged to the top of an office desk and must be reloaded with a new shell after every shot. The recoil is terrifying. It's operated by three people: one person drives the tank with a steering wheel and levers, another uses cranks to aim the gun barrel, and a third reloads the shells that eject automatically from the chamber after every desk-lifting blast. The "shells" in question are 2-litre bottles of fizzy drink, and the crew has set up a whole rack of these bottles for panicked reloading. If you are the kind of person who yearns for the immersion of the legendary Steel Battalion controller then you will get a definite buzz from watching the death machine in action below.

Likely to be the most significant action of its type ever in Belgium, the blocking measures coincide with a growing number of similar actions around Europe.

The Dutchman has never hidden away and has continuously claimed his service operates legally. If only in part, it's still streaming channels right now.

Early positive sentiment was quickly scuppered by bugs, slow updates and more. Now its developers say that they're ending support for the game, and multiplayer functionality will be switched off this September.

That's in addition to new enemy encounters in Redfall Commons, improved AI and a new Unrivaled Weapon.

Skald is terrific.

Still, Murky Divers has some fairly eye-catching USPs. It's got underwater physics, of course, and it puts you and - unhelpfully - your friends in charge of a submarine.

Well, it's out today. Bursting forth into the corporate lobby of early access with uzis akimbo, peppering the walls with angry bullets. Good, I say.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Mike Judge’s 1999 cult comedy Office Space, there’s a scene where Ron Livingston’s Peter - a programmer working a tedious corporate job - visits a hypnotist. “Is there any way that you could, sorta, just zonk me out so I don’t know that I’m at work, in here,” Peter asks of the hypnotist, pointing to his head. “Could I come home and think that I’ve been fishing all day, or something?”. That’s basically the high-level concept for brilliant sci-fi comedy show Severance, right there. Not wanting to spoil any more than I absolutely have to, I’ll present you with two facts up top. 1. It features a touching queer relationship between John Turturro and Christopher Walken and 2. It’s some of the best television I’ve seen in the last few years. Throw in some Stanley Parable, Control, Gilliam’s Brazil, and some more meta undertones of general musing on gamified reward loops, and you’ve got Severance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between this, my supporter post later, and the fact I decided to watch Office Space again this week, I’d like to make it clear to any colleagues or management reading that I value and love them all dearly, and am 110% committed to the eternal grind machine of covering videogames online. Workday malaise is universal, however, whether or not you’re lucky enough to enjoy your job as much as I do. Enter Office Fight, a stylish physics action game where you, a ghost, posess office equipment to cause as much physics-based chaos as possible. The PR did some Office Space jokes in the email, so I pretty much had to cover it. At least once I realised what they were doing, after initially just thinking they were being a massive donkey.

The topic, comedy rock RPG/door-kicking sim Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands, was picked by a sadly absent Alice B, but you know what they say when beloved colleagues become ensnared in the kind of Kafkaesque employment limbo that only a corporate acquisition can engineer: the show must go on. We’re therefore sticking to the schedule, and will launch the liveblog at 4pm BST today, Friday May 31st.

In a video entitled ‘Keeping Our Community Healthy // Dev Updates,” studio head Anna Donlon took to Xitter to outline the new measures for the competitive FPS. Below is a graphic detailing the changes, which include new penalties such as hardware bans for offenders, and an expanded role for the game's Voice Evaluation tech, which monitors chat for bad behaviour. “If you want to make evil statements under the guise of '[naughty word SEO doesn't like being in the first paragraph] talk', you aren't welcome here,” writes the official Valorant account.

It showed off more of how its lovely desert environments morph to fit the weather and how its inhabitants largely don't get on. We also got a look at some cursed lions, an armoured frog with an unsettling tongue and a rideable Chocobo-esque mount that lets you ping arrows on the fly. Let me break it down for you readers, as someone who is increasingly excited at the prospect of more colourful pants.

The morning is cloudy but bright and calm, the north London suburbs are a blissful checkerboard of red roofs and flourishing lawns, hope glistens faintly in the gutters and ditches beside the tube. How unlike the innards of Centum, a point-and-click horror game (Steam page here) that begins with a dreary retro desktop interface on which there are curious text files, curioser decryption tools and most curious of all, an .exe of some kind that drops you into a simulation consisting of a stone prison chamber.

Sorry, not freegans - freegunners. Freeganism is a portmanteau of "free" and "vegan" referring to people who fish jars of near-spoiled hummus out of supermarket dumpsters according to an ideology of minimal resource consumption. Freegunners, meanwhile, are lairy Guardians Of The Galaxy-alike mercenaries with phat guns and playstyle-defining secondary abilities. They do not consume hummus as far as I know. The game is out 23rd August 2024, with a beta happening in July, and I've got an overview trailer for you below.

The good news is that the port, co-developed by Jetpack Interactive and original makers Santa Monica Studio, will pack in all the DLSS 3, FSR 3, and ultrawide what-have-yous that one might expect from a big, monied PC release. The bad, silly, clearly pointless news is that it will need a PlayStation Network (PSN) account, despite the complete lack of multiplayer.

Overall, sites are still being blocked in large numbers, but the real growth isn't found on main domains. Easily and quickly deployed at almost no cost, subdomains can circumvent blocking and Spain blocks them in their thousands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An Activision lawsuit targeting a group of Call of Duty cheat makers has ended with a $14.5m judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. The defendants, all linked to Germany-based EngineOwning UG, initially put up a spirited defense against alleged violations of the DMCA, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and civil RICO, among others. By last summer, all defendants had disengaged from the legal process. At the time of writing, EngineOwning is selling its latest MWIII and Warzone cheat.
