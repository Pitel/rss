        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A report from Yonhap News Agency, a news agency headquartered in Seoul, South Korea, developer NCSoft appears to be undergoing additional restructuring including layoffs and potential recommended resignations and voluntary retirements. The news comes just three weeks after its latest MMORPG, Throne and Liberty, released in the West.




According to YNA, NCSoft is targeting a specific number of employees belonging to the actual game development and operation organizations of the company, which comes after layoffs earlier in the year which targeted more support-related departments in the company.

For rogue-lites such as Hades 2, you'll need to work hard to gather resources and materials to unlock new content. In this case, it's the elusive Adamant Ore, found in the coldest regions of Hades 2.


It's time for Mel to grab some warm-weather gear, as Adamant is an ore found only at the top of the world: Mount Olympus. The Location takes a lot of time to reach, as it can only be accessed after traveling far on the surface. You must first defeat the Guardian of the Rift of Thessaly, who blocks the path to the mythical mount. Oh, but be sure to bring a pickaxe along with some fur boots.

List of all Flows in Skillful Roblox


What Are Flows in Skillful Roblox?


In Skillful, every player has a Flow, which is a special ability that, when activated, provides you stats bonuses for a certain amount of time. Depending on what flow you have, these bonuses can be minor or massive, and the time the bonuses last can also be longer, which is the case for the Galaxy flow.


How to Build Up Flow Meter and Activate Flow in Skillful


Screenshot by Destructoid


To activate your Flow in Skillful, you'll have to press G (PC) while your Flow Bar is full. The actions that will increase your flow meter are scoring goals and ankle breaks. The latter can be achieved by successfully tackling an opponent or by avoiding a tackle/move using your dribble or another move.


That about does it for our list of Flows in the Skillful Roblox experience. To find more guides related to this title, including the full list of talents and all active codes, visit the Skillful section here on Destructoid.

In 2016 Pony Island took the concept to an interactive level in a video game. It did so with a strong sense of humor, but it was effective in blurring the line between the player and the player character in the game. Tormenture is a lot like that with a smidge less humor and, as far as I can tell, less of a lust for metanarrative built from vague subtext.


But the concept of a haunted game isn’t enough to make a game compelling, so Tormenture faced the risk of getting lost under a pretense that has been done before. Croxel deserves mad respect since their…]]></summary>

Shadow Generations has made its way onto emulators early.

The Nintendo Switch build of Sonic x Shadow: Generations seems to be the source of most, if not all, of the leaks we're seeing. While gameplay screenshots from Generations' new Shadow's storyline have been drifting in for at least a week, the more advanced leaks we've seen over the last few days seem to have started with a YouTuber named Vexi.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The vengeful Super Garlic Jr. in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero is angry over the sealing of his father from Kami. After unlocking the character, you can place that anger into defeating the likes of Piccolo and Goku. 


Two ways to unlock Super Garlic Jr. in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero


There are two methods to unlock Super Garlic Jr. in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero. You'll need to do either of the following:



Finish 10 matches with Piccolo.


Buy Super Garlic Jr. from the Shop for 45,000 Zeni and you'll need to be Player Level 5.



The quickest way to unlock Super Garlic Jr. from Player Level 1 is to play 10 matches with Piccolo. Go to Battle, and then Offline to start matches against the CPU. You'll want to beat your foe as quickly as possible, so make sure Piccolo's opponent is Hercule (Mr. Satan). His HP is low, so it should take a few minutes, if that. You definitely don't want to face the likes of Gogeta or Ultra Instinct Goku, for example.

Also, pick the standard Piccolo, not the one fused with Kami. If you get bored of Hercule, you can choose the Kid version of Gohan, who is fairly weak as well. You can change the CPU team by pressing the right shoulder button (R1) and selecting the character. 


How to use Piccolo


To quicken the process even more, use Piccolo's moves like Special Beam Cannon. You can activate it after charging up and reaching the MAX meter after getting to 1 on the top left meter. The Paralyze Beam can be a great set-up for a projectile move as it keeps them paralyzed for a few seconds. It would help to learn how to escape combos as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It feels like just yesterday when the Manibus Scenario was in full swing and I received reports of the gigantic creature emerging from the skies well ahead of schedule. It turns out that — apparently by accident — the Manibus was spawning too early. 


Well, it may have happened again. I wrote an article on where to find the Snowsprite Deviation and, spoiler alert, the best way to find one is by taking down a Chaosweaver. Now that the article is out there for all to see, including a few of the Chaosweaver spawn locations, this gigantic entity has mysteriously vanished from the game. 


Now it's up to players and journalists alike to speculate on whether the Chaosweaver has indeed been removed until Phase 2, or whether the spawn time on these beasts is just extraordinarily long. 


Judging from in-game chatter, the Way of Winter scenario has been met with a mostly warm reception (get it?). Players seem to be satisfied with the new experience, despite early frustration on learning to deal with the temperature system (it got really cold, really fast). 


One of the main complaints currently seems to be the lack of good looting spots for tier-three materials, but with new crops, animals, locations, enemies, and bosses, this is a rather small compromise to make in my humble opinion. 


For now, the question remains whether the Chaosweaver spawns will return before Phase Two, which starts on Thursday, 24 October for the first set of Way of Winter servers. The Way of Winter is set to last for 35 days, after which no one is quite sure what's next on the cards for Once Human. 


Though more speculation here is that we'll receive hard servers on which to repeat the Way of Winter a second time for boosted rewards, given that it took the developers four months to release a new scenario after the start of the first, this is a likely case. 


Only time will tell.

Whether you want the bare minimum needed to progress in the game or you like to spend hours creating elaborate structures, you’ll eventually need a boatload of Sintered Bricks. This guide will make getting your hands on them as quick and easy as possible.

Uses for Sintered Bricks in Once Human


After wood comes stone, and you’ll make hundreds of Sintered Bricks to upgrade your base to stone, marble, and concrete in Once Human. Currently, concrete is the highest tier of structure you can build and provides the greatest defense against enemy attacks.


Unlocking Sintered Bricks


Screenshot by Destructoid


Sintered Bricks are a crafted item in Once Human, earned by unlocking Forging Techniques in the third level of your Memetics' Infrastructure tree. Forging Techniques only costs three Ciphers and 200 Energy Links to unlock and, using a standard Furnace, each Sintered Brick requires three Charcoal and ten Gravel to make. If you’ve progressed to an Electric Furnace, there’s no Charcoal requirement, but you’ll need 5W of power.


Gravel and Charcoal are two of the easiest crafting components to obtain, though you’ll need a Furnace to make Charcoal. You’ll find Gravel by mining any ore deposit, and Charcoal is created by burning Logs.


The best way to get gravel, however, is by mining normal rock ores. You'll also want to use an Electric Drill at the very least, unlocked in tier four of the Infrastructure memetics branch. For best results, however, use an Advanced Electric Rock Drill.


Now you’ll be able to build a fortress that can better withstand the encroachment of Deviants in Once Human, particularly during Territory Purification, and it’ll look good too.

The second one is at a Pochinki compound, which is right beside the mountains. This compound has two warehouses, located on the initial right side upon entering Pochinki from the Sosnovka Military Base.

The third one is located at the Georgopol compound across the canal. You can find this compound after crossing the very first bridge from the Georgopol crates area. Players usually refer to that area as Georgopol City.


Livik

In Livik, you can find the Venom Horse at the compound near the Midstein. This compound is found before the Midstein as you approach from East Port and is located on the right-hand side of the road. 


If you still can’t find it, just head for the recall area that is nearest to Midstein. Upon reaching it, you can see the black symbiote and the Venom Horse.

Ahead of the global launch, Activision has shared some vital information about how the Prestige system will work in the upcoming title. It will be a risk vs. reward approach, as those opting for it will lose plenty of valuable things from their inventory. But they will also be rewarded for their extra efforts, so let's find out how the full system will work inside the game.


When can you activate the Prestige system in Call of Duty Black Ops 6?


The new Prestige system can be activated once you've reached player level 55 (which is the maximum level at first). You can enter into this system from the Progression tab, which is located inside Barracks. Once you enter t…]]></summary>

This is an extremely important figure in this series, who made his debut in Horizon: Zero Dawn and reappeared in the sequel, Horizon: Forbidden West.

It’s now been over a decade since the last new Donkey Kong Country game released (yes, you’re that old), and while the world continues to wait for Nintendo to remember that its beloved ape used to star in a really good platforming series of his own, other developers have stepped up to try to fill the void. Indie releases such as Kaze and the Wild Masks, Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair, and Marsupilami: Hoobadventure have all done an exceptional job of emulating the things that made DK’s old side-scrolling romps so enjoyable and now another contender has stepped up to the plate.
Nikoderiko: The Magical World, the inaugural release of Cyprus-based VEA Games, not only does a great job of recreating DK’s best adventures with its own twist, but it takes things a step further by also calling back to the gameplay style of some other classic platformer mascots. And while, yes, one could make the argument that Nikoderiko is a little too comfortable riding the coattails of the classics without adding many of its own ideas, it does such a good job of capturing what made those games great that it hardly matters. Nikoderiko doesn’t eclipse the projects that served as its clear inspirations, but it provides an enjoyable and challenging platforming adventure that we’d suggest to any fans of the genre.

It is very easy to forget the sheer volume of games that launch throughout an entire year. One month alone can have dozens of releases, let alone the rest as game development teams announce their plans.

One of the biggest mysteries surrounding the reveal of Mario & Luigi: Brothership for the Switch was which team(s) was actually handling the development now that AlphaDream is no longer around.
Well, as we approach the game's release on 7th November 2024, it looks like we now have a reasonably sound idea of who the development team is (at least, without firm confirmation from Nintendo itself). As posted by Nintendeal on social media, Brothership is seemingly the result of a collaboration between Nintendo and Acquire.

The latest home page lets you directly access games, including Warzone and the upcoming Black Ops 6, making it easier to manage your files. Each game tile will have its own UI, providing content for its respective titles. Even past entries, like Modern Warfare 3 and Vanguard, will still be available here via the All Games tab. You can see the difference in changes with this comparison (new one on the left and old one on the right):

When you're playing against the AI at lower difficulties, it's pretty easy to break combos. Moreover, the AI at lower difficulty hardly chains combos in the first place. But that's not the case when you're playing a human opponent or crank up the difficulty of the AI. In such contests, you'll find your opponents attempting plenty of combos, which makes it crucial for you to counter the combos and escape the chain without taking too much damage.

Valve designers Lawrence Yang and Yazan Aldehayyat have shared a little of the company's thinking regarding "generational leaps" in hardware, commenting that they don't want to release a Steam Deck sequel that is "only incrementally better", and in particular, that they don't want to release a new Steam Deck that is drastically more powerful at the expense of battery life.

One of these hidden items can be found early on in Chapter 1, as soon as you set foot in the Bowling Alley with Safi. If you’re anything like me, you’ll look through your choices at the end of Chapter 1 and ask yourself “Was there a plushie in the Bowling Alley?” because you completely missed it the first time. 


If you’ve already played through Chapter 1 and don’t want to play through it again, you can get back to the Bowling Alley by choosing “Chapter Select” from the main menu, then clicking on “Still Life”, then “Out of the Gutter”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the protean stink of 2013, the beast we call Factorio sprouted in lowercase early access form and began its meticulous, ravenous conquest of the emerging factory sim genre. Some say that Factorio gave that genre life, though I'd point at Dwarf Fortress as one among many notable forebears. Today, the terrain of factory simming is hotly contested by rival piles of conveyor belt spaghetti. I'm not just talking about Satisfactory or Shapez - they're even making philosophical factory sims these days. They have cosy factory sims now.
Accordingly, the immense, smoke-rimmed cyborg eye of Factorio has turned from the exhausted soil to the relatively untapped heavens. Somewhere up there, there is unspoilt territory. Somewhere, there is land that has never known the roar of a smelter - and in Factorio's behemothic Space Age DLC, out today, you will find it.

When Blumhouse Productions announced its venture into the video game industry with Blumhouse Games, it would have been all too easy for the company to lean on some of its most recognisable IPs for its first release. Franchises such as Insidious, The Purge, Sinister, and Paranormal Activity certainly have strong potential within the video game realm, but Blumhouse has instead chosen to take a chance on two-person development team Cozy Game Pals and their debut title, Fear the Spotlight.
And boy, was it the right decision! With its low-fi, PS1-style visuals, tactile puzzles, and a sharp focus on atmosphere and dread, Fear the Spotlight is a wonderful venture into the unknown that will keep you enthralled throughout its five-to-six-hour runtime. Very minor performance hiccups aside, if you’re after something spooky yet approachable to complement your Halloween celebrations this year, Cozy Game Pals’ narrative horror is the perfect choice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you enjoy driving cars around the Fortnite map, you'll likely be more than familiar with running out of gas and traveling on foot until you find another vehicle. Visiting a gas station lets you refuel your car using their fuel pumps, allowing you to keep driving a little longer.


How to find fuel pumps in Fortnite


20 gas stations and fuel pump spawns exist in Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 4, primarily around Brutal Beachhead, Sandy Steppes, and Rebel's Roost. Other named landmarks like the Nitrodrome and Brawler's Patch have stations nearby, giving you several locations to visit, depending on the Battle Bus' travel direction. Below is a map of every gas station and fuel pump location.

Almost every major gas station also has a car spawn for you to grab if your current one is low health. That way, you can quickly refuel and head out or swap out your car for an improved version. Sometimes, you may have a weekly or event quest asking you to visit a gas station and refuel your vehicle, allowing you to knock out this objective and get some quick and easy XP.


How to refuel your car in Fortnite


If you just want to refuel your car, you can interact with a gas pump and bring the nozzle to your vehicle. As you hold your attack button toward the car with the gas nozzle, your fuel percentage will rise until it reaches 100 percent. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


Just be careful, as, during this time, anyone can come in and damage you, your car, or the nearby pumps, creating dangerous explosions. 


How to blow up a fuel pump in Fortnite


Alternatively, you can blow up the fuel pumps yourself if you need to finish some quests, create strategic damage sources, or get up to some mischief by damaging them. Every fuel pump has a health bar and will explode once it reaches zero. Watch your positioning while damaging it, as it can very easily hurt you and drain both your shields and health.

As Nintendo opened the gates to its upcoming Nintendo Switch Online playtest for successful participants, it didn't take long for the classified content to be plastered all over social media.
Indeed, if you search terms relating to the playtest on social media right now, you'll immediately be greeted by information and screenshots providing crucial context behind what the upcoming playtest will pertain. Naturally, we won't be revealing such content here on Nintendo Life, but if you're desperate to know, you're not going to have a particularly difficult time locating key information.

And over the years it's received a slew of updates that make it a bit bigger and a bit better, but nothing that's been mega substantial. That is, until today's announcement that it's getting an Ode To Castlevania expansion, classed by developers Poncle as the game's biggest DLC yet. More characters, more weapons, a weapon selector, an enormous stage. I simply can't wait to devour more packets of crisps as I play this.

We've already had a fairly extensive hands-on with the latest in the long-running Mario & Luigi RPG series and, coming off the back of that two-level taster, we've been chomping at the bit to get our hands on the full thing. Luckily, having now taken in everything the first 10 hours or thereabouts has to offer, we're still full to the brim with enthusiasm for what the bros. have been cooking up for this dose of high-seas hijinks.
As detailed in our first hands-on, it's approaching 10 years (!) since we last hooked up with Mario and Luigi in this format, and therefore Mario & Luigi: Brothership has its work cut out in sailing this franchise into more modern waters as the plucky plumbers take on the challenge of piecing back together the land of Concordia, which has been split into separate islands by...well, that would be spoiling things.

As part of its second-anniversary celebrations, Poncle has announced the Vampire Survivors 'Ode to Castlevania' DLC, which will land on Switch on 31st October (just in time for Halloween).
As you might expect, the upcoming expansion is all about Konami's monster-slaying series, from which Poncle has taken more than a little inspiration for its roguelike, it's fair to say. The DLC packs in over 20 new characters, 40 new weapons, 30+ fresh music tracks and the game's biggest stage yet.

But it's elevated, on the other hand, by talk of living helltrains that eat crocodiles for breakfast. Without further ado, here's a trailer.

We've seen a decent amount of Mario Wonder merch since the platformer hopped onto Switch last year, but those plushies (even if they do talk) can't possibly match the adorable usefulness of Bandai's new clip stands.
These clips can be used for all kinds of things — cards, notes, pictures, sweets — but the best thing is that they're modelled on Mario Wonder's Standees, so it would appear that you have a bunch of helpful respawn points dotted along your desk and shelves.

With the steely glare of a polygonal warrior on the verge of killing god, he turns to them and says: "Let's mosey!" It's an unintentionally comical moment - an easy-going phrase, as if they're all going to the shops and not jumping into a big glowing pit at the end of the world.
It's a result of the RPG's famously rushed translation. But maybe not in the way you think. A fan translation of Final Fantasy VII has now fixed a bunch of mistakes that were present in the original, and "let's mosey" is one of them. The fix? Have Cloud say it way more often.

As such, we now have a pretty solid indication that this is another Unreal Engine effort from the development team thanks to a post from Nintendeal. This follows previous Unreal titles such as Princess Peach: Showtime!, Pikmin 4, and Yoshi's Crafted World.

Additionally, this TOIL (time off in lieu) wouldn’t be made available until the release of space game Star Citizen’s accompanying single player campaign, Squadron 42.
At CitizenCon over the weekend, CIG head promiser Chris Roberts said that he’s “confident” that Sqorty-two will release in 2026, via Ian Games. CIG also released a video of the entire first hour and fifteen of the game, which you can watch below.

Valve's not-so-secret third-person MOBA shooter is a fiercely competitive game of push and pull through monster-peppered city streets. You'll get into hectic scrapes with a giant blob man and come out of it sweating and swearing, and possibly alive. It is tactical, deep, instinctive, and an interesting work-in-progress.

This is the kind of game that puts you into a blistering, exciting (and confusing) battle for survival, then displays a graph when you lose. I need to get as far away from it as possible.

Picture that game in your mind: the quietness of the hallways versus the crash of a thunderstorm outside, the sickly-sweet 90s décor, the fairy lights and screwed-up balls of paper, the gentle amber pressure of cloistered teenage memories. Now, imagine a faint scuttling behind the skirting boards. A rattling in the pipes. Was there a toilet in Gone Home's autumnal mansion? I can't recall, but you should probably steer clear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Court of Justice of the European Union has handed a historic victory to Datel, the company behind video game cheat device Action Replay. For well over a decade, Sony argued that modification of game generated code amounted to copyright infringement. The CJEU judgment holds that there was no violation of Sony's rights, since Action Replay ran alongside Sony's game code, only modifying values in RAM while leaving object code untouched.

Previously codenamed Condor, it's called FBC: Firebreak - and I am going to immediately recommend they shorten it to Firebreak, because that caps-into-colon combo is going to wind me up when I'm writing news posts at speed. While I'm throwing my weight around, let me also instantly rebut the pedants who are even now racing to leave a comment saying that, actually, Remedy did work on Smilegate's multiplayer shooter CrossfireX. Yes, they did, but only the single player bits. 


Anyway, Firebreak! Here's the announcement trailer.

As such, the expansion forms a direct connection between the games, and may - read: definitely will - harbour a few clues about the story of the forthcoming Control 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Popular torrent site TorrentGalaxy is suffering downtime again today. While the site no longer spooks its visitors with cryptic messages, the repeated issues are somewhat unusual. TorrentGalaxy reportedly changed owners, which could partly explain the recent troubles. This is another chapter in the unusual history of the site, which originated in the 1337x chatbox after ExtraTorrent shut down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bohemia Interactive have announced that Arma 4, the next big instalment in their shooter simulation series, will release in 2027. The announcement came at the tail-end of Bohemia's 25th Anniversary Concert, alongside some disturbingly gun-less footage of a coastal promontory with rippling ocean waters against a cloudy sky - it reminds me more of The Elder Scrolls 6's announcement teaser than any tactical mili-banger. Perhaps they're secretly making an open world walking simulator? I kid, I kid. Please put the chair down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2021, that dark epoch known as the Pre-Edwin Age, there was but one Ed at Rock Paper Shotgun - the venerable Ed Thorn, aka Edders. Edders had a dream, the dream of Halo Infinite getting a battle royale mode. Like Moses descending from the mount with a Needler in either hand, he bedazzled and amazed us with visions of "an enormous playground stitched together from some of Halo's most iconic maps of yore; Warthogs and Mongooses roaming the lands; players racing to the M41 SPNKR as it spawns; grappling to a rooftop and laying down covering fire; some contrived reason as to why there's a circle of poison gas closing in... but hey, rings are what Halo does best, right? It's 100% doable."
Ed Thorn has always been a journalist of great sagacity and supernatural insight, so it was of no surprise to the RPS editors of the era when rumours bubbled up a few months later that Certain Affinity had partnered with 343 Industries (nowadays Halo Studios) to make Halo battle royale a reality. These rumours have now been confirmed by Certain Affinity's former design director Mike Clopper, who says the now-cancelled mode could have been a "game changer".

Well then, perhaps you'll empathise with the enemies in Archons, a twin-stick Vampire Survivors-like where you control two characters at once, and attacks bounce between them automatically as they move about the arena. I gave the Steam Next Fest demo a quick whirl today, and after a couple of swift attempts (I died horribly fast), I realised this could become a bit of a danger to my free time, so I've put it away for now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nepos Games are the two-person studio behind Nebuchadnezzar, which Nate Crowley called "two thirds of an outstanding historical city builder". They've just informed me they're making a new building sim called County Of Fortune, out in Q4 2025. It ain't a city builder, though. In fact, it claims to have murdered the city builder in cold blood, which is unfortunate, because I was really looking forward to a round of Manor Lords later. 


"The city-builder is dead, long live the county-builder," declares the press release, brandishing the husk of SimCity over its head. OK, I'll bite - what's a county-builder then? Well, it's sort of several city-builders having an argument. In County Of Fortune, you seed and grow a number of settlements side by side, then manage their economic and social relations. In other words, it's a game that appears to simulate the phenomenon of culture clash. I'm not sure all this amounts to the wholesale death of a genre, but it's certainly intriguing. Here's the Steam page, and here's a trailer.

I foresee big success.)
Abrak is so confident, in fact, that he reckons their Bond project might end up mirroring the World Of Assassination’s trilogy format. "But what's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story,” Abrak says. “So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future."
It’s a fine interview, worth a read. But I must ask: how are the queues, Abrak? How am I supposed to get excited about a new IO game if you don’t mention the queues?

When another robed cultist spotted what was happening, he tried to intervene, and a kind of Benny Hill pursuit chain began. We ran across a beach, through public toilets, and into the surf. In the end I had to knock them both out. As they lay unconscious, I worried they might soon wake and tell someone what I had done. This can't happen, I hate accountability. I punched their unawake bodies toward the sea in an effort to float the evidence away. But after a few punches the first man exploded into chunks of flesh. I am a murderer now. I was supposed to be a chef.
Streets Of Rogue 2 has a demo out for Steam Next Fest, and while a lot of features are locked up behind the word "UNAVAILABLE" in red font, there's still quite a lot of mischief for you to get up to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Archetype Entertainment and Blur Studio's space RPG Exodus was announced back in December, and was broadly notable for a couple of things: 1) Matthew McConaughey plays a character, and 2) the game's story is woven around time dilation during faster than light travel, with star-hopping adventurers prosecuting a fight against evil Celestials over hundreds, perhaps thousands of years.
Now, it is notable for three things, the third thing being a cosmic blubber-spire of gurning faces who want to eat your ship and soul. Say hello to the Mara Yama, the ickiest Celestial faction so far. Here's a trailer, in which McConaughey does that thing where he lingers on the sibilants and makes you want to lean in and vigorously mess up his hair.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitch have temporarily banned an account run by streamer Asmongold, otherwise known as Zack Hoyt, after he expressed genocidal sentiments about Israel's killing of Palestinian people in Gaza. According to the eSports journalist Rod Breslau, he's been sent to the naughty step for a grand total of two weeks, which I'm sure will be a huge inconvenience and will really teach him the error of his ways. Assuming Breslau's sources are accurate, it's a great demonstration of Twitch's tolerance for streamers with big audiences, the kind of slap on the wrist you'd expect from a platform that recently reinstated Donald Trump's account after banning him in 2021 for the charge of inciting an insurrection.

In response, the STJV called on staff in France to hold a three-day strike beginning yesterday, which the union reports to be underway with the participation of more than 700 workers, via Le Monde.
"This decision is announced immediately after the failure of the profit-sharing negotiations," STJV wrote at the time. “Exactly like previous salary negociations: management’s proposals were inacceptable, the negotiations’ timetable was appalling, and management was deaf to the proposals of the various Employee representatives."

I hid under a stairwell in order to meditate upon my response, then laboriously typed: "No, I just suck." Right on cue, the other player tumbled into view and shredded me with an AK.
The player I met in my second match was more forgiving. "I honestly think the characters need more HP," they said, generously. My wrists need more HP, actually. My eyes and reflexes need urgent patching.

So maybe it’s just me, but there’s a sense of intense freedom and adventure to Keep Driving's Steam demo that belies its prosaic, tractor-tailing subject matter. The opening minutes are oddly silent, until Westkust’s Swirl blasts out from your radio as soon as you drive off toward your first destination - your mate’s house, to hang out and play console games. It comes on strong and sweet; a rush of wind through an open window on a warm morning.

It’s stuck with me since because the developer Tanat seemed like a rad dude, and also because there’s nothing I cherish more than taking a bad pun and just absolutely going to town on it, marrow and all. Building Relationships is about buildings forming relationships in a Love Islandy scenario, though without the reality TV framing you might find in say, Crush House. But the real gag here is the commitment to the bit. Besides that, it’s just a really charming and fun N64-style 3D platformer.
It also features the sort wonky physics that definitely wouldn’t get Ninty’s seal of quality, but work brilliantly here, especially since your character consists largely of angles but still insists on, you know, performing motions.

That's according to game director Dmitry Grigorenko, who observes that enjoyable PvPvE is the "holy grail" of game design, much-sought and seldom claimed. Balancing shooters in which players fight both each other and the bots is tricky, especially in a game as prone to dousing the screen in giblets as Space Marine 2.

The publishers had already made layoffs at Harebrained in the run-up to release, implying that preorder numbers were low; ultimately, Paradox wrote it off as a $22 million flop. At the time of the "parting of ways", Paradox chief operational officer Charlotta Nilsson washed her hands of XCOMlikes entirely, commenting that "a new project or sequel in the same genre was not in line with our portfolio plans".

When asked by Videogamer if lists of known bugs (Nesmith throws out ‘700’ as an example for Skyrim) should be shared with fans on launch "to temper expectations," he responded:

Months!” his mate had told him. Get less shit mates, thought I, for I had already played it elsewhere, and knew that the missions took mere minutes if you put the game on easy then rushed your objectives, bonking nazis along the way. I did not rush the new Steam demo for Kalypso’s revival, Commandos: Origins, but it’s still doable inside half an hour. I had expected a little more, but what’s here has certainly given me some optimism that the full game might well be worth sinking - if not months - at least more time than it takes to wildly lunge at a few nazis en route to your objective.

Beating its most recent Black Friday pricing ($1179) by over $200, the Samsung 49" Odyssey G93SC Series OLED Curved Gaming Monitor is now down to $949 at Amazon. That’s $650 off its original list price, and one of the best deals of the year so far.

Now, do you see a horrendous first-person shooter anywhere back there, full of memes and intentionally terrible font choices? Congratulations, you may have remembered 420BlazeIt, a freakish eyesore of a game developed during a 7-day game jam by one of the people behind Crossy Road, of all things. It briefly did the YouTuber rounds, back when YouTube was not yet the anxiety-inducing ad factory it is today. 
Now I'm going to ask you to come back to the present. But prepare for a bit of a shock - there's a sequel coming to that bong huffing shooter. 420BlazeIt 2 has been announced for some months, but now there's a demo you can play too.

I react to this news with mingled happiness and disappointment. Disappointment at the delay, and happiness, because I hadn't heard of Beyond These Stars before. To coincide with the delay announcement they've released a new trailer, below, which talks us through the business of foraging on passing planets. It looks engrossing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neva is the Sophomore effort from Nomada Studio, who you may remember from their beautiful, dreamy platformer Gris. Neva is not a literal sequel to Gris, but it certainly seems to be one in a spiritual sense, as it, too, is a floaty hand-illustrated platformer fond of metaphor. Neva introduces some drama, with combat and a health system (if not actual stakes because of near-instant restarts), and although neither the platforming nor combat are precise enough to be neat bedfellows, I think we should be willing to forgive most of the mess.

They worked well together, so started looking for their next project - something full-time that could take the place of the increasing instability of freelancing.
It was a shared passion away from videogames that ended up moulding the shape that project would take. "We love tabletop RPGs," says designer and programmer Sacchetti. "So when we stumbled into Mörk Borg, and then we started to play, we looked at each other in the eyes and said, 'Why don't we make a game out of it?'"

Or maybe not. Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders is the frosty followup to the mountain biking original, Lonely Mountains: Downhill, and like its predecessor it's about going fast while barely able to see what's coming. Yet also like its predecessor, initial frustrations melted away until I was eagerly hitting the slopes in the Snow Riders demo for just one more quick go.

Cosy experiences where nothing goes wrong and you have absolutely zero things to investigate and no otherworldly mysteries to worry about. It may shock you to learn that we were recently duped by "normal" gardening sim Grunn, which was not normal at all. But don't worry, it won't happen again. Today we bring you the ordinary and not-one-bit-suspicious Trip, which sees players wandering from carriage to carriage, chatting pleasantly with passengers during a long train journey. How long? Let me look at the timetable here, let's see... "Forever," it says. Hm. Must be a misprint.

This question has plagued the games industry since Nintendo first allowed millions of unsupervised children to play god with Mii avatars and their customisable peepers. In low-stakes fishing game Webfishing, you can give your fuzzy avatar one of 33 styles of eye (I counted). This is the mark of a solid Animal Crossing-like. There's a lot of other character creation bits and bobs, of course, but you'll have to catch a bunch of bass and sell the haul to unlock every boopable nose and bleppy smile.

In Nahantu’s jungles, I linger to take shots of vines spilling from verdigris-kissed cages, of footfall-slicked stone paths and mesoamerican mosaics. Even Vessel Of Hatred’s malignancy feels like a grimly gorgeous tourist trap. Trip Advisor-recommended cyclopean polyps. TikTok viral demonic cysts. I’ve even got a leopard cub to pose with. He’s not sedated, promise. He’s just like that. I told him how much the ultimate edition costs and he’s been catatonic ever since.
I’d like to stick around, but I keep getting ushered along to the next leg of the tour. There are mobs to pop into goo like ripe spots, each fight as slick and frictionless as a pygmy hippo in a butter bath. There are a dozen different tiered resources and event types designed to make repetition feel like progress, until hell freezes over then melts again. It’s fine, Blizzard packed me some wellies. It’s all so comfortable I suspect they’d have thrown in some Xanax and a back rub if they could.

Say hello to ExeKiller, which I am filing under "not new, but news to me". I know, "ExeKiller" sounds like a computer virus, though I think the people who make viruses tend to favour less obviously nefarious names, like "Microsoft Werd". Hang on, that's what I'm writing this article with! Quickly, before I lose this PC to ransomware: ExeKiller is actually a "semi-open" world cyber-Western FPS with retro futurist visuals. It casts you as a bounty hunter plying the dunes and gas stations of a post-apocalyptic Earth, and it looks like a mix of Cyberpunk 2077 and Drive. Here's some pre-alpha footage.

I was very close to buying the recent remake, actually, until I watched the extended prank scene online and realized, oh no, they’re taking themselves seriously now. They prestige-ified it. It insisted upon itself, Louis, so I didn’t bother. I still wouldn’t say no to a sequel though, and based on a couple of (admittedly vague) hints from two of the game’s actors, one might already be in the works.

I need to start getting a ‘Gene Wolfe referenced’ reaction image for these things, I swear - although this reference is at least hidden behind a couple of links. Which links? That’d be spoiling the layered environmental storytelling that keeps you coming back. This week, it’s Senior Technical Narrative Designer at Remedy, previously of Fullbright, Bioshock 2, and Where The Water Tastes Like Wine fame, Johnnemann Nordhagen! Cheers Johnnemann!

That long sought after holy grail of sticking your fingers in your ears and going wahwahwah. But it’s not going to be something created by people with talent, vision, expertise, drive, a dream, or a story in their hearts. No, as with everything in our imminent future, it will be achieved by putting a bucket over your head.

"It does something to my brain that I've never experienced before." The developer's just-announced Keep Driving seems a lot less inclined to scramble your grey matter, though it's partial to the old rose-tinted goggles. It's a droll, backward-glancing and slightly ominous 2D management RPG in which you drive to a music festival on the other side of the country. Along the way, you will pick up hitchhikers, upgrade your car, fill your boot with random junk, and participate in turn-based, non-lethal "combat" with dawdling children and obstinate tractors. Here's a trailer.

That game is Konafa Game's Starless Abyss - a roguelite tactical deckbuilder published by Descenders and Yes, Your Grace outfit No More Robots. It puts you in command of a fleet of upgradeable spaceships, who must chase away invading Eldritch aliens hex by hex... and also, hex by hex. This is both hex-based and a game in which you can cast hexes, you see. Oh, don't look at me like that. I had to distil several manifestos into an article half-an-hour ago. I need this.

The press release for this particular Disco Elysiulike has the most actual names on it of the three we've learned about this week. It is also, by some distance, the most outwardly socialist of the lot. It accompanies a website, featuring some blood-red all-caps political manifestos and a fairly exhaustive breakdown of Summer Eternal's workers cooperative structure. Amongst other things, the studio will let people who buy their games form a non-profit within Summer Eternal that gets a share of the revenue, and has a say on company direction.

Yes, this RPG has style for days, maybe even an entire calendar, and an upside of its more dated aspects is that it runs fine on the modest internals of the Steam Deck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A spiritual successor to Studio ZA/UM’s RPG Disco Elysium is currently in development at the newly-formed Longdue. It's set in a world “conceived by the leads” of the canceled sequel.
A representative of Longdue told us that "the studio isn't ready to talk about specific names at the moment beyond the people mentioned in the press release, but they are looking forward to sharing more about the game and the studio in the future". They did, however, confirm that Disco Elysium's lead writer and designer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov are not involved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps it’s just a testament to the archetypal strength of the image, honestly, but there’s no denying this fallen giant king looks especially gorgeous in Bylina. I’ll move on from his large majesty for a moment though, because it isn’t the only thing this one looks to have going for it. 
It’s a single player action RPG, to start with - a genre I’m always interested in watching evolve in ways not tied to its usual form as a good-boy-points-vomiting loot casino. It’s also based on Slavic folklore, something that’s not too uncommon but strikes a wonderful mix between blackly funny whimsy and intense dread when done right. Also, I’ll take more discordant folk music any time. Trailer below.

You see, Aspyr have just announced that they're porting Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles to PC and Steam. I have a complicated relationship  with Jedi Power Battles, in the sense that I think I still have scars on my thumbs from when I played it all night on a busted PS1 controller. I have bled for this game. I'd close my eyes after each six-hours session and see fields of lightsabers flickering and dancing like luminous leeches, chasing me through the Dagobahnian jungles of my dreams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I will not lie to you, gentle reader. When I first laid eyes on Secret Door's Sunderfolk, while lurking to the rear of a gaggle of journomancers at a preview event last week, I let out an ostentatious sigh. Fortunately, I still mask up to preview events, and am thus free to adopt all kinds of snotty facial expressions without being set upon by burly PRs and shoved into the minifridge for later disposal. To sum it up, Sunderfolk is a hex and turn-based 2-4 player digital boardgame with fantasy animal characters and deckbuilding elements, reminiscent of Gloomhaven. Conceived during the pandemic lockdowns as a way to "bring back game night", but without the traditional 30-minute unboxing ritual, it's played on the big screen but controlled using a dedicated smartphone app, with players stroking and swiping to move characters and play cards.

Instead, the focus will be on power efficiency and lowering temperatures.

If you're allergic to vulnerability, or find cuteness or the "wholesome" games trend hard to digest, you've probably already turned your face away. But if your heart is open, even a smidge, if you carry a deep craving to peer through the cracks in the internet to discover a small realm of common humanity, then Kind Words 2 can show you a glimpse of that warm and welcoming world.

This came a couple of months after the Crusader Kings publisher washed their hands of the sequel's original developers, Double Eleven.
Speaking to me at Paradox's Media Day last week, deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja offered a shade more insight on the decision, suggesting that hard-up players have "higher expectations" at present and are less trusting that developers will fix problems. Chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus also offered thoughts on what Paradox have learned from the disastrous launch of Cities: Skylines 2 in late 2023. Specifically, he said they need to give actual players access to the game early on, not just testers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I always like to balance the inherent cynicism and general corporate awfulness of covering events like Prime Big Deal Days by focusing recommendations on hardware I genuinely like, and ideally, what I actually own. Partly hence the G515 Lightspeed TKL keyboard post from yesterday. And here’s another: the sleek-lookin', sharp-recordin' Logitech StreamCam, which is down from £139 to £70 in the UK and down from $170 to $100 in the US.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Would it be fair to say that we sometimes overlook SATA SSDs? With NVMe drives forming our future and mechanical hard disks increasingly consigned to the past, the 2.5in form factor is just kind of... there. In all of its middle groundedness.
Which is harsh, because they can provide heaps of capacity at relatively attainable prices, as the Crucial BX500 is currently demonstrating. Per Prime Big Deal Days, Amazon UK is running the 2TB version for just £92 (34% off) as well as 4TB for £178 (41% off). Meanwhile, Amazon US is lopping 43% off the 1GB model, bringing it down to $54, with the 4TB model shedding 13% to reach $210.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 won't be an "open sim" like the 2004 original game, according to Paradox Interactive. Now in development at The Chinese Room, it'll be an action-RPG with a relatively linear story set in the World Of Darkness universe. This obviously plays to The Chinese Room's strengths - they're better known for melancholy or horrifying strolls through broken spaces than the Dishonorable massaging of intricate systems. But it also reflects Paradox's view that the original Bloodlines has been "mythologised" a bit: people love the memory of it more than the reality, and there are aspects of the 2004 game, according to Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja, that simply "wouldn't fly today".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s easy to think of your PC’s RAM as something that just needs to be enough, rather than a powerhouse like the graphics card or CPU. Easy for me, anyway, until testing out the Silent Hill 2 remake this past week served up a reality check: modern games need a lot of memory, and in SH2’s case, might not even get past the Steam launcher if they decide you’re lacking in it. As penance, I’ve found some DDR5 RAM deals in the Prime Big Deal Days sales that should set any modern rig for years and years of... well, games launching properly, I suppose.
As such, while 16GB is the bare minimum you can get away with, I’d recommend 32GB to be safe. For pure value, check out Crucial’s DDR5 Pro set, which I've been using in my own testing setup for a while: it’s down from £140 to £80 on Amazon UK, and down from $150 to $81 on Amazon US. But the single best deal here, I reckon, is Corsair’s Vengeance RGB kit, which the US site has slashed from $130 to $100. That’s the same price as the non-RGB equivalent kit while also being faster, at 6400MHz to 6000MHz. Us UK folk can also get a similar set for £101, down from £147, though that’s set at 6000MHz.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, Broken Sword creator Charles Cecil walked out of the office of Revolution Software and onto the Shambles, the Diagon Alley-esque street that has survived since York’s days as a medieval trade hub. He closed the door behind him, somewhat grumpily - he’d had to work late, and it was already past eight o’clock. Then a voice piped up behind him.
"And one day, when you get older, you will play Broken Sword," said a young woman to her toddler. "This is where Revolution are based."
Cecil had stumbled across an annual pilgrimage to the site where British point-and-click adventures are made. From the sounds of it, this young woman was not alone in making the journey. Cecil registered Revolution’s office address on Google a year ago - and received an email to say that 40,000 people have checked it out since.
"We’re incredibly blessed to have a really positive and lovely collection of people who want us to succeed and love the games that we write," Cecil says. "We love our interaction with them."
These might read like the words of a good community manager, rather than a man expressing a deeply-held sentiment. Yet Cecil does not take his relationship with Revolution’s fans for granted. At times in his long career, he has lost touch with his audience. And at others, he’s feared they might turn their back on him.
