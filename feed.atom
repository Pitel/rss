        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We also get a good look at the new mode
Hitman 3: Freelancer is a new mode for the assassination game, set to arrive on January 26, 2023. But ahead of that, IO Interactive is hosting a closed technical test in November.
The Hitman 3: Freelancer closed technical test will take place on November 3 through 7. The closed technical test will only be available on PC via Steam, and it will be a separate game, with a download code delivered by IO if you're chosen.
Sign-ups for the Hitman 3: Freelancer closed technical test are live here.
We also got a pretty decently sized gameplay video today, showcasing just how Hitman 3: Freelancer works. The walkthrough shows off many different aspects of the roguish new mode: picking contracts, planning, touring the home base, and then setting out for a mission.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2ZZlIMdavM
Even Agent 47 is part of the gig economy
The mode will pose a bunch of new challenges and options to players, based around the maps of the Hitman World of Assassination trilogy.
For the closed technical test, only a select portion of the pool will be available. The nine available maps are: Paris, Sapienza, Hokkaido, Miami, Mumbai, Whittleton Creek, Dartmoor, Berlin, and Mendoza.
The full Freelancer mode will have just about every map, barring three. The ICA Facility, Hawke's Bay, and the Carpathian Mountains will be the only locales not in the full Freelancer launch.

While there is progression within the closed technical test, that mastery will not carry over to the full launch.
But this new way of playing Hitman has looked like a cool alternative for awhile now. I'm sure some players are probably eager to tinker with the possibilities in it. They'll be getting their chance in November, ahead of the full launch at the start of the new year.

The retro-lovers over at QuByte Interactive have announced a brand new compilation spotlighting the works of lesser-remembered '80s/'90s developer Visco Corporation — Now in development for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, Visco Collection offers a look back at some old-school arcade/Neo Geo releases.
The new compilation bundles together seven titles from the Visco archives, freshly emulated by indie developer PixelHeart. The game featured are Neo Geo shmup Andro Dunos (1992); futuristic sports game Flip Shot (1997) and its sequel Bang Bead (2000); side-scrolling actioner Ganryu (1999); rally racer Neo Drift Out (1996), soccer title Goal! Goal! Goal! (1995); and finally the bizarre, tomato-based shmup Captain Tomaday (1999).
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7lDgAJ63Uc
No further details have been announced, so we do not know whether the collection will include online play, save states, a museum mode, or any of the other features typical of other retro collections — such as Capcom Arcade Stadium. There are some fun titles bundled here, though the only one I remember seeing quite commonly on the scene is Neo Drift Out. Importantly, however, Captain Tomaday is finally about to get his day in the sun, enjoying the fame and fortune that eluded the winged fruit during his initial run — smothered by the encroaching concerns of The Millennium Bug, no doubt.
Visco Collection is currently in development for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

The wacky cat-breeding roguelike is the brainchild of Super Meat Boy co-creator and The Binding of Isaac mastermind Edmund McMillen and has been in and out of the works for a decade. After being announced, put on hold, and restarted, it appears to have a new release window. 
McMillen tweeted a gif of two of the game’s adorable cats engaging in what we'll call an intimate cat exercise. The tweet links to the game’s Steam page, which lists a 2024 release window.
Hold on to your Butts!https://t.co/wDBOizNXGl pic.twitter.com/MESXJFFXsh
October 28, 2022
What the heck is Mewgenics? The game tasks players with collecting and breeding hundreds of cats to train and send into battle. Or, as the Steam description puts it, Mewgenics is a “turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats!” The game apparently boasts “100s of hours” of gameplay, multiple classes with over 50 unique abilities, over 200 enemies, and other features. 
Mewgenics was first announced in 2012, with McMillen at the time describing it as "By far the strangest project I've ever worked on.” McMillen has worked on it alongside Tyler Glaiel; the pair previously partnered for The End is Nigh, among other titles. The game was originally billed as a cross between Pokemon, The Sims, and Animal Crossing, and had first been planned to release in 2014. It was, of course, delayed, and its development was put on indefinite hold in 2016 when McMillen began work on The Legend of Bum-Bo, which launched in 2019. At the time, McMillen was unsure of Mewgenics’ future, but in 2018 he announced he was remaking the game to be released in “a few years.” 
The game is slated to launch for PC, though whether or not it’s still coming to iOS is unknown. Are you still interested in Mewgenics? Let us know in the comments! For more on Edmund McMillen, we spoke with him last December where he discussed his life and career, including Mewgenics, which you can read in this interview feature.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who Goes There?
Publisher Raw Fury (of Sable fame) has released an intriguing but incredibly eerie trailer for upcoming psychological horror title My Work is Not Yet Done. The lo-fi survival adventure is currently in development for PC at indie outfit Sutemi Productions. A release date was not revealed.
In My Work is Not Yet Done, players will take control of Avery, the last surviving member of an investigative who trekked deep into strange and uncharted country to source a mysterious radio transmission. A brain-heavy piece, the new title will combine investigative and analytical mystery alongside the simulation of surviving as a single person in a changing, isolated, and deeply unnerving environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC0fSDi5b4g
As Avery, players will be tasked with continuing the work of her departed investigative team, staying one step ahead of death and insanity while uncovering the clues that will lead to an almost indecipherable phenomenon. From the official blurb, My Work is Not Yet Done appears doom-laden, suggesting that the team's — Avery's — task may be unfinishable, as each and every day brings with it further mystery, more questions than answers, and the smothering cloud of both isolation and mortal fear. Heavy stuff.
Regardless, with its creepy, staccato imagery, immersive atmosphere, and non-linear approach to adventure, Sutemi's new release might prove to be a real sleeper hit for those who like their horror a little on the cerebral side. Definitely worth battering down the brain hatches for, at any rate.

Note: This Cloud Version of Resident Evil: Village was tested on 100MB UW Broadband over WiFi along with 5G mobile connection.

The Resident Evil series has seen its ups and downs over the years. After a strong start with the original trilogy (and Code Veronica), Capcom’s seminal horror franchise hit what many would argue to be its peak with the incredible Resident Evil 4, first launched on GameCube back in 2004. After some questionable decisions over the following years that eventually led to a remarkable revival with Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, Capcom decided to lean on the success of Resident Evil 4 for its latest mainline entry: Resident Evil: Village.

If you asked a member of the Platinum marketing team, they'd probably tell you that Bayonetta 3 as a standalone story that you can dive into. But if you asked Platinum dev and executive Hideki Kamiya, he'd urge you to play the initial two games first. The latter is mostly true: if you can play the first two, you'll get a lot out of it. If you play Bayonetta 3 first you'll mostly be fine, but there are bits and pieces from the original two games that will greatly benefit your enjoyment of the story, and certain character interactions.
Minor vague spoilers below in terms of themes, but nothing specific

Bayonetta 1 Switch shortages for the newly minted physical editions are sadly plaguing the UK and some regions in Europe, thanks to an exclusive rollout on the My Nintendo Store.
Here's the full statement from Nintendo, on Twitter, issued today:
"We apologize that we could not meet demand for the physical edition of the first Bayonetta game recently. We will restock the physical edition of the first Bayonetta game once more later this year, on [the] My Nintendo Store."

The tweet then goes on to provide a link for update registration here.
Meanwhile, in the US, Bayonetta 1 has been available at several retailers, and is readily in stock at the time of writing at Best Buy. It actually went up for sale weeks ago (I got my copy a while back), and is holding stock. So the "limited quantities" Nintendo spoke of in the past seem to be region-based.
Outside of the regional Bayonetta 1 Switch shortages, this isn't the first hectic rodeo from a My Nintendo Store rollout. Xenoblade 3 was rife with access problems, with virtual queues that didn't work, or crashed randomly. Ideally Nintendo will stop doing exclusives like this in any region, as the demand clearly exceeds whatever Nintendo has in mind in terms of a sustainable approach to taking pre-orders.
In the meantime, if you really want it and don't want to wait on a mystery restock window (or potentially deal with a broken website again), importing from the US could be an option. Secondhand markets aren't selling it at obscene prices just yet, and some stores might ship overseas.

It's been a long, long, long time coming, but fight fans finally have a release date for QuByte Interactive's long-awaited two-hander Breakers Collection — The compendium of old-school-cool fighting titles will finally launch January 12 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.
Breakers Collection consists of two cult fighting titles from the halcyon days of the genre's first glory period. Initially developed by Visco Corporation, both Breakers (1996) and its revamped edition, Breakers' Revenge (1998) have been spruced up with a fab collection of modern-day features. These include rollback netcode, crossplay functionality, a Team Battle mode, a deep training mode, player profiles, new character color options, and a fantastic Interactive Replay mode, which gives players the opportunity to relive their losses and experiment to find out what alternate paths could have been taken.

Initially announced way back in 2019, it would seem that a simple rerelease of two '90s fighters should not have taken this long to reach fruition. However, it is clear that developer QuByte has gone all out to deliver an excellent package for these cult classics, ensuring that the ever-faithful Breakers community (and yes, it does exist) will receive the perfect product to allow them to take these funky fighters into the next generation and beyond.
My girl Rila has has been benched for far too long, and those nails of hers are ready for action.
Breakers Collection launches January 12 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. Physical editions are available to pre-order now exclusively at Strictly Limited Games. Finally, an open beta will take place on Steam the weekend of November 4, so be sure to mark your calendars.

It's been a pretty big year for Sonic the Hedgehog. From the commercial success of his second movie back in April to the impending release of the much-anticipated Sonic Frontiers in November and the new Sonic Prime Netflix series in December, it is getting pretty difficult to miss SEGA's speedy lil spike ball.
According to the company's latest annual report, it is clear that Sonic's popularity isn't slowing down. The figures contained within the report detail the lifetime sales for all of the company's assets (original and acquired) including the likes of Puyo Puyo, Football Manager and Persona. It is Sonic, however, that stands blue head and shoulders above the rest, with the franchise having sold a total of 1.51 billion units (game sales and downloads across paid and free-to-play titles) since its conception back in 1991.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stress Level Zero's Boneworks was Half-life: Alyx before Half-Life: Alyx released. Released in December 2019, its combination of deeply tactile interactions with a campaign heavily inspired by Half-Life 2 represented a major step forward for VR experiences at the time. It had a fair few rough edges, and you needed a cast-iron stomach to play it, but for about four months it was the ambitious, all-encompassing VR experience that the medium had hitherto lacked.
Then Half-Life: Alyx came around, raising the (crow)bar so high that you'd need to be Mr Fantastic or some sort of bird with hands to reach it. Which is partly why Bonelab, the newly released sequel to Boneworks, hasn't quite gelled with me in the way its older sibling did. Technologically, its still very impressive, and noodling around with its massive interactive potential remains undeniably fun. But it often feels like a lot of good ideas with too little connective tissue between them. It's also even less compromising on your physiology than Boneworks was, seemingly determined to make existing in VR as uncomfortable as possible.

A colossal T-Rex-esque machine with powerful legs, twisted metal horns, and artillery cannons strapped to its back, it loomed larger than any other enemy I'd seen so far in the game. My first thought as I crouched behind a nearby rock and surveyed its chromium splendour was: "I am definitely not yet ready to fight this thing."
My second thought came quickly after the first, when my cover was blown by a nearby Watcher that immediately reared back and emitted a shrill noise that alerted the Thunderjaw to my presence. "Oh shite. Here we go."

Another Splatoon 3 bug has crept up on the team, as version 1.2.0 (which just came out) caused an issue with Rainmaker mode: found in the Anarchy Battle (ranked) playlist.
Here's the full tweet from Nintendo:
"A bug has been found in the Ver.1.2.0 update of #Splatoon3 that affects the Rainmaker Anarchy Battle mode. We will release an update soon to fix this issue. In the meantime, Rainmaker has been temporarily removed from Anarchy Battle. We apologize for the inconvenience."

So in short, as described by reliable dataminer OatmealDome, the actual bug involves a score counter reset if you touch a checkpoint. That's...instant-shutdown worthy for a competitive mode. Funnily enough I've seen some chatter in my circles that some folks seem to like it: as they didn't enjoy Rainmaker anyway, and are enjoying it being out of the rotation.
While I'm still really enjoying Splatoon 3, it's been hit by multiplayer bugs since launch, including connection issues. That last patch had roughly 100 fixes, so it was bound to mess up something else. It's the Bethesda open world RPG patch effect! That's pretty much how every major Fallout 76 patch played out in the early days, with a minor patch afterward to smooth things out.
[Update: As of October 28, Nintendo has implemented patch 1.2.1, which fixes the Rainmaker problems stated above. The mode is now back in the rotation.]

After a year of waiting and months of delays, Bayonetta did get a physical release on Switch earlier this week. Not that many people will have been able to get their hands on a copy of course, as the out-of-the-blue drop sold out almost instantly.
Fortunately, Nintendo has confirmed that it plans to perform a physical restock of the game "later this year," with fans now able to register their interest in the title rather than the slap-dash approach that we saw on the company's first attempt.

The times I've been most scared playing a game are when I don't expect to be scared. And what better way to lull myself into a false sense of security this Halloween than to play an otherwise not-so-scary game, with just one particularly horror-esque moment?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Captain Price is Right
As inevitable as death, taxes, or Hamster's Arcade Archives release, Activision's newest entry to the Call of Duty franchise, Modern Warfare 2, is enjoying an incredible launch  In fact, the Steam edition of the billion-dollar head-popper has already broken the series record for concurrent players on its first day.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, available today on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms is currently entertaining an amazing 192,524 players as of this writing. While this number, in itself, is already the highest number of concurrent CoD Steam players to date, this isn't even the peak, as MW2 already hit a pretty nutso high of 238,522 players during its first hour of launch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeVapCrI1pY
That's a stunning 100,000+ players more than the previous record, which has been held by the original Call of Duty: Black Ops multiplayer since 2010. Once North America wakes up and has its first cup of Joe, it will be interesting to see if this peak number can be smashed even further. Of course, this Steam count represents only one faction of the CoD playerbase, with many choosing to play on PlayStation, Xbox, or Activision Blizzard's own Battle.net app.
The success of the newest Call of Duty title has been something of an annual inevitability, with even "lesser" entries such as last year's Call of Duty: Vanguard still pulling in sales numbers and player figures that most games can only dream of. And it seems, some 18 years from the series' initial inception — and despite perpetual complaints that the series has "peaked" — Call of Duty will remain one of video gaming's most lucrative and fiscally reliable franchises.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is available now on PlayStation, PC (Steam/Battle.net), and Xbox.

The latest deep dive trailer details the game’s magical parkour abilities that you’ll be using to get across the fantasy realm of Athia. Forspoken’s flashy, stamina-based movement is by far the most distinctive thing about it in my eyes, so let's take a look at Frey's parkour abilities below.

I'm a big Dark Pictures fan, but had some reservations about this latest outing due to its subject matter, which this time around draws more inspiration from real-life serial killers than supernatural legends. Still, by the end of my 90 minutes or so with the game, my feelings had evolved considerably, and I'm happy to say I'm now way more excited for it than I was. In fact, I think this could easily end up as the best Dark Pictures game yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's live now, following the Gilgamesh DLC
Stranger of Paradise transmog is now a thing, thanks to a new update for the game, which also ushers in the second DLC: Gilgamesh.
Titled The Wanderer of The Rift, the DLC launched on October 26, and beyond the actual content it comes with, we got a new title update. One of the big features includes transmog, or as the official Twitter account calls it, "cosmetic changes."
In short, like many modern games (especially MMOs, but also titles like Assassin's Creed: Odyssey or Monster Hunter Rise), you can customize your look to your liking, without missing out on stat bonuses from individual pieces of armor. The DLC itself adds Gilgamesh, the blue mage job, rift labyrinths (randomly generated dungeons), the dimension bringer ability, Gilgamesh difficulty, summon blessings (which are acquired through the Tonberry blacksmith), monster bells (call monsters into battle), and chaotic monsters (super-powerful versions of enemies). So, a lot!
I already dug the game at launch, but Team Ninja and Square Enix have added quite a bit of support over the past few months: addressing fan complaints while adding new content in the form of DLC. Overall, a "Complete Edition" should age very well for hardcore action fans, especially given the "challenge" aspect of the DLCs.
If you want to read more about how the team incorporated feedback into their post-launch design perspective, we have a full interview with key members of the team here.

Silver Tempest stars Alolan Vulpix on the key art, but monsters like Lugia, Serperior, Ho-Oh, and Mawile share the spotlight. Meanwhile, players can expect cards starring Regieleki and Regidrago.
The Pokémon Company sent us several booster packs so we could open them and see what we pull. While it may just be dumb luck, I feel like this expansion gave me better pulls than any others in recent memory. As I cracked these open, I was met with several attractive full-art cards, as well as some gorgeous Trainer Gallery cards. I even managed to pull two of the three new Radiant Pokémon cards. 
This expansion adds over 190 cards to the ever-growing library of Pokémon cards. That number includes 6 Pokémon VSTAR cards, 15 Pokémon V cards, 1 Pokémon VMAX card, 30 special art Trainer Gallery cards, and more than 15 Trainer cards. You can see my favorite pulls from this expansion below.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword and Shield – Silver Tempest launches on November 11. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A great game to play elsewhere.

Note: This Cloud Version of A Plague Tale: Requiem was tested on 450Mb AT&T Broadband over WIFI, with the router directly adjacent to the Switch dock.

On paper, it sounds like offering a ‘cloud version’ of a game is a good idea. The Switch’s hardware was relatively underpowered when it was new, so getting more graphically intensive releases like A Plague Tale: Requiem to run on it in an acceptable state only becomes more difficult with each passing year. Cloud streaming could get around this, but it only makes sense if the cloud tech and the machines actually running the game server-side are up to the task. Unfortunately, this otherwise excellent game is marred on Switch by technical issues, making it a tough one to recommend.

"We've held price on our console, we've held price on games and our subscription. I don't think we'll be able to do that forever," Spencer admits. "I do think at some point we'll have to raise some prices on certain things." He was quick to point out, though, that these changes wouldn't come into effect this holiday season, as Microsoft wants to "maintain the prices that we have."

Publisher Marvelous Games has revealed a brand new overview trailer for its upcoming farming remake Story of Season: A Wonderful Life.
The trailer itself is currently only available in Japanese (update: now in English!), but based on the footage showcased, we've got a pretty solid idea of what's being demonstrated here. We get a good look at character creation, seasonal changes, relationships, parenthood, and of course, lots of farming.

We are now but a few short weeks away from the official launch of Tactics Ogre: Reborn on 11th November, 2022, and Square Enix is making one last push to ensure that our excitement is kept at a tip-top level.
The studio has released the game's 'Final Trailer' (we expect to see another on launch day, but that's besides the point) on YouTube today, detailing a whole lot of gameplay footage and more cor blimey British accents than you'd find in an am-dram performance of Oliver Twist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heading for Tony Stark levels of wealth?
Free-to-play mobile card game Marvel Snap has already gotten off to a smashing start, having raked in a staggering $2 million USD in revenue since its launch just one week ago. Available on PC and mobile platforms, the card combat title has already been downloaded by some 5.3 million players.
Marvel Snap is a strategic card battler that focuses on the heroes and villains of the legendary comic-book universe. Players engage in battles, single-player challenges, and objective-based modes with their chosen hand of heroes, set against the backdrop of famous locales from the Marvel universe. Part of the title's attraction is in slick visual style and library of quality Marvel artwork, as well as its speedy gameplay — The average battle takes around three-to-four minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNuq6E3enZQ
The data, which was compiled by AppMagic and reported by mobilegamer.biz, shows that the United States has, unsurprisingly, been the most popular territory for downloads, counting for some 1.3 million players and $1.2 million in revenue. Marvel Snap's second territory of popularity is Brazil, with 433,000 players, and then Italy, with 342,000. The iOS version of the title has the lion's share of the player base.
This is rad and all, but shout me when Jessica Drew shows up.
Marvel Snap is available now on PC, iOS, and Android platforms. You can check out CJ Andriessen's thoughts on the title right here. Additionally, to help you get started, check out our own Eric van Allen's beginner tips right here. I haven't personally played either of them yet, (I feel bad when I beat people), but I'm sure that they know what they're talking about.

If you’ve ever wanted to harness the power of industrialisation, Factorio is certainly the game for you. Stranded on a strange alien world, you must find a way to survive and escape this place using the vestiges of technology left behind by whoever came here first, as well as your own innovations. This is a factory sim with a sci-fi aesthetic and just a touch of exploration mixed in. What starts off simple builds into one of the most engrossing management sims we've played.
It has been more than two years since Factorio first landed on the PC and the Switch version offers a very similar experience to the original. There are lots of different machines to build, outputs to consider, and always the danger of deadly aliens to keep you on your toes. It is one of the best balancing acts we’ve come across in the management sim genre, though there are some issues around how the port plays on Nintendo’s console.

The newest mainline Call of Duty game, Modern Warfare II, is out tomorrow, and fans are beyond excited to get into the game. There's a lot to try out with the new multiplayer maps and the single-player campaign, plus the revamped battle royale mode that's coming out in November, and as if that wasn't enough, Activision already announced the game's first DLC. It's called the Endowment Protector pack, and it's already available for purchase at the in-game store.
All of the proceeds from the Modern Warfare II DLC will go to Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty Endowment, the company's very own charity that assists military veterans in the US and UK in finding new jobs after they return from service. The pack will run players $10, with proceeds from the sales going directly to the Call of Duty Endowment up to $4 million. The most notable items in the pack include a skin called "The Protector" for Operator Hutch, along with blueprints for the Protector's Companion rifle and the Duty Calls sniper rifle. The rest of the items are as follows:
"Frontline Stripes" Vehicle Skin
"Tagged" Weapon Charm
"Ready for Anything" Animated Calling Card
"Mermen" Calling Card
"Seeing Double" Static Animated Emblem
One Double XP Token, One Double Weapon XP Token

As another special perk for those who serve, Activision has also partnered with USAA to give the Protector Pack away completely free to current and former members of the military in the US. The Call of Duty series relies entirely on the stories and real-life actions of military members (like pulling from real-life battles, for example), so it seems only fitting that they would give some of their massive profits back to those who inspired the games in the first place. I would love to see Activision do even more to support vets in the future, but for now, this is a good enough place to start.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new interface is coming to the PC-TV setup
Valve is planning to update its Big Picture viewing mode with the new interface it designed for the Steam Deck. The Steam manufacturer has the new user interface on the beta right now.
This update was announced a while ago, but it looks like it could be rolling out soon. Already, the feature is available in the Steam client through its beta options.
As detailed in a news post, you just need to opt into the Steam Client beta. Then, head over to the properties and add the "-gamepadui" launch parameter. There's also a forum open for feedback.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvokyBOYe8Y
Big Picture is Valve's special set-up for users who want a Steam UI that's more conducive to a TV set-up. And since that often entails a gamepad in hand, the Steam Deck UI does seem like a good fit.
The updated Big Picture mode now includes a new Home Screen, a Universal Search, and optimized Steam Store for controller navigation.
A new configurator should make it easier for adjusting and creating custom controller configurations. And updated game overlay, system menu, and quick access menu should hopefully make jaunting around Steam's interfaces easier.
A new lens
I've been spending more and more time using my Steam Deck, and have also used the old Steam Big Picture UI a fair bit, and have to say: this all feels like a good upgrade.
The user interface certainly isn't the sole reason that Steam Decks are becoming pretty darn popular, but the general experience on them is solid. I've had little trouble navigating its menus or finding what I need to.
So for those who play PC on the TV or still have a Steam Link stashed away somewhere, this is nice to see. The beta is currently live to opt into and test out for yourself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This narrative adventure arrives before the year's out
Somerville has locked in a launch date, and it's surprisingly soon. The sci-fi adventure is set to hit on November 15, for Xbox consoles and PC.
Developer Jumpship dropped the release date in a new trailer today, confirming its November launch. Somerville is set to arrive on both Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, and is also coming to Xbox Game Pass.
This narrative thriller follows a family caught up in the immediate repercussions of an extraterrestrial conflict. As explosions and mysterious visitors descend, it looks like the player will be trying to keep their family whole as they escape.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb0jh956VVU
We've been seeing teasers for Somerville for quite a while now. The IP is created by Chris Olsen and built in collaboration with former Playdead CEO and co-founder Dino Patti.
So yes, it has some of that Inside energy. Both side-scrolling action and tense sequences look to be in store here.
Out of this world
It's a bit of a surprise, to suddenly see a date on Somerville. But it's a very welcome one. Somerville has looked pretty striking in its appearances over the years at various showcases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcjnHHxHV3o
This also bolsters out the Game Pass library, which is pretty nice. While I like being able to access just about every Halo and Fallout under the sun, the bonus of Game Pass has been seeing projects like these get a solid bump. Immortality and Signalis both hit the service at launch, and Obsidian's upcoming historical RPG adventure Pentiment is also currently set for November.
November is looking like a good time to settle it for a weekend in Somerville.

While it's clear that the game won't be for those with a weak stomach, some players won't even be able to try it for themselves, because The Callisto Protocol's release in Japan has been entirely canceled.
According to developer Striking Distance, the cancellation came following a dispute with the Japanese ratings board.

Although the set of three Splatoon 3 amiibo haven't actually come out yet, we're going back to Splatoon 2 this week in some form or another with a Splatoon 2 amiibo restock.
We knew this was coming, but as amiibo News points out, the figure trio are back today online, but several retailers are sold out of various stock: meaning, if you wanted to pick these up at some point, now isn't a bad time. Amazon, Best Buy, and Gamestop have units in stock, but it's not guaranteed any one of them will be in.
At the moment of publication, here is what seems to be available for the Splatoon 2 amiibo wave:
Amazon has the Inkling Boy (Green) and Inkling Squid (Purple) for slightly over MSRP
Best Buy has Inkling Boy (Green) fully in stock at MSRP
GameStop is currently out of stock, but may get more in
Here's what the amiibo situation looks like going forward (2022-2023):
Splatoon Inkling (Yellow)
Octoling (Blue)
Smallfry
Sephiroth
Pyra/Mythra
Kazuya
Sora (still needs full confirmation)
As always, you can check out when those were released here in our master amiibo list, which has been updated since 2014.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m extremely picky with my mobile games. Since its launch in 2019, Apple Arcade has spoiled me so thoroughly with its beautifully crafted, ad-free experience that it’s hard to go back to anything else. To my surprise, this month saw the release of a game that fits both of these criteria: Marvel Snap. I downloaded it a few days ago and haven’t put it down since.
Marvel Snap is a free-to-play deck-builder with very short matches (usually only three to four minutes). As you play, you collect cards adorned with Marvel characters, each with a unique ability. Characters range from mainstream heroes like Hulk and Iron Man to ones I’ve never even heard of, like Ka-Zar or Blue Marvel. At only 12 cards, decks are relatively small, so every character counts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remakes tend to be more exciting than remasters because the improvements often go beyond mere bumps in resolution or framerate. At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window.

We still have a few months left in the year, but I think it's fair to say that Cult of the Lamb is one of the most memorable games to come out of 2022. It's got the perfect balance of roguelike hack-and-slash action and engaging community sim mechanics, all wrapped up in an adorably twisted art style. I can't speak for anyone else, but I honestly think Cult of the Lamb should be up as a Game of the Year contender, because it managed to blend some of our favorite gameplay mechanics to make one of the most unique titles we've seen in a while. If you haven't gotten around to playing it yet, or you're just a megafan, then you're in luck -- pre-orders for physical copies Cult of the Lamb are now available for pre-order for PS5 and Nintendo Switch.

Tiny Roar describes the game as a "soothing and zany building and exploration game where you place tiles to expand your world with small adventures and big surprises for your characters to uncover." Using these tiles, you can create a "unique story-multiverse" at your own pace. If you want to play fast and loose, you can; if you want to play it strategically, laying out every tile in such a way that your story plan goes off flawlessly, you can do that too, it seems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deadpool and Venom are among them
It's a 2K game, so of course the Midnight Suns season pass is a thing. Announced this week via the below trailer (presented by Deadpool), it'll bring more characters into the fray.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blw2Q0YZI_E
Here's what we have so far for the Midnight Suns season pass:
DLC Content Pack 1 - Deadpool - A foulmouthed mercenary with a heart of gold, Deadpool has a penchant for grisly violence and lighthearted, fourth-wall breaking wisecracks.
DLC Content Pack 2 - Venom - Spider-Man’s nemesis and one of the main game’s bosses, Venom turns playable hero in DLC #2, armed with all of the same symbiote attacks that once threatened the lives of the Midnight Suns.
DLC Content Pack 3 - Morbius - One of the original comic book Midnight Sons, Morbius is an accomplished biochemist who, in an attempt to cure his own rare blood disease, turned himself into a living vampire.
DLC Content Pack 4 - Storm - A powerful member of the X-Men, Storm has the ability to generate and manipulate wind, lightning, rain, and other types of weather to her will.
Yes, Deadpool makes a "Morbin' Time" joke in the video.
According to 2K, the pass will also be sprinkled with additional content beyond the characters; like more levels and items. Midnight Suns is still slated for a December 2 release on PC, PS4, PS5, and Series X/S. The Switch version and prior generations are allegedly coming later, though there's no date in sight, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were canceled.
As one of the last big games of 2022 , I think I speak for strategy and Marvel enthusiasts alike when I say that I hope this one is worth it. With Firaxis at the helm it's really hard to go wrong, but putting big characters like this behind a season pass doesn't inspire confidence.

Remember that Sonic Prime Netflix TV show project? Well, it's right around the corner, as we finally have the release date thanks to an IGN announcement. It'll debut on December 15, 2022, which lines up with a prior report from a producer for the game series, who likely let the release window slip.
Further tweets showed off character posters for the Sonic Prime Netflix show, which include:
Sonic
Tails
Knuckles
Amy
Eggman
Big the Cat (and Froggy)
Shadow
Rouge
As someone on Twitter pointed out, the Sonic/main poster actually showcases a weird take on Amy: a potential multiversal roboticized version (just take a look at the crystal shard on Sonic's head). It's been a lonely time on the Sonic TV front, as the mostly well-received and canceled-too-soon-after-it-found-its-footing Sonic Boom has been gone for years now. Hopefully Prime will not only deliver, but keep going for more than a season.
Through good and bad adaptations, it's weird to me whenever there isn't a Sonic TV show of some sort around. As with anything with this series, in any medium, it really could go either way. I dig these character posters, but so far the footage hasn't really convinced me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paranormal Tales is an upcoming indie horror game with a unique perspective twist. Players experience the first-person adventure through the lens of a body camera to provide a more realistic, claustrophobic trek into its terrifying world. 
The game, created by two designers, draws inspiration from found footage films. The name shares the same initials as P.T., which I can’t imagine is coincidental. Players explore a series of video files as they control a person searching for their lost dog, Teddy. Expect to encounter some very creepy phenomena, and the realistic graphics (rendered in Unreal Engine 5) aim to sell the bodycam perspective effectively. Check out the trailer below if you're looking to raise a few hairs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It mostly deals with Naive Angel Mode and leaderboards
A Bayonetta 3 patch has been released, just in time for the game's launch on Friday. The good news? It's short and sweet.
So the first bit involves "Naive Angel Mode," which, in the words of Platinum themselves, "lowers the amount of violence and sexual content." Apparently the day one patch will apply this optional mode to "more scenes," and it can be enabled immediately when starting the game (rather than on the chapter menu after the intro).
Also, the leaderboard/high score functionality is now properly applied before launch. There are numerous ways to upload your score: right after clearing a chapter and pressing "+," or selecting a chapter manually on the chapter menu hub, selecting play history, and pressing "+" after the fact.
Other than that, there's a generic "game balance and other adjustments" note, which could mean anything. You can find the patch notes below, courtesy of Nintendo Everything.

2021's Blue Fire, a rather brilliant 3D platformer that mixes up sword-based combat with challenging platforming, is getting yet another free DLC expansion on 1st November, following last year's 'Void of Sorrows'.
'Void Maker' introduced some pretty grotesque stuff, such as levels filled with eyeballs and tons of deadly traps. There are 24 fiendish stages to make your way through, built by both developer Robi Studios and community members. And you'll be able to make your own levels, too!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who needs Bimmy & Jimmy?
WayForward has released an eye-bruising new trailer for its upcoming sequel River City Girls 2, which is currently waiting in the wings for its inevitable launch on PC and consoles — The new video allows Kyoko and Misako to take a moment out of the spotlight, instead focusing on one of the duo's new sister-in-arms, the mighty Marian!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oIrSsN-MSE
You might remember the sexy slugger from her turn in the classic arcade brawler Double Dragon, where Marian played the unenviable role of the Damsel in Distress. Bored of waiting for brothers Billy & Jimmy Lee to get the job done, Marian focused on honing her body, mind, and fighting abilities to ensure that if there was any future beatdowns to be dished out, she would be the one doin' the dishin'.
Marian appeared in the original River City Girls as one of a number of cameo shopkeepers, but is finally strapping on the gauntlets to take to the street herself. Armed with an array of ground and pound grapples and haymaker strikes, this former abductee turned MMA monster is ready to help Kyoko, Misako, and her other allies in another adventure, (or should that be "ABventure. God...DAMN), against the ruthless Sabu crime family.
If our heroes weren't tough enough before, then shit just got a whole lot tougher.
River City Girls 2 will launch later this year on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. Be sure to check out our previous write-ups on both River City Girls and River City Girls Zero, as well as our interviews with director Adam Tierney, and awesome composer Megan McDuffee.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soft touch.
Following the excellent Star Hunter DX, Raging Blasters, and Crimzon Clover - World EXplosion from Steam to the Switch eShop is Banana Bytes’ Sophstar, a vertically oriented bullet hell shoot-em-up with clearly delineated sprites set against simplistic rolling backgrounds. There are a whopping nine ships to choose from, all with different behaviours, pros, and cons, meaning it takes time and effort to figure out what works for you. Some have disappointing spread shots but killer secondary weapons, while others have access to a teleport that’s like playing Russian Roulette.
Each ship’s base features are fairly eccentric, too. You have several different speeds, moderated by two different firing modes and the 'L' and 'ZL' triggers, which slow you down to a crawl if desired. Teleports work on a quick recharge basis and can be used to get out of clinches, but you need a moment to prep it before you can use it, and this timing requires expert precision and knowledge in later stages. All said and done, the effort involved in finding your comfort zone will either be alluring or excessive, depending on your sensibilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I pity anyone who has to review, or god help them, write a guide for Terra Invicta, because doing it even semi-comprehensively would take longer than I expect to live.
This is a hugely ambitious game, covering something I've never seen before, with a scope that makes Europa Universalis seem limited. It is a complicated, huge, and ponderous alien invasion simulator that constantly threatens to drop the other boot on you the entire time. Anything you do could be the butterfly whose little wingflaps eventually result in the obliteration of the planet. It is not a game to be powered through, but to be played and contemplated exclusively for a solid month.
That is its central weakness. But I think it had to be this way. Its commitment to an idea is demanding, but if you can tolerate some issues with clarity and presentation, the payoff for meeting it is utterly unique.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Callisto Protocol's Japanese version has been canceled due to the game's violent content and the rating it received in Japan, or lack thereof, as a result. 
This news comes from The Callisto Protocol's Japanese Twitter account, which reveals that the game could not achieve an age rating with CERO (which is Japan's equivalent to the United States' ESRB rating). As a result, it cannot be allowed to release as is in the country. Here's what the studio had to say, as translated by Eurogamer. 


"The Callisto Protocol has decided to stop the release of the Japanese version. As of now, the CERO rating cannot be passed. We have decided that we would no longer be able to provide you with the experience you need. We hope everyone in Japan will understand. If you have already preordered, we will refund you."

October 26, 2022
As you can see, The Callisto Protocol will not be releasing in Japan as it seems Striking Distance does not want to change or edit the content of its game to fall more in line with CERO ratings. Given how terrifying Japanese horror can be, it seems The Callisto Protocol is cooking up something scary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New trailer showcases each character.
You would be forgiven for forgetting about Curse of the Sea Rats. The self-proclaimed 'Ratoidvania' - a pun which, despite our best efforts, we cannot endorse - had a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign back in 2020 and was quickly confirmed for a 2021 release. Obviously, this release date was not met, but it looks like the rat is back as a new trailer provides a closer look at the game's four playable characters and re-sets the release date to 2023.
This new trailer (found above) gives us a fresh look at the game's 'Ratoidvania' (nope, it's not sticking) layout, as you will play as one of four characters - David Douglas, Buffalo Calf, Bussa or Akane Yamakawa - battling through a labyrinth filled with enemies in an attempt to return to your human form. There is a slight dissonance going on here between the 2D hand-drawn characters and the 3D environments that doesn't quite sit with us at the moment. Then again, this is a game about people getting turned into rats so it would make sense if the world isn't quite as it seems.

Earlier this afternoon, a report surfaced online suggesting that EA GmbH was planning to cease physical distribution of its games across Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Scandinavia due to the market's increasing shift to digital downloads and the subsequent impact on sales development. However, a short time later, a spokesperson from EA stated that this information was incorrect and that physical copies will still be available to purchase in all areas.
The original story, shared by video game industry analyst @MauroNL3 on Twitter, suggested that the company was to undergo an 'economic restructure' in which it would move away from the production of physical copies of its games such as FIFA and Battlefield and focus solely on the development of digital resources.

However, snapping at its heels is this week's highest-charting newcomer — Persona 5 Royal. The Switch version of Atlus' mammoth RPG sold 45,998 copies in the week of 17th October to 23rd October, while the PS5 version sold just over 5,000 units.

We've already seen quite a bit about Broken Moon, the brand new map being added with Season 15 - but now Respawn has finally released more details about the new Legend, Catalyst, and the Ferrofluid-powered abilities she brings to the Apex Games.
It turns out that part of Catalyst's diverse skillset is an Ultimate ability that may at last provide some serious counterplay to the ever-present scan meta dominated by recon Legends such as Bloodhound and Seer. Take a look at Catalyst's abilities in the new Season 15 vignette trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Green(ish) Light
Microsoft has released its financial details for the first quarter of its fiscal year — While the statistics are something of a mixed bag, it has been a significant, positive season for the Xbox brand, with strong hardware sales leading to an overall revenue increase of around 11% year-on-year.
The continuing economic slump has been tough on Microsoft, which has seen a decline in many of its sectors. Revenue for operating software Windows dropped by a mighty 15%, while Xbox game sales were also down by a much more manageable 3%. The drop in game sales is likely due to the worldwide cost of living crisis, as well as an increased interest in subscription service Xbox Game Pass. Thus, even if Xbox game sales are down, there is something to be said for Game Pass' growth.

More positive news came in the form of the publisher's Intelligent Cloud server division, which saw a stellar year-on-year revenue increase of 20%. As previously mentioned, much of Xbox's decline was offset by the growing sales of Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles. The sales of Xbox hardware and engagement with the Xbox Game Pass service — now boasting over 20 million subscribers — will clearly look to carry to load as Microsoft pushes through this continued downswing in customer spending.
Of course, the more negative elements of the report are hardly about to bankrupt the company. Microsoft's overall revenue for the period still totals somewhere in the region of $50 billion USD, while its net income, even with a huge 14% drop, still saw the company pull in around $17.6 billion. MS is not going to be scratching for change anytime soon.
It should also be noted that the publisher recently laid off hundreds of employees across its entire workforce. Additionally, MS remains adamant in seeking approval for its $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia isn't a terribly long game, but it has spent much longer occupying my thoughts. Any time in the past couple of weeks that my friends and colleagues thought they were talking to me, they were in fact talking to an exquisite Italian neon-folk horror game wearing my skin and looking out of the eye-holes in my skull. On at least one occasion I lay in bed at 3am, sweaty and frozen in half-asleep fear, because I thought I'd heard a strange rattling noise...
In fact it was not stillness, but the panic-sprint into darkness that became my main and oft-unsuccessful tactic whenever I heard the creature of Gravoi. Gravoi itself is a small but inconveniently maze-like fictional Sardinian town, host to a yearly folk festival that, every so often, involves the unwary being carried off and killed by a... something. Unfortunately, four very unwary outsiders - rendered outsiders for a variety of reasons, whether they're locals or not - find themselves having to survive the night of this festival, armed with things like matches, firecrackers and a polaroid camera.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somerville, the mysterious sci-fi adventure game, finally has a release date and it’s only a few weeks away. The game arrives on November 15. 
The experience comes from Jumpship, a studio founded by Dino Patti, former CEO of Limbo and Inside developer Playdead. That shared DNA is evident in Somerville’s somber, surreal atmosphere. The game centers on a rural family – a father, mother, and child – whose lives get turned upside down by a cataclysmic event involving extraterrestrial visitors. The journey unfolds as a side-scrolling adventure game where the family must survive this apocalypse as it rips through small towns and beyond. You can watch the most recent trailer below.


Somerville was first unveiled during E3 2021 and most recently popped up during last December's Game Awards. The game will be available on Xbox consoles (including Game Pass) and PC.]]></summary>

Somehow, we managed a mental cleanse between horrendous downpours that knocked us sideways and made our socks all soggy. And while we cocooned ourselves in metal and waited for these bouts of terrible weather to subside, we played disgusting amounts of Assassin's Creed: Valhalla.
Over the course of a couple of weeks, we racked up a solid 60+ hours of game time. I'd wake up and see my friend clearing map markers. I'd pop out for a quick run (yes, I ran on my holiday like a chump) and return to see both of my friends clearing map markers. Did we enjoy it? Sometimes! But then, why couldn't we stop playing? The Ubisoft Effect, I reckon.

The full Prime Gaming November list is official, and it has Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition front and center. It's an oldie but a goodie, and one people deserve to own forever. If you haven't played it yet, make sure you do it! There isn't much I can say about New Vegas that I haven't said already: it's a classic.
The rest of the lineup is decidedly less hard-hitting, but you might find something in there: Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Facility 47, WRC 9, Etherborn, Whispering Willows, and Last Day of June. Yes, it's that Indiana Jones game, from 1989. It's not the film, and it's not anything recent. I had to do a double take on that one. Wildly, there were three core iterations of game adaptations for Last Crusade: a PC action game, a classic PC adventure title (the Prime Gaming one), and a console platformer.
All of these will be available starting November 1. You can find the full lineup below!
Prime Gaming November 2022 offerings:
Free Games with Prime
Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
Facility 47
WRC 9
Etherborn
Whispering Willows
Last Day of June
New In-Game Content for:
Apex Legends
Dead by Daylight
Fall Guys
FIFA 23
Grand Theft Auto Online
League of Legends
Pokémon Go

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rieko Kodama, the pioneering Sega developer behind titles like Phantasy Star and Skies of Arcadia, has died at 58. 
Nick Thorpe, features editor for Retro Gaming Magazine, noticed that in the credits for Sega's Mega Drive Mini II, there's a message that reads, "In memory of Rieko Kodama." Twitter user Ares Arcadia quote-tweeted Thorpe's tweet to ask Sega producer Yosuke Okunari if this message means that Kodama had died to which Okunari replied and said, "As you understand it. We respected her," confirming her death. 
Sega has since confirmed Kodama's death, citing that she had passed in May, according to IGN. Further details around her death will not be shared out of respect for her family's privacy, Sega says. 
"We pray that the deceased will rest in peace, and we offer our gratitude for her enormous contributions to Sega," Sega of Japan says, as translated by IGN Japan. 
Kodama's journey through game development began in the 1980s when she started as a graphic designer for Master System and Sega Genesis games like Altered Beast and Sonic the Hedgehog. She was the main artist for Phantasy Star and continued to work on the series' visuals team until Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium, which she directed.
Other credits include Mega Drive versions of Sorcerian, Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and more. After directing Phantasy Star IV, she directed Magic Knight Rayearth in 1995 before becoming a producer and development lead on Sega's Skies of Arcadia. She continued to work in games development in some capacity until at least 2018, where she was the lead producer on the Sega compilation title Sega Ages. 
In 2019, she was recognized with the Pioneer Award at GDC 2019. 
The staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Kodama's family.]]></summary>

Some lucky Street Fighter fans got a sneaky treat this week, as the recent Street Fighter 6 Closed Beta miraculously sprang back to life for several hours, before quietly shutting down once again. The beta, which took place on PC and current-gen consoles, officially ended on Monday, October 10.
Earlier this week, however, PS5 players who still had the client installed found that could suddenly re-access a rudimentary version of the trial. Matchmaking wasn't working with any great stability, but the Training Mode was up and running, giving some sneaky petes several more hours to get the tech down with Messrs Ryu, Ken, Guile, Kimberly, Juri, Jamie, Chunners, and Luke.
Word would eventually spread online, and the CapCops came in to hit the big red button.

Meta (formerly Facebook) and Mark Zuckerberg's Metaverse project have been the closest mainstream attempt we've seen, but if that's the best we have, it'll be a while until we see a VR world akin to something out of Ready Player One. The internet has taken the opportunity to roast pretty much everything the Metaverse has shown because, well, it looks ridiculous. Take their most recent announcement about adding legs, for example, which apparently don't even work how they said they do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[38-inch gaming ultrawides are few and far between, and it's particularly rare to find good deals on them - so that's why I was excited to see this Dell Alienware AW3821DW on sale with a code from HUKD. When you use code HUKDAW3821DW, this monitor drops from £1299 to £899, an incredible value for a monitor of this spec. 
Let's quickly run through those specs. This 38-in monitor has a resolution of 3840x1600, essentially a shorter version of 4K, with a 144Hz refresh rate. The monitor is Nvidia G-Sync Ultimate certified, meaning it has a physical G-Sync module to prevent judder and tearing, and it also gets bright enough to earn the lofty DisplayHDR 600 rating. All in all, it's a ton of monitor for a fairly reasonable price.

Marvel Snap recently went into early access on mobile platforms and PC, and it's been creeping its way into every social feed. I've seen players who rarely get hooked on a card game seeking out some Marvel Snap tips, deck advice, or just sharing bizarre board states.
I, too, have been deep in the Snap mines. This isn't my first rodeo, as I've spent a decent chunk of time in games like Hearthstone and Artifact, and dabbled in card games like Magic: The Gathering. Heck, Geralt of Rivia and I dominated Novigrad in Gwent.
With that in mind, I thought I'd provide some helpful tips for players new to the game, or maybe even new to the ideas in Second Dinner's card game.

As familiar as one can get, anyway, with a monster list of 30-plus display and graphics settings, not even counting all the granular DLSS and FSR options for compatible graphics cards. 
After Lord-knows-how-many breachings and clearings of the same damn oil rig, I believe I’ve cracked these options and found the best settings combination to balance nu-MW2’s sharp visuals with smooth, steady performance. The latter can be a big ask of older, weaker PC hardware,  despite some innocuous system requirements, but with the right tweaks it’s easy to get at least a solid 60fps on most modern GPUs and CPUs.

They’re relentless, for one thing, happily chomping their way through anyone who gets in their path. The undead are faceless as well, so you don’t feel too bad about escorting them back to their graves. Yet they can be poignant, dramatic reminders of friends and family that meant a lot to characters too, depending on who the shambling corpse used to be. If I was going to hire any enemy for a game, I’d hire a zombie. Then they’d eat my brain. That’s why I hired them! So to celebrate our very iconic, vitality-challenged friends, I've put together a list of my favourite zombie games.

It wasn't a neck-and-neck, ebb-and-flow struggle between two equal powers. Instead I played RTS games as though they were city-builders, with the added bonus of absolutely steamrolling through the AI when I'd had enough fun.
This was true of basically every RTS I played back then. In Starcraft I'd amass an army of Protoss Carriers and launch them across the map. In Supreme Commander, I'd tech all the way up to the Experimental Weapons, and then send the colossal CZAR Mothership to Independence-Day the entire enemy base. But my favourite variation of this was in Impossible Creatures: a wonderful early noughties strategy game where you create your own units by stitching together parts from different animals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rocksteady Studios co-founders Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker have announced that they are departing from the studio. 
This news comes as a bit of a surprise, both because Hill was the director of the studio's upcoming game, Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, and because both were original founders of the studio and masterminds behind its popular Batman Arkham series. Nonetheless, it seems the two are leaving Rocksteady amicably at the end of the year with confidence in the team they're leaving behind to carry Suicide Squad across the finish line. 
Here is the statement in full: 
- Jamie Walker & Sefton Hill

“Having worked with Jamie and Sefton as one of the founding members of the studio, I want to thank them for creating what I consider to be one of the best games development studios…]]></summary>

The “full-fledged” remake of 2007’s RPG is being developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 and will use the same toolsets that CDPR is creating for their upcoming Witcher trilogy.

In-between all the talking? Lots of slides and presentations and absolutely no hands anywhere near controllers. But finally, finally, I've played a 90-minute PS5 demo of The Callisto Protocol and can confirm that it felt like a last-gen game in a good way: all photorealistic sweat and blood scrawled on walls, coupled with 360-era exploration and fighting. Refreshingly familiar, I'd say.

More specifically, the studio has revealed that Wo Long will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on March 3, 2023. That's less than six months away. Alongside this news, Team Ninja has detailed the editions of Wo Long you can preorder as well as some of the DLC coming to the game.


Let's break those editions down: 
Standard Edition
The physical version of the game will include the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus.
The digital version of the game will include the Zhuque armor as a digital pre-order bonus and the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus. 
Steelbook Launch Edition

After repelling a robot-spamming rival corp across Seasons 1 and 2, your reward in Season 3 – which launches on November 3rd – is to find your mining operating pelted by a meteorite storm. And they’re carrying a nasty payload: Rockpox, a contagion that quickly infects both the caves of Hoxxes IV and the many, many giant bugs living within them. These sickly Glyphids and contaminated caverns will present you and your fellow space dwarves with some new perils, but also new opportunities to turn a management-pleasing profit. And isn’t providing value to shareholders why we’re all here to begin with?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2's campaign may be the best it's been for a long while. There's great variety in the game's first-person shooty bang with plenty of interesting ideas to break the illusion of it being an on-the-rails ride.

For content creation, they're by far the best CPUs AMD has ever produced - but for gaming, there is another option: the Ryzen 7 5800X3D. This CPU remains stunningly fast in some games that can take advantage of its uniquely huge L3 cache, and best of all works with a wide range of inexpensive AM4 motherboards with cheap DDR4 RAM. 
Pound for pound, it's by far the best AMD CPU for gaming on the market - and now it's been reduced to just $329 at Antonline via Ebay. That's a healthy $120 reduction from its US MSRP of $449, and a great price overall given the level of gaming performance it provides.

Bethesda Game Studios announced back in 2020 that it was teaming up with Amazon Studios and Kilter Films to develop a Fallout TV series. Early details revealed that Westworld creators and producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy signed onto the project and are partnering with Fallout 4 director and long-time Bethesda producer Todd Howard to bring the show to life.
Since then, not much else has been released except a 2021 report that details the show as a "gonzo, crazy, funny adventure" and some leaked set photos that reveal some pretty accurate set designs and costumes. However, today, in celebration of Fallout's …]]></summary>

More specifically, Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, the 2019 remaster of the original 1999 Age of Empires II release, is coming to Xbox consoles on January 31, 2023, and it will be followed by an Xbox release of Age of Empires IV later that year. This news came alongside various Age of Empires-related news announced today as part of the series' 25th Anniversary celebrations. 
Check out the announcement video for yourself below: 


That's not all that was revealed today, though. If you're an Age of Empires fiend, check out this video breaking down the history of the series that the Xbox and the Age of Empires team released today: 


Xbox, World's Edge, and Relic Entertainment have also revealed Age of Mythology Retold, a definitive edition of the Age of Empires spin-off series first released in 2002. Check out its reveal trailer below: 


"Age of Mythology Retold is in production," the announcement reads. "We know that the Age of Mythology community has been waiting hopefully for a Definitive Edition, and we'll be delivering. We're working hard to bring you the glory of the original game with updated graphics, features, and more." 
Next up is the reveal that Age of Empires is heading to mobile devices. Not much was revealed, but you can check out the teaser trailer for the game below:

Technically, the main bit of news from tonight's anniversary stream is that both Age Of Empires II: DE and Age Of Empires IV will be arriving on Xbox consoles in 2023 (that, and Age Of Mythology is coming back), but the upshot of all that is that the PC versions will be getting the very same benefits, including controller support, crossplay with consoles and cloud gaming support.

Whenever I load them up, I just can’t help but pause every five seconds for a breather. Multiplayer games are far more manageable, though, and often also turn stifled screams into contagious laughter as your friends terrorise each other.
If you’re a scaredy cat like me and would rather scream at the horrors of your unhinged mates than at unpredictable AIs and scripted jump scares, then you’re in the right spot. Here are five games in which your mates can play as the monster. Some are creepy, some are cute, and none of them will force you to run around alone. If you're looking to get monstrous yourself this Halloween, Liam's done a list all about games that make you the monster. No overlap, promise.

That all changed over the weekend when Umurangi’s composer, ThorHighHeels, posted a YouTube video showcasing three obscure horror games. A short teaser for Origame’s FiveSeven was mysteriously tucked in the middle of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A trailer from the Pokémon Company International has revealed the Greavard, the Ghost Dog Pokémon, just in time for Halloween. You can watch the official reveal below.


On Twitter, the official Pokémon account describes this haunted hound with the following Pokédex-like entry:
That second sentence ties into the first part of this reveal – an animated video posted on the Pokémon YouTube Channel about a trainer searching the Paldea region for ghost-type Pokémon. They eventually stumble upon a Greavard, but mysteriously collapse after playing fetch.
Greavard’s reveal continues a trend in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s marketing campaign where they post animated teasers and reveals of each new monster coming to the games. It started with Grafaiai and has continued all the way up to Bellibolt, a Pokémon revealed less than two weeks ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week I reviewed New Tales From The Borderlands and I really didn't like it. This was upsetting to me; this may come as a surprise, but I try to avoid playing and reviewing games I think I won't like. I don't want to go out of my way to be mean, and I also don't want to spend hours not enjoying myself. I go into almost every game I play actively wanting to enjoy it (the exception being things like Succubus, which I can only assume are trying an avant garde technique to plumb new, unexplored depths of badness on purpose).
As it turned out, a lot of other reviewers did like it. I'm not going to object to that, because it takes all sorts to make a world, and so on. Rather, it made me wonder if I'd sort of hallucinated how much I liked the first Tales From The Borderlands. How fantastic it was, managing to be both the best Telltale game and the best Borderlands game in one, was a big part of why I was so excited for New Tales. It came out a long time ago, and I hadn't played it for a while. Maybe it wasn't how I remembered. Maybe I'd changed, you know?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Adam Isgreen, creative director at World’s Edge, first played the Age Of Empires series, he was still working at Westwood Studios on Command & Conquer. “The first thing I was impressed about more than anything with this series was just like, wow! History! That's really smart," he tells me. "Like, there's no need to explain anything to people. You don't have to be like, oh, there's a laser gun or this is a magic missile. It's like, it's a wheelbarrow. I know what that does!”


To Isgreen, it’s this level of accessibility that’s carried Age Of Empires all the way to today’s 25th anniversary. The instantly legible historical warfare  -  “pikemen, ranged units and cavalry” - paired with randomised maps that promised, effectively, an infinite amount of replayability; “It just had a lot of features that I think players really loved and kind of defined itself along those features in a way that, yeah, it's just outlasted everything else.”

We've received new trailers, details about how campaign progress is tied to the host in co-op, and we've even previewed the game (read here). 
Now, Bethesda and Arkane have released a new "Into The Night" Redfall trailer inviting players to experience a night out on the town to discover all the (bloody) fun that awaits. Spoilers: there's a lot of blood, a lot of vampires, and at least one giant heart that we probably need to destroy. Check out the new Redfall trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Redfall continues to look like good fun. Today's trailer makes me wish this game was coming out this month – it'd be such a great Halloween game – but it's not due out until sometime during the first half of 2023. It will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC, as well as Xbox and PC Game Pass when it's released. For more information, be sure to check out Game Informer's Redfall hub.

By the end of Bayonetta 3's third chapter, it's operating on a scale that dwarfs most video games. Buildings twist and crumble like flimsy plastic, giant craters pock-mark the earth, and mountain-sized creatures level entire cities; the bombastic culmination of an opening three hours that feel like they're running a mile a minute; a never-ending barrage of stimuli.
It's loud, obnoxious, and frankly a bit exhausting. And I was hootin' and hollerin' the entire time. 
The Bayonetta series has always been at its best when you're staring slack-jawed at your TV, repeated…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Activision Blizzard King Workers Alliance have teamed up with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) union to file another charge of unfair labour practices against Activision Blizzard. The filing is in response to a message described as anti-union that was sent by Activision Blizzard’s communications executive, Lulu Meservey, to 18,000 employees last week. The CWA had previously filed a charge of unfair labour practices in September 2021, accusing the company of violating US labour laws and stopping employees from discussing working conditions. Last year’s complaint was closed just a month later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of Overwatch's most popular annual events was Halloween Terror, which brought not only Halloween-inspired skins and rewards to the game's loot box system but a unique PvE experience. 
Halloween Terror has returned, this time to Overwatch 2 and much like the years of experiences before it, this year's event comes with skins, rewards, and a semi-sequel to the first game's Halloween PvE experience, Junkenstein's Revenge. The new PvE mode for Overwatch 2 is now called Junkenstein's Revenge: Wrath of the Bride and you can jump in starting today, October 25.

October 24, 2022
"Return to Adlersbrunn alongside four fresh faces to experience an all-new story as the Bride of Junkenstein seeks vengeance upon those responsible for the death of her creator," a blog post about the limited-time co-op mission reads. "Complete challenges to unlock special rewards like the Nightfall Over Adlersbrunn Name Card, the Jack-o'-Lantern Weapon Charm, Battle Pass XP, and other spine-tingling rewards. Dr. Junkenstein will also be making a grand reappearance in the original Junkenstein's Revenge co-op Brawl, returning for a limited time to Halloween Terror 2022." 
Halloween Terror will run until 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, November 1. If you watch two hours of streams on the Overwatch 2 category on Twitch, you'll receive the Werewolf Winston Spray and if you watch four, you'll receive the Werewolf Winston Legendary Skin (pictured above). 
Alongside this event, Blizzard is also running a Double Match XP weekend for Overwatch 2 starting October 28 and lasting until October 31. All players who login to Overwatch 2 sometime during the Halloween Terror event through the end of Season One will receive the Cursed Captain Reaper Legendary Skin and Health Pack Weapon Charm as well.

Black content creators have been a significant part of The Sims' online presence for years, creating custom content, mods and more.

Today though, with that whole 'impending release of better graphics cards' thing, the 6950 XT is down to $800 at Amazon, which is an awesome deal for the level of graphics performance on offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlatinumGames embodies style, imagination, and risk-taking. Spawned in 2007 by Capcom veterans, including Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami and Devil May Cry and Okami mastermind Hideki Kamiya, the studio became a haven for these minds to create new franchises under the freedom of independence. Early success like MadWorld turned heads, but Platinum’s third title, Bayonetta, cemented it as one of the game industry’s premier action studios.
Launching in Japan in 2009 and hitting U.S. shores in 2010, Bayonetta revamped and, in some ways, improved the stylish action of its spiritual predecessor, Devil May Cry. The bewitching adventure reinvented and reinvigorated the stylish action genre; Platinum created its magnum opus in only two years. Unfortunately, sales didn’t match the reception, and Sega, the game’s original publisher, passed on a sequel. Despite fans’ cries, Bayonetta seemingly ended the series before it could take off.
Nintendo stepped up to answer those pleas by agreeing to publish a follow-up. Bayonetta 2 arrived in 2014 as a Wii U exclusive. The sequel proved Bayonetta wasn’t a one-hit wonder, becoming one of the year’s best games with some fans believing it surpassed its predecessor. The success also proved the family-friendly Nintendo had no problem letting the franchise remain true to its Mature-rated self.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Folks, I’ve got some bad news. Victoria 3 is not a game where you play the clone of the clone of Posh Spice. I was all geared up for some science fiction-tinged Spice Girls shenanigans, but I was left bitterly disappointed. However, I’d already installed it, so I decided to check it out and see what kind of game it actually is. Turns out that Victoria 3 is a grand strategy game, just like its Paradox stablemates Crusader Kings and Hearts of Iron.
Trying to classify Victoria 3 is pretty damn important. Unlike, say, the Total War series, Paradox’s grand strategy titles are differentiated by a lot more than their time periods. Hearts of Iron its WW2 military ticker on its sleeve, while Crusader Kings (my personal fave) is secretly an RPG, just one that happens to cast you as the ruler of a country, rather than a random wandering murderer. Figure that out and you grasped the appeal of the game, especially for people who may lack interest in - or be downright put off by - the historical era it covers.

While I have to admit there's some pretty damning circumstantial evidence there and that not every accusation is exactly unfounded, the game's memetic unpopularity even among people who never played it still feels harsher than is warranted.

I'm not just talking about games that belong to the horror genre, either. In fact, spare those asymmetrical multiplayer games that are all the rage with their worryingly young audiences, there are few actual horror games that let you assume the role of the villain. But that doesn't mean there isn't a deluge of titles where you play as a creature so vile, so menacing, that the residents of their worlds undoubtly view the player as evil incarnate. Far from it. The games on this list may not all be spooky in tone, but your character is still the stuff of actual nightmares.

As for when to expect this update, Bethesda did not reveal a specific date, just that it would be coming sometime in 2023. 
Elsewhere in the 25th Anniversary blog post, Bethesda announced the return of Spooky Scorched, the limited-time Halloween event for Fallout 76. It will run through November 8. There's also a new 25th Anniversary challenge coming to the game. 
"Each day from October 25 to November 8, players can visit the Atomic Shop for a free daily item," the blog post reads. "These free goodies range from handy consumables for your next sojourn through Appalachia to brand-new items, so be sure to check into the Store each day to see what's available." 
Here's a look at the first reward, only available in the Atomic Shop tomorrow, October 25:
You can also complete special challenges during the Fallout 25th Anniversary event in Fallout 76 to unlock even more rewards. Active Prime Gaming subscribers can also claim a special 25th Anniversary Bundle for Fallout 76 starting November 2. You'll have until February 2, 2023, to claim it. In addition to Lunchboxes and Bubblegum, this bundle contains the Vault Boy portrait, Shooting Target Suite, and Lincoln's Repeater Lever Action Skin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright folks, bear with me, because it doesn't look like this one is going to get less messy. As reported by Tech News Space, it appears that Robert Kurvitz, the lead developer and writer on Disco Elysium, is suing Studio ZA/UM, the development studio of Disco Elysium, via his own company Telomer. Kotaku AU seem to have corroborated this, finding a record on the Estonian Ministry of Justice's website showing Telomer has filed an application against ZA/UM Studio to "obtain information and review documents", which you can see for yourself here.
This comes after Martin Luiga announced (in a frankly kinda weird post) the dissolution of The ZA/UM Cultural Association, and that Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere, and art director Aleksander Rostov were no longer working at Studio ZA/UM.

Not because we're die-hard horror buffs - if anything, we're both lifelong wimps when it comes to this stuff. But buoyed by a growing resolve to tackle our collective cowardice head on, October has seen us watch, play and read several of the big horror classics we've been too chicken to attempt in the past. Over the course of it all, though, there's been a gnawing, slightly dreadful realisation slowly bubbling away beneath the surface. Far from being scared by these horrible things, I've often come away feeling no emotions whatsoever. I have remained unmoved, neither frightened, unnerved, or creeped out. Just plain, simple indifference. The Japanese Ring? Nothing. I Saw The Devil? Nah, mate. Lake Mungo? More like Lake Yawngo.
I was beginning to think I'd lost the capacity to feel anything at all. Heck, the real horror show this month has been the collapse of the entire UK nation state, and yet I still cannot bring myself to muster anything beyond a tired sigh. Then I got to the second act of Resident Evil Village's Shadows Of Rose DLC and, oh yes, hello fear. It's been a while, hasn't it?

Former Bayonetta 3 voice actor Hellena Taylor has released a new thread of tweets clarifying some of what she said in regards to Platinum Games' "immoral" compensation offer to return to voice the titular character in the threequel. These tweets follow a report from Bloomberg that refuted Taylor's original claims and added clarification from sources as to how Jennifer Hale, the new Bayonetta voice actor, came about getting the role. They also follow a statement released by Platinum Games that essentially asks the community to support Hale and her statement. 
In Taylor's thread, released October 24, the voice actor says that she feels "the need to defend myself and my reputation in the industry" since "some people are calling me a liar and a golddigger."

Announced during Konami’s Silent Hill Transmission broadcast last week, Silent Hill: Townfall is being developed by No Code, the studio behind the spooky Observation. The trailer was light on details, with a speech about crime and judgement playing over footage from a Pocket Television, but some eagle-eyed - or perhaps eared - fans have uncovered messages hidden in the audio that might give us a hint of what Townfall is all about.

For context, the last time we wrote about a big discount to this model, it was down to £76 - so this is the best deal we've ever seen on the NR200P by some margin!

Pairing asymmetrical multiplayer experts IllFonic with the Ghostbusters license is a match made in the spirit realm. Previous outings Friday the 13th and Predator: Hunting Grounds pit Jason and Predator against camp counselors and mercenaries with flashes of greatness, but technical issues and uneven design choices held them back. With Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, the team has applied everything it’s learned about compelling asymmetrical multiplayer to a property that perfectly lines up with the game…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded video below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, the Uncharted: Legacy Of Thieves Collection came to PC, marking the first time Nathan Drake's Tombraider-but-a-bro adventures have arrived on our fair platform. It is also, err, a collection of the last games in the series. The bundle comprises Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and The Lost Legacy, a standalone Uncharted adventure featuring ladythieves Chloe Frazer and Nadine Ross (they are thieves who are ladies, they don't steal women). Uncharteds 1-3, on the other hand, are nowhere to be seen. In fact, the only way to play them on PC right this second is to buy an expensive PlayStation Plus Premium subscription and stream them via the cloud as part of the Nathan Drake Collection - a far from ideal solution.
This puts us PC lot in a bit of a pickle. Naturally, if you haven't played any of these PlayStation exclusives until now, you're missing three entire games worth of story context. So, is it worth starting with Uncharted 4? The short answer is, "Yes". The long answer is, "Yeeeeeeeeeees - probably".

It's about starting a job in a museum and archive based around a former tobacco plantation, and run by the extremely wealthy descendants of its owners. It's not about what great people they were. It didn't feel like trauma porn, but obviously I can only speak as a ludicrously white person from another country.
What it is definitely good at it is representing real historical research, and who gets to write the history that suits them.

Then you’ve got an in-game manual that’s been pulled apart, with pages strewn around the world to find before you can figure out how to do everything your little fox is capable of. Well, now audio designer Kevin Regamey has explained a whole other secret side to Tunic, and it turns out the game’s soundtrack hides a whole other language.

I've also been picking my way through Gotham City as various members of the bat family, weightlessly punching dudes in alleys before crafting new sticks that hit 2% harder than the one I was using before. Despite a relatively good looking rendition of the iconic gothic metropolis and a pretty engaging story, Gotham Knights ultimately failed to capture my imagination. 


It didn't help that throughout my time with Gotham Knights, I was thinking about the Arkham series. Rocksteady's trio of Batman-em-ups are essential superhero games, titles that redefined the genre and provided a template that still feels contemporary to this day. Aslyum, City and Knight fully immerse you in the Batman fantasy, successfully crafting a depiction of the caped crusader that was deadly, capable and - perhaps best of all - human.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last night, I caught up with a dear old friend the classic way: over a round of Left 4 Dead 2. Valve's cooperative FPS is still a great hangout game after 13 years but while waiting for my pal to log on, I did think I might refresh it by browsing the Steam Workshop and installing some popular mods. Turns out, modders have made lots of anime girls and VTuber avatars to replace friends, enemies, and even guns. What an experience! It is startling to discover that the blue-haired anime approaching you is not a teammate but, in fact, a vomit-filled Boomer.

That’s why I raised an intrigued eyebrow while sipping my seventeenth cup of tea today, after I saw Twitch streamer Luality playing FromSoftware’s latest with just a drawing tablet. Taking on the challenge with admirable confidence, Luality used a virtual keyboard on the tablet’s left side for movement, and bound strokes of the stylus to attack its enormous monsters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a particular battle in the first chapter of Tactics Ogre: Reborn that I've been banging my head against all week. It's an uphill fort siege where you're facing off against an evil necromancer who's shooting down powerful, magical fireballs at you from above, alongside his never-ending army of undead skelly archers. The challenging terrain alone would be a test of anyone's mettle in this tough, turn-based strategy game, especially when trying to parse all the different heights of its grid-based map. But having every enemy unit resurrect themselves after three turns unless you exorcise them with a single-use item or the lone Priest you've just recruited (who you may or may not have neglected to bring into battle with you) on top of all that? That smacks of the kind of late-game tomfoolery that more modern games of this ilk would normally save until their final acts. 
Tactics Ogre: Reborn, on the other hand, likes to make its players sweat early. It was, after all, forged in the fires of the mid-90s SNES era, and looking back at old GameFAQ guides from 2010 (when it was remade for the PSP), it's clear this fight was just as much of a roadblock back in the day as it is now. Think of it as what yer lad Genichiro was to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice - a hard, and often gruelling endurance test of everything you'd learned so far, but one that would ultimately set you up for the rest of the game upon claiming victory. I'm still not quite there yet, but having spent six hours noodling around the rest of Reborn's opening chapter, this granddaddy of Japanese strategy RPGs sure does hold up in the cold light of 2022.

Going into my hands-on time with Pokémon Scarlet, I was expecting some changes based on the ninth generation’s embrace of open-world gameplay and a “do what you want when you want” mentality with its three primary story paths. Pokémon has yet to take the massive generational shift I’ve dreamed of for years and has instead opted for half-steps with each new entry. Scarlet isn’t the transformation I hoped for, but it’s significantly more than a simple half-step, representing arguably the most considerable shift in mainline Pokémon history.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom held a special Resident Evil showcase yesterday, revealing more about the upcoming Resident Evil Village Gold Edition, that game's Shadows of Rose DLC, and its remake of Resident Evil 4. 
Capcom revealed that it was remaking the beloved classic earlier this year, giving it a March 24, 2023 release date. Now, the company has released a second trailer for Resident Evil 4 and simply put, this game looks stunning. It wasn't a surprise when Capcom revealed it was remaking Resident Evil 4 – it was next in line after all – but given how well-regarded the original is, plenty of people were skeptical this remake would live up to its legacy. Capcom is deadset on proving skeptics wrong if yesterday's trailer is any indication. 
Check out the new Resident Evil 4 remake trailer for yourself below:

Immediately after arriving, I embarked on an early-evening pilgrimage of sorts, my only goal to wander once familiar paths in an attempt to capture a spark of the life I no longer lived. As I ambled past houses that used to be homes, local haunts and darkened lecture halls, it was the differences that stood out the most. Pubs with names I didn’t recognise. Shops in locations that were more convenient than the ones I used to rely upon. Huge buildings that had seemingly sprung out of deserted scrubland. The city felt intimate yet alien. I was both a stranger and a local, a foreigner in a place I’d once adored.


I was thinking about this experience a lot when I was invited to play a short hands-on demo of Capcom’s upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. Here is a remake of my favourite game ever made, a title I have replayed countless times in the 17 years since its original debut, and all I can do is think about the little things. Tiny alterations that feel much larger when surrounded by something so immediately recognisable. This was the same Resident Evil 4 I’ve always known, but one that feels bigger, better and more dynamic. I left my session excited to play more, cautiously optimistic that Capcom may be in the process of crafting their best remake to date.

2017's Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle proved naysayers wrong by offering a well-crafted tactics game that successfully blends two very disparate franchises. Its sequel, Sparks of Hope, now must live up to fan excitement rather than dispel their doubt. Ubisoft Milan accomplishes this feat by returning to the drawing board, reworking its template, and creating a more streamlined, dynamic experience that maintains strategic depth. The core combat remains strong, but Ubisoft fleshed out the rest of the offerings to create a more wholly engaging packa…]]></summary>

Since its reveal in 2020, Square Enix has been slowly doling out information about this hotly-anticipated RPG. With beloved Final Fantasy XIV director and producer Naoki Yoshida in the producer seat for this title, many are excited to see what a single-player mainline Final Fantasy looks like from him and his team. A few trailers have been released, further detailing this medieval fantasy adventure, and now, Square Enix has released a new four-and-a-half-minute video to showcase even more of what to expect.

One of my biggest gripes with the mainline Borderlands series is its humor. I’ve had some good laughs while playing, but Borderlands’ jokes land more like a shotgun blast where some hit and others don’t. That’s okay in bursts, but shotgun blast after shotgun blast can get exhausting. Telltale Games’ take on this universe, Tales From The Borderlands, remedied this by providing a more nuanced and subtle take on the humor coursing through the franchise’s veins. It became one of my favorite Borderlands games, with a gr…]]></summary>

Arguably the biggest news from the presentation is that Bloober Team, the developer behind The Medium and other horror games, is remaking Silent Hill 2. The trailer for the game showed scenes from the iconic game with all-new visuals. The Silent Hill 2 remake is coming to PC via Steam and will be a PlayStation 5 console exclusive for at least a year after launch.


Konami followed up with Silent Hill Townfall, a new game from developer No Code, the creators of Observation and Stories Untold. The teaser shared for the game offered little in the way of game details, but the implication is that it will be someth…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Games has announced Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile-exclusive Mortal Kombat experience. The game is described as a collection role-playing game where players build a roster of fighters from the Mortal Kombat universe and “unleash them in massive real-time group battles.” It’s more than just battles, though – Onslaught is also said to feature a cinematic story experience where fighters have to defeat a “dark and dangerous threat.”
This is not the first time Mortal Kombat has appeared on a mobile device. Mortal Kombat Mobile was released in 2015 alongside Mortal Kombat X and eventually adapted characters and features from Mortal Kombat 11 as well. Mortal Kombat Mobile has been downloaded over 150 million times since its launch, so it’s no wonder WB Games wants to release more games from the franchise.
October 8 marked the series’ 30th anniversary, and Mortal Kombat: Onslaught seems to be a celebration of that. Not only is it the newest mobile game in the series, but it’s also the most recent title since the release of Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate in 2020. As far as the future of the series is concerned outside of the mobile market, Netherrealm has been pretty quiet lately. Outside of our interview with franchise co-creator Ed Boon where he said we'd have to wait a little longer, the most recent news we’ve received has been this tweet:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony announced the PlayStation 5 DualSense Edge controller in August, and now, it has revealed that it will be released this January for $199.99. 
When it was first announced, PlayStation didn't reveal too much about its take on the Xbox Elite Series controller type, but it was clear that it was a "pro" version of the DualSense controller, aimed at PS5 enthusiasts. Now, the company has detailed more of what to expect in a new trailer you can check out below: 


The controller will be available to preorder from select retailers starting next week, on October 25. It will be released on January 26, which is the same day the "replaceable stick modules" will be available too. Those will cost $19.99. 
"The DualSense Edge wireless controller features a host of hardware and software-based personalization options, including button remapping, the ability to fine-tune stick sensitivity and triggers, options to swap between multiple control profiles, and a unique on-controller user interface," a PlayStation Blog post reads.

Epic Games announced the event with a quick gameplay trailer teasing what to expect alongside a look at how being a werewolf works in Fortnite. Plus, you can get a quick glimpse of Ash using his infamous chainsaw (it's unclear if it's attached at this point), likely alluding to the fact that this chainsaw might be a weapon pickup around the battle island, akin to the recent Kamehameha or E-11 Blaster Rifle mythic weapons in recent weeks.

Going into A Plague Tale: Requiem, developer Asobo Studio’s follow-up to 2019’s A Plague Tale: Innocence, I was prepared for the usual jump in quality and scale that most sequels embrace. I underestimated just how significant that leap would be, though. Calling Requiem a standard sequel is a disservice; Asobo has created a Plague Tale epic. It feels Odyssean in scope and storytelling prowess. Although much of it came together for me by the end of my 20-plus hour journey through medieval France, the game feels stra…]]></summary>

However, I’m still journeying through Mario’s latest tactical crossover, so I’m not ready to give a full verdict as of yet. In the meantime, however, here are some impressions based on roughly the first half of the game.
As a fan of Kingdom Battle, I’ve enjoyed what I’ve played of Sparks of Hope. It retains the core strategic gameplay of the original, so if you liked the first game, you’ll probably enjoy this as well. Removing the grid and having freedom of movement feels liberating, however, and is one of the big game-changers. It's interesting because this doesn't change my approach to playing a turn-based tactics game. Heroes still have limited ranges and can’t move after attac…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Editor's Note: This story's headline has been updated to reflect that the presentation is happening today (10/19/22). 
Silent Hill’s future has been the subject of numerous rumors over the last couple of years, and it appears we’re finally getting a clear answer on what’s next. Konami is broadcasting a Silent Hill Transmission this week.
The event airs Wednesday, October 19 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern. A tweet only states the presentation will feature “the latest updates for the Silent Hill series." The tweet links to a new Silent Hill website, but it currently doesn't offer any more information. 
In your restless dreams, do you see that town?
#SILENTHILL Transmission on Wednesday, October 19th, at 2:00 PM. PDThttps://t.co/8Knoq9xYsa
October 16, 2022
Konami reportedly has multiple Silent Hill projects in development at various studios, a rumor recently corroborated by Silent Hill movie director Christopher Gans. The most persistent is that Bloober Team, creators of The Medium and Layers of Fear, is remaking Silent Hill 2. Late September, it was reported that a title called Silent Hill: The Short Message had been rated in South Korea. 
The last full-fledged Silent Hill game was 2012’s ill-recieved Book of Memories for PS Vita. Of course, there was also 2014's P.T., the formerly playable teaser for Hideo Kojima's canceled Silent Hills. 
For years, Silent Hill fans have had to settle for rumor and innuendo in regards to what’s next for the series, so hopefully, Wednesday’s presentation rewards that patience with some exciting announcements. What do you expect to see at the Silent Hill Transmission? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

After years of hopeful waiting, Persona 5 Royal has finally made its way to Switch, and we've been playing it. 
In today's installment of New Gameplay Today, your host talks about the lasting legacy of Persona 5 Royal, what makes the game so special, and how it looks and feels on Switch. Enjoy nearly 15 minutes of Persona 5 Royal from the game's opening moments (so you don't have to worry about spoilers too much if you haven't played the game elsewhere!). 


Personal 5 Royal hits Switch on October 21, which is the same day the game hits Xbox and PlayStation consoles and PC too. You can check out our thoughts on the game on PlayStation 4 in Game Informer's Persona 5 Royal review.
