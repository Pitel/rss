In an attempt to understand the origin of her mysterious "powers", Rose will enter the consciousness of the twisted mould that was the source of all the bother in both Biohazard and Village.

In a new trailer and deep dive from tonight's Capcom Showcase we learned that in fact the dino-rain is happening because of the AI. It is running combat tests with humans by, er, opening huge wormholes in the sky and dumping hundreds of dinosaurs on us like so many plastic toys.
If this concept sounds as incredible to you as it does to many of us in the RPS treehouse, then you can sign up for an upcoming closed network test here. Entry is open until the 30th of June, and  to avoid disappointment make sure you take note of the entry requirements.

Resident Evil has one of the most loyal fanbases out there, and those who love the series have been looking forward to playing their favorite games of the series on next-gen consoles. Earlier this year, Capcom announced that they'd be able to do just that, because they had free updates for Resident Evil 2, 3, and 7 in the works for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

During today's Capcom Showcase as part of the summer news blitz, they let us know that actually, these updated versions are available instantly. That was a nice surprise! The Xbox update will even be available with Xbox Smart Delivery, making it even easier for players to update to the best version for their console.
As reported a few months ago, the updated versions mostly just give us nicer graphics for each of the titles. It's nice that a company would go out of their way to make sure their games look amazing, free of charge. Now go and download your free update!

Capcom is finally bringing some DLC to Resident Evil Village, and it's pretty hefty. The Resident Evil Village Winter's Expansion packs in more Mercs content, a story for Rose, and a whole lot more on Oct. 28, 2022.
The big ticket item here is Shadows of Rose, a new story set in the Village universe following Rosemary Winters. It seems to get pretty mind-twisting and creepy, but for those who dig the expanded world of Resident Evil, that's a pretty interesting set-up.
Shadows of Rose is set 16 years after the events of Resident Evil Village, and the story sees Rose entering the consciousness of the Megamycete. Here, she has to deal with her pasts and nightmares. And apparently also a very evil, Persona palace version of the Duke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJDIenuQepo
If story isn't what you're looking for, there's also the addition of a third-person mode, making it feel a bit more like a classic Resident Evil game. This new vantage point offers a new outlook, and possibly a little more distance between you and all the hand-based injuries Ethan suffers in Village.
Towering mercenaries, oh my
The Mercenaries game mode is also adding three additional characters: Chris Redfield, Karl Heisenberg, and the towering Lady Dimitrescu. Yes, Lady D fans rejoice. She's finally playable. Plus, there are some new stages to add some new challenges.
The Resident Evil Village expansion comes either separate, for those who just need to pick up the additional content, or the Resident Evil Village Gold Edition, which packs it all together.

The Winter's Expansion and Resident Evil Village Gold Edition are out on Oct. 28, 2022.

        <updated>2022-06-13T22:40:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom leveraged its summer showcase event today to reveal some new details on Exoprimal, the upcoming action and shooting game in which players control warriors in exosuits as they fight off rampaging hordes of dinosaurs. An out-of-control AI called Leviathan is unleashing these dinosaurs through rifts in the sky, and forcing humans to fight them off in intricate (and frankly inexplicable) wargames – usually at high risk of death and destruction of urban landscapes.
Exoprimal's main event is called Dino Survival, where you join up in a multiplayer team of five and compete against another team to complete very specific objectives.


Those mission objectives are varied and dynamic. In Dinosaur Cull, your team must hunt and take down one specific dinosaur. VTOL Defense demands that your team protect an aircraft on the ground as it gets swarmed by the charging reptiles. Data Key Security is an escort-style mission, in which you must deliver a particular asset from one location to the next. Omega Charge is a mission in which players have access to a swarm-clearing Omega Hammer. And Energy Taker, as you might suspect, is all about gathering more energy than the opposing team.
Interestingly, Exoprimal will include sequences where you directly engage enemy players, but also moments where you team up to take down especially dangerous threats. No matter who you’re fighting against, you’ll earn XP to power up both your player character and their exosuit levels.
Capcom shared that Exoprimal will soon enter a closed network test, which should allow players to get a taste of the action. If you’re interested, you can sign up at exoprimal.com.
Exoprimal is targeting a release on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and Steam, sometime in 2023.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-06-13T22:34:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during the Capcom Showcase livestream, the company touched base on its recently-announced Resident Evil 4 remake – including showing all of a few seconds of gameplay. Admittedly, especially coming off the other deep dives of the presentation, it was pretty disappointing. 
Director Yasuhiro Anpo and producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi led the presentation, filling players in on the story of RE4 and talking about how the game is both a reimagining of the source material and a faithful adaptation. Set six years after the events of Resident Evil 2 and 3, RE4 protagonist Leon Kennedy is now the personal bodyguard of the United States president. When the president's daughter goes missing, Leon is dispatched to a remote European village to find her. As you might expect, things don't go well. 


We then see our first look at gameplay, and to be clear, visually, it looks great. The footage is set during the very beginning of the game, when Leon arrives outside the village in the forest. Compared to the original game, the forest is far darker and scarier. "We want to nail the feeling of loneliness and fear of not knowing what lies ahead, even more so than the original," Hirabayashi said during the presentation. "Of course, there will also be thrilling battles."
You'd be excused if you expected a glimpse at those thrilling battles, but unfortunately, no such look came. Our look at gameplay ends as Leon walks up to a house in the middle of the forest – which ostensibly is where Leon encounters the first Ganado, as is the case in the original RE4. 
I'm more excited for the Resident Evil 4 remake than any other game we currently know about; the original is one of my all-time favorite games. Which makes this reveal fairly disappointing. I would've loved an actual look at the game, but that wasn't in the cards today. Here's hoping we'll get a better look in the future.]]></summary>

First up is a new story expansion called Shadows of Rose, which puts Rose in the lead for a mind-bending journey of discovery.


In this story, Rose, who is the daughter of Ethan, is in her teens or twenties. From the outset of play, you learn she's struggling with her powers. To try and control them, she enters the consciousness of the Megamycete and that's where the madness begins. Time and space are warped and she sees someone that looks just like her. The entire game is set from the third-person perspective.
Capcom is adding that new viewpoint to the core game, allowing players to see Ethan and experience the game much like Resident Evil 4 with over-the-shoulder aiming.
Lastly, Mercenaries mode is getting fleshed out with new missions and playable characters like Chris Redfield, Alcina Dimitrescu, and Karl Heisenberg. Lady Dimitrescu stands in at over nine feet in height.
If you already played through Resident Evil Village, you won't have to buy this Gold Edition and will just need to get the new Winter's Expansion, which contains all three additions. Capcom is planning to release this content on October 28.]]></summary>

Update : During the Capcom Showcase, it was announced there would be a special Dragon's Dogma video event airing on June 16th / 17th on YouTube. This will include a special video celebrating 10 years of the series.

Original story : Capcom's action RPG series Dragon's Dogma today celebrates its 10th anniversary. Yes, it's now been a decade since the original title was released on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Since then, Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen has been released on multiple platforms including the Nintendo Switch in 2019.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hereby announce a video that may be nothing
During today's Capcom Showcase live stream, director Hideaki Itsuno put in an appearance to relay a message about the popular fantasy RPG series Dragon's Dogma.
While no actual announcements were made, Itsuno noted that the series celebrates its 10th anniversary this year, and that Capcom has prepared a special video to celebrate Dragon's Dogma and its games, lore, anime, and community. The video will go live on Thursday, June 16, at 15:00 PT / 18:00 ET / 23:00 BST. The video will be available on Capcom's social media channels such as YouTube and Twitter.
Now, it's understandable that this seemed like a potential tease, and that perhaps the upcoming Dragon's Dogma anniversary celebrations might be an opening to spotlight some new project related to the series — the hungry fanbase would surely love such an exciting development. But it might be better for your health to temper those expectations and just enjoy the video without too high a hope. You would think that if Capcom did have a remake, remaster, sequel, or some other new title to announce, then they might have done it during tonight's stream, or perhaps at last week's the Summer Game Fest.
So just, keep yo'self in check... FOR NOW... (but really, don't get your hopes up.)

During today's Capcom Showcase, we got another check-in with Exoprimal, a PvPvE team action game about keeping the dinosaur hordes at bay, one crisis at a time. Some of us are open enough to this concept to want to at least give it a chance, and on that front, Capcom is hosting a closed network test for Exoprimal's main mode, Dino Survival, on Steam.
Registration for the Exoprimal network test will open later today. According to Capcom, the team will take entries until June 29 at 4:59 p.m. Pacific. You can see a full breakdown of the network test on the website, but here are the play times:
Session 1 — July 11, 2022 (Mon) 0:00 - 2:59 (UTC)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A closer look at the spookier monsters
Capcom delivered what will likely be the last of the major Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak trailers before its June 30 release today during the Capcom Showcase stream. Oh, and a Sunbreak demo is coming soon!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzplEyeMdzc
Here are a few of the monsters shown off today in the Sunbreak trailer:
Espinas (from Monster Hunter Frontier)
Gore Magala (from Monster Hunter 4)
Daimyo Hermitaur (from Monster Hunter 2) - and the Pyre subspecies
Malzeno (part of the demo)
Lucent Nargacuca (coming in an August 22 free title update)
The jungle area from the second generation of the franchise returns, and the "endemic jungle" elements have been updated for the modern generation. You'll be able to test these out in a solo/multiplayer demo that's out on June 14. There will be no limit to the demo (thank goodness), and it's available on both eShop and PC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isosNYy4axw
Here are the main Sunbreak demo hunts:
Astalos
Tetranadon
Great Izuchi
Malzeno (an extra challenge)

Did you notice that sneaky bit of a Lucent Nargacuca addition via a title update? Vague Sunbreak roadmap updates are planned for:
August 2022
Fall 2022
Winter 2022
With "more to come in 2023"
Given how Iceborne extended the life of Monster Hunter World for a bit, it's only fair that Sunbreak will also have its own string of free updates.

After a busy weekend, it feels like we're pretty deep into the summer gaming showcase schedule, but there's still time to hear from some of the big publishers. Next on the list is Capcom, and with Street Fighter 6 and Resident Evil 4 on the way, it's easy to be stoked. The Capcom Showcase begins at 3:00 p.m. Pacific today and will last "roughly 35 minutes."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q48j01h_IGg
Capcom says the showcase will cover "details and news on previously announced titles."
Further keeping expectations in check, the company specifically mentioned the stream will focus on upcoming games like Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, Exoprimal, and Resident Evil 4. Anything else could just be a bonus — but don't let that stop you from hoping for more.
I know Moyse wants to see another Street Fighter 6 character trailer before the team steps out of the spotlight for a bit, and I'm hoping to hear concrete details about the mysterious Resident Evil Village DLC that could be anything at this point. Barring that, an "out later today!" release of RE2, RE3, and RE7 on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S would be nice.

Capcom Showcase 2022 recap
A Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak demo is coming on June 14
Exoprimal will have a Dino Survival network test
Dragon’s Dogma will release a 10th anniversary celebration video this week
Resident Evil Village expansion includes third-person mode, a Rose story, and more this October
Turns out those free Resident Evil 2, 3, and 7 next-gen updates are available right now
As for Resident Evil 4, there wasn't much "new" info to latch onto, but Capcom did share a snippet of Leon walking around during the beginning of the remake. New screens:

With every year that goes by, I am in worse shape than the year before. Not that I’ve ever been the picture of health, but I do fine. I walk (ten steps) to work. My diet is well-balanced (pizza). I get plenty (an excess) of sleep. However, after getting on anti-anxiety medication a few years back, I gained a few (40) pounds and haven’t been able to shed a single one of them.
I’ve tried all the hottest exercises: Wii Fit, Ring Fit, uh… walking my dog, getting out of bed, making tea. However, they all tire me out and take time out of my busy napping schedule. So, I thought, “what would get me to commit to a workout?” Obviously, that’s going to be if it’s part of an 8-bit retro game.

Since I played it back in 2018, Oxenfree has been one of my favorite games. It's one of those stories that's character-focused on top of everything else it has going for it, like a gorgeous art style, amazing VO performances, and one of the best implementations of a dialogue system in a game I've ever seen. I even found the gameplay, which mostly involves walking and climbing around Edwards Island, to be really engaging, mostly because of the conversations the characters had. For me, it captures the coming-of-age magic that something like Stranger Things season one had, and it's one of the best narrative games of the last decade.

As the regional rollout continues, Sony has launched its new tiered PlayStation Plus subscription plans in North America. Many of us will be sticking with the most basic membership (which is now known as PlayStation Plus Essential), but you can see how much it'll cost to upgrade to Extra or Premium on this info-heavy overview page. Another handy link: the list of games and which tiers they're tied to, including PlayStation Classics, some of which can be purchased standalone on PS4/PS5 without needing a membership.

From the same developer as In Other Waters, Citizen Sleeper is all about the seedy, morally-grey underbelly of a cyberpunk civilisation where megacorps can literally own you. By rolling the dice, both literally and figuratively, you will attempt to eke out an existence in a world that is actively trying to break you down into parts to sell.

Whatever happened to Marissa Marcel? That's the question at the core of Immortality, the latest from Sam Barlow's Half Mermaid. It's the third mystery from Barlow and co. told in full-motion video, or FMV, but it's much more than a retread. In some ways, Immortality's match-cut deduction feels like it was inevitable.
I recently had a chance to both chat with the crew at Half Mermaid and play a short snippet of Immortality. And what's striking about Immortality at first is how simply it starts. Much like Her Story and Telling Lies, Barlow's latest is told through a user interface; rather than a computer text interface though, it's essentially a recreation of an old Moviola machine.

My fingers would ache for hours after playing Diablo Immortal; my hands haven’t spent this much time curled around my phone this way in years. Despite the pain my aging hands suffered during my first few days with Immortal, it was worth it for the fun I had. The series’ core action/RPG smash and loot gameplay makes the transition wonderfully to mobile thanks to responsive controls designed for portable play and adherence to the sights and sounds of the franchise. With this mobile facelift comes a free-to-play model most can avoid spend…]]></summary>

There sure were a lot of shooty-type games at Not-E3 this year, and though it's easy to feel a little tired of all the gunplay, there is, admittedly, a lot of fun to be had in just turning off your brain and playing guns.
Especially when the guns in question also come with swords, like in Bright Memory: Infinite, an FPS-action mashup that combines hack-and-slash mechanics with FPS shooting. You can mix it up between shots, slashes, and even psychic powers to take out your enemies, who range from ancient Chinese mythological demons to futuristic soldiers.

Anybody up for a little over-dramatic swordplay in an electrical storm should keep watch on the calendar for the remainder of the year, as Playism and the hugely talented Studio FYQD have announced that the hi-tech, first-person, slash 'n' shoot sequel Bright Memory: Infinite will be arriving on console platforms later this year.
https://youtu.be/n2uSETOP8pw
Already available on PC, Bright Memory: Infinite is a sequel/revamp to the original cult hit Bright Memory, which tells the tale of a Battle Angel Alita-type hero who utilizes razor-sharp swordplay, ballistic gunplay, and an array of bio-weaponry to battle inter-dimensional invaders. While neither title is particularly long, (lasting a mere hour and change), Bright Memory is lauded for its staggering revelation that it was entirely designed, coded, and built by a single developer — making its highly impressive visuals and breathless gameplay all the more fascinating.
While Bright Memory: Infinite is admittedly a little more about its concept and invention than its actual execution, it still makes for a fun couple of hours, with combat that can be snugly described as a first-person Devil May Cry. The console editions have been tweaked to include extra features — such as DualSense integration — and the PS5 and Xbox Series X editions are expected to run a silky-smooth 120 FPS when in Performance Mode. Swish. Check out Chris Carter's review right here.
Bright Memory: Infinite is available now on PC, it will launch on PS5, Xbox Series X and Switch this year.

The labor neutrality agreement will take effect 60 days after Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard closes.

The cake itself was made last year, so we imagine every inch of it has been consumed and digested by now, but the fan in question made it for his daughter to celebrate her birthday, including her own Animal Crossing model within the composition alongside Tom Nook and Isabelle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a release in Asian markets last month, the overhaul of PlayStation Plus is available today in North and South America. Here's everything you'll need to know about upgrading your plan.
Three tiers are now available, offering larger numbers of features, games, and trials to play as you go up in pricing, which is available in one-month, three-month, and 12-month subscriptions. Brief descriptions of what you get in each tier can be found below. 
Upgrading is fairly painless but will require a prorated upcharge to join the new Extra or Premium plans of PlayStation Plus. To do so, go to your PS+ tab on your PlayStation console. There, you'll find an option to upgrade. On PS5, it showed each tier and how much money it would cost to upgrade for the remainder of the month, which for most should only be a few dollars. Upon upgrading, it will tell you your next payment date and that it will charge you for a full-year subscription on that day. Don't panic. There is a way to change your subscription type. 
How To Change Your Subscription Type From Yearly To Monthly
There are various ways of getting to your subscription settings, but here is the most foolproof. Go to the Settings menu for your PlayStation console, select Users and Accounts > Accounts > Payment and Subscriptions > Subscriptions. In there, you'll find your PS+ subscription. Once you've entered your subscription details, you can change your plan. 
Selecting Change Plan will give you the three tiers of PlayStation Plus to choose from. Picking any of them will bring you to another screen that will finally allow you to choose the length of subscription you'd like to pay for on a recurring basis. 
Once you've locked in your desired subscription tier and timeframe, you're ready to enjoy all of the benefits that are now available to you, and you can rest easy knowing you're not locked in for an unexpected charge next month.]]></summary>

Nintendo just put out a Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Zeon character reveal, which showcases the tank class in action.
The first reveal actually comes via the Nintendo of Europe Twitter account, which gives us a quick translated rundown of the character (notice the High Entia wing design on their head):
"Zeon is a Keves soldier and a reliable hero who’ll go above and beyond to protect his allies in #XenobladeChronicles3. Armed with a sword and shield, Zeon’s abilities are enhanced when he’s pitted against stronger enemies."

Next, we have to hover back over to the Japanese Nintendo Twitter account, because this is how Nintendo delivers segmented chunks of news these days, even on bigger games.
Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Zeon character trailer:
https://twitter.com/XenobladeJP/status/1536244016907694082
Through the above account, we actually get a much better look at the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Zeon character reveal in video form, which more than does its job. Big sword? Check. Protecting the party? Check.
I'm a sucker for tank characters, and the getup of knight armor and an anime glowing sword and shield really do it for me. It's going to be hard to push this character out of my forever party unless Monolith Soft has something really special up its sleeve.

There's no shortage of dungeon-ish turn based combat games, nor of those made of all the usual fantasy archetypes, nor of pixelly low-fi games with bleepy bloopy music. Nor again are we likely to run short of games that combine some or all of the above. But like a good meal, combining even the most common ingredients in just the right way can make them delicious.


It doesn't matter that you're a monarch ousted by evil forces, now set on reclaiming your land within 45 days by fighting tonnes of monsters until your team is tough enough to kill the big nasty. What matters is that you'll have a great time doing it.

Publisher Digerati has announced UNDETECTED, a top-down stealth action game that pays homage to Hideo Kojima's seminal masterpiece, Metal Gear Solid. It puts the focus squarely on non-lethal combat, with abilities like knocking on walls and close quarters combat letting you take out enemies in the swiftest way possible.
The game will feature multiple difficulty options, including the very Metal Gear sounding 'Mexican Extreme' mode, which pulls no punches and wipes out your save file if you trigger the game's alert mode.

It’s the latest in a line of games based on the SCP Foundation wiki, a collection of mainly horror-focused stories and faux-reports around a shadowy cleanup organisation and the weird, nature-defying shit they capture and cover up. Judging so far, it’s also shaping up to be perhaps the most complete attempt at an SCP game yet.

It's time to jump on your skateboard, grab your Sinner's Sandwich, and frame rate into oblivion, as Rising Star Games has announced that Swery65's tongue-in-cheek-but-also-actually-bad Deadly Premonition 2: A Blessing in Disguise is now available on PC via the Steam Store.
As a quick refresher, Deadly Premonition 2 was the long-awaited follow-up to the notoriously goofy 2010 release, Deadly Premonition. The sequel features a dual storyline that sees put-upon investigator Francis Zach/York Morgan investigating a Bostonian murder in the past, while being interrogated over said case and its horrendous aftermath in the present. Guide our hero in past and present as they uncover the sinister psychological torment that lies beneath the surface of the sublime Le Carré.

While Deadly Premonition 2 features the strange dialogue, goofy action sequences, and overall sense of compelling weirdness that is the series' trademark, it was also lambasted at launch for its myriad technical issues, some of which went beyond the realm of parody and into poor value. Unfortunately, according to reports in the Steam forums, it seems that this new port carries its own weight in both new and old technical issues, (though it seems that the frame rate issues have been fixed).
In true Deadly Premonition style, it seems that this release is really just for those who have no problem dropping cash on irony, warts and all. Deadly Premonition 2: A Blessing in Disguise is available now on PC and Nintendo Switch. The Steam port is being sold at a discounted price until June 18.

Let's break this down.
Why did Pokemon have 65,535 versions?
Originally, Game Freak wanted each and every copy of the game (in the initial run at least) to feel special. As such, games would ship with a unique version of what became known as Pokemon Red/Blue [Green], with tens of thousands of variations.

So everyone was pretty excited to see what this new space RPG holds at the Xbox & Bethesda Showcase stream this weekend. And, sure enough, we actually got a pretty big eyeful of it.
Now, keep in mind that this game is set in outer space, the vast expanse and wonders of which we cannot ken. You could do any cool, awe-inspiring thing you want with space. Crystal waterfalls that flow backwards into the sky. Aurora borealis-like lights but so low down they whip along at ground level. Deserts of hot-pink dust sprouting deep blue rock spires. Destiny 2 has some cool planets, for example. Imagine my confusion, then, when the footage of Bethesda's brand new IP made it look like they've accidentally done Fallout or Elder Scrolls again.

From Arizona's lasso-crazy multi-slam, to Paprika's ultra hug of death, Tianhuo's demonstration of their martial arts expertise, and Pom's Akuma-esque touch of death — these new supers are packed with personality and character.

In addition, all current and future TFH players can now download DLC character Shanty free of charge. Incidentally, the G.O.A.T. herself has perhaps my favorite super, featuring a barrage of cannonballs from her nearby ship, ending in a spectacular explosion. Them's Fightin' Herds has spent the past four years building upon its great foundation, determined to prove itself a major contender among its big-budget contemporaries. It's a great fighter, no doubt, and the console release — officially called for later in 2022 — will be sure to add more than a few new disciples to the herd.
Them's Fightin' Herds is available now on PC. It will launch on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms this fall.  You can check out the full list of balance tweaks and bug fixes over on Steam.

Updated with ten more games in celebration of Pride 2022. Enjoy!

The games industry has not always been good at portraying LGBTQ+ relationships and identities, but thanks to the efforts of small studios, indie developers, and LGBTQ+ creators, that's beginning to change. Not only do we have enough games with strong LGBTQ+ themes on the Nintendo Switch that we can actually make a list, but all of these games are exceptionally good. We're spoiled for choice!

Maybe it's just us, but right now there's nothing more appealing than the idea of quitting your job, moving to the countryside, opening a café, and raising chickens. Not that we don't love our jobs, mind you — it's just that the day-to-day of city living is not nearly as appealing as living in the woods.
Well, at least we have games like Lemon Cake to escape into. This wholesome café management game starts with the player restoring an old bakery, with the help of a friendly ghost, and turning it into a café. With recipes to learn, a greenhouse to tend to, and chickens and cows to give you fresh ingredients, hopefully it'll be no time at all until your café turns a profit.

Everyone knows that the true heart of any RPG is the character creation screen though. It’s just science. Speaking of which, Starfield’s character creation menus are modelling themselves on some real-life science, namely molecular biology. That’s cool, I think.

There must be something in the water, and that something is Bear Juice, because after the announcement of Bear & Breakfast's release date earlier this week, and Cozy Grove getting a sequel, we've now got the surprise release of LumbearJack, too. We're not complaining, of course. It's bearrific news.
LumbearJack, as the title suggests, is about a lumberjack who is also a bear who is also named Jack. His woodland home has been invaded by the sinister industrial giant Evil Works, who have installed a bunch of machinery ready to tear down Jack's lovely trees. Not if he can help it, of course. With the help of his trusty axe and his animal friends, he can hack those machines into pieces.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scroll down on the giveaway page a bit
GOG is giving away a free Shantae and the Pirate's Curse PC copy, in case you don't own the game already.

So here's a quick rundown of how to redeem the free Shantae and the Pirate's Curse copy on GOG:
The landing page of the game is here: you'll need to click "go to giveaway" to head to the main site to actually redeem it.
On this giveaway page, you'll find the "add this game to your account" button roughly halfway in: just look for the Shantae image.
You have roughly 46 hours from the time of publication to actually claim the game. Note that you'll need to (at least temporarily) agree with marketing communications from GOG to claim it, and have a logged-in account to boot.
Definitely do it, even if you have no intention of playing it anytime soon! Pirate's Curse is an interesting deviation from the Shantae formula, as it sees the titular character losing her genie powers in favor of going on a more traditional adventure. Some folks still consider it their favorite in the franchise, and given the aforementioned conceit, it's a great entry point.
This is your chance to dive into the series!

Since IGN started its month-long coverage for Sonic Frontiers, feedback from the fans has been, well... mixed, at best. The gameplay videos shown so far have a few fans concerned about the new format, particularly the rather bizarre similarities to games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
In chatting with VGC, it seems Team Sonic boss Takashi Iizuka is well aware of some of the feedback being shared online at the moment, but doesn't seem overly concerned at this stage. Here's what he had to say:

In case you missed it, Ark 2 was shown over the weekend at the Microsoft conference. But before that actually arrives sometime in 2023, there's a free Ark (the original) promo going on over on Steam. It typically goes for $29.99 on the platform.
As usual, the standard provisos apply. The team could cut off the offer as it runs until "supplies last," though it's not particularly common for this to happen. Also, you don't get Steam trading cards via free games like this. Note that there is a cutoff time! You have until June 19 at 10:00AM PT to click "own." Just go log in and do it here in browser form!
After you pick the game up, there's a decent chunk of free and paid stuff to grab. Beyond the $29.99 season pass (which is on sale for $23.99 at the moment), there's also several expansion maps that you can pick up for free, including "Lost Island, Valguero, The Center, and Crystal Isles and Ragnarok" variations. A "Primitive Plus" total conversion mod is also free, which is intriguing in and of itself: "Primitive Plus is a free add-on for ARK: Survival Evolved that alters the available tools, weapons and structures in the game to reflect what humans could realistically create using primitive technology and resources. This does not simply remove advanced technology from ARK, but instead replaces it with a multitude of new resources, engrams and systems."
While Ark might not be for everyone (and the survival genre is sure to scare off droves of people on principle), you could spend an entire weekend diving into this game before realizing you don't even like it.

If you managed to catch the Microsoft and Bethesda Games Showcase 2022, then you'll know that Persona 3 Portable, Persona 4 Golden, and Persona 5 Royal will be making their way to Xbox consoles and Game Pass. It was a blow for Switch owners hoping for the series to be ported onto Nintendo's console and now it looks like all three games are also coming to PlayStation 5 and Steam.
Given that rumours have been swirling of the Persona games coming to the Switch for quite some time at this point, it genuinely feels like we're the last one to be picked for the sports team right now. What gives? Granted, there's still time for the games to be announced for Switch (Nintendo Direct soon, anyone?), and their arrival on Xbox platforms signifies an openness from Atlus to finally go cross-platform with the core series, but we can't help but feel a tad left out.

Sonic Frontiers raced among 2022’s most anticipated games when it debuted during the 2021 Game Awards.

I still have many questions, but I walked away with clearer expectations and some glimmers of hope.

Capcom has confirmed that its exciting new scrapper Street Fighter 6 will indeed have fully redesigned rollback netcode, and will not simply port the online infrastructure that powers previous entry Street Fighter V.

"SFV also had rollback netcode, but SF6 will have rollback netcode [but] it's not going to be the same as what we had in SFV," said Nakayama (in dictation recorded by EventHubs). "This is something that they're building from scratch. There's a lot of effort being put into the development of the netcode."

Though the manga only started in 2016, Demon Slayer has gone on to become one of the most successful media franchises in existence—even passing up the likes of Sonic the Hedgehog and Minecraft in raw sales. Despite this, Demon Slayer has had shockingly little presence in video games; aside from a Japan-only mobile game that still has yet to release, the only other game is Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles. This release came to other platforms just this past fall, and now the Switch version has come with all the post-launch DLC from those releases. Though it has some flaws, we found Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles to be thoroughly enjoyable and we think you should consider giving it a shot.
The story of Demon Slayer follows Tanjiro, a young man with an axe to grind with demonkind. Prior to the events of the game, a demon attacked and killed his family while he was away—one sister survived, but she didn’t get much of a better deal given that she was turned into a ferocious demon. We take on the role of Tanjiro just as he’s about to complete the final step of his training to become a proper Demon Slayer. Once he’s done so, his goal is then to avenge his family’s death by killing the demon who murdered them and hopefully to find a cure for his sister somewhere along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can probably tell what I picked already
We've been through a State of Play, Sonic Central, Summer Games Fest, Devolver Direct, a Netflix Gaming stream, the Epic Games Store Summer Showcase, a Microsoft event, and the PC Gaming Show together. It's been a trip! "E3 2022" has been trying at times, but now is the time to share your favorite reveal of this past week.
For me, it was the Persona on Xbox announcement. The fact that this trio of killer games is coming to PC [beyond what we already got], Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass, is pretty huge news. Although they're older releases (well, Royal technically isn't that old), it's a trifecta announcement: so I'm kind of cheating here.
It's just lovely to see this series live on, on as many platforms as possible. I can still recall the first time I played Persona 2 with my cousin; huddled away in my relative's house, never realizing how big this series would one day get. I watched Persona 3 claw its way onto the PSP after a PS2 release, and now, it's coming to Xbox consoles, potentially before PS5 and Switch. That's wild!
A bit of housekeeping for what's on the horizon. So to be clear, all the major showcases are done as of this afternoon. The next stream is the Capcom showcase at 6PM ET tomorrow, followed by the 10-minute FFVII celebration shindig on June 16. Oh, and if Nintendo plans a surprise Direct next week, there's that. You can find a list of confirmed streams here.
But again, as of today, what was your favorite reveal? As a reminder, here is what some of us wanted to see.

So another PC Gaming Show is in the bag! And as usual, it was a bit uneven. There was some cool stuff in there! And some not-so-cool stuff like ads for stuff no one wants and trailers of old games. We sifted through the bigger things so you didn't have to.
Below you'll find a collective of the main headlines, but the big takeaway: this showcase did not need to be two hours long on a US Sunday afternoon/European night. I know some things absolutely need to be done to pay the bills (where was Drake's Cakes?!), but the PC Gaming Show has been around for seven years. At this point there are a lot of lessons learned to impart over the years that could be used to create a slicker show with less downtime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An unexpected and fun surprise from the PC Gaming Show was the reveal of Klei Entertainment's newest game. Rotwood is a multiplayer action game, and it's expected to enter early access at some point, but that date is up in the air for now.


Thanks to the Steam description, we know a little more about Rotwood than what was revealed in the trailer. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler designed to be played with up to four people. Each run will bring your cute animal avatars through a dangerous forest where the challenge amplifies the deeper you go in. New armor and weapons can be crafted from items scavenged, and a safe haven can be built up and fortified as well.
In typical Klei style, the hand-drawn look of the characters and enemies is unreal. Once again, the studio is pushing the boundaries of making it look like you're controlling a cartoon character; Rotwood's models are expressive, fluid, and bursting with personality. I can't wait to see what Rotwood looks and plays like in action when I can eventually get my hands on it.
The trailer gave an early access date of "202?" which could be anytime in the next decade, though I'd expect us to play it well before 2030. Rotwood can be wishlisted on Steam, and it's unknown whether Klei is planning for release on any additional platforms at this time.]]></summary>

If there's one thing that the PC Gaming Show nailed this year, it was remembering not to forget to show New Blood's Gothic first-person adventure Gloomwood, which previously had the misfortune of being left off of the show by accident, and uploaded to social media once the stream had finished. Oops.
Anyway, those who have been waiting to dive into its gory gaslit world will be pleased to hear that Gloomwood finally has an Early Access date, and will be opening its creaky wooden doors on Steam come August 16. Gloomwood's stealth 'n' slash action will come as snug entertainment to those who enjoyed that '90s Thief titles, which clearly presented a form of inspiration to the New Blood devs.
In between all the creeping and cranium-axing, players can also indulge in a spot of suitcase arranging, ala Resident Evil 4, which as fans know is almost a compelling game in and of itself. If this is your first time hearing about Gloomwood, then be sure to check out the trailer below to get yourself up to speed on New Blood's latest old-school-cool release. Check out the trailer below, which features several titles from the New Blood catalog along with some e-e-edgy comedy.
Gloomwood goes live on Steam Early Access August 16.

Leikir Studio had premiered the first trailer for its upcoming ecological city-builder, Synergy. Making its world premiere at this year's PC Gaming Show, the new title sees a struggling people efficiently utilize their surroundings in order to thrive and survive in a mysterious, fictional land.
As you can see from the trailer below, Synergy boasts a pleasant illustration style and holds tight to its themes of harmony, ecology, and community to sustain the homes, food, and resources of its civilians. Explore the surroundings for new food, minerals, and materials; research new forms of education and social evolution; and watch your community progress from the brink of oblivion to a harmonious, thriving, and self-sufficient settlement.
Synergy is now available to wishlist on Steam.

Valve's catalog has been modded again and again, and has even given birth to iconic titles like Garry's Mod and The Stanley Parable. Now the modding community is taking on the studio's most recent release, Half-Life: Alyx, to build on the game's world and characters and deliver a whole new narrative adventure. It's called Half-Life Alyx: Leviathan, and we got a full eight-minute gameplay demo during today's PC Gaming Show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WE1qf3Z_-s
We got a look at some close encounters, tense shootouts, and even a brief cameo by the ever-iconic Gordon Freeman. Leviathan looks indistinguishable from the real Half-Life: Alyx experience, and it looks like it's shaping up to be a must-play for anyone with a VR headset.
The project was created by modders FMPONE and Corey Laddo, and is set to release sometime in 2022 on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Go on
Backfirewall (stylized as Backfirewall_) is one of the more interesting games shown off during the PC Gaming Show today: it's about an OS that doesn't want to update. That alone has me intrigued! PC Gamer, says that it's a "tragicomedy," and is a self-aware parody at points, with elements of Stanley Parable and Portal.
Described as a series of "puzzles and gags," in Backfirewall_ you'll explore various bits of the OS, including different types of apps, to swipe through the narrative. Apparently there are shades of Toy Story afoot, with the intent of having players ponder the inner workings and feelings of an OS. You'll become attached to OS9, as the OS10 update arrives: and decide what to do from there.
Creative drector Julia Jean had this to say about the premise: "We want players to feel like they're playing inside a Pixar movie while also reflecting on the rather mindless way in which we interact with our everyday digital devices. If you think twice before you update your phone after playing Backfirewall_, our job is done!"
It's also one of the few games shown today in the PC Gaming Show coming to Switch! It'll arrive on PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X later this year. A demo is available now until June 20.

Publisher Frontier Factory and developer KeokeN Interactive have offered up a new trailer for the atmospheric space adventure Deliver Us Mars, which is currently in development for PC and console platforms ahead of its September release date.
Set on The Red Planet itself, Deliver Us Mars follows a young explorer and her robotic drone pal as the duo embark upon a mission to locate and recover a selection of ARK colony ships from the sinister force, The Outward. KeokeN promises "a suspense-filled, emotion-fuelled narrative alongside music from award-winning composer Sander Van Zanten, state-of-the-art motion capture, stunning graphics and real-time ray-traced shadows and reflections, powered by Unreal Engine."
Already this summer has been jam-packed with space adventures, but it seems that Deliver Us Mars might be dialing back a little on the horror, focusing more on its exploration, adaptation, and deep adventure — not that it won't feature its own fair share of outer space peril, of course. It's not looking too bad at all, as you can see for yourself in the new trailer below.
Deliver Us Mars launches September 27 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

The very concept of Metal: Hellsinger appeals to me from the first note: Slay demons in a modern Doom-style first-person shooter to the beat of newly recorded tracks from some big names in rock and metal. As someone who grew up playing the original Doom and loves the modern iterations of the franchise, and has perhaps sunk more time into the Rock Band series than any other franchise, The Outsiders' upcoming game checks a lot of boxes. Still, coming into my hands-on time with the game, I was skeptical. Thankfully, the short demo I played at Summer Game Fest (which is also a…]]></summary>

Roughly a year ago, our own Jordan Devore gave us a pretty in-depth look at Agent 64: a GoldenEye/Perfect Dark/TimeSplitters homage from studio Replicant D6. The PC Gaming Show today gave us another look at some Agent 64 gameplay via a new trailer.
While we didn't get a ton of new info, we did get some kernels due to a new piece from PC Gamer. It's "out in early access later this year," and no multiplayer is re-confirmed, alongside of multiple difficulty modes. The game will feature a CRT visual filter, and some portions of the game have been shored up as a result of the 2021 alpha testing: including quicker firing control considerations, and a more arcadey feel with hip-firing. The team also reminds us that the demo is available now on Steam.
A lack of multiplayer could be seen as a missed opportunity, but it's actually kind of refreshing in a way. I know I'll be able to just dive into this, finish it up, and put it on the shelf. In an era of endless games as a service, it's a welcome respite. "Early access later this year" doesn't quite grab me though! I'm in when it's done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a long absence, Nightdive Studio's remake of System Shock made an appearance at the PC Gaming Show, and it's looking pretty cool. You can watch the trailer below for yourself, along with an interview with series creator and industry luminary Warren Spector.


This new trailer for System Shock gives a great look at the game's visual style, which toes the line of using modern graphical techniques while paying homage to the low-res look of the original game. More specifically, some of the in-game panels and monitors are intentionally blocky and pixelated, as if they were textures from a 90s first-person shooter. SHODAN, the antagonistic AI who is ever-present in System Shock, is also a prominent feature in the trailer as she talks smack to the player as they explore the Citadel Station.
System Shock is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

This afternoon, audiences for the PC Gaming Show got to see a new trailer for Sam Barlow's upcoming FMV mystery, Immortality. The new title, leading on from hits Her Story and Telling Lies, will launch on PC and Xbox Game Pass on July 26.
Immortality tasks the player with uncovering the mystery behind the disappearance of failed actor Marissa Marcel, whose three uncompleted movies never saw the light of day. Utilizing groundbreaking linking mechanics, the player is tasked with finding links between scenes, using props, characters, and the scenery itself to uncover the answers hidden behind Marcel's ultimate fate.
While FMV games are renowned for their limited appeal and slight player interaction, Barlow has won plaudits for finding ways to take the genre to a whole new level, bringing in interesting and novel ideas, quality performances, and compelling mysteries to hold the player's interest throughout. No doubt that Immortality will see Barlow once again make something special out of the genre's limited toolset.

For one, you're creating alternatve versions of yourself in order to survive on a rickety base rolling across an alien world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11 Bit Studios, the developer behind This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta, is making something new and a bit more surreal. The Alters is a sci-fi adventure where one man trying to survive and get home from a mission that's gone wrong finds all the help he needs in himself. Or rather, himselves.


 
Jan Dolski, the main character, turns to The Alters, or alternate versions of himself that differ from him in ways that will help them all survive. The Alters each have different skills and character traits, so even though they all look like Jan, they'll fill specific roles in the mission to get home. The trailer shows Jan and The Alters' ship, a giant wheel-like craft with a series of shipping container units held together at the center.
During the presentation, 11 Bit Studios' Lead Artist Tomasz Kisikewicz says the game has aspects of a psychological thriller, with a dash of horror, but also obviously deals with surrealism. He also says this lands in a "classic sci-fi" story by taking a relatable topic and applying these fictional science solutions like creating alternate selves, but the gameplay is contemporary with a focus on system design and non-linear gameplay. It's designed for players to create their own stories.
 

It seems like it's far too early for a release date, but we do know The Alters will be coming to PC whenever it does end up launching.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PC Gaming Show debuted an extended look at gameplay for a Sci-fi thriller from Starward Industries, The Invincible. What was shown is compelling, and it may be an understatement to say, but this game looks stunning.


The demo begins from the perspective of Yasna, a hazmat-suited explorer as she ventures into a dusty and irradiated facility. Her cohort Novik supports her on comms as she delves deeper into the mysterious local. She soon comes across a deactivated Antimatter cannon and later a robot looping a task it's been engaged in for who knows how long. The tech of The Invincible is retro-futuristic, which gives the rundown facility and gadgets Yasna uses a lot of character and charm. Yasna pulls out a handheld tracker with a field of tiny lights and uses it to discover a body buried in the sands beneath her feet, confirming this place isn't at all safe. Then, the antimatter cannon surges to life, takes aim, and blows the robot worker away with a spectacular beam of particles before turning its sights dead on our protagonist.
I'm not usually one for slow-paced first-person narrative games, but this look at The Invincible had me on the edge of my seat, and I can't wait to see more. The Invincible is coming sometime in 2023 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

Revealed during today’s Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase, Pentiment looks like quite the departure from what Obsidian has released over the past few years. Nonetheless, the project looks fascinating. The game features quite a unique visual style that looks reminiscent of an old medieval painting or book. This makes sense, too, because Pentiment is not an RPG like The Outer Worlds or a survival game like the studio’s Grounded, but rather, a narrative adventure game. 
Check out the trailer for yourself below: 


Here’s how Xbox describes Pentiment in the YouTube trailer description: 
“Set in 16th century Bavaria, Pentiment will take players on a narrative journey through the eyes of Journeyman Artist Andreas Maler during a time of great social unrest. Led by game director Josh Sawyer, this game is brought to life by a talented team inspired by illuminated manuscripts, woodcut prints, and history itself.” 
Pentiment hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC this November. 
While waiting for its release, read Game Informer’s review of The Outer Worlds and then read about Obsidian’s next RPG, Avowed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Dusk Falls, an interactive drama where you make choices that impact the characters' lives, made an appearance at the Xbox Games Showcase. The trailer, which was captured in-game, not only looked intriguing but also revealed the game's launch date. And it's next month!
On July 19, you can gear up with friends or solo to experience a story of "betrayal, sacrifice, and resilience." The trailer, which you can watch above, sheds light on some of the dilemmas and challenges you'll have to navigate in a small town. It makes statements like, "Sometimes doing the right thing is doing the wrong thing." The narrative-driven game will explore the entangled lives of two families across thirty years, and it looks like three characters, in particular, are at the forefront of the experience.
The multiplayer lets you have up to eight players, but it's unclear how each person will actually be involved in the process. 
Guess we'll know soon enough when As Dusk Falls launches on July 19 for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. The game is also a day-one title on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game creator Hideo Kojima of Kojima Productions joined the Xbox Games Showcase presentation today for a quick but impactful announcement; he and his team are working on a new project in partnership with Xbox.
Unfortunately, he chose to share next to nothing about what the project will be, beyond sharing that it is a “game I have always wanted to make.”
Kojima also implied that it’s a new game, and thus likely not part of any existing franchise. He also spoke briefly about Microsoft’s cloud technology, suggesting that the project might leverage that capability as well.
It’s not much to go on, but it’s an interesting new direction for the studio and auteur, as Kojima has more recently been connected to Sony and its PlayStation brand.
It will be especially interesting to see what shape this new project will take as we learn more, but that may be quite a long way off from now.]]></summary>

The first locale we see is a moon called Kreet, which is stark in detail with rocky grain terrains and brief flares of color with red plants.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's Xbox Games Showcase featured many games – big and small – by a glut of different development teams. Baby Robot Games is a Barcelona-based studio that focuses on supernatural stealth and adventure games. Today, it revealed Ereban: Shadow Legacy, a game where you must harness mystical shadow powers and use high-tech gadgets to uncover the truth about your past to save the universe.
In the trailer, the main character, Ayana, who channels some serious Tron energy with her attire, confronts big mechs. Apparently, Ayana is the last descent of a forgotten race and is key to saving this dying, morally grey universe. The gameplay footage showed her stealthily outsmarting big machines and using an array of powers. She can also stab them through the head, so that's pretty cool. She even takes some big falls from huge heights, reminiscent of Assassin's Creed. Watch the trailer above to get the full scoop.
Ereban: Shadow Legacy will launch day one on Xbox Game Pass. No release date was revealed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has a history of showing off some of our favorite indies during its big showcases, and it looks like it's keeping that tradition alive and well. During the platform's Summer Game Fest event today, we got our first glimpse at a new project from Limbo and Inside lead designer Jeppe Carlsen.
Cocoon, published by Annapurna Interactive, which has a showcase of its own next month, promises to be a mind-bending experience with an undeniably compelling art style. The creators promise to take players "on an adventure across worlds within worlds," which are represented by a series of unusual glowing orbs in the trailer. The clip begins with a sweeping and stylized view of a desert landscape which is soon disturbed by a blinding beam of white light. Our hero pops out of a mechanical-looking cocoon energized by the laser and appears to be a kind of beetle. We mostly see it grabbing and distributing globes of various colors, which may allow it to jump to different locations.


 There's not a lot to glean from this reveal trailer, but the game's Steam page goes into a little more detail. 
Cocoon is set to release on Xbox consoles (via Game Pass), Switch, and PC sometime in 2023. The trailer's description indicates fans should get ready to "master world-leaping mechanics to unravel a cosmic mystery."]]></summary>

The necromancer joins the previously announced barbarian, sorceress, rogue, and druid, all allowing for high levels of customization.
As you dive into dangerous open areas, you'll be hunting the disciples of Lilith, the daughter of hatred. In new gameplay footage, developer Blizzard Entertainment says Diablo IV offers over 150 dungeons, along with territories to reclaim, and story sequences that occur as you explore. Some of these story moments could lead to massive boss battles that require numerous players.


Diablo IV offers cross-play between console and PC, and also two-player couch play for people in the same household. If you play a bunch and become incredibly powerful, the game will highlight you as a champion, which other players can see. Along with the high number of dungeons, Blizzard claims the endgame is deep and will continue to expand years after release.
Blizzard says they are close to completing development, but has only given an open 2023 timeframe for release.]]></summary>

Revealed during today’s Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty looks quite similar to Team Ninja’s Nioh series in that it features a ninja-like character fighting against not just humans, but monstrous and demonic monsters, too. The reveal trailer, which you can watch below, doesn’t feature any gameplay but it gave us quite the taste of Fallen Dynasty’s world.


As you can see in the trailer above, the character that appears to be the protagonist of Fallen Dynasty is fighting off barbarian enemies before consuming something that turns them into a massive demon dragon monster that looks terrifying. Here’s what the trailer description for Fallen Dynasty says about the game: 
It looks great, albeit a little scary, and fortunately, we don’t have to wait too long to check it out because Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in early 2023.

        <updated>2022-06-12T18:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ebb Software showed a new trailer for Scorn at today’s Xbox Games Showcase, and the first-person horror adventure continues to look just as disturbing as ever.
Drawing clear lines of inspiration from the famous artist, H.R. Giger, Scorn features some of the same disconcerting imagery that is a part of the art from movies like Alien, in which biological and mechanical elements seem to merge.
The new trailer continues to embrace those elements, with more than a little bit of body horror mixed in for good measure. The video shows numerous instances of disconnected human appendages attached to strange, non-human machines and creatures. And the protagonist appears to be horribly mutilated in the brief glimpses we get of their arms and other body parts.
Ebb has stated in the past that Scorn is aiming for a cohesive “lived-in” world, in which players are thrown in the deep-end by arriving and having to try and grasp what is even happening in the spaces they explore. Environments are said to be maze-like and individual regions are open and exploreable, but interconnected with other distinct spaces.
The developers are also touting the game’s focus on full-body awareness. Rather than have items simply floating in the world and having them picked up by magic, every object is a real thing that your character must lift or move with their own hands, hopefully leading to a greater sense of immersion. And, given the subject matter, a likely greater sense of disquiet.
While the environment and creature design is certainly impressive, I continue to have a number of questions about the nature of gameplay in the project. I’m eager to understand more about the nature of the puzzles and characters that are part of the surreal game world, but this latest trailer does little to illuminate either.
Scorn is headed to Xbox Game Pass, but more generally will be available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and on the Cloud when it releases on October 21, 2022.]]></summary>

Arkane's spooky co-op FPS has been on my most anticipated list for a while, especially because I was hoping the studio would put their signature weird twist on things. Judging by the big guns and big abilities you have at your disposal, they have - and the vampires should be watching their be-caped backs. Never thought I'd see the day when someone made being a vampire hunter look cooler than being a vamp, but we might be getting there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[6/12 UPDATE: 
As we previously reported below, a leak heavily hinted that Forza Horizon 5's first expansion would be a Hot Wheels crossover. Today, at the Xbox Games Showcase, it was not only confirmed, but a high-speed trailer featuring the toy cars from our childhoods whizzed across the screen on the tracks and red loops we've come to know. You can watch the trailer above. The expansion hits on July 19. 
PREVIOUS STORY
According to Eurogamer, Forza Horizon 5’s first expansion – a Hot Wheels crossover – leaked on the Steam store listing and was immediately taken down. The listing was posted to Reddit, where it gained traction. You can see the image of the crossover below. 
This wouldn’t be the first time the two car-racing giants joined forces. Hot Wheels DLC packages sped onto the scenic tracks of Forza Motorsport 5 and Forza Horizon 3 and 4. What Playground Games has in store with its latest arcade racing simulator is anyone’s guess. 
Forza Horizon 5 cracked Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2021 list: 
“To merely say Forza Horizon 5 is among the most mechanically sound racing games ever created would be a disservice and overlook what makes the game worthy of praise. Yes, the foundational act of driving feels fantastic, but it’s the rest of the package that truly elevates this fifth entry in the series to the rarified air that demands a place on our list of the top 10 games of the year.”
Are you excited about the alleged crossover?

When it hits Early Access, Overwatch 2's PvP content will be free-to-play, giving players who want to play matches with or against friends the chance to do so at no cost. It'll also have a new character called The Junker Queen who got her own cinematic trailer, introducing her Mad-Max-meets-punk-rock persona in a handicap match against some nasty-looking fellas. The Junker Queen uses an ax and shotgun to tear through other heroes on the OW battlefield. We'll learn more about her on June 16, when Blizzard holds an Overwatch 2 reveal event.
Blizzard promises regular content updates for Overwatch 2, including new maps, modes, heroes, and even more. Also, because this showed up on the Xbox showcase doesn't mean the information above isn't any less true for the other platforms OW2 is planned to launch on. Overwatch 2 will hit Early Access on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC at the same time.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pete Hines took the stage at today's Xbox Showcase to introduce a bevy of Bethesda projects. Among looks at Elder Scrolls Online and a recap on Redfall, which kicked the event off in style, the Bethesda exec revealed a new expansion for Fallout 76. The company's online multiplayer game had a rough start, but Bethesda has continued to work on its title, with several story expansions and updates to the game's world. However, this is the first update we've had for the title in a while, as the last major expansion came last year.
The Pitt's story will take place in post-war Pittsburgh, a location we haven't seen since Fallout 3. Described as "a grim industrial wasteland crippled by conflict," players will be teaming up with the Union, a band of mechanically skilled fighters seeking to rid their home of raiders that have taken over called the Fanatics. This task will be made even harder by the fact that The Pitt's toxic wasteland is warping the mind of its inhabitants. 


Fallout 76's Expeditions: The Pitt is coming this September.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft and Mojang have revealed Minecraft Legends, an action strategy game coming to Xbox consoles and PC. 
This news comes from today’s Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase, where Mojang revealed the Legends trailer. The story shows the destruction of a village and the rebirth of a new land thanks to some heroic deeds of friendship, bravery, and more. According to the trailer, the game tells the story of a united overworld, and that overworld is to be united by none other than you, the player. 
Check out the reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Legends is quite the departure from the typical Minecraft formula. Breaking away from the survival crafting mold the series has held for over a decade, similar to what Minecraft Dungeons did in 2020, Legends will be the first action strategy game in Mojang’s blocky world. It also features a unique spin on the traditional Minecraft visuals.
It retains the blockiness fans of Minecraft have come to know and love, but with a more distinct, almost comic book-ey style. It looks great, and fortunately, we don’t have to wait too long to play it because it hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC sometime next year. 
While waiting for Minecraft Legends, read Game Informer’s Minecraft Dungeons review.

The new footage shows stealth maneuvers captured in striking detail. We see Amicia hiding under a table to evade a patrol and being surprisingly aggressive, using weapons to silently take out guards. We also see her use fire to create a blaze that will surely draw out every guard in the area.
Of course, Hugo's curse doesn't remain dormant for long and a flood of rats appears to keep him safe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early in today’s Xbox Game Showcase, Riot Games’ president, Marc Merrill, took a few minutes to announce a big new partnership with Xbox and its Game Pass program. A number of Riot’s biggest experiences are coming to Xbox Game Pass on mobile and PC, with relatively robust options unlocked for players to enjoy.
First, Riot’s flagship property, League of Legends, will see all champions unlocked on PC.
In League of Legends: Wild Rift, it’s a similar picture, with all champions unlocked on mobile gaming platforms.
In Legends of Runeterra, Game Pass players can expect to have the full Foundations set of cards unlocked. For those not in the know, as the name implies, that’s the foundational cards for the game, establishing the base mechanics. The card set will be available on both PC and mobile.
In Teamfight Tactics, players can expect select Little Legends to be unlocked, whether you play on PC or mobile.
And in Valorant, all agents will be unlocked on PC.
It’s a notable team-up that should give a boost to both Xbox and Riot. On the Riot side, the availability of so many characters and sets across the spectrum of their games means that a potentially huge audience of Xbox players could have a chance to experience a broad spectrum of what each of those games have to offer. To Xbox’s benefit, it offers a meaningful boost to the already potent draw of Xbox Games Pass as a service and experience, since players can gain access to a number of aspects of each of those Riot games without needing to pay additional costs.
While Riot’s expansion into Game Pass is big news, it’s worth noting that it won’t have much effect for players on Xbox consoles, as all the available options are coming to specific combinations of PC and mobile, depending on titles.
The availability of all of these options is said to be coming this winter for Game Pass subscribers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft and Turn 10 Studios have revealed Forza Motorsport (that’s right – there’s no number attached to this entry in the franchise) with a beautiful trailer. 
Revealed during today’s Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase, Turn 10’s latest motorsport game will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in spring of next year. The studio calls it the “most technologically advanced racing game ever made.” To highlight these technological advances, the team showcased Maple Valley, a fan-favorite track alongside news that the game will have a dynamic day-and-night cycle, a first for the Motorsport series.
Check out the reveal trailer for yourself below: 


Not to be confused with Playground Games’ Forza Horizon series, Motorsport is closer to a racing sim than it is an arcade racer, making it an especially great time for people who really like to get under the hood of the vehicles they race. To go with that, there’s plenty of environment tech happening in Forza Motorsport to simulate not just how the cars would drive, but how the time of day, the temperature associated with it, and more can affect the race. 
Check out this demo trailer for more information about that: 


All of it looks great thanks to ray-tracing, photorealism techniques, and more. That includes the car damage your vehicle will endure when you hit other drivers or barriers on the track, too. 
 
While waiting for it to hit Xbox consoles and PC next year, read Game Informer’s Forza Horizon 5 review.

It’s appropriately poppy and colorful, too, and it looks like a great time. Plus, we don’t have to wait too long to play it because it hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) later this year. 
“After a cartel of aliens invades Earth, a freshly minted high-school graduate grabs the nearest talking gun and becomes the deadliest intergalactic bounty hunter across the cosmos,” a press release reads. “The alien invaders in High On Life are on a mission to dominate Earth, but with a particularly sinister twist: Garmantuous and his cartel goons are intent on enslaving humanity and using them as a new drug.
“[Defeating] powerful aliens isn’t going to be easy; bounty hunters will work with (or against) NPCs, collect upgrades, and acquire an arsenal of talking guns on their journey. Each of these guns has its own unique personality and special gameplay, and they provide their own narrative take on what’s going on.” 

Squanch Games’ studio director Mike Fridley says to expect Roiland’s comedic voice to tie this game together with all of the studio’s other outputs. He says the studio wants players to look at any of its games and immediately know it’s a Squanch game. 
“I wanted to make games that I wanted to play, and that was the spark that sort of lit the fire of Squanch Games,” Roiland writes in a press release. “Then we shipped Trover, we shipped Accounting+, and now we’re on this absolute dream game that we were kind of building towards this whole time.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pelican aircraft from the Halo series is coming as a free add-on to Microsoft Flight Simulator, Xbox announced today during this year's Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase. Better yet, it's available now. 
The reveal came at the tail-end of a trailer for the Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary edition, which among other aircraft, adds the Wright Brothers' Wright Flyer airplane.
Our look at the Pelican was brief, though it did end with the aircraft hovering high above the Earth's stratosphere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arkane Studio’s Redfall kicked off the Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase with the first extended gameplay trailer.
The trailer sets the table for the adventure, which unfolds on the island of Redfall, Massachusetts. The idyllic town falls apart when residents disappear and, worse, become vampires. If that’s not enough, some survivors have taken to worshipping these night creatures as deranged cultists. Up to four players team up as a band of survivors who must fight back and escape Redfall with their lives intact. 


The crew consists of protagonist Layla, who wields telekinesis, the sniper Jacob, the engineer Remy (with a cute robot companion in tow), and cryptid hunter Devinder. The gameplay trailer shows how these four combine their abilities to combat hordes of undead, such as Layla creating a telekinetic elevator to launch an ally skyborne. 
Redfall releases in early 2023 for Xbox Series X/S and PC and will launch day one on Game Pass.]]></summary>

While still seeing some reported use today, unfortunately the same cannot be said for the quality of the VMEbus Linux support. After the VME subsystem was promoted out of staging a decade ago, the VME hardware drivers failed to ever leave staging and the code has fallen into disrepair and no maintenance now for the past half-decade. So the VME subsystem support is preparing to depart back to the land of the kernel's staging area...]]></summary>

This real-time switching means Morbid Metal moves very quickly. You might think hyphenated phrases like "high-octane", "action-packed", and "fast-paced" are moving in the direction of this game, but buddy this is going at such speed that they're already here.

Well, those brothers are now Team Clout and that game now exists, albeit called simply Ill. I've not got much to point you towards - there's no Steam Store page, no high-res press screens, no release window. Even calling the video from the Future Games Show a gameplay trailer is taking the biscuit, if not most of the factory floor at McVities. But the vibes, as they say, are immaculate: bare feet on a grubby floor, shambling horrors with many half-glimpsed appendages, and a gun that is surely too small to protect you from any of it. Resident Evil but injected with your most virulent 2022 strain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld has a new trailer. If you've seen Palworld's previous two trailers, those words alone should send you rushing below to see what new absurdity is on show. For the uninitiated: Palworld is a game in which you can catch off-brand Pokémon, put them to work in a sweatshop producing guns, and then do battle with these Nopémon by your side and and an assault rifle in your hands.

Watch the trailer, you'll see.

Cai, developer of The Cartomancy Anthology, as part of his efforts to dig into the mystery of why tarot is such a popular inspiration for indie games at the moment. Happily, after today's Future Of Play Direct, we can provide you with a little update on that story: Cai's expansive collaborative project is due to release on Steam very soon: on August 9th, 2022.

Milo might reasonably fall to his knees and scream "You blew it up, damn you!" when he gets there, because the earth he lands upon has been blown up several times larger than normal - either that or he's been made much smaller and is now the size of a penny. Milo must then have to navigate the abandoned world with a Pikmin-like army of aliens by his side, ready to solve puzzles. 

It looks great, and after being announced last year, Tinykin now has a release date of August 30th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there's anything I've learned from today's Future Of Play event, it's that stylish futuristic dystopian mysteries are where it's at right now in the indie scene, and I for one am all in favour. One of the coolest announcements at the event was Hill Agency: PURITYdecay, described as an "Indigenous cybernoir detective game" and in the works at Achimostawinan Games. Although maybe "in the works" isn't quite an accurate description, because the game is in fact out very soon: on August 31st this year, to be exact.
The trailer is a pitch-perfect hearkening back to the golden age hardboiled detective stories of the 1940s — complete with a black-and-white palette with just the occasional hint of colour to highlight the high-tech parts. High-tech because, despite its 20th century influences, this game is set quite far in the future, in 2262. It's not exactly a nice vision of the world in 240 years' time, though, as the narrator is quick to point out that it's riddled with "crime, conflict, and propaganda". Truly holding up a mirror to our times, then.

        <updated>2022-06-11T20:29:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2017's Serial Cleaner was all about stealthfully infiltrating a murder scene and cleaning up the mess before the cops got their hands on any evidence. Developer Draw Distance is taking that concept and expanding on it further with Serial Cleaners, offering more ways to play and even more gruesome crimes to cover up.


Unlike its 70s-inspired predecessor, Serial Cleaners pulls from pop culture of the 1990s, including Quinten Tarantino's body of work and other classic action and crime thrillers of the era. Once again, stealth is core to the experience; you can't let the authorities know what happened at each crime scene. Serial Cleaners brings four characters to mop up blood, bodies, and clues, each handling business in their own way. Players will utilize these new cleaners' street smarts, tech, brute force, or classic know-how to get the job done.
If you're ready to aid and abet in some gnarly virtual killings, Serial Cleaners is set to release on September 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-06-11T20:21:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We got a new look today at Arctic Awakening, the upcoming first-person narrative game from GoldFire Studios. Players control Kai, a cargo pilot who was on a relatively routine supply delivery to a small Alaskan town with his partner, when their plane goes down in the middle of nowhere. Donovan, the co-pilot, is lost out in the cold and snowy wastes, and Kai sets out to find him.
As Kai, you must explore the freezing cold wilds, and the environment is a constant threat. The game is set in April of 2062, so there are a few things that are a bit different than one might expect to find in a modern-day setting, including a court-mandated therapy bot that is along with you on your journey. The AI drone has no shortage of pithy commentary to share with you as you navigate the wilderness, but has little in the way of helpful tools or weapons that might aid in your survival efforts.
Beyond the exploration elements, Arctic Awakening focuses on narrative choice, and the way those choices shift the relationships and situations of the characters around you. The decisions you make also affect the way the game ends.
Beyond narrative elements, GoldFire Studios is promising dynamic weather that shifts over time, meaning even areas you’ve visited already may be different when you return to them a second time.
As Kai explores, it becomes increasingly apparent that something more sinister is going on out there in the wilderness. High-tech facilities and mysterious technology is everywhere, providing a sense of mystery tinged with terror.
Arctic Awakening is targeting launch on consoles, PC, and Mac something in 2023. It will be released as a collection of five 60-90 minute chapters for players to take on at their own pace.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most intriguing new announcements at today's Future Of Play event had to be Psychroma, a cyberpunk horror adventure game in the works by indie developer/publisher Rocket Adrift Games. The devs describe their game as a narrative-driven side-scroller where you play as a digital medium. Imagine something halfway between Observer and Detention, then, and you'll be on the right lines.
The trailer harks back to the point-and-click mysteries beloved of my misspent youth, which really fits in with Psychroma's whole retro futuristic vibe. It's got that clever pixel art style that looks exactly how you remember golden age adventure games looking in the '90s, which of course means that it's much, much more polished and modern than those games ever were.

        <updated>2022-06-11T19:56:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Future Games Show gave us a new look at Bramble: The Mountain King, a visually arresting upcoming game from Dimfrost Studio. Players control a young protagonist named Olle as he as he explores a world of misty Nordic fairy tales in a forbidding wilderness, and the strange and deadly creatures that crop up along the way. His journey is motivated by a hope to rescues his lost sister.
The studio is aiming to offer a compelling juxtaposition of beautiful natural environments and sudden, horrifying moments of danger – all reflected in high-quality visuals. That goal is clearly presented in the game’s footage, which has an attractive and lush art style that immediately captures the mood.
The studio describes a focus on “David vs. Goliath” bosses as you explore nature. As an illustration of the concept, the new trailer discusses the strange creature called the Näcken, perhaps inspired by the myth of the Nykr. In the game, the Näcken plays its magical violin from its watery home, and lures people to their deaths by drowning in the lake. He was once a normal man who was terribly bullied by those around him, who eventually snapped and killed everyone close to him – including the girl that he loved.
Based on the description explored in the trailer, it’s clear that Dimfrost is interested in exploring the backstories and foundational elements of each monster’s narratives as part of the unfolding game. The Näcken is just one of many strange creatures that players encounter in the game.
The footage reveals the young explorer navigating creepy 3D environments, often as imposing giant creatures lurk in the background. Gameplay is said to focus on puzzle-solving and platforming.
Dimfrost Studio is previously known for its work creating the 2017 release, A Writer And His Daughter, a VR exploration game.
Bramble: The Mountain King is on the way to PC and consoles later in 2022.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-06-11T19:47:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kumi Souls Games has been rather quiet on social media about its upcoming gothic-horror action game The Last Faith, but as part of the Future Games Show presentation, we were able to see how it's shaping up. The fresh footage shows Belmont-esque protagonist Eric as he brutalizes everything in his path, destroying plenty of beautifully drawn monsters, and faces off against a towering and salivating hydra beast.
The Last Faith borrows heavily from Castlevania and games like Dark souls, offering what looks to be a tough, violent affair. Eric has plenty of weapons and attacks in his arsenal including a fiery haymaker punch, a shocking electrified blade, and a shotgun to keep the enemies in check at mid-range. He also utilizes gruesome execution moves to take foes down for good; it's strangely impressive how gross some details of these attacks come off in the pixel low-rez art.
Following a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2020, Kumi Souls Games have been hard at work on the 2D action game. Since then, publisher Playstack has picked up The Last Faith for distribution, and the final game is starting to come together.
We don't have an exact release date for The Last Faith quite yet, but the trailer does solidify a 2022 launch target on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The summer showcases are going strong, and we've seen plenty of games that catch our eye. After the Future Games Show today, we'll be adding one more to the list: Sunday Gold. 
Sunday Gold is a "classic adventure" game from developer BKOM Studios and publisher Team17. The point-and-click, turn-based title has serious Disco Elysium vibes, though its dystopian future London looks to be a little more over-the-top. The game's leading characters, a group of scrappy criminals, are on a mission to reveal the truth behind the unethical business practices of corrupt billionaire, Keny Hogan. And today's trailer showed the bombastic length's they're ready to go to achieve that goal. Check out the world premiere trailer below.


Fully voiced and filled with puzzles alongside the combat, Sunday Gold is set to launch on PC later this year.]]></summary>

This SEO nightmare is being developed by Bit Loom, the team behind colourful yet somehow unsettling puzzle game Phogs, and it's about racing down sand dunes on trays. As the trailer says, "the world ended... But the fun didn’t!", and I guess winning a dune race would take your mind off the unending horror for a bit.

"We were sent here with a purpose," the voice murmurs soothingly, then adds: "But we're not doing that any more."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the Summer Game Fest's adjacent livestream events, Epic Games did it's own thing to show off this year, and first on the docket was the reveal of a Lord Of The Rings Game that, as a lapsed fan, I'm actually interested in. The Lord Of The Rings: Return To Moria is a multiplayer action survival game about the Dwarves trying to reclaim the most cursed mine in all of fantasy canon. It's due out in Spring 2023 and will, of course, be an Epic Games Store exclusive.

That’s essentially the cut and thrust of Moving Pictures Interactive’s roguelite co-op action adventure Shoulders Of Giants, coming to the Epic Games Store later this year. They’re not quite a 21st century Banjo-Kazooie, but they’ll do in a pinch.

Equally, what is building a jigsaw but piecing together an analogue cardboard PC you can't do anything with after it's finished? These similarities are why building a PC isn't as strange a subject for a videogame as it first appears.

If you like your electric jigsaws, then good news: there's now an open beta available for PC Building Simulator 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since Diablo Immortal launched amid a storm of controversy last week, people have been trying to work out how much it really costs to play this theoretically free game. I'll be honest that maths has never been my strongest suit, but figuring out how games work under-the-hood is one of my favourite things to do. So I've spent most of this week chasing answers, and I've come up with a ballpark estimate of what it would cost to max out your character. The answer is: £46,000, or $51,000, to fully equip your character with the best gear as quickly as possible using premium currencies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One time in the office (so, a hundred years ago) a hypothetical was posed: if you were given the chance to go to the moon, with a guarantee that nothing would go wrong, would you take it? "No," I said. "No way. Not a chance. I wouldn't like it." People were shocked at my refusal. "But nothing will go wrong!" they exclaimed. This misses the universal truth that even - and indeed, especially - when it is guaranteed nothing will go wrong, something will always go wrong in space.
Honestly, who can say that they've played a video game set on a space station and not encountered at least one deserted corridor plunged into darkness, but with one spotlight tipped over onto its side to cast ominous shadows? Raise your hands. Terror in space has never gone out of fashion, really, but the source of the terror does seem to go in cycles. In the 2010s a lot of the danger came from an AI gone a bit sinister and funny. As we saw at last night's Summer Game Fest, though, the monsters are back, baby.

From Free Lives, the creators of Broforce and Genital Jousting, it’s so aggressively kicky that I don’t feel like going near doors anytime soon. They describe it as a “lightning fast hard bass blast of kicking down doors and kicking ass”. Good grief. Keep an eye on the threatening tootsies in the trailer below.

It's got a spacefaring train in it, which I always think is cute; but also it's got anime waifus in it and those make me cringe. Its new trailer, which you'll find below, is dynamic and exciting and well-edited; but... it's got cringy anime waifus in it.

Watch it and make up your own mind.

Tim Schafer and friends revealed more about some stonking looking indies from places as far apart as the Netherlands, Japan and Argentina. It was lovely to see some solo devs featured too, such as Madison Karrh with Birth, a point-and-click puzzler about loneliness, and Billy Basso’s beautiful pixel-art Metroidvania Animal Well.

Then, earlier this year, they announced The Cub, a side-scrolling platformer telling a parallel story of one of the poor souls left behind on our home planet while the rest of humanity buggered off to Mars.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry's Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!

If any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we'll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. 
Please note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we've been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!
