        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've said it before, but I really keep meaning to play Ctrl Alt Ego. Released last year, it's a sci-fi immersive sim built all around classic abilities of the genre: remote control and possession. You bounce your digital consciousness between robots and devices and ach, I hear it's great. I've bought it. I've installed it. I've played the first part of the tutorial. And then, who knows. One day. One day very soon. But right now, for people who have played it, good news: a free update has added a Sandbox mode generating squillions of new levels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse set to arrive in theaters in just over a week, it should come as no surprise that Fortnite is adding some items and costumes to the most expansive IP crossover in gaming history. As teased yesterday, Miles Morales and Miguel O'Hara (AKA Spider-Man 2099) are joining Fortnite in promotion of the highly anticipated film.
The new additions, which include reskinned Spider-Man's Web-Shooters – now called Spider-Verse Web-Shooters – and two new Outfits, accompany Spider-Man themed Week 11 Quests. Epic Games teases that the Web-Shooters, in particular, will come in handy in those Quests. While most of those Quests award XP, one will give you the "Silk & Cologne (EI8HT version)" lobby track from Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.
If this sounds up your alley, you can find the Spider-Verse Web-Shooters on the ground or by exchanging bars for them from Spider-Gwen. You can also find the Spider-Man (Miles Morales) Outfit, which includes the masked Earth 1610 alt style and the Spider-Verse Portal Back Bling, as well as the Spider-Man 2099 Outfit, which includes the 2099 Web Cape Back Bling, in the Item Shop. These items, along with other accessories, can be purchased as part of the Across the Spider-Verse Bundle. That bundle includes the Mega City Swing Loading Screen.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse arrives in theaters on June 2.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it was announced in February, Samba de Amigo: Party Central excited many who look back on the 2000 Dreamcast/Arcade title with a nostalgic fondness. The rhythm game, which tasks players with shaking maracas to the beat of popular songs, finally has a concrete release date. Players can expect to transform their Joy-Cons into maracas when the Switch-exclusive title launches on August 29. 
Samba de Amigo: Party Central's launch soundtrack already features 40 popular tracks from artists like Ariana Grande, Kesha, Nicki Minaj, and Carly Rae Jepsen, as well as some tracks from Sonic Adventure 2 and Sonic Forces. While "City Escape" and "Fist Bump" from those games are a part of the launch lineup, fans of Sega's lineup of games can anticipate even more content from Sonic, as well as other Sega franchises, through downloadable content.
The Sonic Music DLC Pack includes "Open Your Heart" from Sonic Adventure, "Reach for the Stars" from Sonic Colors: Ultimate, and "I'm Here" from Sonic Frontiers. The Sega Music DLC Pack includes "Bakamitai (Taxi Driver Edition)" from the Yakuza series, "Go Go Cheer Girl!" from Space Channel 5: Part 2, and "Rhythm Thief Theme" from "Rhythm Thief & the Emperor's Treasure.
All of these DLC tracks are included as part of the Digital Deluxe Edition, which will be available on the Nintendo eShop for $50. The Digital Deluxe version also includes special costumes for Sonic, Tails, Space Channel 5, Super Monkey Ball, and Puyo Puyo, further hammering home the Sega theme in this game. The standard edition costs $40.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For whatever reason, I'm quite good at reading physical books, but when presented with a visual novel game my attention span slumps. "It's not you, it's me", rings true here, as it's definitely not the fault of the video games. I trust that Phoenix Wright or Paranormasight are brilliant, but the sudden act of having to read lots in a game has never worked out for me.
Then Citizen Sleeper came along for this month's RPS Game Club - and I think I'm a changed man? I think I now get why people are excited about static images and dialogue boxes. And I'm certain it's the game's cyclic nature that's managed to lasso my brain and keep it focused on the task at hand: help an AI trapped in a vending machine.

After teasing an Across the Spider-Verse film crossover event for a week now with "Where is Miles Morales?" posters: we're entering the final stage of Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 2 with this latest spider-themed update. Accompanying a series of Week 11 quests are two new skins (Miles and Spider-Man 2099), alongside of the return of the Web-Shooter item.
This season is extremely motion-heavy, with katana airdashes, lightsaber double-jumps, and omni-directional mobility gear from Attack on Titan. It's a veritable buffet of crossovers and one of the most densely packed seasons in that regard. It's a bit much at times, but it's one of my favorite seasons in recent memory as there's a lot going on, no-build mode is still a staple, and weekly quests no longer operate …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After giving us an early glimpse of its unstoppable raptor hordes in a closed beta test last summer, Capcom recently let us loose with the opening hours of their upcoming dinosaur multiplayer shooter, Exoprimal. Its final release isn't far away now - its July 14th launch fast becoming the sole highlight of an otherwise desolate month - and I was excited to finally play the game that RPS vid bud Liam literally hasn't been able to stop talking about ever since he first clapped eyes (and his thumbs) on its somersaulting T-Rexes. (You should also read his excellent interview with the devs while you're at it, too). 
I'll hold my hands up now and say I didn't get to play as much of Exoprimal as I would have liked, but the handful of missions I did play really are as daft and brilliant as Liam described last year. I won't waste time repeating its fundamentals (you can read them here), but the basic setup is thus: in a world plagued by dinosaurs that periodically pour out of strange portals for some reason, you play a rookie dino hunter that gets pulled into a time-looping wargame set up by your company's clearly psychotic AI called Leviathan. In order to gather valuable 'combat data' for its simulations to fight said dinosaur threat, Leviathan endlessly ropes you and other rookie exosuit wearers into deadly feats of speed and skill. It's a neat, if patently preposterous setup for its 5v5 PvP multiplayer missions, but the thing that struck me most wasn't its gloriously silly dinosaurs or Leviathan's perfectly pitched ham lines. It was its bot companions, because heck, they're great to play with, but absolute fiends if you're on the wrong side of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no secret that Sony have been making increasing efforts to bring their exclusive PlayStation games to PC over the last couple of years, but one thing they've never quite been clear about is when we can expect to see them. They said a few years ago that we obviously shouldn't expect a simultaneous launch release, but some such as Death Stranding and The Last Of Us Part 1 have taken as little as six to eight months to come across, while others such as Spider-Man and Uncharted 4 have taken several years. 
According to PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, though, data from fans seem to suggest that the only "acceptable" route from a player point of view is a wait of two to three years. Outrageous, I say, but also: surely that means the long-sought-after Bloodborne must be next in line, right? Surely. It's been eight years, come on now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Please apply as soon as possible."
We've been pouring many drinks out for the Wii U since it was officially canned, but we're running out of imbibements! Eventually, the Wii U will become a faded memory for some folks, brought up once a year in vague terms, like: "Hey remember that tablet you could play Luigi hide and seek with? What was the name of that thing? Anyway...."
That time is coming sooner than later, according to a new posting on Nintendo of Japan's official website. The publisher explains that they're running out of Wii U repair parts, and once they're gone, they're gone. Here's the full statement from Nintendo of Japan (Google translated):
"For Wii U peripherals (Wii U GamePad, etc.), we will stop accepting repairs at the same time as the Wii U itself. If the inventory of parts required for repairing a peripheral device runs out before the end of repair acceptance for the Wii U console, we will stop accepting repair requests for the peripheral device for which we have run out of parts inventory."

Nintendo also makes this double-clear on that same page, noting:
"If you are considering repairing the Wii U console or peripherals, please apply as soon as possible."

We knew this was coming, but it's sad all the same
Part of me is saying "well, the vast majority of folks probably thought this happened ages ago," but seeing a system die out in real time is still a bummer. I had a lot of great times with the Wii U and there were plenty of fantastic games for it, and I hope any and all preservation efforts for it are fruitful for years to come.
Mine still works at least!
[Thanks John!]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Psychoactive.
Nightmare Reaper’s procedurally generated stages are as rawly aggressive as the thrash metal motifs that drive it. Coined a looter-shooter, it’s a roguelite that revels in retro visuals, blazing speeds, and the ensuing spectacle of its bloodbath.
In a novel move, it procedurally generates levels, meaning each time you die or start over, things have changed. The aesthetic alters by chapter, shifting from watery pits and spiky tombs to hospital wards and cities; and, if you can find them, space stations where pets can be purchased that help you uncover secrets. The layouts are mostly unique with each new playthrough, but hitting switches, finding keys, or locating suspicious walls to kick through is a constant. At its best, the procedural element generates levels that feel deliberate, which is impressive considering its layering. That said, it’s not perfect, with sections occasionally recycling, dead ends cropping up, and on one occasion, an impassable early jump that forced us to quit the stage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetEase Games has announced the founding of a new game studio based in Canada. The studio is headed up by Sean Crooks, a former Ubisoft producer with credits ranging from Just Dance and Driver to the Watch Dogs franchise. Other members of the team include developers who have worked on series like Splinter Cell, Army of Two, Far Cry, and Child of Light.
The team hopes its first project will kickstart a new franchise. The title is an open-world, story-driven action/adventure title that draws inspiration from '80s action and horror films. Bad Brain is using Unreal Engine 5 to develop its debut title, which will launch across multiple platforms.
"I'm honored to be leading this talented team of developers in Canada," Crooks said in a press release. "We're all passionate about creating memorable and meaningful experiences. NetEase Games has given us a warm welcome, with an abundance of support and creative freedom to allow us to do what we do best. Our first game is a passion project that gives us the opportunity to truly free our brains."
NetEase, which is based in China, views this as an investment in the Canadian game-development industry. "We're thrilled to welcome Bad Brain Game Studios into our family and enriching our presence in Canada," NetEase Games president of global investments and partnerships Simon Zhu said in that same release. "With this new studio, NetEase Games continues its commitment to nurturing top-tier talent in Canada and creating games that players love. Canada has a thriving gaming industry, and we're excited to continue to be a part of it. We believe that our talented teams in Toronto, Montreal, and beyond will create some of the most innovative and exciting games the industry has seen."
Bad Brain Game Studios will have offices in Toronto, Ontario, and Montreal, Quebec, and will operate using a hybrid work model. To learn more, you can visit the studio's official website.]]></summary>

In an interview with GQ, he talked about the baggage that inevitably comes with having a 35-year-old series with soon to be 16 numbered mainline games in it (not including the sequels and spin-offs, I might add), and the confusion it continues to create with new players. "Every numbered title we release in the series, we have to go into it like, 'It's OK, you don't have to play the rest of them,'" he said, and removing them is "something that I've discussed with the higher-ups". It's an understandable problem, for sure, although I think I'd be quite sad to see the numerals go entirely. As long as they don't pull a Mortal Kombat and go back to 1, though, we're good.

[Update: Devolver Digital has announced that a Nintendo Switch port fo Weird West: Definitive Edition is in the works. A release date was not announced.]
https://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1660658264311226368?s=20
Devolver Digital has announced that its fantasy gunslingin' adventure Weird West is to receive a "Definitive Edition" release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X platforms next week, bringing Wolfeye Studios' strange frontier of cowboys and monsters to the ninth generation of gaming.
Released in the spring of 2022, Weird West is an anthology title that tells the story of five distinct characters, each forced to face a bizarre and twisted version of America's formative period. Utilizing a top-down perspective and with a heavy emphasis on exploration, combat, and environmental interaction, Weird West was praised for its pulpy writing, creepy character design, and interesting world, though some of its action and technical elements gave critics pause.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NS3lzv0Nw4&ab_channel=DevolverDigital
Weird West: Definitive Edition will see the game launch on modern platforms, boasting new 4K resolution options and running at 60 FPS. Hopefully, with these visual upgrades and the power of Gen 9, some of the game's stiffer creases will be ironed out. Here's hoping, as Weird West is certainly charming in its own peculiar way, and any fans of alternate realities, old-school horror comics, or twin-stick action would do well to test the murky waters of Wolfeye's adventure.
Weird West: Definitive Edition launches May 8 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X. It is already available on PC, PS4, and Xbox One in its standard form. Devolver has not yet confirmed a free upgrade option.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get booked in soon.
Nintendo's Japanese support service has announced that it will be ending repair support for the Wii U. When exactly? Well, that really depends on when its current parts inventory runs out.
The announcement was made on the Japanese Nintendo Support Page, confirming that the period of holding repair parts for the Wii U has now passed. As such, customers requiring a repair will need to book in sooner rather than later. Nintendo is unable to provide guidance as to when the repair support will end as this is contingent on remaining stock.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last july I was given the opportunity to play an early beta for Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer shooter that pits you and a bunch of your mech suit-wearing buddies against unstoppable raptor hordes. In the nine months since I took command of a T-Rex and did a sick backflip, my life has not known peace. “I’m really excited to play Exoprimal” I’ll say to colleagues, unprompted, in important meetings unrelated to anything prehistoric in nature. “From what I've played, it blends PvE and PvP gameplay into a single multiplayer mode that feels very unique and hugely entertaining”. My tax return was voided because I drew a big stegosaurus on it. I have renamed the cat “Sniper Neosaur”, and I am disappointed that she has yet to emerge from a gooey purple orb.


It was my delight, then, to be given the opportunity to sit down with key members of the game’s development team to discuss Exoprimal’s inspirations, its inevitable comparisons to Dino Crisis and how Capcom plans to use it as a template for their live-service games moving forward. Alongside a fresh opportunity to check out the game, I hopped onto a Zoom call with Exoprimal’s director Takuro Hiraoka, technical director Kazuki Abe and art director Takuro Fuse.

For many of us, it's fair to say that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has taken over our every waking moment. This was all well and good when you could pour endless hours into exploring, blissfully unaware of the total playtime racking up behind the "Played in the last 10 days" message on your Switch Profile screen. But, if you got the game on launch day, that safety net has now disappeared.
Yep. Those of us who bought (and played) Tears of the Kingdom on 12th May can now see our total number of hours spent in Hyrule on our own Switches (formally, the only way to see this was via a friend's profile). We will be seeing more playtimes over the coming days as an increasing number of people get out of the 10-day induction period, but some of the totals that we have seen so far are, uhh, impressive...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That's not how The Force works
According to new rumors published online, a release date is still up in the air for Ubisoft's as-yet-untitled Star Wars release, which has been in development at Ubisoft Massive for several years now. According to Kotaku sources, an initial plan to launch the title by spring 2024 is on the rocks, with the open-world adventure possibly being pushed to spring 2025 instead.
First announced in January 2021, Ubisoft's Star Wars release is being touted as a truly epic open-world experience, that will capture the scale and grandeur of the blockbuster movie series, along with its worlds and characters. The game is expected to follow a wholly original storyline featuring brand-new heroes and villains, but will feature themes, elements, and an aesthetic familiar to all fans of a galaxy far, far away. Another tale told in the expansive pantheon of adventures inspired by the Lucasfilm series.
However, it seems that the ambition of the title will see it pushed backward from its supposed launch date and — according to Kotaku's sources, a delay is all-but-inevitable. In its most recent financial report, Ubisoft listed some of its upcoming releases, which included the stealth sequel Assassin's Creed Mirage, online shooter XDefiant, and racer The Crew Motorfest. Given its crowded schedule and the size of the project, it's a fair bet to suggest that Star Wars is at least a full year away at the very least.
Ubisoft's Star Wars project is currently in development at Ubisoft Massive.

Insomniac has confirmed that its upcoming comic-book sequel Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will deliver an "epic, single-player experience" when it arrives on PS5 later this year, seemingly shutting down recent whispers that the studio was developing a co-op title for its latest adventure.
Insomniac quietly made the confirmation in a simple Twitter response to a fan who straight-up asked the studio if there was any truth in the rumors — rumors that suggested Peter Parker and Miles Morales would be teaming up for double arachnid action across the rooftops of Manhatten. But Insomniac succinctly noted that Spider-Man 2 is being developed as another single-player title, much like the original Marvel's Spider-Man and its excellent spin-off Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales.
https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/1660732829934964736?s=20
All that said, the new sequel is expected to feature both characters, suggesting twin campaigns with the player swapping between each. It is believed that the duo will meet up with various allies and enemies from the Marvel universe, eventually leading to the gunky doorstep of the vicious symbiote, Venom. The alien antagonist will be voiced by Candyman star and unquestionable horror legend Tony Todd.
If you'd like to get an early start on the new sequel's narrative, then be sure to check out the tie-in comic book, released by Marvel for Free Comic Book Day. You can check out our report on the issue here.
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is scheduled to launch on PS5 later in 2023.

Exoprimal’s time-traveling, dinosaur-blasting premise firmly positions it as one of the strangest multiplayer shooters on the horizon.

As a quick primer, Exoprimal tasks you and four other friends to team up to battle waves of invading dinosaurs. Outfitted in specialized exosuits, you’ll blast apart velociraptors, triceratops, and mighty T-Rexes in a race to finish missions befor…]]></summary>

Although the Mario Movie is now available to rent and buy in certain parts of the world, it's still setting records in cinemas around the world.
The latest update from Collider reveals the Illumination and Nintendo production has now officially overtaken Disney's Incredibles 2 to become the "third-biggest animated movie of all time" at the global box (not counting the 2019 remake of The Lion King).

The Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has been out for a few weeks now and it seems another easy duplication glitch has been discovered.
Instead of the bow and arrow trick, this one requires Link to jump off a ledge, pull out his paraglider, and then multiply inventory items before he hits the ground. You can see this new "dupe method" on display in the video below - allowing the player to get 20 Diamonds in under 30 seconds!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toil and trouble
Puzzle Bobble has been around roughly forever and has received far more sequels than its progenitor, Bubble Bobble, probably ever will. Far more than I can keep track of. I’ve generally been staying in my safe bubble (heh) of the first two titles.
Generally, the Puzzle Bobble formula is simple enough that there isn’t a whole lot of room for variation. New bubbles, power-ups, selectable characters; you can’t shake things up too much. With that in mind, Puzzle Bobble Everybubble is the best one I’ve played. And that’s simply because it’s the first I’ve played with co-op.
It’s not the first game in the series to have co-op (Bust-a-Move Bash on Wii allowed for 8-player cooperative), but it is the one that is most thoughtful about it, and that goes a long way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It says a build could have been around for some time
Bloodborne lovers who use Twitter know the pain of seeing the game trending every other day only to find out it's for old reasons. This time around, it's for a surprising new development.
Bloodborne only has two real problems. The first is that it doesn't run at a stable 60 FPS. The second is that it isn't on PC. Lance McDonald, a prolific hacker in the Bloodborne scene, has discovered what he believes is proof that there is a PC port of Bloodborne.
https://twitter.com/manfightdragon/status/1660129358235996161?s=20
In short, McDonald spotted a screenshot taken by Marcos Domenech, a FromSoftware developer, and says they were taken with a Windows build. McDonald has claimed that Bloodborne has had a Windows build since as far back as 2014, but says this particular version may be such a complete version that it even features the game's DLC. This is due to context clues from the screenshots themselves, like the loading icon, to the screens coming from the Fishing Hamlet.
Alongside porting the game to a new platform, a Bloodborne PC build could also overcome the game's FPS limits. McDonald himself has published a 60 FPS patch for Bloodborne in the past, so it seems quite doable, especially with a PC's power behind it.
The long night
Nothing has been announced from FromSoftware in terms of a PC port happening. The hope would be that Bloodborne could get a port onto PC, a move that could follow in the steps of very successful ports like God Of War and Spider-Man. (And hopefully not like The Last of Us Part 1's PC port.) McDonald doesn't seem quite that optimistic, though, saying it's just "trivia" or frustration, knowing the build could exist somewhere.
Bloodborne coming to PC could open the game up to a new batch of players, much like it did for the Souls games following their ports to PC. For now, we're still stuck waiting to see.

Well, E3 is dead. It has officially ceased to be. That doesn't mean E3 predictions have to die. It just means we have lots of different streams to predict for now. In the past, we'd collect community questions and do a long-form predictions post where we divine the outcome by tarot cards or zoo animals. Maybe a coin toss or Magic 8-Ball shake.
I prefer tarot because I'm a shut-in, and the zoo is a three-to-four-hour drive. I've buckled down and studied this last year too, reading tarot books and collecting decks in numbers that would probably disturb most YouTube and TikTok readers. And unlike them, I know the Ten of Swords means your ex isn't coming back.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the PlayStation 3 generation, updates released on a game’s launch day, colloquially known as Day One patches or updates, have been the norm. Sometimes they’re small, squashing a few last-minute bugs, but other times, they’re massive and nigh essential to enjoying the adventure before you. 
However, Day One patches draw criticism from players excited to jump into the action, only to be left watching a download bar fill up. Some players with slower internet or limited access might be left waiting for hours, if not days, depending on download speeds. During my Final Fantasy XVI cover story trip, I asked the team about its March accomplishment of going gold and what the team was working on now. 
Final Fantasy XVI has gone gold.
#FF16's launch on June 22nd 🐺 pic.twitter.com/Vrtd3cMNW5
March 31, 2023
To my surprise, developer Creative Business Unit III isn’t working on a day one patch, a revelation that continues to become rarer with each new release in games. Director Hiroshi Takai gave me a few reasons as to why. 
The first is that the team is confident in its final build of Final Fantasy XVI. The second is that he and producer Naoki Yoshida (and the rest of the CBUIII team) believe the game should be ready to go at launch, recognizing that not everyone has access to the internet needed to download a day one patch in light of Final Fantasy XVI’s global simultaneous release. So as of right now, we won’t be downloading a big patch on June 22 when the game hits PlayStation 5. 
However, Takai notes that CBUIII is testing the game daily and searching for bugs, and things could change as a result, but right now, like in the days of old Final Fantasy, this entry should work entirely as expected out of the box.

Pokemon Scarlet & Violet have seen an absolute whirlwind of bug-related issues since launch. However, this past weekend may mark one of the lowest points for the games yet. First, Pokemon Home integration was prematurely announced and then swiftly recalled, with the note that support would be added “soon.” Then, within the same 24-hour period, dedicated Scarlet & Violet players found that all Tera Raid events scheduled for this weekend were completely pulled.
Game Freak initially announced that trainers could face Great Tusk and Iron Treads as event Tera Raid battles from May 19 to May 21.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the last six years, my Skyrim wood elf has been stuck in some godforsaken cave in goodness knows what corner of Tamriel. I don't remember why they were there, or what goal they were trying to achieve. It was just 'one of those caves' that looked cool and interesting when I came across it and I thought, 'Yeah, all right, let's have a go then, shall we?' But while other Skyrim caves I'd come across could be easily polished off in an office lunch-time - as that was often how I played Skyrim back then - this one was different somehow. It was so large and twisty, so infinitely befuddling, that I seemed to be trapped down there forever. Sure, I could have probably turned back, but I'd been down there for ages, and felt like I'd come too far to simply not see it all through to the bitter end. But the end never came, and I eventually abandoned my save as a result, whisked off by the prospect of newer, more exciting games that didn't involve trying to figure out how to escape its narrow, bioluminescent hellscape.
Worse still, this disastrous feat of orienteering has now become my overriding memory of Skyrim. For all its great sidequests and its ever-increasing number of excellent mods, all I ever think about are its damn caves. Just the thought of loading up that save file again makes me grimace, and I'm starting to dread the thought of getting stuck in another one whenever the heck The Elder Scrolls 6 comes out. But I've been playing a lot of The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom this past week, and cor, I'm immediately jealous of Link's Ascend ability. As part of his new slate of powers, Ascend lets him instantly woosh through almost any ceiling as long as there's a traversable bit of terrain above it. That kind of power wouldn't have been half handy for my poor old wood elf, and it's precisely what makes exploring Tears Of The Kingdom's caves so enjoyable. So if there's one thing The Elder Scrolls 6 should steal take note of, please let it be this.

It's been 10 days since The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom went live for Nintendo Switch. And thanks to the way Nintendo's system tracks playtime, that means we are now at the point where launch Tears of the Kingdom players can see their hour count.
A long-standing quirk of the Switch has been that it doesn't count hours played until 10 days after you first played a game. A little weird, but that limit is now off for those who picked up and played Tears of the Kingdom on day one.
Just head over to your Nintendo Switch profile using the icon in the top-left of your home page, and you should see Tears of the Kingdom's hour count. Keep in mind, Nintendo also rounds off hour counts to multiples of 5. It's not quite as exact as something like Steam, but it's an hour count for Tears of the Kingdom nonetheless.
[caption id="attachment_380902" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
For the record, my own hour count after 10 days of play sits at 70 hours or more, which is pretty respectable, I'd say. It still only feels like I'm grazing the surface of the game, though. Seriously, how big are the Depths?
Spending years in the Kingdom
So yes, now you can encourage your friends to share their own hour count and boast who has more. It's a testament to this entry that even though we're back in Hyrule, the changes are so substantial that I still feel there's so much to explore. I haven't been to the floating cubes, nor have I progressed too far into Tarrey Town's house-building possibilities. Heck, I still want to see what they did over on Eventide this time around.
Feel free to share your Tears of the Kingdom hour count in the comments below!

We've often found ourselves wondering a lot of things about the Legend of Zelda franchise and, more specifically, its main protagonist, Link. Which Link is the strongest? What does he do in his spare time? Just how long does he really sleep?
What we've never really considered, however, is which Link is perhaps the stinkiest. We're almost certain that no version of Link smells absolutely perfect - consider the strenuous exercise he puts himself through in each game, for one - but as for which is the absolute stinkiest? That's frankly lost on us.

Weird West — a gun-slinging action RPG from the co-creators of Dishonored and Prey — released in March 2022 on Steam, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One before heading to next-gen consoles earlier this month, and publisher Devolver Digital has today announced that the game will be shooting its way over to Switch too.
This reveal is thanks to a surprise Amazon listing that appeared earlier on today, which showed the game's Switch box alongside a 22nd September release date. Shocked by the discovery of this before an official announcement, Gematsu reached out to the publishers on Twitter for some confirmation, which was met with the following response:

The All Elite Wrestling fighting game AEW: Fight Forever has set a date for its debut in the ring. The new wrestling competitor will arrive on June 29, 2023.
In a video today featuring AEW wrestler and video game fan Kenny Omega, the release date in June is locked in for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch. THQ Nordic is partnering with All Elite Wrestling for publishing, while former WWE 2K developer Yuke's is developing the new title.

The release and readiness of AEW: Fight Forever has been up in the air for some time. Since it was first revealed, the project has gone through some bumps. We've seen some hints of it and its minigames over the years, but now it looks to be arriving, and pretty soon at that.
As for features, AEW: Fight Forever is boasting a fair number of modes, as well as the customization options you usually like to see in a wrestling game. Attire, appearance, move sets, entrances, teams, and arenas are all part of the customization. Add in the AEW roster and online play, and it's looking like it could put up some competiton.
A new fighter enters the ring
Competition is what wrestling fans are hoping for, I think. The WWE 2K series has had some serious ups-and-downs lately, and even when it's somewhat stabilized out, I still see some reminiscing about the old days of No Mercy.
There seems to be a hope for rekindling some of that older-school arcade magic here, and for those who want that, I hope they get it. Either way, I'm interested to see how a new wrestling entry is received, and if it can shake up the wrestling genre.
AEW: Fight Forever heads to PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on June 29, 2023.

Be it State of Plays, PlayStation Showcases, or even PlayStation Blogs, it’s clear Final Fantasy XVI is a big release for Sony. 
During my cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, offices, I asked producer Naoki Yoshida how developer Creative Business Unit III feels about the game’s PS5 exclusivity and what that does for the studio in terms of development. He says it’s important to distinguish that CBUIII doesn’t go into game development thinking it wants to limit a game to just one platform or company. When the team started development on FFXVI, the studio “looked at all options,” Yoshida says.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's working! Victory is assured. My retirement tomorrow will be all the sweeter.
LEGO certainly hit the gold mine when it realized there are tens of thousands, if not millions, of childless man-children like myself with disposable income who'd rather spend their money on toys than whatever adults our age spent their money on in the past. Drugs, probably. Over the past few years, we've seen several sets from the company aimed squarely at the young Gen-X/old Millenial crowd. Sets like the LEGO NES, the LEGO Atari 2600, the LEGO Optimus Prime, and that $500 Lord of the Rings Rivendell set. Even the classic LEGO Death Star sets didn't reach that high in price. Now, we get about one or two a year that cost that or more. The new LEGO Pac-Man Arcade won't set you back as much as a trip to Rivendell, but it'll still cost you more than a few quarters.
Following the NES and the Atari 2600, LEGO has announced the classic Pac-Man arcade will be the next '80s arcade gaming device to get the LEGO brick treatment. The set is a miniature version of the countertop cabinet, complete with a joystick, a quarter slot that lights up, and an even smaller version of the original cabinet for the included Minifigure. To add a level of interactivity, the set also features a hand crank that will move Pac-Man and the ghosts on the cabinet screen.
https://twitter.com/LEGO_Group/status/1660559964748886016
I would have much preferred a Ms. Pac-Man set, but I think this one is cool enough for me to add to my collection of unopened LEGO sets that I don't have any room to display. If you've got a pocket full of quarters and are heading to the arcade, you can get the LEGO Pac-Man Arcade starting June 4, 2023, for $269.99.

Hamster has today announced that the second game in Arika's tough Tetris series, Tetris The Absolute Grandmaster 2 Plus, will be dropping down onto the Switch via the Arcade Archives collection on 1st June (thanks, Gematsu).
The game's predecessor, Tetris The Grand Master, was added to the Archives at the end of last year and this second entry promises much of the same challenging twists on the classic block-aligning format. Alongside the split-second gameplay of the series' Master Mode, this version of the sequel also adds a Normal Mode for more casual players and new challenges in the shape of TGM+ and T.A. Death which adds a rising garbage mechanic and increased gravity respectively.

Tears of the Kingdom is taking the world by storm, and you might want to rep it via the Nintendo Switch Online system. That's where icons come in! Following the release of Wave 1 last week, Nintendo just dropped Wave 2 of its My Nintendo Switch icon rewards this past weekend, and you have a few more days to pick them up (until May 25 at 5:59 PM PT, to be exact).
https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1656826529811144706
Wave 2 of the Tears of the Kingdom icon suite includes (all icons are priced at 10 Platinum Points):
Riju (Gerudo)
Sidon (Zora)
Tulin (Rito)
Ganondorf
Also, there are a few more icons that are still available in the general pool:
Link kneeling on a sky island
Link sheathing his sword
A Zonai
A horde of enemies
The Master Sword (no background)
A silhouette of the Master Sword (black background)
Here's the full visual suite for Wave 2, including backgrounds and frames:
[gallery link="file" columns="2" size="large" ids="380847,380848"]
Need Platinum Points?
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All Elite Wrestling fans have anxiously awaited the company’s first video game AEW: Fight Forever, since its announcement in 2020. That wait finally comes to an end next month.
As announced by AEW star and executive VP Kenny Omega in the trailer below, Fight Forever is launching on June 29. Developed by the former long-time maker of WWE games Yuke’s and published by THQ Nordic, the game serves as a throwback to the ‘90s-era AKI-engine arcade-style games like WCW/nWo Revenge and WWF No Mercy (even enlisting the expertise of No Mercy director Hideyuki “Geta” Iwashita).


Fight Forever includes over 10 gameplay modes, including a Career Mode, online play, and a full customization suite that lets players create wrestlers, teams, move sets, entrances, and arenas. Match-types include: 
Singles
Tag-Team
3-Way
4-Way
Ladder Match
Casino Battle Royale
Falls Count Anywhere
Unsanctioned Lights Out
Exploding Barbed Wire Death Match
The complete roster has still not been shared officially, but here are the wrestlers we know are in the game based on previous reveals, interviews, and videos. Keep in mind that this is almost certainly not the entire playable roster: 
Abadon
Adam Cole
Adam Page
Bryan Danielson
Chris Jericho
CM Punk (probably)
Cody Rhodes (yes, really)
Darby Allin
Dr. Britt Baker, D.M.D.
Hikaru Shida
Jade Cargill
Jon Moxley
Jungle Boy
Kenny Omega
Kris Statlander
Matt Hardy
Matt Jackson 
Miro
MJF
Nick Jackson 
Nyla Rose
Orange Cassidy
Owen Hart
Paul Wight
Pentagon
Sting
Thunder Rosa
Yuka Sakazaki
AEW: Fight Forever is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PAYONPAH!
One of the biggest games to dominate the scene of the golden age of arcades was Bubble Bobble, a cute Japanese action platformer centered around little dinosaurs that could shoot bubbles out of their mouths. While that original game eventually went on to spawn a ton of sequels and ports that iterated on the concept, it also led to the development of spin-offs like Puzzle Bobble in 1994. Ditching the platforming roots, this new game put an action-focused twist on tile-matching and quickly garnered a following of its own. Now Taito has seen fit to continue the legacy with Puzzle Bobble Everybubble!, a new entry that brings new ideas.
Puzzle Bobble follows a relatively basic gameplay formula wherein you fire colored bubbles from the bottom of the screen at a mass of bubbles at the top of the screen, which disappear when your shots produce a group of three or more like-colored bubbles. A big part of the challenge comes from being constantly under pressure to perform, as bubbles are usually either slowly pressing down on you from above, or you’re only given a limited amount of time to clear everything out. Couple this with the fact that you can never quite tell exactly where your shot is going to land, and it's an experience that straddles a fine line between being stressful and relaxing. Mistakes pile up fast and make it that much harder to make the shots you intend to, but playing things too slow and methodical means that you’re at risk of failing or, at the very least, receiving a lower ranking for that stage.

I played Final Fantasy XVI during a recent preview event in February, but it was focused almost entirely on combat. I enjoyed the combat a lot – you can read my thoughts here – but my latest hands-on with the game happened during my cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, offices. I played a few hours of the game, which is what everyone who’s part of this latest wave of previews played, and that’s what I’ll be talking about here. 
But I also saw never-before-seen gameplay, received an exclusive tour of some areas in FFXVI, learned about its endgame, and more for this month’s Game Infor…]]></summary>

If you're like us, then you'll no doubt be reasonably familiar with the original 151 Pokémon. Over the years, official resources have been abundant, so knowing the strengths, weaknesses, and overall behavior of the Pokémon from Red and Blue is pretty easy for most fans.
Yet for those in Russia, an official translation of the original Pokédex had never been made available when the franchise became popular, since it was only ever provided in Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. As such, Alexander Zhitinsky, the father of a particularly passionate Pokémon fan, took it upon himself to create his own Pokédex using the few precious resources available to him at the time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Planet of Lana has all the hallmarks of a story-rich platformer. Across its six-hour run time, you'll encounter a string of environmental puzzles, an evil plan concocted by a group of baddies, a rich orchestral soundtrack that swells at all the right moments, a cute animal companion, and a gorgeous world that needs saving. 
On paper, it has everything you could possibly want from this kind of game, but in practice, it can also be Lana's undoing at times. It does everything well - admittedly some much better than others - but it feels like this sci-fi tale is missing something. That gut punch, that sigh of relief after a thrill, that unexpected surprise... You know, that extra edge to really make it sing. It’s still a very enjoyable adventure, but its lack of emotional highs means it doesn't linger long in the memory once you've seen the credits roll. Is that a roundabout way to say that Planet of Lana is a solid 7/10? Maybe, but we don't do that here.

Since the release of Limbo in 2010, cinematic puzzle platformers have relied on capturing players’ attention and imagination with beautiful art directions and compelling, often enigmatic storytelling. As typically brief experiences, the moment-to-moment puzzles must hit hard with clever, memorable obstacles and not meander by rehashing familiar mechanics too often. Planet of Lana almost hits this sweet spot by boasting a gorgeous presentation, but trekking through this strange world doesn’t always inspire the same awe.

It's arriving on 23rd May and ahead of the Switch eShop launch, Focus Entertainment and Auroch Digital have released some new extended gameplay footage.

It's all about Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom at the moment for most Switch owners, but there are still plenty of other new releases to enjoy.
One, in particular, that arrived this week was LEGO 2K Drive - a new open-world driving sim featuring all sorts of live service elements. The first round of reviews have now gone live, and generally speaking it seems to be a decent experience so far. Below is what a handful of outlets had to say:

That's because it's their last update to the prison simulator originally created by Introversion Software. The update was also released alongside a trailer thanking fans for supporting the game, which also seemingly teases a 3D sequel.

SCS Software have got better at replicating the long roads and countryside of the United States, however, so they've also been going back periodically and revamping their very first. Five cities in northern California were updated last year in a second update, and work is ongoing on a third phase of revisions that should arrive soon. SCS Software this week shared screenshots of their new Santa Cruz, which has been "revamped from the ground up".

Now Pocketpair have released a content update for Overdungeon and say that previous radio silence was because they were "a bit tired and struggled with our contract with the publisher."

I admire that so many developers and publishers out there are still chasing that kart racing checkered flag. Because there is one clear winner in this category, every other racer we get is just lucky to finish as a runner-up. Over the past few years, we’ve seen several new games in the genre come and go with little fanfare. I don’t know if the same fate will befall LEGO 2K Drive, but what I do know is the racing in this game is legitimately fun.
It’s just, well, a good chunk of everything around that racing is rather lackluster.

The first time I went down into the Depths in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, I figured it would be a fairly straightforward experience. I had seen the glimpses of it in pre-release footage, with some lights staving off ever-present darkness, and figured it would be a neat side venture. A curiosity to explore, when my interest fell away from the overworld of sky islands.
Boy, was I wrong. The Depths aren't just another location in Tears of the Kingdom. They are a massive addition, a second-half rounding out the world above. And the Depths bring a new, fascinating, terrifying kind of horror to the Zelda series.
Note: Mild location spoilers for the Depths will follow, but I'll try to avoid any story-related spoile…]]></summary>

The recent Street Fighter 6 demo might be fairly limited in terms of its characters and modes, but that hasn't stopped the highly dedicated Fighting Game Community from already delving into its secrets and mechanics — Case in point: This Drive Parry shortcut, that could prove very useful in Versus play.
Street Fighter 6's Parry mechanic allows players to perform essentially Perfect Defense against any incoming attacks, by holding MP + MK together. However, once in Parry state, the player can then instigate a dash cancel ("Drive Rush") by tapping forward twice while in the Parry state. This allows for a fast turnaround and advance after blocking long-distance moves such as projectiles and supers.
However, some players have discovered an alternate way to activate Driv…]]></summary>

It's Saturday, and that means it's time to take a look at this week's Arcade Archives offering — Once again, publisher Hamster is looking to the stars to save it, with the arrival of another galaxy-blasting shmup from yesteryear: Ark Area, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Developed by UPL and released to the coin-op market in 1987, Ark Area is a multidirectional shmup that chooses not to follow any strict horizontal/vertical plane to provide full 360, alien-zapping action. A loose sequel to UPL's own Nova 2001, Ark Area puts one or two players in the pilot seats of cute lil' ships, which must fend off extensive waves of enemies, which can attack from all directions. In typical shmup fashion, power-ups can be acquired to increase firepower, and meaty boss battles are peppered throughout the game's 23 stages.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber SBH Gameplays.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJqDE7pAJpE
Following a fairly standard run on the arcade market, Ark Area simply faded into the annals of time, only to be resurrected by this here Arcade Archives release. It's a fun, formative little trip into shmupland, but even on release,  Ark Area was already being eclipsed by some of its flashier and more exciting contemporaries. Still, for completionists, you now have another finger-mashing zapper to add to your collection, no doubt bursting at the seams by this point.
Ark Area is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at $8. Next week's Arcade Archives release will be Namco's excellent run 'n' gunner, Rolling Thunder 2.

Crazy Taxi is like a wonderful time capsule. It captures the best part of the ‘00s in perfect stasis: the part that was basically still the late ‘90s. It was a time when we celebrated the identity of being an asshole. Consumerism was both rampant and celebrated. Wait, that all makes it sound awful. Maybe it was, but in kind of a funny way. And although the developers probably didn’t intend it to be, Crazy Taxi encapsulates all of it.
My first experience with the series was Crazy Taxi on the GameCube. Acclaim ported the Sega arcade title right when Nintendo’s first disc-based console was fresh on the shelves. There wasn’t a lot to play at the time, so I wound up playing everything. I have some great memories of playing Crazy Taxi with my mother. One of my favorite arcade experienc…]]></summary>

Behaviour Interactive has announced two new spin-off games for asymmetrical horror game Dead by Daylight. Supermassive Games and Midwinter Entertainment are both working on spin-off projects within the Dead by Daylight universe.

He's the ultimate evil that necessitates the perpetual rebirth of the legendary hero. Since Ganon takes several incarnations over the course of the games, we decided to rank his various appearances in the Legend of Zelda franchise.
Before you proceed, be warned: This list contains spoilers for all the games listed, though we did try to be appropriately vague for the Tears of the Kingdom entry for now.
For this list, we excluded Demise from Skyward Sword, as that isn't Ganon, as much as it is the evil force that will eventually create Ganon. We also left Hyrule Warriors Ganon off, as that version exi…]]></summary>

From early halcyon days at Tokimeki Memorial to Dream Daddy and Boyfriend Dungeon, developers have created a variety of romance stories in virtual landscapes over the years.

In recent years, the beat-'em-up, (or brawler, if you would prefer), genre has gone through a major renaissance. What was once confined to the golden coin-op age of the late '80s and early '90s — before falling short of expectations come the '00s — has found itself spraining fingers and cracking wrists once again — led by some bold new IPs and the return of some very familiar faces from the past.
In order to change with the times, these modern titles have been forced to add depth, variety, and longevity to what has mostly been a short-lived, quick-to-fatigue genre. In addition, the characters, worlds, and stories have been fleshed out to offer more context to the knuckle-dustin' action.

All those themes suggest a heavy, self-serious game. But Kujlevka's great strength is its levity. While not particularly funny, its consistent wry humour perfectly counterbalances all the talk of political chaos, existential futility, and petty greed. Its opening should have been a clue, really, considering you hang out with skeletons while drinking and commenting on the food on a train in outer space.

With a full suite of Super Mario Game Boy Advance titles hitting the Nintendo Switch, it's really easy to perk up and go "but what about that [X] other GBA thing I liked?" That system had so many bangers it's nearly impossible to keep track of them all, but one that really wormed its way into my heart forevermore is The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Four Swords: emphasis on the Four Swords bit.
This little sub-franchise ended up having a relatively long (albeit niche) lifespan, as it was brought back in anniversary form on the DS and the 3DS for a limited time. But what about the still-trapped-on-GameCube classic Zelda: Four Swords Adventures? Well, we might be waiting a bit longer for that one, which is a shame.
Watch our video on why Zelda: Four Swords Adventures is so special
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so5uRnRrS4Q
So what's the impetus for all this Four Swords talk (besides, I don't know, a massive Zelda release)?
Well, the Destructoid video team has cooked up a wonderful little retrospective on Four Swords Adventures, and it's definitely worth a watch. I have a lot of personal experience with this oddball project, complete with the full setup of the GameCube hub + Game Boy Advance controllers. At launch, I spent the entire weekend at my friend's house playing it, hosting various other people who dropped in and dropped out as we continued to forge onward. Years later we reunited for Four Swords Anniversary on the DS, and it felt so good.
Given that Four Swords Adventures came out in 2004 and has never seen the light of day on another system; it makes sense that a lot of people likely wouldn't have played it, or only heard its name in whispers. If you can't get a copy of it, at least you can relive those glory days by proxy with the video above!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lo-fi carnage has never looked so good
The definitive edition of the dark fantasy action game Bleak Sword DX is coming to PC and Switch and it's...on the horizon! In a new trailer, Devolver Digital confirmed the Bleak Sword DX release date for June 8th on both platforms.
Originally released on Apple Arcade back in 2019, the enhanced version will include the original nine chapters in the Bleak Sword campaign and all three DLC chapters.  The gist is that you'll be taking down horrifying monsters across a variety of cursed battlefields with a variety of fierce weaponry and powerful magic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArQ5jZDHCSI
It apparently improves the original in every way
The improved version of the game will include a streamlined control system built specifically for PC and Switch. Utilizing the new controls you will be able to execute new attacks, parries, and counters against an enhanced enemy AI. Graphically the game has received graphical enhancements in every aspect. There are new post-processing effects, unique filters, an adaptive depth of field, and more. Particle effects, foliage, and even the weather have seen some improvements as well.
Additionally, Bleak Sword DX features three all-new game modes as well. First is a brand new randomizer campaign modifier that creates a remixed version of the original game. Next is a Boss Run gauntlet where you will face all 12 in-game bosses in a row with only one health bar. Last is an endless arena mode throwing increasingly difficult enemies at you until you suffer defeat. This is all accompanied by the epic score from award-winning composer Jim Guthrie and sound designer Joonas Turner. If you are looking for a challenging but rewarding action romp in a dark fantasy setting, be sure to check out the game when it releases early next month.
A demo for Bleak Sword DX is currently available on Steam!

But my affection for George Lucas' brain-baby is less about the stories and characters, and more about the general vibe of the galaxy itself. I love its retro-futurist junkpunk style, the rusty spaceships, dusty planets, and fusty aliens. That's why I've more fondness for games like Dark Forces and KotOR than any of the films or TV shows, as they let me poke around locations like Tatooine and Ord Mantell at my own pace.


Hence, the idea of being properly, immerse in Star Wars, to be physically surrounded by it and able to touch it, is probably my ultimate VR fantasy. Sod the imaginatively inert virtual spaces of Horizon Worlds, if Mark Zuckerberg really wanted to sell the Metaverse to me, he'd build the whole thing out in Mos Eisely chic, and let me run my own virtual cantina selling NFT space-drinks to legless bounty hunters and idiot Web3 prospectors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Walk on over
Epic Games has revealed the latest freebie for the EGS, and it's none other than the oddball cross-country adventure Death Stranding. Note that this is a full week of freebie availability (through May 25 at 11AM ET), which is a massive step up from the prior "24-hour use it or lose it" promotion that ran in December of 2022. All you need to do is follow the link here (or get it directly through the Epic Games launcher) and you're good to go.
When playing through Death Stranding pre-launch in complete isolation, I had no clue how the general public would respond to it. It was such a bizarre big swing, and perfectly on-brand for Kojima. But even without the Metal Gear name attached, it did fairly well for itself; spreading to multiple platforms beyond its PS4 launch, and a sequel is fully confirmed, amid other multimedia opportunities.
If you haven't played it yet, give it a go! I mean it's free for a week, so even if it's ultra-low on your priority list, you'll probably get around to clicking "forget password" on your lapsed Epic Games account at some point...right?!
What's next for Epic Games Store freebies?
Next up is another "mystery game" that Epic has been hyping for some time now, due out in five days. If you haven't already, bookmark this page and periodically go back to it and redeem whatever is there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Game Boy Advance library of Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack is getting a Mario-infused shot in the arm with the addition of three Super Mario Advance titles.
On May 26, Super Mario Advance, Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2, and Yoshi’s Island: Super Mario Advance 3 hit the service. First released throughout the early 2000s, these games are enhanced portable remakes of Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario World, and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island, respectively. 


Although the original versions of each game are already available in the NES/SNES libraries, the Advance series features several tweaks, such as Advance 2 giving Luigi his Super Mario Bros. 2 jump. These join Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3, which was in the initial batch of GBA titles, to complete the series. As a reminder, the GBA library is part of the Expansion Pack tier, the pricier upgraded version of Nintendo Switch Online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has been out for about a week, but yesterday marked the launch of its first post-release patch. Version 1.1.1 of the game fixes one very specific problem, but also ambiguously addresses issues to improve the gameplay experience. You find the patch notes below, as well as on Nintendo's website.
Fixed issue where, sometimes, the player could not clear main quest “The Closed Door,” even if they fulfilled the conditions to advance the quest.
	
If you have already encountered this issue, you will be able to clear the quest by downloading this update data.
Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.
Despite both Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild being incredibly solid games out of the gate, even Zelda is not immune to patches, but Nintendo tends to keep the changes vague. Many of Breath of the Wild's patch notes simply pointed to the updates making the game a more pleasant experience. It seems the trajectory of Tears of the Kingdom's patch notes might receive the same ambiguous details if the second bullet point is an indication of what's to come.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Does that pommel horse have a grenade launcher?" is one of many bizarre questions I found myself asking while playing HROT. This Slavic shooter revels in the strange, straddling the line between hyper-bleak Soviet satire and goofy memetic joke factory. This isn't the best thing about HROT, we'll get to that in a couple of paragraphs. But the balancing of these two personality strands is what defines HROT's quality. At the outset, they exist in perfect symbiosis, but the relationship becomes less stable as the game goes on.
The year is 1986, and something is seriously wrong in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. What that might be isn't explicitly stated, but given the year, the ambient chatter of Geiger counters, and the soldiers vomiting through their gasmasks as they prowl the abandoned streets, a nuclear disaster at an infamous Ukrainian power plant isn't a vast stretch of the imagination. In any case, anyone who wasn't killed by the fallout is now being hunted by an army of (presumably Russian, but again, it isn't explicated) soldiers. Emerging from a bomb shelter beneath Prague's Kosmonautů Metro Station (now named Háje), you take it upon yourself to defend your glorious homeland from these invaders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update (22nd May): This is the final day to grab this excellent deal on an Ergotron-built monitor arm! Original article continues: 
Ergotron make some of the best monitor arms around - reliable, capable and generally brilliant - but they're also pretty pricey. That's probably why Amazon hit up Ergotron to make its Amazon Basics monitor arms, which offer the same excellent quality in unbranded form for considerably less money. 
Today though one of these arms is even better value than usual, as there's a ridiculous 40% off voucher available on Amazon's take on the Ergotron LX, dropping this high-end monitor arm from £81 to just £49. That's a brilliant price for an arm that can support monitors up to 11kg in weight with full tilt, swivel, rotation and height adjustability.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Corsair MP600 Pro LPX is a high-end PCIe 4.0 SSD with TLC flash memory and a DRAM cache, and I'd rank it right behind the (more expensive) Samsung 990 Pro and WD SN850x as the best gaming SSD on the market. Unlike those drives though, the MP600 Pro LPX comes with a heatsink by default and is often priced more aggressively, making it a great value choice that doesn't sacrifice performance. Today this drive has dropped to £74.98 on Amazon UK, a historic low price that makes it easy to justify an SSD upgrade for your PC or PS5.

So I was excited when publishers 505 Games announced singleplayer follow-up Hawken Reborn on Monday then launched it into early access two days later. Having now played it, oh dear.

The usual parts are there. Chop some trees, chip some stones, and chep some crops to get your pioneers' basic needs met, then get to expanding. But Syx isn't interested in testing you or manufacturing drama. It's not about surviving, not about building a happy little colony. It's about how growth changes not just the scale, but the nature of a settlement. Despite similarities with its influences, it defines itself with a different dynamic, a whole different ethos to its peers. And it's one that even playing it my own awkward way hasn't broken.

We (attempt to) talk about our favourite Zelda games of the past, our favourite Zelda-likes on PC, and I explain how Tears Of The Kingdom works to Nate and James. Honestly though, we don't make it very far, because it turns out the lads haven't ever played a Zelda game before. At least, Nate might have. We're not entirely sure. 


We do also talk about what we've been playing this week as well - which include some old favourites, some new secrets, and Gaben's tiny hands - and give some great new recommendations. Nate also delivers a very involved mini-game involving beans and aliens, and James doesn't talk about the Asus ROG Ally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Case of the Golden Idol was one of 2022’s best hidden gems that only PC players have been able to enjoy. Fortunately, Switch owners can put on their thinking hats when the dark mystery game heads to the platform next week.
On May 25, The Case of the Golden Idol lands on Switch alongside its recently released expansion, The Spider of Lanka. Both titles can be purchased separately or together in a bundle. The award-winning game takes place in the 18th century and tasks you with solving a mystery spanning decades over 11 bizarre, interconnected deaths. Each scenario is presented as static scenes where players must carefully observe the environment to find clues revealing who each character is, how the person died, and the chronological order of events. The Spider of Lanka serves as a prequel that adds three additional cases. 
The Switch version sports a redesigned UI to better accommodate a controller-based experience. If this is the first you've heard of the game, the trailer below provides a good idea of what to expect.


As a fan of The Case of the Golden Idol, it's great to see it come to more platforms, and Switch should be an especially good fit. Will you be giving the game a shot on Switch? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Hero Ultra Rumble, the upcoming battle royale based on the popular manga and anime, My Hero Academia, is holding an open beta that begins later this month.
The beta begins May 25 at 7 p.m. PT and concludes June 1 at 11 p.m. PT on PlayStation 4. It appears all you have to do to participate is download the beta to play, which you can preload by going here.


The game features 24 player matches divided into eight teams of three, with players selecting their favorite heroes and villains from the franchise and taking advantage of their various unique abilities. You can also upgrade your abilities with pick-ups on the map and support your teammates as needed.
The upcoming beta is only for PlayStation 4 (playable on PlayStation 5), but the game is planned for release on Xbox, Switch, and PC, as well. Bandai Namco does not have a proper release date for the game yet, but it will be free-to-play when it officially launches.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Epic Games Store is getting its own rewards program to further incentivize users to engage with its storefront.
Officially dubbed the Epic Rewards Program, it’s now live and lets users earn 5 percent back in Rewards on eligible purchases. Epic has not specified what type of transactions qualify for the kickback. You also don’t have to sign up for the program and can join for free. 
Although the storefront still has some strides to make to catch up to Steam, this could be a helpful step in that direction. This move comes months after PlayStation recently rolled out a rewards program for its storefront called PlayStation Stars, meaning most of the big gaming storefronts has their own variation now. 
Does this program entice you into engaging with the Epic Games Store more often? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lords of the Fallen is coming this October, and despite the good news it lands on the unluckiest day of the year. Thankfully, a lengthy trailer gives us the good fortune of enjoying some action-packed gameplay footage. 
This reimagining/reboot of its 2014 predecessor is coming on Friday, October 13. A big new trailer set to Iron Maiden packs in a ton of metal-infused action that shows off the game's Unreal Engine 5-rendered graphics. 


It's been a long road for Lords of the Fallen, which began life as Lords of the Fallen 2 years ago before development restarted from scratch. It was re-announced as The Lords of the Fallen last year before reverting back to its original name. The Souls-inspired game's open world is five times larger than the original's and supports online co-op. The combat has also been retuned to be faster and more fluid, and developer Hexworks promises the game to be an overall expansive action RPG experience. 
We're looking forward to seeing the result of this overhaul when the game comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lego 2K Drive has stirred up a surprising amount of thoughts, perhaps moreso than any other video game so far this year. I think it's because the game is an open world kart racer, a combination of words that sing to my nostalgic love for old-school racers, where as a kid I'd worshipped the majesty of Muppets Race Mania and Mario Kart (this is the only time I mention Mario Kart). In all respects, 2K Drive nails Lego's historically strong presentation, with slick courses and a genuinely lovely combo of grassy hills and dusty plains which certainly seem like a chip off Forza Horizon's shiny paint job. Building is upheld too, as a mighty garage lets anyone create an interesting set of wheels. The wheels start spinning, though, as the live service gates start closing. I don't think the gates totally shut off what's meant to be a fun time, but it certainly tries. Even an innocent kart racer can't escape the perils of live service, it seems.

A new tweet from the official Mortal Kombat Twitter account reads, "Tomorrow is a new dawn" and contains a teaser styled after the previous video, featuring a clock hand that skips past 12 and strikes 1, followed by the text “It Is Time” with a start time of 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET.

May 17, 2023
Fans have speculated that the clock landing on "1" may signify the next game is a reboot of sorts. Although 2011’s MK 9 already did that, the wild ending of MK 11 (and its Aftermath expansion) certainly paved the runway for Netherrealm to essentially start fresh and do whatever it wants with the fiction going forward. As such, this 12th entry has the potential to be pretty nuts, even by MK standards. 
We learned a new Mortal Kombat was coming this year when Warner Bros. CEO told investors that Mortal Kombat 12 was launching this year. Whether this new game is actually called MK 12 or something else entirely is unclear, but we’re looking forward to waking up bright and early tomorrow morning to see what’s next for our favorite spine-ripping kombatants.]]></summary>

Developer Behaviour Interactive released a teaser for an announcement on July 5 regarding the massively talented actor's mysterious involvement. As for what Cage's role entails, an in-game version of the Renfield star only offers this nugget:
“There’s nothing more powerful than imagination. One can shape the fabric of reality, transforming everything you think you may know.”


Who knows what that means, but it looks like Cage is joining the game in some capacity. Is he a killer? Will he appear in one of his many, many film roles? Or is it scary enough to just have Nicolas Cage as himself running around trying to murder players? We’ll get our answers in July.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Universal Pictures have dropped the first teaser for their Five Nights At Freddy’s film adaptation, based on the hit horror series. Ten years ago, I’d hear schoolmates chatting about the games’ ghosts, purple people, and dismembered heads stuck in animatronics. Now, we’re old enough to buy R-rated cinema tickets, and Hollywood’s ready to capitalise on some teen nostalgia - essentially the film industry’s version of min-maxing. Check out the first teaser here:

        <updated>2023-05-17T15:20:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embark Studios has shifted the scope of its upcoming shooter, Arc Raiders. The game was first announced in 2021 as a co-op PvE-focused experience about working together to battle invading alien machines. Now, the game will have a PvP element thrown into the mix.
In an update, Embark reveals that since delaying Arc Raiders to focus on finishing its other upcoming title, The Finals, it’s added competitive play as well as an extraction element. The game still unfolds on a far future Earth ravaged by sentient machines, but now teams must compete with other human players in addition to the in-game enemies. Furthermore, the game adopts extraction-based objectives by tasking players to locate and retrieve resources scattered across the world for their squad. Here’s Embark's pitch for what Arc Raiders now entails:
Embark plans on launching a closed alpha test, giving players who sign up on their website the first opportunity to go hands-on with Arc Raiders. The game still has no release date, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
What do you think of this new premise for Arc Raiders? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-05-17T14:32:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A PlayStation Showcase will air next week, ostensibly serving as the publisher’s big summer showcase.
It airs on Wednesday, May 24, at 1 p.m. Pacific/4 p.m. Eastern. A PlayStation Blog post states the event will run a little over an hour and will feature new titles for PS5 and PS VR2. In addition to showcasing first-party PlayStation Studios titles, the event will also highlight third-party and indie games. 
This means it's time to put on our speculation hats. It’s likely we’ll see Insomniac’s Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 at the show given it’s releasing this fall and we’ve yet to see gameplay of it. There’s also the slim chance that Wolverine could make an appearance. Naughty Dog could also provide an update on its The Last of Us multiplayer title. Personally, we’re hoping to see something about that mysterious adventure title from a recent PlayStation ad that has rumored ties to Uncharted. As for third-party, it would be nice to see more of the PS5-exclusive Silent Hill 2 remake. 
So what do you expect/hope to see at Sony’s big event? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Believe it or not, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is off to a fantastic start. In addition to garnering an overwhelmingly positive critical reception, over 10 million copies of the hotly anticipated sequel have already been sold within its first three days of release.
That number makes Tears of the Kingdom the fastest-selling entry in franchise history. A press release states that 4 million of those sales have been in the Americas, which not only makes it the fastest-selling Switch game in this territory but the fastest-selling Nintendo game period. This achievement is even more impressive when you consider that Tears of the Kingdom is also the first $70 Nintendo first-party title, showing fans are willing to shell out the extra dough for a tentpole Switch release.

Last night, the Overwatch 2 development team announced that they've scrapped most of their ideas including the Hero Missions mode which had skill trees, levelling up, and other light RPG elements shown off in the trailer below. Instead, they'll be gradually releasing co-op story missions and integrating them into their ongoing seasons, similar to how PvE operated in the first Overwatch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During a developer livestream today, Blizzard revealed its roadmap for the coming months. The roadmap, which was presented by game director Aaron Keller and executive producer Jared Neuss, details what is coming during Season 5, 6, 7, and beyond. In addition to PvP updates, the Overwatch 2 developers also gave us an idea of when to expect the long-awaited PvE experience that was announced alongside the game in 2019.
Season 5, which has the theme of "Mischief and Magic," is currently set to kick off on June 13. This fifth season of the live-service shooter brings events and modes, including a new limited-time event called Questwatch, as well as the return of the Summer Games event. The roadmap also promises a cinematic reveal, a 5v5 mini comp season, the Creator Workshop mode, and the return of the On Fire mechanic that was present in Overwatch.
Season 6, which is set for later this summer, is heralded by Blizzard as the single largest drop of new gameplay released at one time since Overwatch 2 launched in October of last year. Season 6 promises a new support hero, Flashpoint, Hero Mastery, a Firing Range, a player progression system, and the annual Overwatch anniversary event. Perhaps most importantly, Season 6 gives players the PvE content that was announced back in 2019, as Story Missions arrive as part of Season 6. Unfortunately, the Hero Missions PvE mode has been cut from the team's plans.
Finally, we learned what players can expect from Season 7 and beyond, which includes a new tank hero, reworks of longtime heroes Roadhog and Sombra, a new Control map, a new winter event, new Hero Mastery missions in multiplayer, cinematic debuts, the return of fan-favorite modes and Competitive Mastery heroes, a new limited-time collaboration event mode, and a new lore codex.
Overwatch 2 launched on October 4, 2022. While the initial response was positive (read our review here), the approach to supporting the game and the season pass structure has deterred many players from keeping up with the title.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A French court has ordered ISPs to block veteran file-hosting/streaming platform Uptobox. French internet users made roughly 10 million visits to Uptobox last month and are unlikely to give up easily. Meanwhile, blundering efforts to block other content led to the entire Telegram platform being blocked in France last weekend. French visitors were diverted to a government website where code linked their visit to serious crime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EVGA's Kingpin motherboards are some of the most bonkers out there, proper slabs that are designed for extreme overclocking with hugely impressive power delivery, multiple BIOSes and some unique features. They're also hugely expensive, normally costing close to $1000, but a deep discount on their Z690 model over at Newegg brings it to $400. That's still pricey, but a reasonable pickup given the feature list for anyone designing a top-end gaming rig around Intel's 12th-gen or 13th-gen Core processors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been meaning to write about Veiled Experts for over a month now, since playing it religiously during the Final Beta Test. I've been putting it off mostly because I've been busy, but also because I'm trying to find a way of saying "actually it's really good" without people laughing and throwing garbage at me. It's very hard to describe Veiled Experts to someone in a way that doesn't prompt an instant dismissal. That was my reaction too. I saw it on Twitch, my mind said "third person Counter-Strike", and sent an automatic signal down to my lips to proclaim the words: "sounds awful".
Thank goodness for boredom. Later that day I was at a loose end and saw that Veiled Experts was free, so I downloaded it and tried it out. And here we are, a month and a bit later. The game is about to release into Early Access, and I'm desperately trying to get everyone I know to play it with me, because it's bloody phenomenal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After playing a bunch of the demos at LudoNarraCon earlier this month, the best one I played, with zero hesitation, was Cryptmaster. Its smart text-based puzzle design fused with stylish dungeon crawling had me completely spellbound, to the point where it's now become one of my most anticipated indie games for 2024. It’s honestly unlike anything I’ve played.
Developed by Paul Hart and Lee Williams, Cryptmaster is a dark fantasy dungeon crawler where you need to type (or speak) commands to help get your undead amnesiac party members out of a strange underground kingdom. Your band of forgetful adventurers aren't completely at the mercy of the dungeon, as a devilish-looking necromancer is there to give a helping hand. An ominous figure who acts as both guide and a quest giver, the horned necromancer helps you navigate the strange rules of this underground world where words and letters are a resource for survival.

I've enjoyed the pop platforming of Sayonara Wild Hearts, the DIY DJ-ing in Fuser, the grungy game-meets-album Teenage Blob, and the recently released fist-pumping robot-thrashing Hi-Fi Rush just to name some from the top of my noggin'.
Music is a definitely big part of these games, but Stray Gods: A Roleplaying Musical has set itself on a different kind of musical path, in that it’s actually a musical. I'm talking like a full-on ballad-belter, curtain-caller, exit-stage-left-er musical. And get this: it’s also a modern retelling of the mythos behind the Greek Gods. It feels like my inner theatre kid has chugged ten Red Bulls and is waiting for her cue to burst out.

The investigation began last November, with the commission citing Microsoft's potential expansion into the cloud gaming market as a primary concern.

Roughly summarized, here are the conclusions the European Commission came to as a result of their investigations:

Playing god is a familiar feeling for many video game genres, like action titles where your character is unstoppable or sims where you control everything. Roleplaying a god is rarely something I feel while playing puzzle games, but Humanity provides it in new and surprising ways. The unique style of puzzle solving uses directional signs and commands to guide droves of miniature people to an endpoint. The puzzles start simple, but Humanity builds on this core system throughout its 100-plus stages in exciting and challenging ways, push…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries Of Honjo isn’t your average visual novel. There are some buck wild concepts in Square Enix’s game, including fourth wall breaks to manipulate characters' actions and literally muting someone by turning voices off in the options menu, to name just two of the wackier features (and a big plot twist is discussed in this article, so beware if you're planning on playing Paranormasight soon). 


At the outset, though, Paranormasight loks like it is your average visual novel, with the player working away to prevent curses from claiming the lives of Tokyo citizens. Writer and director Takaya Ishiyama explains this was actually the starting point for Paranormasight’s inception. “I first decided what the final goal of the game would be, and from there I began to plot out the broad elements I needed to include, such as the Seven Mysteries,” he explains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Jedi: Survivor developers Respawn Entertainment have been busy on patch duty, pumping out a series of updates aimed at addressing the torrid state of its PC performance at launch. The newest, last week’s Patch 4, sounded particularly enthusiastic about tackling Jedi: Survivor’s technical troubles, so now would be a fine time to check in on the progress of this fixing-upping campaign.


A few droid decapitatin’ benchmark runs later, I can say that Patch 4 (and its predecessors) have made meaningful improvements to ray tracing performance, and that there's a lot less stuttering than there was at launch - even if this hasn’t been smoothed out entirely. General performance, however, remains deeply underwhelming, with powerful GPUs still unable to achieve a bulletproof 60fps even at 1080p.

The European Commission have today approved the $70 billion acquisition, saying that Microsoft’s commitments “represent a significant improvement for cloud gaming.” That’s a markedly different tone to the UK’s conclusion last month, as the British regulator blocked the acquisition over concerns about the cloud market’s future.

        <updated>2023-05-15T15:27:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a huge game that is particularly skilled at providing you with distractions. I crossed the 90-hour mark recently, and my in-game percentage tracker still shows less than 50% completion. Sometimes, however, you may run into a situation where you're not sure where you want to go. When that happens, I suggest talking to Patricia.
Patricia is not a human character in Tears of the Kingdom. She's a sand seal, and Riju's personal sand seal at that. After cleaning up the main quest in Gerudo, you will find her in the southern corner of Gerudo town.
Patricia loves to eat and will share bits of ambiguous wisdom, translated by her handler Padda, when you give Patricia food. Her favorite food, however, is Splash Fruit.
If you give her some splash fruit, her caretaker will let you know that she has spoken a string of strange numbers.
Those numbers are, of course, coordinates, which you can find on the map or on the bottom of the minimap as you are exploring.
In the example I took screenshots of for this guide, it sent me to a person out in the middle of nowhere who happened to have a sidequest for me. I've done this a few times with Patricia, and she has always pointed me toward something I have not yet discovered.
Running out of things to do in Tears of the Kingdom is something that many players (myself included) won't run into for many hours, but it's nice to know there is an in-game database of distractions built into the game when you run out of activities.
For more on Zelda, you can read Game Informer's Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom review, our beginner tips guide, our interview with producer and director Eiji Aonuma and Hidemaro Fujibayashi, our Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo guide, and this feature of stupid screenshots.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ranked Play is coming to Fortnite, and it's coming soon. According to a blog post from last Saturday, the team behind Fortnite will implement the new mode in the 24.40 update, introducing eight main ranks players can progress through. If Epic keeps to their usual schedule, the mode is expected to come this week, but a date has yet to be formally announced.
Once Ranked Play is added to the game, players will be able to toggle it on or off from the main menu. Other than the fact that it's generally more competitive, there aren't any major gameplay differences between Ranked and unranked play, though that's subject to change. In fact, most details about Ranked Play are not concrete, as Epic says this mode is going to be the start of Ranked Season Zero, so they can "make any adjustments to issues and concerns that arise, while also working on additional features and overall improvements for when Ranked starts following the normal Battle Royale Season schedule."
Ranked Play will be available for both Battle Royale and its popular alternative, Zero Build. You'll have separate ranks for each mode. However, since Ranked Play is still in development, only certain party sizes will be available. In Battle Royale, you can play Solos, Duos, and Party (this excludes trios), and in Zero Build, you can only play duos. Ranked Play's Season Zero is set to end when the main season ends (early June), so hopefully, more party options will open up by then.
Ranked Play will also replace Fortnite's existing Arena mode. Other than the Console Champions Cup, the rest of the tournaments this season won't have any Ranked requirements. Eligibility for future tournaments will now rely on your rank and "other factors" Epic has yet to specify.
Will you be playing Ranked Mode once it drops? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

This owl can’t sleep at night, mainly because it’s nocturnal, but also because the planet’s impending environmental doom has affected their shoddy sleep schedule. That’s where the Green New Deal Simulator comes in, a micro deck-builder about transitioning the USA into a post-carbon economy, all while keeping employment rates stable. The results are simultaneously funny, educational, intense, and they help that damn owl get a good night's rest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of first-person shooters and old-timey cartoons should keep an eye on Mouse. The recently announced game slaps the classic animation of yesteryear over a retro shooter template to create an experience that's old-school in more ways than one. 
Mouse comes from Polish indie developer Fumi Games and is billed as a noir story-driven shooter about murder and deception set in a corrupt city. Players control a private detective wielding vintage firearms like a Tommy Gun, revolver, and Carcano rifle to blast the rather adorable rodent enemies.
The game’s Steam page describes Mouse as a play-your-way type of experience, emphasized by a power-up system in which players can collect special abilities and weapon upgrades that cater to a chosen playstyle. The trailer shows the game is very much a work-in-progress, but it’s already an eye-catcher. 


Mouse is rendered in the classic rubber hose animation style that defined early 20th-century animation, which has found new life in video games such as Cuphead and Bendy and the Ink Machine. The game has no release window but will come to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

While performance is good, at up to 550MB/s for reads and a little less for writes, the real benefit here is having up to 8TB of silent, reliable and low latency storage. 
You can currently pick up this RPS-recommended gaming SSD in its ultimate 8TB form for less than £415 from two places in the UK: Tech Next Day, where you can use code TND-10 to get it for £414, and Amazon, where you can get the drive for £412. I've included both options in case you have a preference, and in the event the drive goes out of stock at this reduced price by the time you come to click the links below!

Today, the RX 6950 XT has dropped below the £600 mark for the first time we're aware of, with a chunky triple-fan ASRock model costing just £598 at Overclockers in the UK. That's significantly cheaper than the £999 that these cards originally debuted at, bringing it into contention with newer-gen cards.

You can really imagine Link reaching into a grocery store freezer to grab his favorite obscure ice cream flavor hidden behind all the unsold cartons of strawberry. But what if the new Amiibo was a more accurate reflection of players' time with the game?
Sometimes you are on the side of a mountain and you accidentally shoot a bomb arrow in the wall two feet from your face, fall to your death, and then snap a screenshot right after the moment where the UI disappears, but before the Game Over screen appears. I think the flames licking Link's dead body would look great in translucent red plastic.

Artsy games making a point (that seldom grab me, I shouldn't admit) are another. But Mech Punk is something else altogether, and an incredibly rare game that actually earns the "punk" in its title.
Does that mean it's good? Well, umm. Yes, it's good at what I think it sets out to do. Being an irreverent mess is a valid artistic approach, but still means your game is exactly that. It's not a good game in the traditional sense, though. Do I recommend you buy it? If you can spare £20 to pat an artist on the back, maybe. What kind of artist? Put it this way: on release, its developer changed all their Steam page credits to "Alan Smithee". I don’t think they’re disowning it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tunic developer Andrew Shouldice has made no secret about his love of The Legend Of Zelda over the years. He's not only spoken at length about how playing the original pair of Zelda games on the NES provided ample inspiration for his crafty hack and slasher, but you can also see it right there in the game itself, from your fox hero's bright green outfit to the beautifully illustrated in-game manual you piece together to unravel the world's mysteries. 
But speaking with Shouldice at GDC this year, I wanted to talk to him another other potential source of inspiration. Before he struck out on his own to make Tunic, Shouldice cut his teeth making hidden object games, ranging from globe-trotting mystery adventures to Atlantean-themed detective stories. On paper, this earlier work would appear to provide the perfect proving ground for Tunic, as we all know by now that it holds plenty of secrets of its own. For Shouldice, though, it was more of a reaction against his earlier work that fuelled his approach to Tunic, as he gradually came to realise his hidden object games "weren't tapping into this very specific type of mystery and discovery and player agency and true exploration that I was interested in," he says.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced as a surprise stinger at the end of the E3 2019 Nintendo Direct, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has occupied the top spot of many "most anticipated" lists for nearly four years. The long-awaited sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is finally here, with reviews confirming that it was well worth the hype (you can read our full review here). The entry innovates and expands upon the formula established by Breath of the Wild in myriad ways, giving players the most open-ended Zelda game yet. 
With the launch finally here, we sat down with series producer Eiji Aonuma and director Hidemaro Fujibayashi to talk about the daunting task of following Breath of the Wild, as well as the new game's successes and challenges.

With The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom carrying forward and expanding much of what made Breath of the Wild so special more than six years ago, I decided to scan through the entire Legend of Zelda collection of Amiibo figures across multiple days to see what each figure yields.
It's worth noting that these figures' rewards all come with RNG mechanics, meaning that many of the good drops will require you to scan the figures multiple days before getting the reward you're really after.

This is only the third year that games have been recognized at the annual film festival. The event highlights upcoming titles, which have generally been smaller budget/indie works, that have “potential for excellence in art and storytelling through design, artistic mastery, and highly immersive worlds.” The previous Tribeca Games Award winners are Norco in 2021 and Thirsty Suitors in 2022. 
Here is the 2023 selection, which will be spotlighted with new trailers and developer interviews on the big night:
Chants of Sennaar
Despelote
The Expanse: A Telltale Series
Goodbye Volcano High
A Highland Song
Nightscape
Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical
Additionally, the festival will screen a new documentary called Hideo Kojima - Connecting Worlds. The film delves into the mind and creative process of the man behind Metal Gear and Death Stranding and features appearances from Guillermo del Toro, Norman Reedus, Grimes, Chvrches, and others. 
The Tribeca Film Festival runs from June 7-18, but the Games showcase airs on June 9. The Tribeca Game Awards is just one of the many video game showcases airing in June, and you can keep up with all of them by visiting our handy event schedule.]]></summary>

It's why I love the model of Imperialism, where everywhere is one turn, no shuffling away. It's also why I'm a little surprised how engrossing Foxhole is as a strategy game. As most players (including Brendy) will tell you, it's a game all about shuffling, ie. logistics. But after finally making time for it, I've realised that most of them, even some of the "logi" focused players, don't know what that actually means.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is battling impossible expectations. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild represented a radical and successful reinvention of The Legend of Zelda – a series considered by many to be the apex of game design. Despite its numerous changes to Zelda’s formula, Breath of the Wild was a massive success and its legacy only grows stronger with time.
To give Breath of the Wild a direct sequel (a rarity in Zelda canon) is a dangerous prospect. The resulting game lacks the admittedly difficult-to-recreate, undeniable impact and newness …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We know Mortal Kombat 12 is apparently coming sometime this year, and Ed Boon is stoking the fires of excitement by seemingly teasing an impending announcement.
In a Warner Bros. Discovery earnings call in February, CEO David Zaslav told investors that Mortal Kombat 12 was planned for release this year. Initially, Boon didn’t confirm or deny the news, but today he tweeted out a short video of a clock hand dramatically ticking towards 12 that then, interestingly, skips over it to strike 1. Boon's tweet asks, “Does anyone know what time it is?”
Does anyone know what time it is? #MortalKombatpic.twitter.com/pXY2wlidde
May 10, 2023
It might be the 12th mainline fighting game, but the teaser could be hinting at a reboot of sorts. Regardless, it appears an announcement could be imminent, which seems especially likely following the big delay of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Summer Game Fest is less than a month away, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see the hotly anticipated sequel pop up there.
Mortal Kombat 11 was released in 2019, with its Aftermath expansion arriving the following year. Developer Netherrealm also released Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile RPG, last fall. Although Netherrealm has released an Injustice game in between Mortal Kombat releases since 2013, it appears to be bucking that trend by jumping straight to the 12th entry.

The story follows Mimi, a young woman who returns to her departed grandmother’s countryside cottage in the real-life French region of Dordogne to uncover family secrets. Her return triggers a flood of childhood memories, which players relieve in flashbacks as a child version of Mimi. Gameplay involves exploring the cottage, taking pictures, and collecting keepsakes while witnessing the bond between Mimi and her grandmother and learning how these nostalgic experiences connect to the present. Check out the game's new trailer below, as the game looks even prettier in motion.

The last we heard, Silksong was due out in the first half of 2023 but last night, Team Cherry delayed the game without offering up a new window. 
Hey gang, just a quick update about Silksong.
May 10, 2023
As you can see, it's clear Silksong won't be released in the first half of 2023 as originally planned, but there's no word or indication of what the game's new release date is. 
Team Cherry put out its first game, Hollow Knight, in 2017 and it was extremely well received. While the game received several free DLCs, the studio was also working on a larger expansion of paid DLC starring Hornet from the game. In 2019, the team announced this DLC had expanded massively in scope, to the point it'd now be a full sequel game called Hollow Knight: Silksong. Since then, fans of the first Hollow Knight have wondered when they'd be able to play Silksong.
While waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Hollow Knight review and then read about why Silksong is one of our most anticipated upcoming games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Private Division has announced a new publishing partnership with Pokémon developer Game Freak. It will publish a new action-adventure game from Game Freak meant to be a new IP for the developer. 
Codenamed "Project Bloom," Game Freak and Private Division state in a press release the new IP is expected to launch during Private Division parent company Take-Two's Fiscal Year 2026. Alongside this news, Game Freak has released the first piece of concept art for Project Bloom. You can check it out below: 

"We're thrilled to have the opportunity to create new IP that is bold and tonally different from our prior work," Game Freak director Kota Furushima writes in the release. "From the beginning, Private Division was the publisher we wanted to work with on our new game. Their track record and global expertise gives us all the confidence to create a sweeping new action-adventure game that we can't wait to share more about in the future." 
Take-Two Interactive chief strategy officer and Private Division head Micahel Worosz says you'd be hard-pressed to find a studio with more iconic hits over the past 30 years than Game Freak, addding, "We're ready to help Game Freak unleash their potential and we're honored to be the first Western publisher to work alongside this exceptionally talented and proven team to bring a bold new IP to market." 
Game Freak was founded in 1989 and is best known for developing the majority of mainline Pokémon entries across various Nintendo consoles. Its most recent Pokémon release was last year's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It has, however, released non-Pokémon games throughout its history, including this year's Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! on iOS and macOS devices. 
Private Division was founded in 2017 as a third publishing label within Take-Two Interactive. Notable titles published by Private Division include Hades, The Outer Worlds, Kerbal Space Program 2, Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and developer Guerrilla have revealed that the Horizon franchise has surpassed 32 million units sold. 
The series, which consists of 2017's Horizon Zero Dawn and its Frozen Wilds expansion, 2022's Horizon Forbidden West and this year's Burning Shores expansion for it, and the recently released PSVR2 exclusive title, Horizon Call of the Mountain, has quickly become one of PlayStation's best selling. In a new PlayStation Blog post detailing Guerrilla's history, PlayStation reveals the Horizon franchise has surpassed 32.7 million units sold worldwide. 


It also reveals that Horizon Forbidden West has sold more than 8.4 million units as well. 
"Millions more around the world have discovered Horizon thanks to PlayStation's subscription services and initiatives, including PlayStation Plus and Play at Home," Guerrilla studio director and art and animation director Jan-Bart van Beek writes in the blog post. "All told, it's a milestone we never imagined possible twenty years ago when we first started making games.
"The reception has been staggering, and we're grateful to the community for the continued love and support for the franchise."
The blog post ends with van Beek teasing that the studio "cant wait for you to find out where [Aloy] will go next." 
For more about the series, read Game Informer's Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West reviews. Then read what we thought of Horizon Call of the Mountain and the recent Burning Shores expansion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has announced a new action-platforming game called Mr. Run and Jump, which promises to be a speedrunner's delight. With lush neon graphics and reflex-based platforming stages, the game promises fast-paced and frenetic action for fans of the high-speed, tight-controlling entries of the genre.
As Mr. Run and Jump, you explore the Realms of Color on a quest to defeat Void and find the hero's missing dog, Leap. The title was originally created as a homebrew title for Atari 2600 in 2021, but a modernized version is now being released by developers Graphite Lab and Heavy Horse Games through official means. If this sounds up your alley, you can check out the announcement trailer below.


Mr. Run and Jump offers dozens of unique levels across six different worlds, as well as several enemies with distinct attack patterns and personalities. According to Atari, the title will offer more than 30 hours of gameplay when you take into account time trials, collectibles, and achievements.
Mr. Run and Jump arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Atari VCS later this year. For more on one of Atari's most recent successes, check out our review of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration.]]></summary>
