        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take the high road AND the low road.
Scotland. The final frontier. At least, as far as games go. Despite many games being made in and about the glorious north, very few actually represent its natural wonder without also featuring an embarrassing stereotype of haggis-eating, ginger-bearded, tartan-clad men, and/or clobbering the English (although we do deserve that last one).
A Highland Song, the latest offering from the narrative game wizards at Inkle, steps lightly in to right this wrong. Its mountains and its music flow like honey, showing a side of the highlands that most of us rarely get to see without taking a long train up north. And you, as the teen runaway Moira, are tasked with exploring this daunting mountain range with one goal: to get to the sea.

Nintendo has announced its next free game trial for NSO subscribers in Europe, confirming that Suika Game will be lining up for some payment-less playtime from 7th-11th December.
Of the many, many games that have made a big splash in 2023, Suika Game is right up there. Complexity takes a back seat in this fruit-based puzzler that became a viral sensation in Japan earlier this year and while it might not be the most expensive purchase on the eShop at its current price of £2.69 / $2.99, it's difficult to turn your nose up at getting to play it for free.

This week in the UK, EA Sports FC 24 manages to maintain its lead in the competition thanks to some rather tasty deals over the Black Friday period. Hogwarts Legacy also benefitted from some discounts to secure its position at number two.
Super Mario Bros. Wonder, meanwhile, has done well against tough competition and aggressive price cuts across the board, climbing another position and supplanting Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III at number three. Speaking of Mario, Super Mario RPG has sadly slipped even further down the charts to land at twenty-one. It's not a huge drop by any means, nor is it particularly surprising, but we had hoped it would stay in the top ten for a bit longer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back, I had a feeling we'd see a lot of games about nature and plants and the wild coming out over the next few years, as developers and players alike emerged from being shut inside for basically a year like dairy cows during their annual spring turnout. We may not all be not be naturally disposed to it, but there's much to be said for the fleeting, if unbridled happiness that comes from running barefoot into the teeth of the wind or getting caught in a rainstorm without a coat.
Nine times out of ten, you might get wet and have cold fingers, but that one time that you get wet, have cold fingers and feel red-raw and alive is a doozy. A Highland Song, a lone and dangerous jaunt through the Scottish highlands, is trying to capture that feeling, most especially in segments where you sprint across rocks and heather alongside a deer. At these times you leap in time to swelling music, and whoop and yell in spontaneous joy. It's lovely. It's also easy to stumble.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo and Universal's partnership has been a fruitful one. Universal Studios Japan's version of Super Nintendo World kicked it all off in late 2020 and early 2021 with a magical experience for Nintendo fans (learn more about our experience here), then in February 2023, Universal Studios Hollywood's Super Nintendo World opened its doors (see our photo tour of that version here). The collaboration to this point culminated shortly after that with the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which garnered strong fan reactions and grossed more than $1 billion at the box office.
While 2025 is the next major milestone for the collaboration, with Super Nintendo World locations opening in Singapore and Orlando, we got an announcement during a Universal Kick-Off media meeting. The big news pertaining to Super Nintendo World, as reported by Universal Parks News Today, is that the previously announced Donkey Kong Country expansion to Universal Studios Japan's park opens this coming spring. The expansion features a new rollercoaster starring the iconic ape, themed merchandise, more interactive experiences, and presumably themed decorations to make you feel like you've traveled to The Country.
While there are currently no plans for the Donkey Kong Country expansion to come to Universal Studios Hollywood, but according to Orlando Park Stop, Epic Universe in Orlando will be getting a mine-cart-themed Donkey Kong rollercoaster. Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios' Epic Universe is currently slated to open in 2025, but prior to that, it sounds as though the Osaka location will debut the DK attractions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Rockstar Games announced last week that it was going to release the first trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI on Tuesday, December 5. However, the studio released the trailer a day earlier – watch the official GTA VI reveal trailer here – after it leaked online. The trailer confirmed GTA VI will be released in 2025 and now, thanks to a new press release from Rockstar parent company, Take-Two Interactive Software, we know it's coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. 
Curiously, the press release only mentions those two platforms, leaving out PC. Here's what it says: 
Despite the popularity of Grand Theft Auto V on PC, it seems like GTA VI won't be launching on PC on day one. Of course, this doesn't mean the game won't eventually make its way to PC; GTA V eventually got there (albeit about a year and a half later). 
Game Informer has reached out to Rockstar Games to ask if a PC version of GTA VI is planned and, if there is one, when it will be released, and will update this story if more is learned. 
In the meantime, read about the first official Grand Theft Auto VI trailer here, and then check out some screenshots from the trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With thousands standing by waiting for it to release tomorrow, something happened and the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer just released. The 90-second-long features what looks to be mostly cutscenes, showing off a handful of locales including a massive city, a beach, and a bayou while playing Tom Petty's Love is a Long Road. The trailer ends with the GTA6 logo and coming 2025. Unfortunately, it appears as though the 2025 release date is only for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, with no mention of a PC release.




Even though the trailer was scheduled to release tomorrow, the trailer leaked which prompted Rockstar Games to go ahead and officially release the trailer early. I'm sure the leak wasn't ideal, but Rockstar was pretty quick to flip the trailer live after the leak popped up.

Return to Vice City


It's been long rumored that the highly anticipated sixth entry in the Grand Theft Auto series would bring a return to Vice City, and that looks to be the case. The trailer's title card features the classic Vice City pink and orange washed-out colors. Also, about halfway through the trailer, we see a Vice sign in the style of the Hollywood sign, which almost certainly confirms it.


Even though the video featured mostly cutscenes, it's safe to say this is exactly what everyone was hoping for: more Grand Theft Auto.


Grand Theft Auto 6 will be released in 2025.

I wish we could get some sort of re-release, or maybe even a release of the canceled (but apparently finished) Primal Rage 2. But we’re not talking about Primal Rage. We’re here to look at DinoRex.


Released by Taito in 1992, DinoRex has a lot in common with Primal Rage. There are dinosaurs animated by stop-motion and humans in the foreground. I would use that same description for both games when trying to explain them to someone who hadn’t played them before. However, while Primal Rage is an “okay, not great” game, DinoRex is more of a “so bad it’s kind of good” kind of game—the very best flavor of kusoge.


It is just incredible.

        <updated>2023-12-04T22:45:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a surprise trailer dropped by the Street Fighter X (formerly Twitter) account, a crossover between Street Fighter 6 and Spy x Family Code: White is coming on January 9, 2024. The event serves as a promotion for the upcoming Spy x Family film, which will be released in Japanese theaters on December 22, 2023.


Aside from collaboration activities coming to Street Fighter 6 early next year, not much information was shown in the trailer. The X post said that additional information would be coming at a later date. 




Street Fighter 6 is no stranger to collaborations. Since its release on June 2, 2023, the fighter has joined forces with several popular franchises including Baki and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. While the Baki collaboration is relegated to fighter card aesthetics, the TMNT crossover had full-fledged costumes for all four Turtles.


This is where things get a little conflicting. While it was exciting to get the turtles in SF6, they came at a heavy cost, namely 750 Fighter Coins (roughly $15) each. So to get all four Turtles, players would have to drop about $60; and that didn't include all of the extras like stickers and what-have-you. Adding insult to injury was that the Turtles weren't actually characters; they were costumes for the player's avatar. Compared to the Turtles' inclusion in Injustice 2, whose pack was only $9.99 and had them as individual characters, it's kind of a raw deal in SF6.


While I'm excited about the prospect of two franchises I greatly enjoy crossing over like this, I'm hesitant about how Capcom will implement it. Either we get a bland pack like Baki or we get overpriced content that isn't usable outside of Avatar Battles. Here's hoping I'm totally wrong and we get an Anya and Bond combo utilizing Psycho Power.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game preservation is a topic close to my heart. For me, video games never age. I spend just as much time playing games from decades ago as I do with modern titles. My favorite games are the ones I’ve never played before, and that isn’t exclusive to the future.


Accessibility is therefore important, especially when it comes to PC titles where changes in operating systems, graphical processing, and even monitor resolutions have rendered a lot of old titles unplayable on modern setups. GOG has, for a long while now, been an important fixture to people like me. It provides easy access to retro titles from the DOS and early Windows days in formats that are typically simple to get working with minimal configuration.


Typically.

We all know that The Game Awards 2023 is coming on 7th December and that the hotly-contested Game of the Year crown has two Nintendo reps in the top six. But one of those representatives is also duking it out for the Players' Voice award.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has made it to the final round of the player-voted award alongside four other heavy hitters — Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and last year's winner, Genshin Impact.

        <updated>2023-12-04T20:37:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age: Dreadwolf has been a long time coming, and a new teaser trailer – arriving on Dragon Age Day, appropriately – provides a glimpse of its continent, Thedas, while also announcing when Bioware will properly reveal the game. 
The trailer provides a cinematic flyby of Thedas’ map and a few scenic shots of locales as out-of-context musings from several characters set the tone. It wraps up with a message announcing a full reveal coming next summer. 


It’s a bittersweet announcement. It’s good to know when we’ll finally see what Dreadwolf actually is. We're just bummed to get a teaser for a trailer that's months away. There’s always the chance Dreadwolf launches a few months after its grand debut (it’s happened before with several other big games), though the game was announced as being in the middle of full production last year, and with Bioware’s recent restructuring resulting in layoffs, a 2024 launch may be optimistic. 
Although Dragon Age: Dreadwolf has been in development in some form since at least 2015, its first big teaser took place at The Game Awards in 2018. However, it didn’t get its proper title until last year. Dreadwolf has gone through the wringer in terms of development shake-ups, from high-profile departures at Bioware, including Casey Hudson (again), to EA reworking it from a live-service model to a more single-player-focused experience following Anthem’s failure. 
We still know very little about what Dreadwolf entails other than it takes place in Tevinter and will feature Solas (the titular Dread Wolf) and new characters Bellara and Davrin, whom we know nothing about as of yet. Here's hoping Bioware rolls out the carpet for the game in a big way next year after fans have waited so long to see what's next in the Dragon Age mythos.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are few fantasy creatures more fascinating than slimes, but have you wondered what it's like to be a slime? Senior technical artist at Epic Games and Slime Master Asher Zhu is working on bringing this dream to life and has shown off his results on X (Twitter).


He's been using the company's tools and engine to create an adorable slime game set in a modern city. The results are impressive based on a short video that shows how goopy the little guy is. It's mostly clips of it doing mundane things like roaming around and showering, but it might also be one of the best UE5 showcases for an actual game. 




The slime's reactivity to the world around it is incredible, as the parts hanging off the slide fall off. What got me the most was seeing it mold to a tub's space with some spillover due to size.


Since the slime is a liquid entity, Zhu's game has it interact with the world as a liquid does. This means it can conform to the space it's in, flatten itself, and evaporate in the summer sun. 


That last part even ties into the game's premise! Keeping the slime hydrated seems to be the main goal, with showers and vending machines shown as good sources of sustenance. 


Zhu has been working on a slime game for several years now, posting updates every so often. As impressive as UE5 is, most of the credit goes to Zhu for developing this specific tech for some time.


Zhu's slime game doesn't have a name or any indication of a release date, and it won't be for a while. He's clarified that it's in the prototype stages because the slime tech has been difficult to engineer. Hopefully, he continues taking his time, because the world deserves an amazing slime protagonist.

        <updated>2023-12-04T19:08:43.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam hardware survey provides a general idea of the specs PC gamers are playing with — a little window into hardware expectations and trends to expect. More often than not, we see how much Nvidia creams the competition, and the latest data shows Team Green still dominates.


As first reported by PC Gamer, the most recent Steam hardware survey shows that, while down 4.88%, the Nvidia RTX 3060 graphics card is still at the top as of November 2023. A quick scan down the list not only shows a minimal amount of AMD and Intel, but that the 3000 series crops up quite a bit.

The 3060 laptop edition is at the number four spot, with an increase of 1.20% over the previous month. We can also see the 3050 has increased by 0.55%, while the 3070 and 3060 Ti are down slightly. It's also interesting to note that many PC gamers are still using older generation GPUs, with the GTX 1650 and GTX 1060 the second and third most popular, according to this survey.


Ada Lovelace is rising slowly


We already saw last month that Nvidia RTX 4000 cards were beginning to show up more in the results, and this still seems to be the case. While the RTX 4060 laptop model doesn't appear until the 11th spot, it's still up 1%.


Likewise with the RTX 4070 Ti, which, although much further down, saw an increase of 0.18%. Even the 4090 – arguably the most powerful graphics card on the current market – saw a 0.28% rise. Additionally, the RTX 4080 went up by 0.05%. It's small, but it does show that the more enthusiast Ada Lovelace GPUs are starting to make their way into people's rigs.


It also goes to show just how much Nvidia seems to be the preference when it comes to PC gaming. It should be said that these Steam surveys are never 100% accurate, but they do paint a picture of the divide between the two graphics card powerhouses (three if you include Intel, which no one seems to).

Just when we thought that we had freed ourselves from the unrelenting pull of Vampire Survivors, developer Poncle makes an announcement that has us ready to grab our Garlic and dive into the bullet-hell roguelike all over again. That announcement is that a new 'Adventures' update is on the way. That's right, we're getting a story mode.
Now, let's make some things clear right from the get-go. The update currently has no release date for Switch, with the reveal trailer stating that it will come to Nintendo's hybrid "soon". It will be available on PC and Xbox from 6th December, however, so if that's the main way that you play, you're in luck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Via Superflat’s own blog, Jasper Byrne recently announced that he’s working on a sequel to 2012’s indie darling Lone Survivor called Lone Warrior.


Lone Warrior is set to follow a new protagonist. Byrne says that it will be quite a bit different in terms of gameplay, with “less of a focus on stealth and survival and more of a focus on action/panic scenarios.” Aliens to Lone Survivor’s Aliens, as he puts it. He also says that it will likely be a “shorter but (hopefully) more intense game.”

Byrne also states that he’s been working on Lone Warrior before the release of Super Lone Survivor, an updated re-release of the original game. According to him, it just made more sense to re-release the first game before revealing the second. Meanwhile, Destructoid’s own grizzled veteran Jonathan “Destroyer of Flapjacks” Holmes has said that he has seen “some behind-the-scenes stuff on this game earlier in the year, and it was really cool.”


I played Lone Survivor back when it was released in 2012 and didn’t love it. It’s been so long that I don’t remember my specific complaints, but it was enough that I pulled the brakes early on and never went back to it. I have considered going back to it now that I’ve spent so much time wading elbow-deep through the horror genre, but haven’t yet. Mr. Holmes, on the other hand, is an enthusiastic fan, as are a lot of people who connected with it back in the early boom of the independent field of games.


There are no release plans for Lone Warrior so far, nor is there information on planned platforms.

Believe it or not, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is going to be five years old this week - on Thursday 7th December, to be exact! Since its launch, which was already packed to the rafters with content, the game has been updated with free content and paid DLC via the Fighter Pass Volumes 1 and 2, which added a boatload of brand-new characters from iconic video game franchises.
To introduce each major character addition, CGI trailers were released with but one goal in mind: get you on board the hype train with a one-way ticket to Hypesville. Frankly, they all succeeded with ease, and choosing a favourite from the bunch is a much more difficult prospect than you might think.

The title is codenamed Project Baxter and is slated to arrive in 2026. In a press release, Starbreeze states that Baxter is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and “will carry the signature Starbreeze game cornerstones of co-operative multiplayer, lifetime commitment through a Games as a Service-Model, community engagement and a larger than life experience.” Although D&D is a role-playing game, it's unclear what genre Project Baxter will be. 
We are excited to unveil Dungeons & Dragons® as the IP for our next game, codename ”Project Baxter”. A co-operative multiplayer title to be released on all major platforms in 2026!

December 4, 2023
Project Baxter is slated to launch on all major platforms and will feature cross-play. Starbreeze released a piece of concept artwork, posted above, as a small visual hint of what's to come.
In a year where Baldur’s Gate 3 delivered on faithfully replicating the D&D experience in video games, Starbreeze has a lot to live up to. But as a D&D fan, it’s cool to see more triple-A projects based on the license, so hopefully Project Baxter turns out well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yogcast Games has announced that Team HalfBeard’s colony sim, Time to Morp, will be released on February 22, 2024. Everything in 2024 still feels like it’s so far in the future, even though we’re talking about a couple of months.


I’m realizing right now that I don’t know what a “colony sim” is. The Steam tag points me to everything from Frostpunk to Cult of the Lamb, which, to me, are two entirely different things. It seems to lump in survival city builders with base builders. Is Roller Coast Tycoon a colony sim?




Time to Morp has you taking care of the eponymous Morps, horrific cat creatures that help you gather resources and explore. You build pens for them, decorate the base, explore the surroundings, and research new technologies. With this technology, you can automate jobs and make your work a lot more comfortable. There’s even four-player co-op if you can stand to associate with multiple people at the same time.


Really, it sounds more like a farming sim that focuses mainly on livestock. A ranch sim. In fact, the Morps remind me of the slimes from Slime Rancher. But genres are made to be broken, so I’m not going to get all pedantic. Even though I already did. I do love automation, and the graphics look colorful, even if the people remind me too much of Miis.


Time to Morp will be released on PC on February 22, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Endure The Swarm, which launches on Friday 8th December, takes that most abstract and respectable of game genres, the block-pushing puzzler, and fills it with ghastly, flesh-eating insects. There’s no amount of pesticide that can stay this tide, nor (sadly) is there the option to stand on a chair screaming and waving a broom. Rather, you must call upon your mammalian mastery of spatial reasoning to survive. The insect hivemind, you see, is incapable of grasping the complexities of block positioning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Next week, Mortal Kombat 1 is getting its second DLC fighter in the form of the Nether Realm’s favorite wizard, Quan Chi. His gameplay trailer makes no bones about the fact that he’s an extremely formidable fighter.
Quan Chi sports his usual arsenal of necromancy-based offense, such as summoning skeletons and firing skulls, but he can now conjure giant tentacles from presumably another reality. He also tag teams with upcoming Kameo fighter Khameleon, who becomes available in January. We particularly enjoy seeing Quan Chi and Shang Tsung make perhaps the most delightfully eye-rolling Deadly Alliance reference ever, plus the bonus tease of another impending guest fighter, Peacemaker, who arrives in February.  


Owners of Mortal Kombat 1’s Premium Edition or Kombat Pack get access to Quan Chi early on December 14. Everyone else will have to wait until December 21. Quan Chi follows Invincible’s Omni-Man, who hit the game last month, on the DLC character roadmap, leaving Ermac, Takeda, Peacemaker, and The Boys’ Homelander.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has been hard at work on the next update for Stardew Valley. While the creator is taking their time to make sure the patch is ready for release, they have made it clear that progress is coming along, while also sharing a little tease.


Over on Twitter, Barone has shared a screenshot from Stardew Valley, showing off the new "Big Chest" in update 1.6. The post goes on to say that the developer has "self-imposed" a crunch mode to get the patch out, but made a "ton of progress" on it last month.




Nothing much has been said about what's coming, as the developer wants to keep "mostly everything secret." However, we have had some teases in the past, such as hats for animals. But we'll know more once the update does roll out.


A labor of love


Barone seems clearly passionate about their game, which has gone down as one of the best indie titles in recent memory. When asked why they continue to work on Stardew Valley, the creator said: "I want it to be the best it can be," adding that "it's been my life's work and I care a lot about it."


On top of update 1.6, the game is also going on tour, with an orchestra set to travel the globe playing arrangements from the Stardew soundtrack. The tour kicks off in Los Angeles on February 16, 2024.


On a personal note, I'm actually fairly new to the game myself. However, I became rather hooked on its simplistic visuals, relaxing mechanics, and the sheer amount of content that's been lovingly put in. The next patch is definitely one that a lot of fans will be keen to try out.

It’s a combination of genres that seem to pair together as naturally as sausages and strawberry jam. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a fan of both of these things as separate entities, but together? My assumption was that they would prove too strange to stomach, but much like the cursed pork and berry snack that became a staple of my university diet, the result is a thrilling concoction that delights the palette. I’ll say it right up top: Against The Storm is one of this year’s best.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The city builder genre was quite unique when 1989’s SimCity hit the scene. It was a game with no end, something rarely (but not never) seen in those days. But there are only so many times you can maximize the density of your residential zones before it loses its grip.


2014’s Banished altered this by incorporating a survival aspect and increasing the possibility of failure. It’s been adopted by many builders since, and Against the Storm is another. And in it, we see the genre mutate further. There actually is a great deal of progression in Against the Storm that further diverges from SimCity’s “build forever” philosophy. By incorporating some aspects of the roguelite genre, it’s able to give greater meaning to your civil development strategy.


And it’s very successful, so long as you are…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-12-04T14:44:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who's ready for the first, official trailer for GTA 6? Apparently, a lot of people, as plenty have already staked out their digital spot ready to view it. Evidently, thousands don't want to risk missing what is probably one of the most anticipated teasers in years.


At the time of writing, there are 31,659 people currently waiting on the Rockstar Games YouTube channel, where the GTA 6 trailer will be playing. It's not scheduled to play until Tuesday, December 5 (at 9am ET, to be specific), so you'd be forgiven for thinking these eager beavers were being too keen.




However, this could be a pretty historic moment for gaming. Okay, it's only a promo, but seeing as Grand Theft Auto 5 has been out for ten years now, I'd say gamers are more than ready for the follow-up.


The numbers just keep going up


Given the behemoth amount of success GTA 5 has had, there's every possibility the sixth installment could be one of the biggest releases of this – or any – generation. Obviously, I don't want to oversell it, but the fact that more than 30,000 people are waiting to watch a YouTube video that can be replayed whenever they want shows how important it is to some.


It was just a few weeks ago that Rockstar announced the GTA 6 trailer. We've had barely any information about the game itself, save for the big leak that happened in 2022. Outside that, nobody really knows anything about the upcoming Grand Theft Auto game.


I must admit, I'm quite eager to check out the trailer myself. I've played most of the major entries in the series, going all the way back to the original 1997 release (Yes, I'm that old). We don't know what the teaser will show, but it's going to be on everyone's lips this side of Christmas.


Ooh, 34,750 people waiting now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of waiting, Amazon Studios has released the first trailer for its upcoming TV adaptation of Fallout. The series is set to premiere on April 12 on Amazon Prime, and this teaser proves that visually speaking, the series appears to faithfully capture the essence of Bethesda’s beloved RPG.


Fallout is brought to life by Westworld showrunners Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, with Bethesda head Todd Howard serving as executive producer. The cast includes Ella Purnell as a freshly emerged Vault 33 dweller named Lucy and Walton Goggins as a gunslinging ghoul aptly dubbed “The Ghoul,” and the series synopsis reads as follows:
The trailer packs in what a lot of fans would expect from a Fallout adaptation: power armor, vaults, irradiated, mutated creatures, exploding headshots, and a dark sense of humor. Here's hoping it can live up to recent live-action success stories such as The Last of Us and Twisted Metal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article is written in partnership with MicroProse.


Craving an old-school tactical shooter experience? Then set your sights on an exciting new FPS Ground Branch, from one of the developers behind the original Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six.


Developed by BlackFoot Studios and published by the simulation wizards at MicroProse, it takes the traditional tactical shooter and dials the realism up to eleven. BlackFoot boasts it puts the "tactical back in tactical shooter," and they’re not wrong.


Ground Branch delivers solo and multiplayer action including co-op, player-vs-player, and objective-based game modes. It boasts an impressively in-depth customisation system where you choose exactly what you carry, all the way down to how many pouches you want on your vest. Plus, you can mount attachments virtually anywhere along your weapon. We’re absolutely spending six hours perfecting that loadout.




Thanks to Ground Branch’s True First-Person System, that degree of detail extends to the field. You have full control over your protagonist, from leaning to multiple weapon postures. That’s not just about looking cool, either. Every inch of you is modeled, so if you forget to pull your foot in, an enemy, human, or even AI soldier may just put a bullet in it.


Ground Branch is currently in Steam early access but we’ve been blown away by what we’ve seen so far. Going by the many positive Steam reviews, including the short-but-to-the-point “She's a beaut cobba,” we’re not alone.


With a possible price rise coming once it eventually leaves early access, there’s no better time to buy or wishlist Ground Branch on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in a weird place with the Meta Quest. It's really its own platform these days, with its own specs and increasingly divergent library of games. At the same time, the Meta's standalone headsets are by far the most popular PCVR devices. Therefore, most PCVR gamers will also have access to the Quest's handful of VR exclusives. Generally, this column sticks to covering games you can play with any PCVR headset, Quest or no. But since I reviewed the Meta Quest 3 last month, it feels odd not to check out at least one of its new titles, especially when it's probably the most notable VR release of the year – Assassin's Creed Nexus.
Also, I'll admit, a VR Assassin's Creed game intrigues me. The idea of cavorting across historical rooftops and shanking templars in the sternum sounds brilliant. It also sounds like barf city. Most VR games limit the need to move around as much as possible, so translating a game as kinetic as Assassin's Creed into VR seems mighty challenging.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Botany Manor is an enigmatic puzzle adventure game that tasks players with solving riddles to grow plants within a mysterious estate. The game first raised eyebrows during its reveal at a Nintendo Direct last November, and we can exclusively reveal that it’s arriving next spring.
Players control Arabella Greene, a retired botanist looking to bring life back to her massive collection of rare, long-lost plants. Doing this involves exploring a giant 19th-century manor in search of clues, notes, and other items to uncover the proper methods and conditions to make her plants grow. This involves finding the ideal habitats to place seedlings, for example, which may require some creative problem-solving and mature plants have mysterious qualities. 


As players find and examine clues, they’ll also learn about the ups and downs in Arabella’s life, both personally and professionally. Overall, the game has a peaceful atmosphere accented by a calming presentation and a pleasant soundtrack. Botany Manor is the debut title by the small team at Balloon Studios and is published by Whitethorn Games. 
Botany Manor is coming to Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC. It will also launch day one on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

The Game Awards 2023 are right around the corner and, just like clockwork, host and Mr Games himself, Geoff Keighley, has revealed this year's "hype trailer" to get us all, well, hyped.
As is usually the case, Keighley takes to the editor's seat to showcase some of the year's best games (according to TGA, that is), over some emotive music — courtesy of Radiohead, this year.

Alas, in the case of In Stars And Time, I've been thrown from its time-looping RPG trampoline with such violence that I now can't even look at it without breaking out into a sweat.

We had previously received highlights of the event from a Bloomberg article, though with the full interview out, we've learned a lot more. One of the first things Spencer highlights is just how big the gaming industry is. In a world of 8 billion people, he claims 3.3 billion play video games. This means there is a massive market for creators to express their ideas and for businesses to provide entertainment in innovative ways.

Much like the Omni-Man trailer, Quan-Chi also shows off an upcoming Kameo, but a more literal cameo at the trailer's end may be the biggest surprise. 




Mortal Kombat 1 unleashes first Quan-Chi trailer, Peacemaker first look


The trailer shows off Quan-Chi in all his glory, including a particularly nasty fatality involving glass panes. The gameplay is as brutal as you would expect, but some of the shine is rubbed off by Quan-Chi's presence in the game's story mode. 


Joining Quan-Chi is Khameleon, who is an interesting pick for longtime MK fans. …]]></summary>

There are the creepy exomoons, the claustrophobic corridors, and even the possibility that even your teammates will turn on you just to make the quick buck needed to meet a quota. 


Those do a great job of raising players' chances of peeing their pants, but let's not kid ourselves — the true star of the show is the game's gallery of alien monsters. So, perhaps for fun, perhaps in an attempt to make them less scary by fitting them in tight imaginary containers, let's rank them!

        <updated>2023-12-03T17:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The delightfully short and sweet series of Momodora Metroidvanias is coming to a head with Momodora: Moonlit Farewell. Publisher PLAYISM and developer Bombservice describe it as "the culmination" of the series, and it's officially set to drop via Steam on January 11, 2024. 


You can see a glimpse of the latest in the exploration-focused series in the release date trailer: 




The original Momodora was released in 2010. Moonlit Farewell marks the fifth installment in Bombservice's series. 


Moonlit Farewell maintains the detailed, meticulously animated aesthetic of previous entries with a Sigil system that helps customize each run. Sigils can be found while exploring, during events, or purchased at shops. Effects range from attack boosts to increased healing effects, weapon summons, and beyond, and they can be turned off and on at any moment. Using an effective mix of attacks and Sigils sounds like it's going to be key to defeating the assortment of boss battles that await along the way.

Bombservice promises improved visual effects in this one, with the aim of bringing the already established mystical world of the Momodora series to life. 


The story of Moonlit Farewell is set five years after the events of 2014's Momodora III. This time around Koho village's High Priestess Momo has to set out to save the world from demons after a mysterious bell summoned them. Beyond the main Momodora storyline, there was also the 2016 prequel Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight and Minoria, a spiritual follow-up with similar thematic elements. 


With just a little over a month to go before launch, we'll find out how the saga expands shortly.

Brace your carapace for combat in the Early Access trailer. 




Fight like a crab in Fight Crab 2


If the novelty of the first game is still strong with you, or if this is your first crab rodeo, there are some new features to grab onto this time around. Chief among them is Career Mode, which has you raising your own crab and growing along with it as you get ready to throw it into battle. 


Throughout the campaign, you can raise your crab's stats, get new skills and weapons, and climb up the ladder of ranked matches. Once you've had your fill of fighting evil crabs or other crustacean warriors online, you can pass all the obtained skills to another aspiring crab fighter. 


There's also a new control scheme that hews closer to a traditional third-person action game, which is just one addition aiming to make Fight Crab 2 easier to play. Another is the ability for crabs to learn skills that let them automatically perform certain actions. 


All the claw-crackin' confrontations feature live commentary, too, just in case you're not shouting over the action enough already yourself. You can see more of Fight Crab 2 on Steam while we wait for the Early Access period to begin.

This Zen 4 design includes 16 cores and 32 threads, making it their ultimate consumer CPU for highly threaded workloads like video production, 3D rendering... and yes, many video games too! 
This is still a pretty expensive processor, but it's a relative steal versus its launch price of £770. Amazon are now asking just £483 for this flagship-grade model, and that seems a fair price given just how well this CPU performs in everything from games to scientific computing and video rendering.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With The Game Awards just around the corner, Sega has teased a new game announcement at the event. Sending teaser letters to fighting game content creators, it points towards a Virtua Fighter 6 reveal at Geoff Keighley's show. 




On social media, content creators like Curiousjoi and Maximillian Dood have been posting images of said a press mailer they've received, a postcard that reads "New Era New Energy. Make sure to tune in to The Game Awards December 7th." 


Maximillian Dood says on his Twitter post, "Curious, have these gone out to others that are NOT huge fighting game creators?"


One of the replies from Brodoof shows a screenshot from one of the Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown trailers. It has the same exact font, but the color is red instead of blue. This has led many to speculate the press mailing is setting the stage for something new in the Virtua Fighter franchise.

Sega could be planning a new Virtua Fighter with rollback netcode


One of the most important aspects of a modern fighting game is having a great rollback netcode. It lets players around the world battle it out and participate in tournaments online.


"I believe that implementing rollback will be absolutely necessary when developing future titles," said Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown producer Seiji Aoki when interviewed by Gamer Braves.


"While it’s important to create content for fighting game fans, I think it’s important to also create content that viewers or newcomers to the fighting genre can enjoy," Aoki said in the same interview when asked about how to keep the game interesting for both new and returning fans and how they're approaching the eSports aspect of the industry. "For example, I can’t play soccer, but I love watching soccer." 


It's just a waiting game now for eager fans to learn if Sega will revive the beloved Virtua Fighter franchise at The Game Awards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ready to return to the world of Halo? The second season of Paramount Plus' live-action adaptation just released a first look at CCXP alongside a February 8 release date.


The news comes a day or two after the streaming service launched its flagship show's first season on YouTube. Unfortunately, the date was leaked via the descriptions for a bit, so it wasn't much of a surprise. However, we got our first teaser for the new season and it looks to be a ride for sure. 




I Can See Your Halo, Halo


In the minute-and-a-half-long trailer, we see a bunch of wide shots and some action, and the epic scale does feel a bit more on par with viewer expectations. It's just a first look, so we can expect a better picture when a full trailer comes around. For now, what we got looks, dare I say, more promising than the first. 


Despite Halo receiving mixed reviews, the viewership was record-breaking for Paramount Plus, easily prompting a season two renewal. Well, that could be attributed to its looseness in the adaptation department. I mean, the show's first episode had Master Chief take his helmet off (and if you didn't last through that, he takes off more than just that). Personally, I hope the team takes into consideration the feedback from viewers and crafts a series worthy of its fanbase. 


Halo stars Pablo Schreiber (Narcos) as Master Chief/John-117 and Jen Taylor (Halo: Combat Evolved) as Cortana, whom we got to speak to last year. The supporting cast boasts the likes of Charlie Murphy (Happy Valley), Natascha McElhone (The Truman Show), and Bokeem Woodbine (Spider-Man: Homecoming), just to name a few. So, if you have time to kill, you can watch all the episodes free of charge via this playlist and finish the fight before February 8.

        <updated>2023-12-02T17:12:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Prime has officially released its teaser trailer for the upcoming Fallout series, giving fans their first look at the latest venture into the post-apocalypse. 


The trailer comes just days after the first look at the series via a Vanity Fair exclusive. 




The first Fallout teaser trailer is a quick slice of life of the upcoming video game adaptation. Numerous Fallout mainstays are present, such as Vertibirds, Brotherhood of Steel Paladins, an uncannily charismatic ghoul, and a host of Vault Dwellers who seem to be going through a really rough patch. 


There are also plenty of monsters abound in the trailer, including a pretty nasty-looking Yao Guai. In true Fallout tradition, the whole thing is set to a moody 1960s soundtrack. For the trailer, it's Nat King Cole's "I Don't Want To See Tomorrow." 


Prime Video's Fallout series is coming in 2024


Developed for Amazon Prime Video by Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan, Fallout is based on the storied video game series known for its tongue-in-cheek humor and dark storytelling. The Fallout series is a vivid take on a potential post-apocalyptic America populated by militaristic factions, irradiated monsters, and the iconic Vault Dwellers -- individuals raised in fallout shelters who are either the most capable or most clueless people in the room. 


The first Fallout, released in 1997, was a groundbreaking RPG experience where players were a Vault Dweller seeking a water chip to save the inhabitants of Vault 13. Today, the series is perhaps best known for its FPS/RPG hybrid games, starting with 2008's Fallout 3. 


The latest game in the series, Fallout 76, is an attempt at an MMO that has been met with divisive reviews and staunch criticism but is somehow still going strong today.


First announced in 2020, Fallout stars Walton Goggins, Ella Purnell, and Kyle MacLachlan. The series is scheduled to be released exclusively on Prime Video on April 12, 2024.

No matter how many blankets I pile on top of my knees, it hangs there lurking, breathing down my neck, extending its icy mitts down my fingers until they're too frosty to carry on typing. I sometimes worry the cold will penetrate my very soul, a harbinger of something more sinister and oppressive. Oh wait. False alarm. It's just the cat giving me the evils out the corner of my eye because I've stolen their favourite woolen nap pillow. Nothing to worry about. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ready for some sensory overload? Bullet hell shoot 'em up Shinorubi has officially fired off a release date and is now lined up for consoles and PC on January 12, 2024.


Red Art Games previously had Shinorubi penciled in for "early 2023," but clearly time is running out to make that cut. When Shinorubi launches it will be available digitally on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam. Those looking to pick up a physical copy will be able to do so on day one for PS4 and PS5. As for the physical Switch release, manufacturing delays have pushed that one back to Q2 2024.


If you've properly steeled yourself for a full-on eyeball assault, you can see just how hellish these bullets are shaping up to be in the launch date trailer. 




The Deluxe Edition of Shinorubi, pictured below, is limited to just 300 copies per platform and available exclusively through Red Art's online store. Copies of the PS4 and PS5 versions are still available to pre-order, but the Switch Deluxe Edition is already sold out. There's also a Shinorubi Pink Edition for Switch, which packs the game in a steelbook case with a double-sided poster and soundtrack. That one is a little less scarce at 2,000 copies.

Shinorubi marks the first release from the development team at Last Boss 88, who are, as you might have guessed, huge fans of danmaku shmups. For anyone who wants a taste, the game has been in Early Access on Steam since January 2022.

You can redeem an Epic Games Store code from Amazon's website on that date. You will need to be a Prime Gaming subscriber to pick this up, alongside the other games headed to the service.

The December Prime Gaming lineup isn't that bad


Deathloop isn't the only game being given out for Prime Gaming subscribers in December. There will also be the following:


December 14



Akka Arrh 


Aground


SeaOrama: World of Shipping



December 21



Kombinera (through the Epic Games Store)



December 28



A Tiny Sticker Sale 


Asteroids: Recharged (through the Epic Games Store)



Every game other than Deathloop, Kombinera, and Asteroids: Recharged will be available through the Amazon Games app. Asteroids: Recharged, in particular, seems to be an intriguing modern twist on the classic Atari game with co-op functionality and visual upgrades.


Deathloop is worth checking out


Before the mediocrity that was Redfall, developer Arkane Studios created a unique FPS called Deathloop, which revolves around time. Like Groundhog Day, you're repeating the same day over and over, but as you explore the game's world, you'll find out more about the characters and the environments you inhabit. One plus is that you don't have to be hounded by Ned Ryerson every day.


You're also gathering intel on each of your targets while chased down by a (sometimes player-controlled)  rival. There's a lot going on in Deathloop, but it's an intriguing take on the tired genre. 


Deathloop won multiple Game of the Year awards in 2021 from outlets such as GameSpot and the Critic's Choice award from Golden Joystick. "Deathloop combines a classic Arkane stealthy-shooty foundation with a genuinely interesting and fun premise to aplomb," our review said.

Larian's RPG garnered a lot of fans, who became infatuated with the world, story, and especially its characters. Now, in Patch 5, BG3 solidifies a particular fan-favorite character as a part of the journey.


Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 5 launched this week with a ton of updates, including a brand-new epilogue. Taking place six months after the conclusion of the adventure, it lets your player character reunite with their friends and reminisce. And, in the process, remark on the lasting legacy of Bing Bong.

The underlying court orders and other legal mechanisms are intended to make it harder for people to access pirate sites.

This ban apparently applies to Google's 'knowledge panels,' from which the site's problematic URL is carefully stripped.

Christmas definitely isn’t my favorite time of the year. I make the most of it, but not only am I a spiritually-devoid husk, I also once worked a job in retail over the holiday season. If you ever want a reason to give up on humanity, that’s how you do it.


So, I’m bitter about the holidays. Not only that, but I’m well-practiced at being bitter about the holidays. Maybe you are, too. If that's the case, I invite you to learn from my years of humbug-slinging and celebrate the way I do: by playing a bunch of marginally Christmas-related games that pay no respect to the holiday.

As I mentioned in my review-in-progress, there’s really no shortage of extra content for those who don’t want to leave the world of Persona 5. And if you want more Persona 5—more hijinks, gags, and general time spent with the Phantom Thieves—then Tactica can certainly accommodate that.


On top of that, it’s a solid tactics game that even has some interesting ideas. Persona 5 Tactica is lighthearted, fun, and even hits some solid notes near the end with its stance on fighting for your beliefs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gear up squad, we’re going to Arrakis. Activision has revealed skins for its operators revolving around the upcoming Dune: Part Two for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone Season One.




No date was attached to the announcement, but the models for the skins are shown. The characters Paul Atreides (Wonka’s Timothee Chalamet) and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Elvis’ Austin Butler) got revealed and they look… a little uncanny. They both look like they’ve had a bit too much spice, in Dune terms. It’s not known if the Oscar-nominated actors will reprise their roles, as other actors like Anthony Starr for The Boys’ Homelander or Nicki Minaj as, well, Nicki Minaj.


Dune and Dusted


You’d be right to be a little confused with the timing of the promotion and I don’t blame you. Originally, Dune: Part Two was scheduled to release on November 3. However, due to the Hollywood strikes, the sequel was pushed to March 15, 2024. The decision to delay the highly-anticipated adaptation came in late August, so it’d be too late to push them out of Season One. Still, it is weird to see the movie be promoted through, of all means, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.


Granted, Dune is no stranger to video games. For promotion for Denis Villeneuve’s epic, characters Paul Atreides and Chani (Euphoria’s Zendaya) appeared in Fortnite back in 2021. Outside of shooters, Dune sticks to strategy-style gameplay, which is befitting of the book's political landscape. Last year, Shiro Games launched Dune: Spice Wars, which made it’s way to Xbox Game Pass just recently. 


Furthermore, the series is venturing into MMO territory by the folks at Funcom with Dune: Awakening. It’s a strange but nice time for Dune fans. Hopefully, Activision will include sandworm riding in Modern Warfare 3 as a vehicle option. If you can put Nicki Minaj in the game, you can also put in sandworms.


Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is available now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S

The Jared Hess-helmed film, which also stars Aquaman’s Jason Momoa, is set to release on April 5, 2024. Filming is underway in New Zealand and is expected to ramp up by the end of the month.


Around the Block


An adaptation of Minecraft has been in the works for a while, dating back to 2014. Directors like Deadpool 3's Shawn Levy and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Rob McElhenney took turns in Creative Mode before quitting. The movie even had Steve Carell attached to star back in 2016, but he left at a later time. 


Now, Napoleon Dynamite's Jared Hess has taken the reins…]]></summary>

The trailer also gives us a chance to hear Daniel Dae Kim's Masataka Ebina and Danny Trejo's Dwight. Here's what Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has to say about the two characters.
Ebina is the de-facto leader for the Seiryu Clan, a yakuza syndicate whose current chairman is incarcerated. Dwight leads the Barracudas gang in Hawaii and supervises the world's largest counterfeit goods market, aided by his sharp sense of business and even sharper machete.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Turns out CD Projekt has even more plans for Cyberpunk beyond its 2.0 update and Phantom Liberty earlier this year. During a stream detailing the update with developers Paweł Sasko and Monika Janowska, the team at CD Projekt revealed Cyberpunk will be getting a 2.1 update soon that will add a fully functional metro, radioport, replayable car races, boss fight improvements, accessibility features, and more. The update will be available December 5 (the same day Rockstar is launching the trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto), which will also mark the release of Cyberpunk 2077's Ultimate Edition.
The metro system, called NCART in the game, lets players move around the city and take in the views. The Radioport will let players listen to music outside of vehicles. The update will also allow players to to invite their in-game significant others to "quality time" together in V's apartment. The other previously mentioned updates are a little more self-explanatory, though CD Projekt did specifically mention that the boss updates were specifically applied to the late-game encounter with Adam Smasher. He is also now equipped with Sandevistan, which was seen in Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. New vehicles will be added like the Porsche 911 Cabriolet and others, motorcycle handling has been improved, and there are also technical updates like larger fonts and the option to turn off timers in the Breach Protocol minigame.
As stated, the 2.1 patch launches December 5 on all platforms. To read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review, follow the link. You can also read our Phantom Liberty review here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After teasing that it would be releasing a trailer in early December about a month ago, Rockstar confirmed an exact date and time this morning. The trailer for the next be Grand Theft Auto will premiere Tuesday December 5 at 9 a.m. ET.
pic.twitter.com/BguwiJokQt
December 1, 2023
Rockstar shared the tweet above without any context, so it's worth noting that it is technically not confirming that this trailer will be for the next Grand Theft Auto. All it says is "Trailer 1" and a date. But, considering its early November tease explicitly read, "We are very excited to let you know that in early December, we will release the first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto," it's safe to assume that this is what the tweet is referencing.
The art of the tweet also offers the first official tease for the game's tropical setting. It has long been rumored that the next Grand Theft Auto would return to Vice City and a massive leak in September where 90 video related to the game also made that apparent.


If you're on a video game website reading about Grand Theft Auto, it's safe to assume that the excitement surrounding this game does not need to contextualized, but the previous Grand Theft Auto is one of the video game industry's biggest hits of all time. In 2018 it was crowned the most profitable entertainment product of all time.


While waiting to learn more about Rockstar's next game, read Game Informer's Grand Theft Auto V review and then read our thoughts on Red Dead Redemption II. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game.

I mean, just look at this trailer for Ironwood's Vandemeerian vehicle survival roguelike Pacific Drive. How am I supposed to be satisfied with some stupid road after watching that? What's the point of cars if there are no floating cryptid lifeforms, inexplicable walls of energy or lost research facilities involved?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, previously described by Ed as "an exciting action-RPG mix of Elden Ring and God Of War" has a new trailer - and cat-lovers, you are in for a treat, because this game has a cat called Enki which you can use as a magic grappling hook and a handy source of lightning for your groundpounds. Enki has big cute ears and a beaver's tail, and I wouldn't be surprised if he's related to one of those awful, many-limbed gods Flintlock's protagonist Nor Vanek is trying to slay. 


I'm sorry, it's my first time writing about Flintlock, and I realise the "OMG it has a cat!" ship has probably long since sailed. Only hang on, Ed thinks Enki is a squirrel, while Graham thinks it's a dog. Which of us is correct? Developer A44 Games describe Enki as "fox-like", further muddying the waters. There's only one thing for it: you'll have to watch the video and decide for yourself.

An order handed down by a Washington court this week, one of the broadest ever seen in a case of this type, requires dozens of major platforms to help identify the remainder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am late to walk the Path of Exile. Very late: the evergreen free-to-play dark fantasy action-RPG launched literal generations ago in 2013, the heyday of Bioshock Infinite and GTA 5. (It's still arguably the heyday of GTA 5. Bioshock Infinite, not so much.) It's my understanding that New Zealand-based developer Grinding Gears have released approximately one bazillion Path of Exile updates and expansions in the decade since, the latest of which, Affliction, is briefly detailed in a boxout down the page. 


I am not your guy for blow-by-blow descriptions of what Affliction adds to Path of Exile. My cautious summary would be: lots of terrifying trees, and lots of modifiers. I am, however, your guy for a newcomer's snapshot verdict on the sequel ahead of the closed Path of Exile 2 beta on 7th June 2024. In a twist so far-fetched they might just pull it off, the new game is designed both for returning players and newcomers, and I think a lot of that is epitomised by the just-announced Mercenary class, which reflects game director Jonathan Rogers's desire to create combat mechanics that are at once more involved and more inviting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tonight's PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted stream may have been mostly focused on games we already knew about, but there were a couple of surprises hidden away in there, too. One of them was Spine, an upcoming action game that asks the question: what if Sifu also had guns? The new gameplay trailer shows street artist heroine Redline punching, kicking and shooting her way through a cyberpunk-themed world of thugs and armoured guards, and her fancy footwork and the equally agile camera framing looks like it could be quite the combo when it eventually comes out in 2025. Alas, the trailer doesn't give away much else, but I spoke to developers Nekki ahead of tonight's showcase to find more about it, and how it's taking direct inspiration from Sifu and John Wick to become the next big cinematic beat 'em up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After suffering a delay to next year, we now know that the driving-focused roguelite survival game Pacific Drive is arriving on February 22.
The news comes courtesy of today's PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted. Pacific Drive is a first-person adventure that unfolds in a surreal version of the Pacific Northwest. Players drive a station wagon to explore a forest filled with supernatural threats related to a government agency’s experiments gone wrong. Check out a recent story trailer below.  


As a run-based game, the world shifts with every trip into the forest, and the only thing keeping you alive is your trusty vehicle, which you’ll repair, reinforce, and modify using materials found while exploring the unsettling landscapes. Your car will need to stay up to snuff in order to withstand dangers such as the Zone Storm, a recurring maelstrom that obliterates everything in its path, meaning players will have to outrun it to stay alive. 
Pacific Drive will be available on PlayStation 5 and PC. For more on the game, you can check out our extended preview of the game here.]]></summary>

Things aren't looking great for Starfield - or at least, they're looking mixed, as in the Steam reviews, and verified but nameless devs are responding to negative reviews with comments that are basically like "no, our space game is fun and you're playing it wrong". We laugh about this (but also discuss the role of Steam reviews and devs replying to them). As well as that, the lads have been playing, well, the same sort of stuff this week, James brings us talk of mini PCs, and Nate makes us play Dracula or Russell Crowe. Extremely normal.

If you're in the UK, the figure is currently £53.98 on Steam. It's the first time Capcom have sold the base edition of a game for $70 in the US of A, and follows comments this September from a Capcom executive that videogames are priced "too low" these days, based on how much games cost to make.

In the case of my multiplayer hands-on, that empire was the Ix'Idar, a race of burrowing insect critters with a unique resource - pheromones. Boldly disregarding the PR's gentle advice that I start with an easier-to-master race, I set out to swarm the galaxy and immediately found myself at the bottom of the victory or "Succession" point scoreboard, with one player picking off my planets by means of espionage, while others stomped my fleets of stargrubs flat in no-nonsense space combat. 


I did manage to briefly take possession of the titular Nexus, a throneworld which awards beaucoup Succession points to its owner, but it turns out fixating on the Nexus is a great way to set yourself up for a midgame dogpile - you pour resources into capturing it, sacrifice half your fleet to the first invader, then lose it all to the second. With my initially bountiful dominions rudely shrunk to a smattering of isolated planets, I took the coward's way out of the press event and said I had to be going because I had other work to attend to. I didn't at all! I just wanted to go and cry in the toilet. Alas for the Ix'Idar - not so much "lions led by donkeys" as an antfarm in the hands of a wilful toddler.

I say “another” because Shadow briefly appears during Sonic the Hedgehog 2’s mid-credits scene, setting him up as presumably the antagonist of the third film. While we still don’t know his exact role or who will voice him, today’s image, posted above, provides a good look at Shadow below the neck (does he have a neck?), namely his signature air shoes.

November 29, 2023
Production on Sonic the Hedgehog 3 had stalled due to the SAG-AFTRA strikes, and today’s update confirms work has resumed following the strike's suspension. Jeff Fowler remains in the director’s chair, and the returning cast includes Ben Schwartz (Sonic), Colleen O'Shaughnessey (Tails), Idris Elba (Knuckles), and James Marsden (Tom Wachowski).
Whatever the third film entails, it has one heck of an act to follow. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was a box office smash, becoming the highest-grossing video game film of all time in the U.S. until The Super Mario Bros. Movie took that crown earlier this year. A live-action TV spin-off starring Knuckles is also in the works and slated to release early next year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remakes tend to be more exciting than remasters because the improvements often go beyond mere bumps in resolution or framerate. At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window. This will be an evolving list t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s official: a new Beyond Good & Evil game is coming out. No, wait, come back: we really mean it this time. While Beyond Good & Evil 2 is still a no-show for the foreseeable, Ubisoft has confirmed that the original game will see a remaster next year for its 20th anniversary. And unlike BGE2, we know we’ll almost definitely be able to play it in the next 12 months, let alone the next decade, because some people are already playing it.

It's a first-person spellcaster from Slovenia-based Emberheart Games, which takes hefty inspiration from Heretic, Hexen and Ultima Underworld, though it's far more colourful than I remember any of those games being. Check out the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After unforeseeable problems with Elon Musk's public image, my publishers delayed my debut young adult novel about teenagers saving the future using NFTs. I rolled with the punches, fighting back against Musk's cult of personality with a bold new direction for the future of the 'chain in the second novel of my Non-Fungible Future series. Well. I had expected both books to be in your hands already (and on the bestseller list), but now my publishers are concerned by that report declaring "the vast majority of NFTs are worthless". Well then! As we say on the Infobahn: when Turing closes a crypto exchange, he opens an ICO. So in the wake of Cyber Monday, I now present to you a sneak peek at my third Non-Fungible Future novel, a mint read I call 'Worthless'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition is arriving early next year. The news was accidentally posted early to the Xbox store and was even briefly available to play (albeit in unfinished form) on Ubisoft Plus. 
According to its now-deleted Xbox Store page (which was shared by Wario64 on X), the 2003 adventure will now feature 4K graphics and 60 FPS with improvements to controls and audio. It will also feature auto-save and cross-save functionality. Here’s the full blurb:
The store page also included a big batch of screenshots of the remaster, which can view in the gallery below.

According to Ubisoft’s statement to IGN. , the store listing went up early due to a “technical error” 
"As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of Beyond Good & Evil, we're excited to share that the official launch is set for early 2024, and we look forward to sharing more with you in the new year," Ubisoft wrote in the statement. 
Beyond Good & Evil originally launched for PlayStation 2, Xbox, PC, and GameCube in 2003. It stars Jade, a reporter and fighter who joins a resistance movement to uncover a conspiracy on an alien planet. Gameplay involves taking on enemies in martial arts melee combat while using Jade's camera to take photos of clues and evidence while solving puzzles. The cult classic received its first big remaster in 2011 in the form of an HD upgrade, while its long-lost sequel, Beyond Good and Evil 2, has seemingly been in development limbo since its formal reveal at E3 2017. 
Beyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition is expected to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom held a new showcase for Dragon’s Dogma 2, showing off more of the game’s fantastical action but giving fans the one thing they’ve wanted most: a release date. The hotly anticipated sequel is coming on March 22.
If that date looks familiar, that’s because it was accidentally leaked not once but twice. The first instance occurred earlier this month, thanks to a PEGI rating that revealed the March 22 date. The second leak occurred just hours before today’s presentation courtesy of the game’s Steam page. But if you missed both early reveals, today is probably a nice surprise. 
A new trailer shows off more of the game’s story while also offering up new gameplay footage. The trailer showcases the new Trickster Vocation alongside new enemies, such as the towering statue, mythical beasts, and, naturally, dragons. 


Dragon’s Dogma 2 is launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crossover skins are extremely commonplace for in-game stores in 2023, and Among Us is no different. Their latest collaborative effort introduces skins from a list of popular indie games; Undertale, Celeste, A Hat in Time, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Untitled Goose Game, Alien Hominid Invasion, and Castle Crashers. The cosmetics from all seven games will be included in a Cosmicube, which can be purchased with 7000 beans. The crossover includes 25 hats, 18 skins, 12 nameplates, 9 visors, and 6 pets. You can see a gallery of the featured skins below.

The update will also include a series of patches (which you can read right here) and will notably deprecate 2021 versions of the game, pushing players to use updated versions instead. "We’ve been supporting a lot of older versions of the game, and as it continues to grow and get new features, it gets harder to keep up," the patch notes read. "We have to remove older versions so we can focus on improving our system for everyone. Make sure you update your game and thanks for understanding!"
This is the first update to Among Us since they added The Fungle, a new map that takes place in a fungus-infested jungle. You can watch the launch trailer right here.
Are you planning on trying out the new cosmetics in Among Us? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-11-28T18:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, something odd happened in the streets of Gotham. With no prior announcement or fanfare, people booting up Batman: Arkham Knight were greeted with a skin from 2022's The Batman starring Robert Pattinson. But then, as quickly as it appeared, it was removed, all without comment from the developers. While we still don't know exactly why the skin was added accidentally, we know exactly why it was created: it's a timed-exclusive suit launching with the Batman: Arkham Trilogy on Switch.


The collection brings Rocksteady's beloved trio of Batman games to Nintendo's hybrid console, complete with all previously released DLC. The trilogy will also include the aforementioned suit from The Batman, but it won't be limited to the Switch forever – other platforms will get access to the suit "at a later date."
Game Informer, much like the rest of the gaming community, is a big fan of the trilogy, with all three games appearing on our list of best superhero games of all time. While it's been eight years since the last game, Rocksteady has been hard at work ever since working on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which is set to come out on February 2, 2024. If you want to stick to the classics, Batman: Arkham Trilogy launches this Friday, December 1.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only... compromise, calculation and license to misbehave. In Owlcat's forthcoming RPG Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, you play the free-wheeling head of an interstellar merchant's dynasty. Operating on the fringes of uncharted space, you're the owner of a Warrant of Trade that essentially lets you run your own miniature empire within the Imperium, deciding the fates of planets, amassing vast wealth and recruiting a motley crew of xenos, heretics and assorted weirdos. It's the kind of behaviour that'd get you vaporised if you were some run-of-the-mill Space Marine Chaplain, but out here on the frontier, you're allowed to act with impunity, providing you fulfil your overall mandate of adding to the God Emperor's glory and kicking the odd Eldar's head in.


Rogue Traders are arguably the only characters in Games Workshop's brutal and decrepit table-top setting that lend themselves to the role of CRPG protagonist, because they are the only characters in Warhammer 40K's Imperium who enjoy anything like the plot agency of a Commander Shepard. And with that, I think, comes an interesting transformation of the character alignment systems the game shares with other CRPGs such as Baldur's Gate 3.

The Vanity Fair article goes on to give us the first concrete details of the show, thanks to an interview with co-creators Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan, who also created Westworld. The series will star Ella Purnell as Lucy, a "doe-eyed" woman who emerges from her vault with naivete and optimism but is forced to face the horrors of the wasteland. 
"Lucy is charming and plucky and strong," Nolan says. "And then you see she’s confronted with the reality of, hey, maybe the supposedly virtuous things you …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since premiering in late October, Five Nights at Freddy’s has become a big box-office success. It’s already the highest-grossing horror film of 2023, and it has now become horror production company Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film of all time.
The film adaptation of the popular 2014 horror game hit theaters on October 27, grossing a strong $80 million in its opening weekend, the best for any horror film this year. That’s even more impressive given that it premiered on the streaming service Peacock the same day it was released in theaters (becoming the most-watched title on Peacock during its first five days). 
Five Nights At Freddy’s has continued to gain traction over the past few weeks and has now grossed over $295 million ($136 million domestically, $160 million overseas) during the month it's been in theaters. That ranks it at the top of Blumhouse’s highest-performing films, a record previously held by M.Night Shyamalan’s Split, while also climbing over top performers such as Halloween (2018), Get Out, and Glass. 
FNAF is the BIGGEST @blumhouse film of ALL-TIME. Just passed SPLIT. thanks to Emma Tammi, Scott Cawthon, cast & the New Orleans crew, the Henson team, & our partners @universalpics & @peacock. @jhutch1992, @matthewlillard, @Piperrubios, @elizethdlail
November 27, 2023


First announced in 2015 (roughly a year after the first game’s release), Five Nights At Freddy’s stars Josh Hutcherson (The Hunger Games series) with actors such as Elizabeth Lail and Matthew Lillard in supporting roles. The film is directed by Emma Tammi and produced by Blumhouse. The film joins the ranks of other highly successful video game adaptations to release in 2023, such as the other box office juggernaut The Super Mario Bros. Movie and HBO's critically-acclaimed The Last of Us.

With the series’ action built around the incredible manoeuvrability and momentum of the Omni-Directional Mobility gear, the genuine unnerving threat of the titans, and the relatively fragility of its human heroes, it’s just primed to be mined for video game inspiration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the round of layoffs that recently hit Bungie, it had been reported that Destiny 2’s next big expansion, The Final Shape, had been internally delayed to the summer. Bungie has now confirmed that to be the case.
Originally slated to launch on February 27, The Final Shape now launches on June 4. In a blog post, Bungie states that the expansion “needs more time to become exactly what we want it to be”.
“The Final Shape is the culmination of the first ten years of Destiny storytelling and, for Guardians everywhere, countless hours spent together,” Bungie writes in the post. “We want to honor that journey, so we’re taking the time we need to deliver an even bigger and bolder vision, one that we hope will be remembered and treasured for years to come.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chinese company ByteDance is best known for its ownership of TikTok, the international video platform, but it owns a number of other companies as well. One of those companies is Nuverse, a game publisher best known in the West for its work on Marvel Snap. Fans of the superhero card-battler had reason for concern this morning, as an article from Reuters reported that ByteDance had plans to leave the gaming space entirely, with intentions to "divest from titles already launched." This seemed to spell doom for Marvel Snap.
However, the official Marvel Snap X account issued a statement today that this would not be the case.
Dear SNAPPERS,
November 27, 2023
It's unclear exactly why the PC and mobile game will be exempt from any changes, but we're happy to hear that one of the best games from 2022 isn't going anywhere. However, the fates of the workers at Nuverse and the company's other games are unclear, as Reuters reports that "the decision is likely to impact hundreds of employees." The report states that ByteDance will announce this restructure sometime today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dredge was pretty weird to begin with. The indie hit somehow melded fishing with cosmic horror - seamlessly - to create an enthralling adventure where you can never be sure if what you're about to haul out of the depths will have a normal amount of eyes or tentacles. The new Pale Reach DLC gets even weirder, a masterpiece of show-don’t-tell horror that manages to evoke some of the more inspired Bloodborne monsters as well as some of icy, supernatural scares from The Terror. And it's all centred on a big whale. 


Spoilers ahead, friends, but in The Pale Reach, a massive icy landscape has suddenly appeared in the southern, well, reaches of Dredge's world, so naturally we’re off to see what that’s all about, ploughing along in our faithful fishing boat to the hostile new climate. Every path into the landmass is barricaded by imposing ice walls. It's a slog.


It’s also a great setup. We're made to instantly wonder what the hell hides in this treacherous ice field, and the answer is equally great: a massive corrupted narwhal with bulbous glowing eyes. The huge beast dwarfs your tiny ship, but mercifully it’s frozen solid in an even bigger chunk of ice, with only those very angry eyes poking out at us. Four angry eyes on one side of its head, to be very precise.

It's the work of former Hi-Rez subsidiary and nowadays independent studio Prophecy Games, and going by SteamDB listings, it's called Tribes 3: Rivals.
New to the Tribes series? It once went by the unofficial title of "the world's fastest shooter". On the one hand, I'm not sure that claim holds as true in the era of Titanfall 2 or DOOM Eternal or Hyper Demon or heck, even latter-day Fortnite with its rocket-powered rams. On the other hand, and to pick up the tune from Matt Cox's (RPS in peace) 2019 retrospective - WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Here's a compilation of footage from a recent playtest.

In an X post, the team behind The Medium and Layers of Fear asks for fans’ patience in regard to new information on the game while stating that development is going according to schedule. Konami announced the Silent Hill 2 remake last October with a lengthy trailer showcasing the 2001 classic’s updated presentation. The game currently has no release window but will launch on PlayStation 5 and PC. 


Here is Bloober Team’s full update: 
Silent Hil 2 remake was one of many new Silent Hill projects announced last October. The first one to arrive was Silent Hill Ascension, an interactive streaming series that premiered on Halloween. Other projects in the pipeline include Silent Hill f, a new mainline entry set in 1960s Japan, and Silent Hill Townfall, a mysterious title published by Annapurna Interactive and developed by No Code, the creators of Observation. A new live-action film called Return to Silent Hill is also in production by original Silent Hill director Christophe Gans.]]></summary>

Last Train Home has an intriguing premise: taking the Czechoslovak Legion home from the Eastern front via an armoured train directly through the chaos of the Russian Civil War. Its unusual mixture of survival sim, RPG, tactical skirmishes, and narrative history holds together, I think, precisely because your efforts to make it all work provide such a contrast to what an incredible mess the world around you is becoming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In another lifetime, SteamWorld Dig could have easily ended up as SteamWorld Build. When Image & Form first released their 2D digging platformer back in the depths of 2013, its moreish loop of carving out rocky chasms, finding gems and treasure, then upgrading your pickaxe and burgeoning township back on the surface was instantly captivating, and its 2017 sequel continues to be one of my favourite platformers of all time. Now, a decade later, SteamWorld Build has reimagined Dig's core ideas as a handsome citybuilder, placing equal focus on managing your rustbucket town up top, while plundering its depths via an abandoned mineshaft to find treasure, resources and (most importantly) rocket parts, so you can escape your crumbling planet and find a new homestead up in the stars.
Despite the threat of annihilation hanging over the horizon, however, SteamWorld Build is one of the most relaxed and easy-going building games I've ever played. This is a game that's more concerned with keeping your economy running like a well-oiled, uhh, machine than turning a profit, for example, and it merely dips its toe in the genre's wider, ongoing obsession with building up defences to fend off oncoming hordes of malicious town hall-eating nasties. If the scales do get thrown out of equilibrium, the worst that will happen is you get lots of angry little red robot faces appearing above your houses. You won't go bankrupt, you won't get turfed out for being incompetent, and you definitely won't see any kind of game over screen if the aforementioned nasties end up running amok in your mining levels. The stakes, then, are quite low, which is probably a good indication of whether you'll get on with SteamWorld Build, and how much you'll get out of it.

The most endearing aspect of the SteamWorld series is how each of its games relates to one another despite their disparate genres. From tower defense to turn-based RPG, each title offers a unique spin on a specific gameplay experience while adhering to a shared mythos, resulting in a fun collection of games that coalesce thematically. SteamWorld Build, Thunderful's city-builder/RTS hybrid, serves as the latest iteration of this formula. Sporting streamlined genre mechanics, intuitiv…]]></summary>

The Czech site has been under fire for some time and was recently branded a 'notorious market' by the MPA. However, Ulož says that an imminent ban on file-sharing in favor of a private, cloud-based storage model, is due to the strict conditions imposed by the EU's Digital Services Act.

Since its official reveal in June 2021, Palworld has raised eyebrows with its vibrant, expansive world teeming with dozens of monsters ripe for catching but in greater fidelity than Pokémon’s recent entries. In addition to capturing them and harnessing their abilities in battle, you can also wield realistic firearms and other weapons to blast them apart or, more hilariously, arm your cuddly critters with some serious heat.
“Pokémon with guns” has become the shorthand description of Palworld, but the experience packs in survival mechanics, base-building, a central narrative, and other bells and whistles. With so many promises, some have deemed Palworld too good to be true, a sentiment its Tokyo-based develo…]]></summary>

Miles Morales is a comic book character created to represent people of color.
Leading up to the 2008 election, which resulted in the United States’ first African American president, Barack Obama, Marvel wanted to "take a good look" at one of their icons to reimagine as African American. A few years later, when an internet campaign pushed Community actor Donald Glover to play Spider-Man, the icon was chosen, and writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli created Miles. Every iteration of the character continues this legacy of representation, and Insomniac Games’ Spider-Man 2 is no different.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is admittedly unfair of me, but any time a video game reveals itself as free-to-play, my interest immediately dissipates. Free-to-play games are not universally bad; plenty of brilliant design ideas, engaging stories, and fun mechanics can be found in games with no upfront admission fee. But once a game’s goal shifts from singular experience to long-term engagement, any excitement I may have folds in on itself and disappears like Pac-Man.
It all stems from my desire for experiences, not obligations.
In free-to-play and comparable models, success is marked by player engagement. The more rounds a player queues into and the longer they play, the more likely they are to engage with the monetized elements. And the best way to encourage that engagement is to incentivize players to return. Dai…]]></summary>

That’s great, as I love having the opportunity to help someone find gaming experiences that will lead to a great time. But it can be especially challenging if the giftee in question is a younger child who wants to play games, but is perhaps too young or inexperienced with the hobby to know what they might enjoy.

One of the most notable features is how RGG rethought its classic brawler combat. Protagonist Kazuma Kiryu now has two fighting stances, Yakuza and Agent, the latter of which comes with a host of new secret-agent tools, such as an exploding cigarette, a Spider-Man-like cable he can use to whip enemies around, and so on.

Kyle also touches on Assassin's Creed VR before the duo moves on to the main course: ranking fictional video game birds on criteria like how tasty do they look and how bad would we feel about eating them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ah, Thanksgiving. It's a time of year for gratitude, togetherness, repeatedly attempting to explain my job to older relatives, and most importantly, a time when a lot of people come together to eat one really big bird. But here's the thing. Why do we always eat the same kind of bird? I mean, turkey is fine and all, but why not branch out a bit? Why not chicken, or quail, or pheasant?
And that got me thinking – why limit my daydreaming to real-life birds when there's so much delicious-looking poultry in video games? Sure, not every video game bird would be tasty, but it's worth assessing in case I ever get Jumanji-ed into a game one day.
Here's my rating of video game birds based on how good they'd be for Thanksgiving dinner.

It might have more entries in it than any other series out there and it won’t be slowing down anytime soon. On top of that, thanks to its anthology-like nature, if one Final Fantasy game doesn’t click for you, there’s a good chance another one will. As a result, ranking the Final Fantasy series can be highly contentious. Everyone has a lot of love for the first entry they played, and then there are heavy hitters like Final Fantasy X and VII, too. 
However, the staff here at Game Informer did the seemingly impossible: we ranked all 19 mainline numbered Final Fantasy games, including their direct sequels, from worst to best. As a reminder, this ranking is the sum of collective thoughts of the Game Informer staff and your own pers…]]></summary>

Alongside animation studio Illumination, it had teamed up with Red Wing Shoes to make Mario’s shoes from the movie, not as a line of shoes for sale, but rather a hyper-realistic version of the boots – odd proportions and all – to be displayed at the official Nintendo Store in New York City.

The interest in Mario’s shoes began with the movie’s first teaser poster, where the fidelity of Mario’s footwear blew fans away. People wanted to know more about them, which led Nintendo and Illumination to contact Red Wing Shoes, a Minnesota company specializing in work boots, about making some. “We got the call, and naturally, we’re like, ‘Well, Mario is the world’…]]></summary>

In December, that expansion pack is expanding a little more, as Jet Force Gemini is coming to the service.
First released in 1999, Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter developed by Rare, the studio originally known for the Banjo-Kazooie games, but most recently known for Sea of Thieves. It's set on a sci-fi alien world, where players blast through hordes of insect-like creatures.
The most recent way players could experience the game on modern consoles was through Rare Replay, a compilation of classic Rare games released on the Xbox One in 2015.  For a refresher on the game, check out this 60-second rundown Rare put out a few years back.


The Switch Online currently includes 26 other N64 games, including the recently added Excitebike 64. It also includes Game Boy Advance games, Sega Genesis games, and DLC content for popular Switch titles, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the first ways Fortnite was able to prove its mainstream success was by introducing popular real-world people into the game. Whether it's Travis Scott, Lebron James, or Patrick Mahomes, it's become a sort of Hollywood Star of Fame to be featured in Epic Games' hit shooter. Today. Marshall Mathers joins the club – Eminem is coming to Fortnite. 
The Grammy winner will be added to the game's item shop on November 29. The image above shows the three versions of the rapper that will be available for purchase. From left to right, they're called Rap Boy, Slim Shady, and Marshall Never More. This release comes a few days ahead of Fortnite's Big Bang event, which is set to happen on December 2 at 2 PM Eastern. Alongside whatever world-altering event phenomena Epic plans to introduce, Eminem will be performing a live concert. Attendees will receive the Big Bang loading screen, featured at the head of this article.
Fortnite has been in gaming news a lot recently, thanks to the rollout of Fortnite OG, a record-setting new season that throws players back in time to the earliest maps in the game. It's also come under fire for new rules about which skins are allowed in certain creator-made worlds: you can see their response to this controversy here.

Season OG has included weekly updates to add items from Chapter 1's various seasons, too, making it a fun romp through what Fortnite was like years ago. However, Season OG ends on December 2, which is also when Fortnite's next live event, The Big Bang, goes live. 
The Big Bang begins on Saturday, December 2, at 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, and Epic says, "This event marks a new beginning for Fortnite." 
✅ Unforgettable event

Before the event begins, Epic says players will see The Big Bang in the Battle Royale tile in the Discover section of Fortnite 30 minutes prior to its start; that way, you can jump in before the event starts to link up with friends and get your cosmetics in order. And speaking of friends, The Big Bang will support parties of up to four players. 
The Big Bang will be available anywhere you play the most current build of Fortnite, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. If you won't be near a dedicated gaming device during the event, you can check it out using Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Amazon Luna services to play Fortnite via cloud streaming on your computer or mobile device. 
"To prepare for The Big Bang, Fortnite experiences made by Epic will be disable starting 12 p.m. ET on December 2," Epic writes in a blog post. "Creator-made experiences will remain enabled until downtime for Fortnite v28.00 starts at 11:30 p.m. ET."
While waiting for The Big Bang event, read up on everything you need to know about Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG, and then read about how Epic says it's aware it missed the mark with a recent cosmetic restriction update for Fortnite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt Red released Phantom Liberty, the first and last expansion for its 2020 RPG, Cyberpunk 2077, in September. We loved it – find out why in Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review here – and if you enjoyed the base game, it's not an expansion to miss. Currently, it's only available for purchase as an add-on to Cyberpunk 2077, but if you haven't yet picked it up, it might be worth waiting just a couple more weeks. That's because CDPR has revealed Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion in one single package.
Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 5, and will be released in both a digital format and physical. Check out the box art below: 
Big news… Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition arrives on December 5th in digital AND physical form for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC!

November 21, 2023
All that CDPR has shared about this new edition is the tweet above so it remains to be seen if the Ultimate Edition includes any new goodies or enhancements. Given Phantom Liberty and the Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 update improved the game in big ways, reworking and revamping several of its mechanics in the process, it's unlikely the Ultimate Edition will include any changes in that vein. Only time will tell, though. 
For more, read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review and then read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review. After that, read about the things to remember and know before starting Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, and then check out this feature about how the team behind the expansion created its spy-thriller soundtrack. Read about this live-action Cyberpunk 2077 project that's now in the works, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yakuza: Like A Dragon was a very silly game in spite of its dramatic narrative, but its follow-up, Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, looks to give it a run for its money. Between letting Ichiban ride a dolphin and its Animal Crossing-style city-building mode, fans of the franchise’s goofball nature should be in for a treat, and a new batch of screenshots highlight this.
The images provide looks at Ichiban, Kiryu Joryu, and their returning friends, such as Nanba, Adachi, and Saeko, kicking butt in a variety of classes and looking absurd doing so. Other familiar faces will be playable party members for the first time, such as Seonhee, who is shown brutalizing opponents with a whip in the images. It's clear that Hawaii will never be the same once these guys are done with it. 


Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 26. You can learn more about the game and see it in action in this pair of trailers. Be sure to also read our review of its direct predecessor, Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Put your sleuthing caps on, detectives—it’s time to solve some mysteries! We are proud to announce that a whole batch of HeR Interactive’s Nancy Drew games are now ready for public testing:
In Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. 
Nancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.
In Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.
And if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.
The games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.
