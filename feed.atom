Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is not just a great adaptation – Game Informer gave it an 8.5 out of 10 – but it’s also a record holder amongst video game movies. 
That’s because it had the best opening weekend for any video game movie ever, coming in first place at the movies after earning $71 million at the domestic box office, as reported by Variety. With Sonic the Hedgehog 2’s impressive $71 million haul, Sega and Paramount’s video game adaptation beat out Sony and Marvel’s Morbius and Michael Bay’s Ambulance.

When you're discussing video game history, it's often the case that memories will be dominated by consoles like the NES, SNES, Mega Drive / Genesis, N64, GameCube and so on – but those old enough to have lived through the '80s will remember that for a period of time, home computers like the C64, Atari ST, ZX Spectrum and Commodore Amiga were a perfectly legitimate way of playing games outside of the arcade.
It's fitting, then, that alongside the recent explosion of interest in plug-and-play 'micro consoles' like the NES Classic and Sega Mega Drive Mini we've seen some fresh takes on the humble home micro; UK firm Retro Games Ltd. has already produced a miniature version of the C64, and how it's back with a pint-sized facsimile of the Amiga – a platform which, in Europe, at least, was insanely popular during the late '80s and early '90s.

Now that Season 3 of Video Gameography is complete, and the Uncharted series has been, well...charted, we're diving below the depths and soaring above the clouds to spotlight the Bioshock series in Season 4. This week we welcome our guest Bryan Vore back on the show as we take to the skies and explore the last game in this unfortunately short trilogy, Bioshock Infinite.
Bioshock Infinite started pre-production around the same time as Bioshock 2, but while 2K Marin was exploring the depths of the seas once again, Ken Levine and his team at 2K Boston/Irrational Games had their heads in the clouds. Focusing on American exceptionalism, Bioshock Infinite introduces players to the floating city of Columbia, an engineering feat inspired by the World's Fair attractions of yesteryear. We discuss the troubling development that miraculously came together late in the process as well as the main characters, Booker DeWitt and Bioshock's first constant companion in Elizabeth. And listen until the end as we reveal what's in store for the next season of Video Gameography!
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), and former Game Informer Editor Bryan Vore (@Bryan_Vore) as we unpack the history and narrative of the final Bioshock released to date!
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

Easter is already just around the corner! Or Egg Day. Whatever you want to call it. Really, it's just an excuse to eat chocolate and play video games, right? Did you check out our Indie Spotlight earlier in the week? Well, we'll give you another chance below. After last week's Zelda bombshell, it's been a bit quieter otherwise. Nintendo has announced that the Switch Online Expansion Pass will be teeing off with Mario Golf next week. Did you notice that Nintendo is reprinting some 3DS games too? And, if our review is anything to go by, we think that LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga might just be the best LEGO game ever.
Now it's time to chill out and discuss our weekend gaming plans. A few members of the Nintendo Life team have done just that below, so feel free to give our entries a read and then join in with your own via our comment section. Enjoy!

The Quarry is an upcoming game from Supermassive Games, and it’s a spiritual successor to 2015’s Until Dawn. Unlike Until Dawn, which puts players in the roles of multiple characters stuck in a winter mountain cabin, The Quarry is riffing on the classic “teenagers without supervision at summer camp” trope. 
It’s doing it with an impressive voice cast, too, including the likes of David Arquette (the Scream series), Lin Shaye (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Insidious), Ted Raimi (the Evil Dead Series, Candyman, The Grudge), Ariel Winter (Modern Family),…]]></summary>

Poslanci požadují, aby výrobky byly navrženy tak, aby déle vydržely, mohly být bezpečně opraveny a aby jejich části byly snadno vyjímatelné. Domnívají se, že řádné „právo na opravu“ by mělo opravářům a spotřebitelům umožnit bezplatný přístup k informacím o opravách a údržbě. Pokud jde o digitální zařízení, Parlament upozorňuje, že aktualizace softwaru by měly být vratné a neměly by vést ke snížení výkonu například chytrých telefonů. Měly by být k dispozici po minimální období a spotřebitelé by měli být při nákupu o dostupnosti aktualizací plně informováni.]]></summary>

A few weeks ago, spring's annual crack of the bat was in question as MLB's lockout dragged on. The players and league eventually came to an agreement, and the season was delayed slightly, but no games will be lost. As of this writing, we are just a week away from the first pitch being thrown on April 7. Sony's MLB The Show series usually hits a few weeks in advance of the MLB season starting, but this year's installment hits the streets just two days before it on April 5 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation …]]></summary>

Update: LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga has been added to this list. Enjoy!

The release of Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker may have 'ended' Star Wars as we've known it for the past four-and-a-half decades, but all it really did was tie a bow on the cinematic tales of the Skywalker clan and the nine-film saga which began way back in 1977. After all, Star Wars is never really gone.

Following a disastrous debut trailer, in which the iconic blue hedgehog looked far removed from his appearance in every other form of media, the studio went back to the drawing board. Instead of discouraging the filmmakers, the backlash motivated director Jeff Fowler and the rest of the team to pay more attention to the enthusiastic fan base.
“They were absolutely right to request us to work harder and to make adjustments,” Fowler says. “And then to come out the other side and for everyone to be able to high five and celebrate, it felt like we ended in a place where they were happy, and the film was a film that they could embrace.

The story revolves around a prince from a fallen kingdom who finds that he can consume the souls of the dead to increase his power (sound familiar?), and he uses this ability to grow stronger, build his skills, and defeat the monsters and bosses that plague the land.

Join us on a special episode of The Game Informer Show as we review "Emergence," the third entry of the new Paramount Plus show starring Master Chief and company.

Starscourge Radahn is easily one of Elden Ring’s hardest bosses, especially now that he’s back to his usual high-damage output following the fix of a recent bug. There are tons of great strategies to defeat him but what if you could have Radahn just defeat himself. 
Well, one Elden Ring player – izuoku_ on Twitter – discovered a way to have Radahn defeat himself with just one of his own moves, as reported by IGN. Now, before you scoff at this method and call it a “cheese,” one, who cares? If From Software wanted to remove cheesier elements from Elden Ring, it would, but i…]]></summary>

It used to be the case that, if you missed out on a particular game, your only way to catch up was to buy the original console and the original game. Then, thanks to services like the Virtual Console, you could emulate those old games without having to own any old consoles, for much more affordable prices than the ones you might find in second-hand sales.
Then came the era of remasters, with updated graphics, controls, and sometimes even new content, and it was pretty exciting to be able to play old games on new hardware. But the riskiest re-release of all is the remake, which requires taking a beloved game, giving it a total makeover, and hoping that the end product is not an insult to the players' treasured memories. Very few game developers have taken this risk... but when it pays off, it pays off big.

Fan artists and creators are incredible. The dedication and time they put into making art related to their favourite media is honestly pretty inspiring, and there are some extremely talented people out there that make us a little bit jealous!
Now, come on, if you're anything like us, when you first played Zelda: Breath of the Wild, you probably combed over every inch of the map, and scanned every detail of every statue. Well, maybe not that far, but one thing we remember in particular is just how nature was overtaking the ruins and statues dotted around this apocalyptic Hyrule.

Resident Evil Village was released last year, and we gave it a 9.25 out of 10 and a place in our list of the top 10 games of 2021. While we all await DLC for it that Capcom announced was happening last June, prominent and well-proven Resident Evil leaker-insider Dusk Golem has revealed some new information about Moreau’s swamp area in Resident Evil Village. 
More specifically, Dusk Golem reports that Moreau’s section featured mermaid-like enemies at one point before a lot of content was cut from this area of the game. The content cuts happened because Moreau’s ar…]]></summary>

Nintendo surprised us today by dropping a brand new video on their YouTube channel all about Kirby. Given that Kirby and the Forgotten Land is still very fresh in our minds, this makes sense. But this one isn't about Kirby's adventure in a post-apocalyptic world, oh no. It's something much more adorable than that.
Titled 'Kirby's Tiny World', this is a video version (and a translated version, at that!) of the once Japan-only children's picture book Kirby Time: Kirby's Tiny World, which you can find on Japanese Books. That's right, we get read along time with Kirby for free! And honestly, this is absolutely the cutest thing we've ever seen. That's right. Go home everyone else.

Which, though, is the better buy? Both are 1080p-focused cards on sale for £300 or less, both sit at the bottom of their respective GPU hierarchies (the RTX 30 series and Radeon RX 6000 series), and both support ray tracing, so let’s break out the bar chart app and do some comparisons.

Xbox and 343 Industries announced last month that Season 2 of Halo Infinite’s multiplayer is called Lone Wolves and would begin on May 3. Now, the studio has released a quick trailer to showcase some of what players can expect in it. 
Titled “Season 2 Announce – Lone Wolves,” this trailer is short and sweet. It’s less a trailer highlighting all that awaits players in Season 2 and more a trailer meant to build some hype for the new season, which is now less than a month away. However, there are some things that stand out in it, like new cosmetics and most excitingly, new …]]></summary>

In the last few months alone, we’ve endured the cursed nights of Age Of Darkness: Final Stand, called down sky lasers on the hordes of Diplomacy Is Not An Option, and now we’ve got ORX, a dark fantasy tower defence game that blows all of them out of their ditch water moats with its compelling mix of deckbuilding and real-time strategy. It’s not out in full just yet, but its demo got a substantial update this week, adding more levels and a bunch of game-changing cards to the mix that are well worth making a return trip for if you’ve only ever played the original half-hour version from 2020. I’ve lost several evenings to it already, and lemme tall ya, RTS turtlers have never had it so good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we were putting together our most anticipated games of 2022 list back in January, there was one game I knew had to be on it: Mojiken Studio’s A Space For The Unbound. It’s a slice of life adventure about two Indonesian high school students set in the late 90s, and the demo (which has recently been expanded to include the first chapter in addition to its short prologue) instantly captivated me when I first played it a couple of years ago. There are some light supernatural elements that will be instantly familiar to anyone who’s watched the films of Japanese anime directors Makoto Shinkai and Mamoru Hosoda (including a giant, ominous Your Name-style comet, no less), but for the most part this is a much more grounded game than Mojiken have made in the past, such as the fantastical point and click puzzlers She And The Light Bearer and When The Past Was Around. 
Indeed, the only game in their back catalogue that has a recognisable, real-life setting is their short, free browser game Banyu Lintar Angin. Born out of an internal game jam project in 2017, Banyu Lintar Angin once again draws inspiration from the studio’s home country of Indonesia. It only takes a couple of minutes to play, but speaking with its creator Dimas Novan, it was vital in sowing the seeds for what A Space For The Unbound would eventually become.

Nintendo just added a new Dread Mode and Rookie Mode to Metroid Dread last month alongside news that a Boss Rush mode would be added to the game in an April update. That update is now live in Metroid Dread and it brings not just one boss rush mode, but three to the game. 
Marking the second free update for Metroid Dread, this new April update adds Boss rush, Survival Rush, and Dread Rush. Plus, it adds a Practice Mode that lets you practice battles against the many bosses found throughout Samus’ latest journey.

Earlier this summer, the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise turned 30 years old. Sega marked the occasion by holding a Sonic Central stream that teased three new projects (Sonic Colors: Ultimate, Sonic Origins, and an untitled mainline Sonic game) in May, followed by a special 30th-anniversary concert featuring an orchestra playing classic Sonic music.
With the bulk of the celebrations in the rear-view mirror, we caught up with five longtime developers from Sonic Team. Ranging from directors and producers to composers and artists, we covered the spectrum to learn about each individual's unique experiences with the franchise, as well as what 30 years of Sonic means to them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Sonic the Hedgehog 2 launched on Sega Genesis in 1992, it took the foundation laid with the Blue Blur's debut entry and expanded it in myriad ways. In the 16-bit sequel, Sonic had new moves and a two-tailed fox friend to aid him, but with those upgrades came more significant threats from the evil Dr. Robotnik. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 on Genesis was immediately regarded as a definite upgrade over the already strong first entry in the series. Similarly, Paramount's Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie expands the universe established by its predecessor and delivers a better overall film thanks to bigger action setpieces, laugh-out-loud gags, and some terrific fanservice moments.

Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog has long been one of the most recognizable names in gaming. Whether you're talking about multiple long-running comic series, the multitude of animated shows, or the recent live-action universe, it's hard not to know who Sonic the Hedgehog is. However, no matter his omnipresence in multimedia, Sega's mascot will always be known, first and foremost, for his gaming legacy.
The Blue Blur has had his shares of ups and downs, but when Sonic games are at their best, they rival the best the platforming genre has to offer. …]]></summary>

Cellar Door Games has revealed that Rogue Legacy 2, its upcoming roguelite sequel to Rogue Legacy that hit Early Access in 2020, will launch into 1.0 this month. 
More specifically, Rogue Legacy 2 will hit Steam and the Epic Games Store on April 28. If you haven’t yet played the first Rogue Legacy, you can do so now as it's a free game on Epic Games Store from April 7 through April 14. To celebrate today’s news, Cellar Door Games has released a new trailer on IGN showcasing some of what awaits players in the roguelite.

“Rogue Legacy 2 is finally reaching v1.0 and we couldn’t be happier with how it turned out,” Cellar Door Games writes in a press release. “Our goal for Rogue Legacy 2 was always to make ‘Rogue Legacy 3’ because we didn’t want to settle for just more. It had to stay true to the original, but also stand on its own as something new. After nearly four years of development, bringing it to the fans is the final step in this long journey, and we hope they find it as special as we do.” 
The sequel features a new art style – namely, 3D characters set against hand-drawn 2.5D backgrounds – new weaponry, abilities and classes, environments, and more. It also introduces Heirlooms to the series and Cellar Door Games says this pushes that “unique Metroidvania feel by permanently giving heroes new abilities.” 
“Alongside this, Rogue Legacy 2 vastly improves traits to bring greater value to their risk versus reward gameplay, as well as making significant strides in accessibility to let players succeed even when they’re struggling.” 
Be sure to check out these new screenshots from Rogue Legacy 2 while waiting for its 1.0 release on Steam and Epic Games Store on April 28.

The newest Magic: The Gathering set brings Planeswalkers to a whole new plane and the bustling city of angels and demons called New Capenna. The city is run by five families, each with a demon at the head of the table, controlling various aspects of the metropolis' economy. Streets of New Capenna harnesses the golden-age feel of the roaring '20s full of glitz and glamor juxtaposed by a nefarious criminal element, all vying for control of a mysterious magical substance called Halo.

When Gran Turismo 7 launched, it marked the release of another great entry in the long-running simulation racing franchise. However, after some time, players began to realize that cars in GT7 cost a lot more in-game credits than previous games. 
Furthermore, after an update that decreased credits and rewards earned for some races took the game offline for more than 24 hours, players grew even more frustrated with some of the decisions developer Polyphony Digital made. So much so that Polyphony Digital president Kazunori Yamauchi published an apology that contained promises to fix the game’s econ…]]></summary>

Previous Sega Genesis and Nintendo 64 titles that have become available with the expansion include Paper Mario, Banjo-Kazooie, F-Zero X, Alien Soldier, Super Fantasy Zone, and Light Crusader. Mario Golf was well-received when it initially launched in 1999. A bevy of playable characters, including the titular plumber and his mainstay companions (Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, etc.) alongside several courses rendered in 3D for the first time in the golf-centric series impressed and excited a large swath of fans. 
Get into the swing! ⛳

April 7, 2022
Moreover, wind strength, weather, and direction added nuance to the loop, making shots more rewarding. This success continued with the recent Mario Golf: Super Rush, released on Switch in 2021. Nintendo aficionado Brian Shea reviewed Super Rush and gave it an 8.25, saying:
“Despite the underwhelming nature of the story mode, Mario Golf: Super Rush delivers plenty of golfing greatness. With a strong foundation and multiple fun avenues of play, Mario Golf: Super Rush carries on the long-standing tradition of Nintendo sports games by being a good time regardless of your fandom of the actual sport.”

Now, players that might’ve missed out on one of the definitive entries in the Mario Golf series will be able to get a hole-in-one on the blocky prairies of the Nintendo 64 title on April 15. Hopefully, more Camelot Software Planning games will become available or even remastered (we’re looking at you, Golden Sun!).]]></summary>

Cult of the Lamb debuted during Gamescom last year, and it quickly grabbed our attention due to its unique art style, fantastic score, and mix of fast-paced action roguelike gameplay with Animal Crossing-style base-building mechanics. Game Informer editors Alex Stadnik and Wesley LeBlanc recently went hands-on with Cult of the Lamb, playing through the game's first 20 minutes. 
In this installment of New Gameplay Today, Alex and Wesley discuss everything about those first 20 minutes, including how the gameplay feels, how well the two disparate gameplay mechanics in base-building and roguelike action come together, the score, the visual style, and more. And today's New Gameplay Today is extra special because they're joined by Massive Monster creative director Julian Wilton, who discusses the game's development and answers all the questions they had for him.

If you're excited about Cult of the Lamb, this New Gameplay Today can tide you over until the game's release, which is set to happen sometime this year when it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This past Wednesday (April 5) marked the end of Ghost Recon Breakpoint updates. A tweet posted on the game's official Twitter account states, "We will continue to maintain our servers for both Ghost Recon Wildlands and Ghost Recon Breakpoint, and we truly hope you will continue to enjoy the game and have fun playing in solo or co-op with your friends." Despite Breakpoint's end, a new Ghost Recon game has entered development. 
According to Kotaku, the next bombastic chapter in Tom Clancy's illustrious military universe is codenamed OVER. The title has reportedly been in the works for over a year now and could launch in 2023. As far as the fandom is concerned, this fast turnaround could be a good thing. Recent Ghost Recon experiences haven't found the same success as other Tom Clancy titles like Rainbow Six and The Division. Breakpoint, for instance, might have alienated its players after Ubisoft implemented its NFT-based Quartz beta into the shooter's cosmetic rotation.
The only announced and showcased mainline Ghost Recon game around the corner is Frontline, "a massive first-person PVP shooter with epic 100+ player battles" throughout a sandbox called Drakemoor Island. You can read more about the live-service game here. With XDefiant also on the horizon, it's worth pondering if the live-service model might also be a focus for the mysterious OVER project. Only time will tell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The makers of Lego are teaming up with Fortnite creators Epic Games to build some sort of "metaverse" play space. I think that means they're making an online Lego game, a concept which has existed many times before, but they don't really say what it is they're up to. In lieu of explanation, they repeat the word "metaverse".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You’d be forgiven for getting excited about the AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT. A brand new RDNA 2 graphics card, with ray tracing support, that’s both easy to find in stock and available at a comparatively approachable £200 / $230? In the midst of a years-long components shortage, exacerbated by all manner of price-gouging bollocks, it’d be entirely understandable if upgrade-starved PC owners went for this like my cat goes for unattended crisp packets. Especially if they’re happy to stick to playing at 1080p.


Alas, the RX 6500 XT isn’t just an inferior low-end option to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 (one of the best graphics cards, and perhaps the outright best for budget builds right now). It’s an offputtingly slow, sometimes bizarrely-designed GPU in general; instead of providing long-overdue relief to a truly fudged hardware market, it ends up feeling like more an attempt to just sell any old second-rate kit to an audience that’s been left desperate for something, anything that’s new and somewhat affordable.

What's a good metaphor for that? If only there were a food product that had built an entire brand around the concept. I guess we'll never know. But Chinatown Detective Agency, a beautiful, pixely, point and click puzzle game set in a cyberpunk future Singapore, has what I predict will be a pretty polarising central feature, and that is real time historical research.

Warner Bros. Games and Turtle Rock Studios have released a new trailer for the upcoming Back 4 Blood DLC expansion, Tunnels of Terror, and it features a look at two new Cleaners, new Warped Ridden, and more. 
Back 4 Blood was released last October, and it offered a Left 4 Dead-like experience that tasked players with working together to defeat hordes of Ridden through multiple levels. Those who have completed the base campaign might be hungry for more content, and fortunately, the game’s first expansion, Tunnels of Terror, laun…]]></summary>

Not that I would take a Steam Deck to the toilet. But in theory. Look, I'm just pretending this is about me so I don't have to accuse you of anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video game movies have a relatively checkered history. The highs and lows have been well-documented, but the Sonic movie franchise has been a source of happiness for gamers looking to see their favorite titles on the big screen. Sonic The Hedgehog 2 continues that trend of good video game movies, and we're sitting down with the cast and crew to find out how they did it.
Click here to watch embedded media
Join Brian Shea as he sits down with Ben Schwartz, James Marsden, Colleen O'Shaughnessey, and director Jeff Fowler to discuss all the things fans should look forward to in Sonic The Hedgehog 2. To kick things off, Ben and James chat with Shea about what it was like to film the live-action scenes when the former basically had to imagine his furry companion being alongside him. Ben also discusses some of his favorite Sonic games of all time and what moments he'd want to see in a future film.
From there, we move to Colleen to discuss what it's like joining the stacked cast for the first time. She has been the voice of Tails for years through the games and TV series, but this is the first time she's getting to bring her character to life on the big screen. Finally, we sit down with Jeff Fowler to discuss bringing all those pieces together and delivering an experience Sonic fans are hoping for.
Did you enjoy today's video but are curious if Sonic The Hedgehog 2 is actually worth seeing? Our own Brian Shea has seen it, and in his review, he says:
"Paramount's Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie expands the universe established by its predecessor and delivers a better overall film thanks to bigger action setpieces, laugh-out-loud gags, and some terrific fanservice moments."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment is returning to the franchise that made the studio a noteworthy name in the game industry and will remake Max Payne and Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne. The announcement comes with word that Remedy has struck an agreement with Rockstar Games to develop the remake.
The deal is for Remedy to make one big remake encompassing both classic Max Payne titles. The game will be targeting a release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC and will utilize its Northlight game engine. Rockstar will be fronting the bill for development, which will be budgeted to be "in line with a typical Remedy AAA-game production," according to a press release provided by Remedy. Remedy will collect royalties on the game after Rockstar has recouped its funding from development and publishing. No release window for the project was given. 
Remedy CEO Tero Virtala remarked on the agreement, saying, "We're hugely excited to be working with our partners at Rockstar Games once again for the chance to bring the story, action and atmosphere of the original Max Payne games back to players in new ways." 
Take-Two, the parent company of Rockstar, owns the rights to the Max Payne IP, and Rockstar itself developed Max Payne 3, which was released in 2012. Remedy and Apogee Software sold the rights to the series for $10 million in cash and stock shares in 2002, a year prior to the release of Max Payne 2.  
Remedy Entertainment's most recent games include Control, the campaign of Crossfire X, and Alan Wake Remastered. The studio is currently developing Alan Wake 2, a multiplayer game with Tencent codenamed Vanguard, and a multiplayer Control spin-off.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia's RTX 3080 Ti and 3090 Ti graphics cards aren only a bit faster than the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 that came before them, but they are proving much easier to get ahold of at their (admittedly high) recommended retail prices. 
Today, Scan's selling both models at RRP, with the 3080 Ti costing £1049 and the 3090 Ti costing a cool £830 more than that. These are both high-end cards with a price tag to match, but the Founders Edition models are generally the cheapest you'll find - so we thought you should know about this unprecedented stock situation!

THQ Nordic, however, is confident in its plans and has revealed the date and time for its second annual digital showcase.
Click here to watch embedded media
On August 12, the THQ Digital Showcase will show off all of the new and upcoming games from the Embracer Group-owned publisher. THQ Nordic released a video you can watch above that shows off clips from its slate of titles to hype up the announcement and reveal the date. Most of the games included in the video were featured in last year's digital showcase, including Outcast 2, Jagged Alliance 3, and Spongebob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake, though none of these are currently confirmed for the 2022 show.
The description from the video is all we have to go on regarding its contents as of now. Here's what it says:
With over four months of advance notice, there's no excuse to miss THQ Nordic's series of summer announcements. The festivities begin at 12 p.m. Pacific on August 12. You can watch the show on YouTube, Twitch, and Steam. We'll keep you updated on the other events happening throughout the remnants of what was previously known as E3 season.]]></summary>

The main focus of Diamond Dynasty in MLB The Show 22 is to assemble the ultimate roster, hopefully consisting of as many elite-ranked players as possible. This pursuit of power will also net you other items, including classic stadiums. You can get a Choice Stadium pack by playing horribly in one Mini Season game.
All you have to do is complete three errors in the span of one three-inning game to complete the "Are you even trying?" mystery mission. Adding terrible fielders to your roster isn't necessary; all you have to do is make terrible throws to first base. You'll likely lose the game, but you'll walk away with a classic stadium in return. The challenge expires on May 2, 2022.
I played the game on Legend difficulty to ensure the CPU would make good contact. I lost the game 27 to zip. Yes, it took that long for three legitimate ground balls to be put into play.
For more on MLB The Show 22, check out our review in progress. This year's game is quite good on new-gen machines yet struggles mightily in the tech department on Switch. This is the first time the game is on Nintendo's platform, and it just isn't as smooth or polished as the other versions.]]></summary>

Shiro Games and Funcom have announced Dune: Spice Wars will be entering Early Access at the end of the month, once again embroiling the planet of Arrakis in a resource war starting on April 26.
The Early Access date was announced on the Dune: Spice Wars site along with the reveal of the fourth playable faction, the Fremen. The post shares a quote from Shiro Games CEO Sebastien Videl. He says, "With so many massive Dune fans in the studio, the excitement I see every day of working with this universe is very real, and we hope this comes across in the game. With all this passion for the source material, and all the know-how we've gathered from making Northgard, we can't wait to put this game into players' hands." 
As for the addition of the Fremen to Spice Wars, this marks the first time the now Arrakis-natives will be a main playable faction in any Dune strategy game to date. The Fremen are led by Liet Kynes, who holds dueling allegiances to her people and to the emperor as a planetologist. Her faction interacts with the harsh deserts of Arrakis more favorably than the feuding houses and smugglers they will contend against. The Fremen can move through the sands further before succumbing to exhaustion or attracting massive sandworms. They specialize in stealth and guerilla tactics and can make use of and ally with neutral territories.
Spice Wars isn't the only game making use of the Dune property in development under Funcom. The publisher is also working with German studio Nukklear on an open-world survival multiplayer game set in the Dune universe.
You can play Dune: Spice Wars, the 4X and real-time strategy hybrid, later this month when it hits Early Access on PC through Steam.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've ever played 2019's My Time At Portia (and given that game's popularity, statistics suggest a bunch of you have) you'll know the appeal. It's a life sim set in a post apocalyptic world where, instead of punk metal bikinis and murder, the vibe is regrowth and bright colours; a sort of juicy 3D Stardew Valley with an emphasis on crafting. 
But now the sequel My Time At Sandrock is launching into early access on May 26th, bringing a whole new region to restore. Sandrock may look more traditionally post-apocalyptic, being as it is a sandy outback populated by cowboys, but it's still got a helping-hands community feel at its core, plus an interesting eco-friendly angle and an all-new multiplayer mode. But its origins were much more modest. As Pathea Games' executive producer Zifei Wu tells me, Sandrock originally began life as a My Time At Portia DLC pack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a brief stint at NetherRealm Studios last year, the game director of Days Gone at Sony's Bend Studio has announced he has started work at Crystal Dynamics. 
In a Tweet posted today, Ross repromoted a host of job openings at Crystal Dynamics and, at the same time, revealed he is working as a design director for the company. "I'm excited to announce I now work at the amazing Crystal Dynamics as Design Director. That's all I can say other than I'm thrilled with the project, and especially the team of really wonderful people," says Ross in the Tweet. 
I'm excited to announce I now work at the amazing Crystal Dynamics as Design Director. That's all I can say other than I'm thrilled with the project, and especially the team of really wonderful people.
https://t.co/HjDFIFk7MF
April 5, 2022
Ross leaves a palpable mystery hanging of which project he's attached to. We now know of two upcoming projects that Crystal Dynamics is working on: the just-announced Tomb Raider game running on Unreal Engine 5 and Xbox and The Initiative's new Perfect Dark title, which Crystal Dynamics was announced to be assisting with development in September 2021.
Whether Jeff Ross is working on either of those projects or something else entirely is unknown. It seems the studio isn't lacking in exciting projects at the moment. Considering the call for more developers to join the team, Crystal Dynamics looks to be staffing up appropriately. 
Crystal Dynamic's most recent release is the live service superhero team-up Marvel's Avengers, which has seen its share of troubled development while revamping many of the game's progression systems and releasing new characters and content expansions since its release in 2020.
Other than Days Gone, Ross was heavily involved in the design for most of the Syphon Filter series and Resistance: Retribution. Earlier this year, he spoke openly about his time developing Days Gone and the lack of a green light for a sequel despite the game selling millions of copies.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funcom today announced an early access launch date of April 26th for Dune: Spice Wars, a new real-time strategy game set in Frank Herbert's sci-fi world of giant sandworms and winged underpants. Even aside from my enduring love of megafauna, Spice Wars is made by Shiro Games, the studio behind Wartales and Northgard, and that's enough to have my interest.

Bethesda has released a new video all about Vasco, the robot companion seen in previous trailers and videos that will accompany you on your journey through the stars. 
In the video, which runs a little over a minute, Starfield’s lead artist, Istvan Pely, highlights what to expect from Vasco. He says the robot is meant for, well, everything – Vasco is great for space travel, on-land traversal, defensive needs, and more. While little is known about Starfield, from this video alone, it sounds like Vasco will be with us for a lot of our time in the game, if not all of it.

Here’s what Pely says about Vasco in the video, in full: 
For more about Starfield, check out this trailer that details some of its lore, including information about bloody wars, violent space pirates, galactic mysteries, and more. Watch these three Starfield videos that showcase some of the locales we’ll be visiting in-game after that and then watch this Starfield developer diary that discusses the game’s open world freedom.

To unlock every character in Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, you'll need to play through all nine movies and perform specific tasks, but you can get a few by simply entering a code. TT Games and Warner Bros. Interactive provided Game Informer with several codes at launch. When you boot up the game, enter the pause screen, then access the option "Enter Code."
The codes will add a variety of characters like Dengar and Emperor Palpatine. Getting these characters early is a big win, as they are a part of classes you'll need to perform certain feats and don't normally unlock until later in the game. Here are the codes:
Admiral Holdo: XV4WND9
C-3PO (Holiday): C3PHOHO
Chewbacca (Holiday): WOOKIEE
DARTH VADER (Holiday): WROSHYR
Dengar: OKV7TLR
D-O (Holiday): TIPYIPS
Emperor Palpatine: SIDIOUS
Gonk Droid (Holiday): LIFEDAY
Grand Moff Tarkin: 3FCPPVX
Nute Gunray: WBFE4GO
Poe Dameron (Holiday): KORDOKU
Poggle The Lesser: Z55T8CQ
Ratts Tyerell: GR2VBXF
Razor Crest (Ship): ARVALA7
Resistance I-TS Transport (Ship): SHUTTLE
We'll update this list as more character codes are discovered. Until then, have fun unlocking characters on your own, and may the Force be with you!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga represents great value. All nine Star Wars films bundled up in bricks! But do its pieces really come together? Well, yes and no. The game is charming and breezy, offering plenty of locales and set pieces fans of the force will fawn over. Yet its episodes are wildly inconsistent, with stories told at lightspeed and open world hubs filled with so many collectible bricks it solidifies your brain to a lump of mortar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Regular readers will know that I have been complaining about moving to another country for some time. This move has now happened, but if you were hoping for an update on how I am getting on with a massive virtual jigsaw, you will be disappointed. Everything I own (bar the suitcase of clothes Mr. Ryanair allowed on the plane) has been held by customs. More monstrous is that my stuff actually cleared customs, but some absolute head-melter unrelated to me or my boxes of pens - and who, I am choosing to assume, tried to ship a load of high grade cocaine into Ireland - got the entire container stopped in Dublin.
This means that I have been without any TV for two weeks. Nor any books, video games, or even my big bag of crochet. We didn't get internet until two days ago. It is only by the grace of a technician looking at an HDMI cable stuck in our wall jack, stroking his chin, and then yanking the cable really hard that I'm talking to you now. In those two weeks, I discovered I am weak. But by a stroke of complete luck the new flat faces an busy shipping lane in an estuary. So I have also discovered a deep love for big boats and VesselFinder.

Come watch The Coalition's vid to gaze deep into a man's pores and coo over aggressive fog, but don't assume the tech demo reveals any specific game they're making.

One of the best games from January is coming to more platforms in less than two weeks. Drinkbox Studios has announced it will release Nobody Saves the World on PlayStation consoles and Switch this month.
Along with the new console editions of Nobody Saves the World, Drinkbox is introducing local co-op to the game on all versions on the same day. It previously featured online cooperative play, but this update will allow for multiple people in the same room, maybe even the same couch, to play together. What a concept! The Switch version can be played in tabletop mode, with each player using a single Joy-Con, while the PS5 and PS4 versions will recieve cross-gen compatibility for its online play.
A new trailer was released alongside the announcement showing off gameplay and promoting the review scores the game received on its initial release a few months back.

Nobody Saves the World puts players in the shoes of a weakling "nobody" who acquires the magic wand of a powerful sorcerer, granting him the ability to change his form at will. He'll have to use this shape-shifting to purge a goofy kingdom of corruption that's plaguing the land. I really enjoyed my time with Nobody Saves the World, giving the Xbox and PC releases an 8.25 out of 10. It's fun, wacky, and provides plenty of opportunities for player expression in the versatile form-swapping system. Read my full review to find out why its worth checking out.
Drinkbox Studios will launch Nobody Saves the World on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch on April 14. You can play it now on Xbox consoles through Game Pass and PC.]]></summary>

Supermassive Games has released the first 30 minutes of gameplay from The Quarry, which is its upcoming spiritual successor to 2015’s Until Dawn. 
If you’re unfamiliar, The Quarry is a slasher set in a summer camp. Like the 80s and 90s movies that inspired it, the summer camp is very much a major part of The Quarry as is the cast of young people together there with little to no supervision. In it, nine teenage camp counselors are left overnight at Hackett Quarry, free of kids, supervision, and most importantly to the tropes Supermassive is riffing on rules. 
As expected, things go awry and people start to die as “something far more sinister” begins to hunt them throughout the night, according to a press release from the studio. It will be up to you to control and interact with characters played by actors like David Arquette (the Scream series), Lin Shaye (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Insidious), Ted Raimi (the Evil Dead Series, Candyman, The Grudge), Ariel Winter (Modern Family), Justice Smith (Detective Pikachu), and Brenda Song (The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, Dollface), amongst others. 
If you’re interested to see what all of this looks like in action, you now can, thanks to 30 minutes of gameplay from The Quarry’s gameplay, which is now live over on IGN as part of the publication’s month-long coverage of Supermassive Games’ latest. You can watch it below:

Ubisoft announced on Twitter today that the ongoing development of Ghost Recon Breakpoint is ending. 
The post reminisces on the recent content released for Breakpoint over the last two years and highlights the final content that came to the game in recent months, including bringing Splinter Cell's Sam Fischer into the game and the inclusion of AI teammates.
Hey Ghosts, we have an important message we would like to share with you all 👇 pic.twitter.com/kYeyVWVtgi

Motherland mode, tons of new items including the 20th anniversary iconic outfits and Quartz items for Ghost Recom Breakpoint. We will continue to maintain our servers for both Ghost Recon Wildlands and Ghost Recon Breakpoint and we truly hope you will continue to enjoy the game and have fun playing in solo or co-op with your friends."

The post goes on to give thanks from the Ghost Recon team to the players who have supported the franchise. There's no work on what's next for Ghost Recon, nor the teams who have been working on creating new modes and content for Wildlands and Breakpoint.
Ghost Recon Breakpoint originally released in October 2019. You can read our review of the open world shooter right here.

Click here to watch embedded media
My Time at Sandrock will have players crafting and exploring in a new land, the dusty desert region of Sandrock. There, you'll play as a Builder who can craft, gather, and construct devices and machines to "save the town from the jaws of economic ruin." 
Like Portia, Sandrock development started following a successful Kickstarter in 2020, and the game has been in backers' hands for an extended beta period for almost a year. The Kickstarter raised over $500,000 to bring the sequel to life, and now we're just a handful of weeks away from the public's opportunity to get their hands on it.
My Time at Sandrock will be available in early access on May 26 on PC through Steam and the Epic Games Store for $24.99 but will increase in price when Sandrock is fully released.]]></summary>

Along with the engine's release, The Coalition showed off its cinematic test of the tech in a demo video called "The Cavern."
According to the video, the demo is not representative of a game that's in production. "The Cavern" features a man in a dark cave, facing off with an imposing and impressively rendered smoke that moves in abrupt ways smoke shouldn't be moving in, and a deadly creature lurks within. The man only has a sharp, glowing crystal in hand to defend himself against the dangers stalking him in the darkness.

Crystal Dynamics revealed during today’s State of Unreal 2022 presentation that it has just begun development on the next Tomb Raider game and it will be developed entirely in Unreal Engine 5. However, if you’re looking for anything more about the game, that’s sadly all that was shared. 
Crystal Dynamics is incredibly excited about the future of Unreal and how it will help us take our storytelling to the next level. That's why we're proud to announce that our next #tombraider game is being built on Unreal Engine 5! pic.twitter.com/UFMiWzJAZc
April 5, 2022
Here’s what was announced, in full, by Crystal Dynamics’ Tomb Raider franchise general manager Dallas Dickinson: 
As for what to expect from this Tomb Raider game, it will likely continue the story of the recent trilogy from Crystal Dynamics (with help from Eidos-Montréal on the final entry). However, that’s pure speculation – there’s always the possibility that Crystal Dynamics could reboot Tomb Raider once more, just like it did in 2013. However, the studio always referred to its trilogy reboot as an origin story for its Lara Croft so perhaps this new Unreal Engine 5-powered Tomb Raider will be the first game in the reboot’s timeline where Lara Croft is the tomb raider many think of when they hear the words “Tomb Raider.” Only time will tell. 
For now, read about everything announced during today’s Unreal Engine 5 presentation, and then read Game Informer’s thoughts on the most recent Tomb Raider game in our Shadow of the Tomb Raider review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam Deck makers Valve are looking to avoid any further delays in getting their portable PC to the waiting hands of reserve order holders.  The Deck, which launched in February after missing a planned release in December 2021, has only just finished its first round of shipments; now it’s moving into the Q2 2022 phase, Valve are “ramping up shipments” to make sure everybody gets theirs within their current order availability estimate.


That’s according to the Steam Deck Twitter account, from which Valve also announced that they’re clarifying what these availability estimates actually are. So far these have been given purely as Q2 2022, Q3 2022 and so on, but the Deck’s Steam store page will now list the actual months in that quarter – including your personal delivery estimate, if you’ve already got a reservation waiting. This change won’t affect when the handhelds are ready, it just saves a Google search for anyone less familiar with the business-speak of quarterly codes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games has officially released Unreal Engine 5, the game development engine it first unveiled in 2020. This is the same engine used for last year’s surprise Matrix demo, The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience. 
Now, it’s out and available for anyone and everyone to download and use. Plus, to get people started on their Unreal Engine 5 journey, both in development and those who want to mess with it more casually, Epic Games has released Lyra, a new playable shooter demo. You can, of course, simply play Lyra – it looks like Splitgate mixed with Fortnite shooting mechanics –  but what makes this demo unique is that it can be completely customized on the development side. This gives users the chance to tinker with lighting, platform locations, and more.

Epic Games also released City Sample, another Unreal Engine 5 demo, but unlike Lyra, this one isn’t playable. It’s the same city from The Matrix Awakens experience, but in this, you’ll be able to freely view the city, its buildings, its vehicles and pedestrians, and more.

Of course, this is just the start of Unreal Engine 5. Like Epic Games' development on Unreal Engine 4, the company will continue to iterate on Unreal Engine 5 to implement new features, updates, tools, and more. There are developers out there already using this new engine, including Epic Games itself – Chapter 3, Season 2 of Fortnite, which is what players are playing today, runs on Unreal Engine 5.

        <updated>2022-04-05T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chrono Cross was one of those Square JRPGs that never made its way to Europe at its original time of release. Heck, the first time I got to play time-travel classic Chrono Trigger was when the Nintendo DS version came out in 2009, almost 15 years after it first came out on the SNES. Chrono Cross, its semi-related but not direct sequel, has taken even longer to get here. First releasing on the original PlayStation in 1999 in Japan (and 2000 in the US), it's finally arriving on PC and modern consoles on April 7th as Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, which bundles the original game with its accompanying text-based side story Radical Dreamers that only ever released on the ill-fated Satellaview. The latter's original 4:3 pixel art looks mildly ropey blown up on today's screens, but the main game has received all the modern conveniences you've come to expect from Square Enix's recent run of retro PC ports: new HD character models, re-orchestrated music, multiple font options, and the holy grail: a fast-forward button.
I'm nowhere near the end yet, but from what I've played so far, Chrono Cross is a rollicking good time. There are dozens of characters to meet and recruit to your party that can tangibly change your path through the story, the turn-based battle system offers oodles of depth and variety, and Yasunori Mitsuda's revamped score is right up there with the Final Fantasy greats. For all its buff and polish, though, Chrono Cross has, sadly, also been struck by the same curse as other Square Enix PC ports. The lack of settings options makes it hard to pin down exactly what the problem is, but there's something about the performance and inconsistent frame rate of my review build that's so fundamentally borked that it's like those 22 years haven't even happened. If you, too, have been looking forward to Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, I'd strongly advise waiting for a few patches to arrive before dipping your toes in.

        <updated>2022-04-04T16:10:47.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo Infinite officially launched last December, receiving rave reviews from critics and fans - including Brendan’s review here at RPS. It peaked with over 200k viewers on Twitch. And for many content creators like Kevin Lynch, aka KevinKoolx, December marked their best month ever in terms of engagement on YouTube and Twitch. Halo, after a decade of somewhat divisive releases, was back. It’s hard to overstate how impressive a feat this was, since the Halo fanbase is almost as divided as the Star Wars one - a seemingly trivial topic like the inclusion of sprint is just one of many decade-long points of contention. But somehow with Halo Infinite 343 Industries created an experience that almost every type of Halo fan could rally behind. But now, just four months after launch, Infinite is struggling to retain its playerbase.

 Now the Twitch peaks are below 10k and dropping, with the averages even lower. Lynch says February was his worst month views-wise in over a year. You'd expect some tail off after launch for any game, but every content creator I’ve spoken to echoes this sentiment: engagement for Infinite is abnormally low for a live service-game at the beginning of its multi-year journey, especially for a franchise as big as this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strike 3, the most prolific 'copyright troll' in the United States, is suing an individual said to have pirated its movies using BitTorrent. While that is nothing out of the ordinary, the currently anonymous defendant is now in a battle to prevent Netflix and Google from handing over masses of personal data that the adult movie company somehow claims is relevant to its case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Four US senators have voiced concerns about Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard for $69 billion, urging the Federal Trade Commission to consider the impact on workers before approving the proposed merger. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Sheldon Whitehouse, and Cory Booke raised this in a joint letter to the FTC chair yesterday. Considering that Actiblizz are facing many, many, many accusations of discriminatory and abusive working conditions, and that the CEO who reportedly intervened to protect one alleged harasser is still happily with the company, they're worried that the merger might make things worse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The most despicable, awful and down right evil thing I’ve ever done in a video game was during a Dark Side playthrough of Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic. At the end of the side quest Honest Debt, you convince a man to either spare or gun down a rather horrible chap who wronged him greatly. There’s nothing particularly remarkable about that - I’ve encountered the same thing dozens of times in games - but what comes after is a real doozy.
Not content simply with nudging the fella into giving in to his worst impulses, I then proceeded to persuade him to wipe the very memory of his nemesis from the galaxy, up to and including hunting down his friends and family members. Bastilla Shan, noted Jedi do-gooder, pointed out that neither she nor the Jedi council would approve. I was giggling like a schoolgirl.

Firstly, that Kojima's bonkers hiking postal sim is still one of the best open world games around. If you haven't read my full thoughts on the new Director's Cut, please do consider having a gander. The second most important thing is that Death Stranding's photo mode remains just glorious, brilliant fun, and it therefore felt appropriate, nay, necessary to give my good old BB Boys another trip for the album.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And breathe... We did it! We made it through the first three months of 2022, potentially the busiest first quarter of any year to date. By comparison, April 2022 almost seems a little light when it comes to new PC releases. Only one AAA blockbuster launching this month? How quaint. 


Still, this relatively quiet period finally gives indie games a chance to breathe again. There are a ton of super interesting, smaller titles launching on PC this month that I’m excited to share with you all today. From epic turn-based RPGs based on English mythology to offbeat walking simulators about free will, there’s something for everyone launching on PC this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The main consolation of disliking a genre is the childish fun you can have by describing it badly and pretending you don’t know its name. For example, there's probably a generally accepted term for RPGs about traipsing around dungeons killing rats, while turning and moving strictly at 90 degree angles. But I actually typed out "Dungeons of Gridlock" because I genuinely thought that's what Legend Of Grimrock was called. For once, I am not trying to annoy fans of a thing I generally hate.
That's because I've been playing Potato Flowers In Full Bloom, which is very much one of those games. And it’s the first I’ve ever enjoyed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck’s battery life isn’t one of its best qualities. While this weakness is outweighed by the pleasures of playing PC games in bed or on the bus, most such games will drain the Deck quickly, requiring a degree of foresight if you want to entertain yourself on a long trip away from mains power. At the same time, different games will drain at different speeds, with some allowing Valve’s handheld to last hours longer than others.


Ultimately, I think the only truly accurate way to measure and judge the Steam Deck’s battery life is to test a bunch of different games to see how long it lasts with each. So I have! Here you’ll find a list of games with how long they took to empty the Deck’s battery from full. I’ll be coming back and adding more to the list as I test them, so you can see for yourself what uptimes to expect from your favourites.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The comedy of Borderlands is like a high-recoil submachine gun. Hit and miss. In poorer moments, it falls into the trap of the sketch show, flogging a perfectly fine jokehorse to the point of putrefaction. In richer moments, it flips your expectations with a huge scene-changing gag that solicits a hearty giggle. Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is more mix for the bag. It's a loots-be-shoot with a moreish loop urging you onward, boasting characterful art design and thick-lined scenery goading you to pause for yet another snap in photo mode. For Borderlikers, the gun compulsion and farty japes will be enough. It exists as a handsome world to roam through with pals, half-listening to dialogue while Paula chews toast and Jeremy complains about work. As that, Tinalands is fine. It is also 100% not for me.

There's a hint of Sekiro in there, with katana clashing combat, combined with a mysterious story that has me itching to know more.

One of the (many) talking points around the game was its art style, and the perception that Blizzard had made the art style lighter and friendlier versus the gothic greys of the previous two games. The criticism seemed a little overblown and silly at the time, but here we are reading the latest quarterly update on the development of Diablo 4. It focuses on the new game's art, and the phrase "return to darkness" is used repeatedly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, the Electronic Wireless Show podcast is talking about TV adaptations of video games, specifically the best games that would make for great telly box shows, rather than what's already been turned into visual screen fodder (*cough* Halo *cough*). Alice Bee is away this week, adapting to life in a brand-new country, leaving Nate and Matthew to dwell on the merits of The Mandalorian, and whether a show following the life of a Halo grunt would be better than big flashy Master Chief quips.
Matthew puts forward the idea of a Hitman TV show in the vein of Succession, focusing not on Agent 47, but the elite corporate villains he assassinates, as they deal with various cast members being offed in mysterious circumstances. Nate, meanwhile, wants to go all-in on a Dungeon Keeper sitcom, and The Office-like monster relationships therein.

You have one week to claim the start of Creative Assembly's strategy trilogy set in Games Workshop's fantasy world of WH0K. Epic have also brought back a previous freebie, the first-person stabber City Of Brass. A tidy haul for the small price of using the Epic Games Store.

Having just hit early access, this Mesopotamian pomegranate-’em-up is certainly no epic, and you can see pretty much everything it can do within a couple of hours of play. But it’s been under development for five years, and by Hammurabi’s majestic beard does it show.

The new Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is a more mature-looking replacement for the 2021 version, while also introducing two brand new components from AMD: the Ryzen 9 6900HS CPU and the Radeon RX 6800S graphics chip. Much like the key internals of the MSI Raider GE76, then, these components are up for first-time testing as much as the rest of the laptop is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo meets The Boys is the four-word elevator pitch of Stitch Heads and Raw Fury's new isometric hack and slasher - and judging from the amount of loot, blood and minced limbs I saw in my hands on demo last week, I'd say they're pretty bang on the money, albeit with an extra dash of Borderlands thanks to its cel-shaded comic book visuals. Whichever way you slice it, though, Superfuse makes a striking and violent first impression. 
Perhaps it's because I'm playing as its Berserker class, a large walking slab of man muscle whose axe and (comically large) fists can pulverise anything and everything standing in its way. Or maybe it's because the devs have given me free rein of the game's extensive skill tree, letting me pile in dozens of points into attacks, abilities and power-ups normally reserved for later on. Superfuse may be a loot-driven hack and slash with hundreds of different weapons and armour components to pick from, but its skill tree is equally vast, giving you as much flexibility in how your attacks play out onscreen as your various wardrobe choices - and some of its effects are deliciously gory.

It’s a concise expression of everything the town’s been through: the rampaging bandits, the cannibal kidnappings, the swirling tornados. Filling the graveyard has been a solemn bid for order in the wake of so much chaos.
It’s not that way in Bripton, the next town over. The graveyard there is uncannily empty, save for a similarly bare tree. But you can change that, should you so choose: shoot up the bank or fight a duel and, the next time you return to that settlement, new plots will have appeared for every life snuffed out. Weird West even suggests you head to the local cemetery to loot any bodies you’ve missed - though its reputational system implies you should ensure nobody’s watching first.

Bouncing around an arena and carving demons into hunks of meat gets a bit repetitive for my tastes. Which is weird! I love FPS games and repetitive things, like dying in Hades over and over again.
I'm into Nightmare Reaper because it's repetitive... but not. It's a roguelike DOOM-inspired shooter where you blast through procedurally-generated levels and their demonic denizens, earn cash, put points into a skill-tree, and get as far as you can. The quest for loot has elevated this from a potential "Meh" to a solid, "Oh yeah".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a strange thing, returning to the world of Death Stranding after more than a year away. Having done that classic thing of rinsing almost every last delivery out of it before finally strapping myself in for its rollercoaster ending back in 2020, there hasn't been much reason to return to my precious, daft BB Boys in the intervening months - not even its Cyberpunk 2077 crossover was enough to tempt me back. At long last, though, I have cause to load up the BB train again. Death Stranding Director's Cut arrives on Steam and the Epic Games Store today, bringing with it new story missions, new delivery buddies, new weapons and... a Mario Kart-style race track? Yep, that sounds like a classic Kojima upgrade pack, if you ask me. Not quite as revolutionary as Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence, mind, but it's roughly in the same kind of ballpark. 
It's been great fun revisiting the lush mountains of Death Stranding's definitely not Icelandic version of post-apocalyptic America. If anything, the weirdest thing is seeing that same world I know and love on a fresh server, bereft of all the distracting neon signs, yelps of "Keep on keeping on!" and one-upmanship bridge-building that made up the bulk of the original's asymmetric online multiplayer component. It's actually quite refreshing to see these virgin, unspoiled landscapes again, although I imagine this won't last long once returning players flock back to their well-worn delivery routes. As for the new new stuff, is it worth making a return trip? As with all expando games, the answer will very much depend on if and how much you played the first one.
