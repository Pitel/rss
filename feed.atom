        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard revealed the next limited-time event coming to Diablo 4 as Lunar Awakening. A mysterious phenomenon is taking over the shrines throughout Sanctuary, empowering them. By activating these shrines players will earn 50% bonus XP, have their movement speed increased by 30%, and will earn Ancestor's Favor reputation. The event goes live on February 6 at 1 p.m. EST and will run for two weeks until February 20 at 1 p.m. EST. Unlike some events that have been exclusive to seasonal servers, this event will be active on the Eternal Realms as well.




Moon, wake up!


With the Lunar Awakening event, players can visit a new hub in the northern section of Ked Bardu. There players will find a new NPC, Ying- Yue, and the Lunar Night Market. As players find and activate Lunar Shrines throughout Sanctuary—including in dungeons—they will gain the experience and movement speed buff while also earning Ancestor's Favor reputation for slaying enemies while under the effects of the Lunar Shrines.


With the new reputation, players will ascend through ten reputation levels and obtain event-exclusive Lunar-themed rewards. There are six unique rewards in total, and look to be all different types of cosmetics including a Mount, Mount Armor, weapon skins, armor, and more.


Also part of the event, Nightmare Dungeon Sigils can have the Ancestor's Favor affix during the event. This affix guarantees that only Lunar Shrines will spawn in the dungeon, and also gives 10% bonus Glyph XP for completing the dungeon.


The event sounds rather simplistic in nature, which sort of seems to be the trend so far with Diablo 4 Season 3. Of course, I'm always up for bonus XP and the ability to earn some cool free cosmetics.


The Diablo 4 Lunar Awakening Event goes live on February 6 across all platforms.

So, I have bad news. The Duke Nukem table appears to have been removed. I’ll get to that. However, in its place, there is the spin-off table (Devil’s Island) and two brand new tables based on Missile Command and Centipede. Not a bad deal.


Balls of Steel was developed by Wildfire Studios (with help from Apogee/3D Realms/The Pinball Wizard) and published by GT Interactive in 1997. If we track the lineage, GT Interactive was acquired by Infogrames in 1999, which later became the modern-day Atari. That would be why it’s Atari releasing a remaster of it. That is, assuming everyone has the rights ownership figured out.

In case something sounds off about this announcement to you, it's because these features were already built into the console versions of these games. Why it took nearly a year to make it to PC is pretty mystifying.

The fonts, in particular, were hated by many who picked up the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster games back when they were released on PC in 2021. And it makes sense. Pixel art is a stylistic choice, but if you pile something that is not in line with the style on top of it, it’s not going to look right. Sometimes, that’s w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie briefly teased some upcoming Destiny 2 armor inspired by the legendary sci-fi RPG Mass Effect. According to the tweet, players can join the Normandy Crew with armor inspired by Commander Shepard, Garrus Vakarian, Liara T'Soni, and others from the Systems Alliance. The armor is set to drop in Destiny 2 on February 13.




Definitely a Win


Let's be honest, Destiny 2 fans haven't had much to be happy about lately. Not that an armor cosmetic alone is suddenly going to flip the frustrations the dedicated fanbase currently has with the game. But regardless of the impact, a Mass Effect crossover is a win in my book. I haven't played Destiny 2 in years but you bet I wanna grab that sweet Garrus armor in preparation for my return in Destiny 2: The Final Shape.


Bungie also revealed that in celebration of the collaboration with Bioware, an Enhanced Defense Ghost Shell, Alliance Scout Frigate Ship, and Alliance Drop Ship Sparrow will all be available for free as well. It seems like these are all just cosmetic skins for the various items in Destiny 2. I hope the ship and sparrow are cool.


The Mass Effect-inspired armor pack, called the Alliance Requisition Bundle, is set to arrivate on all platforms on February 13.

Weapons and playable characters alike undergo acute surges and declines based on several factors, with the most prevalent being player behavior. Years ago, Pathfinder reigned supreme across casual and competitive matches; his grapple hook-centric mobility and inconsistent hitbox made him an unrivaled duelist until his ability cooldowns and physique were tweaked. Similarly, the Prowler SMG once rivaled its light ammo counterparts before the Selectfire Receiver – a legendary hop-up that converted the weapon's burstfire to automatic – was removed from the loot pool. These changes, in addition to many others, morphed the meta in significant ways, but one particular update trumped the rest: Revenant's rework.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fantasy 4X Strategy title Age of Wonders 4 is set to get its next content pack, Primary Fury. Triumph Studios and Paradox Interactive revealed today that Age of Wonders 4: Primary Fury will get the primal beast-themed pack on February 27 across all platforms. The content pack adds a handful of new features and content to the popular 4X title with a focus on a new Primal Culture system.




Channel your Primal Culture


The new Primal Culture system allows players to channel an animal spirit that influences and shapes their empire both physically and spiritually. The Tome of Fey Mists and the Tome of Stormborne are two new Tomes of Magic added to the content pack, and include spells to conceal troops in shrouded magical fog and gain advantages over seas and shorelines.


In total, there are seven primal animals that the people of your empire can worship. New quests allow you to follow specific primal anima to earn unique rewards. Your people can even take on new physical forms in tune with the animals, including Lupine and Goatkin.


Also releasing alongside the Primal Fury content pack is the free Wolf Update. While Primal Fury is a paid content pack, the free Wolf Update will add new features and improvements for all players. In the Wolf Update, Necromancy has received a rework, new randomly generated items have been added, and War Bounties allow you to better direct your allies in conflicts.


Age of Wonders 4: Primal Fury releases on February 27 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S for $9.99. Players who purchased the Premium Edition or Expansion Pass will get access to the Primal Fury content pack at no additional cost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitwise Reprise has announced that their 2023 NES title, Jane Austen’s 8-bit Adventure is available now for purchase on a physical NES cartridge.


Not really the subject matter I expect on an NES game, but it would look great next to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Jane Austen’s 8-bit Adventure is a platformer that stars the 19th-century novelist and author of Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen. According to the summary, she finds herself in an 8-bit video game and must “Restore Miss Austen's books to the 8-bit library!”




While the art doesn’t look great in the trailer, the game itself shows shades of Castlevania. Jane Austen battles stuffy British-types using a quill and battles characters from her novels.


If you’re not convinced, Jane Austen’s 8-bit Adventure is already available on PC and is, understandably, quite a bit cheaper than shelling out for the cartridge.


I’ve said this before, but homebrew has come a long way in the past few years. I found a lot of physical releases a decade ago to be of rather questionable quality, but that’s largely because they were just hobbyist projects, and learning to program for a 6502 processor is more of a dedicated enthusiast’s undertaking. Even if you did manage to create something worth publishing, it wasn’t easy finding someone willing to produce NES cartridges. NESmaker has made developing for the ancient platform a lot more accessible, but from the looks of things, Jane Austen’s 8-bit Adventure was created the old-fashioned way.


Jane Austen’s 8-bit Adventure is available for PC and NES.

In a post on X, Bungie announced that Mass Effect cosmetics would be coming to their online shooter on February 13, just two weeks from now.

As mentioned in the X post above, the Alliance Requisition Bundle includes armor sets based on Garrus, Liara, and the protagonist, Commander Shepard. In addition to the bundle, which players will presumably have to purchase, three items will be available for free – the Enhanced Defense Ghost Shell, Alliance Scout Frigate Ship, and Alliance Drop Ship Sparrow.
Destiny 2 is currently gearing up for its next expansion, The Final Shape, which is set to launch later this year on June 4. It's supposed to usher in the conclusion of Destiny's story so far, so now's a good time to get caught up if you aren't already. Here's what we thought of their most recent expansions, The Witch Queen and Lightfall.  If you start in two weeks, you can do it while roleplaying as Garrus!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently the Xbox page for Visions of Mana made news, as it cited the upcoming Square Enix RPG would be included as part of Xbox Game Pass at launch. Today we learned it was just a big mistake.


Game Pass owners thought they had a gem inbound for the subscription platform. X users, like Idle Sloth below, celebrated the Xbox reveal of the big Day One get.




Eurogamer reached out to Microsft to get clarification on the listing. A Microsoft spokesperson responded to the outlet to confirm that the mention of Game Pass was indeed a mistake. 


"We're aware that Xbox.com included language that indicated Visions of Mana was coming to Xbox Game Pass and can confirm this was an error," the spokesperson told Eurogamer. Microsoft concluded its statement by confirming: "We do not have plans to bring Visions of Mana to Game Pass at this time."


When Microsoft rolled out its Xbox Developer's Direct on January 23, Visions of Mana was a surprise inclusion within the showcase. The game looked great, and Series X|S owners were rightfully excited to finally get some love from Square Enix on their platform. 


With the promotional partnership between Xbox and Square Enix during the Developer's Direct, fans who spotted the Game Pass mention on the Vision of Mana page would have little reason to doubt the game's inclusion. Now, it looks like Xbox Series X|S owners will have to purchase the awesome-looking action-RPG when it releases alongside PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC versions later this summer.

        <updated>2024-01-30T17:17:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lucid Dreams Studio has announced that their “dark metroidvania,” Biomorph is slated to release on March 4. Alongside the announcement is a new animated trailer that, out of context, tells very little.


That’s okay, because more informative trailers have already been released. I opened one in Steam, and after watching a bit of it, I switched back to writing this, and the video kept playing in the background. I can tell there are a lot of gooey effects in there because, past the halfway point of the trailer, it begins to sound like someone is eating a can of tuna using only their tongue set to epic music.




Pointless musing aside, Biomorph looks like a pretty slick game in the gated exploration style. The big draw is that the gooey protagonist can take the form of some of the enemies in the game, which strikes me as a good substitute for keys and a great mechanic to base puzzle-solving on.


But beyond the usual hop-and-collect gameplay, you also get to customize a village. You’re tasked with rebuilding the town of Brightmoor and befriending its inhabitants. By the looks of things, you can pick from a variety of styles for the buildings. Looks light, unobtrusive, and satisfying.


“Metroidvania” isn’t my favorite genre, but it’s one that I’m no stranger to. Of the many that seem to be circling toward release, Biomorph looks like the most appealing to me. Something about the visuals exudes a love for the world the developers are building, dark as it is.


Biomorph will be released on March 4 for PC. An extended demo will be available for Steam Next Fest.

You might even—gasp!—do crimes. This also drew my attention to a ten-minute gameplay video they released last month and oh, yes, please.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We know that MSI is attempting to take on the likes of the Steam Deck with its own device called The Claw. There were also leaks suggesting how much the handheld would cost, and now prices have been confirmed by the tech company.


As noted by Videocardz, MSI has listed three variants of its upcoming mobile gaming PC on its website. As you can see, they're not exactly the cheapest. You'll be having to fork over $699.99 for the lower end model, while the two more expensive ones will cost $749.99 and $799.99, respectively.




If you opt for the first, you'll get a Claw device that's powered by the Intel Core Ultra-5 processor. The midrange model will have the Ultra-7, as will the priciest one, but that will have 1TB of storage instead of 512GB.


A potential USP


Also, MSI's device will be utilizing the Intel Arc graphics chip technology, something which the Steam Deck, ASUS ROG Ally, and Lenovo Legion Go don't have (these all use AMD). Whether this will be a unique selling point for The Claw is anyone's guess at this stage.


As far as specs go, it's going to give the Deck a run for its money, offering up slightly more advanced hardware, including a better screen and supposed stronger battery life. However, with that extra juice comes the price tag to match.


The other thing to say about The Claw is it uses Windows 11. That's not inherently a bad thing, but the good thing about the Deck is that it's gaming ready, linking users up to their Steam account from the first boot-up. That could be a win in Valve's favor, but MSI and other competitors could also get the edge by offering more powerful handhelds.

        <updated>2024-01-30T17:03:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Certainly, there are instances where the Destiny 2 community struggles to agree on certain things, but things just fall into place sometimes. Take, for example, Bungie's latest The Witcher-themed mini-event, which has been completed in quite a short amount of time, actually.


As part of its previous This Week in Destiny blog post, Bungie announced that it'd hold a special community event that officially kicked off at 12 AM PST, on January 25. From that point onwards, players would need to kill 7,777,777 enemies before a unique (and free) Witcher-themed goodie unlocked: the Adventurous Spirit emblem. A mere emblem might not be quite as exciting of a tidbit as the big Destiny and Witcher crossover was, at the start of the Season, but it's a neat bonus all the same, and Guardians can now claim the emblem.


That's right - the Destiny 2 community has successfully sliced through almost 8 million foes in just over five days' worth of time. Whether that's impressive or disturbing to imagine, we'll leave it to you to decide.




Claim Destiny 2: Adventurous Spirit today, whether you participated or not


All cheekiness aside, Destiny 2's Adventurous Spirit is a neat little emblem, and you can unlock it for use in-game whether you participated in the event or not. To do so, you can either use Bungie's own embedded link, or go to Destiny 2's official website and open up the Emblem Redeem widget that way. The activation code is 9FY-KDD-PRT.




And hey, if you - like yours truly - never did end up contributing anything to the event, you can still grab the emblem regardless. From the looks of it, plenty of us haven't really gotten around to participating, so it's a good thing that nobody's left out of the equation this time around. Heck, a snazzy new emblem might be just the thing that draws you in to complete a few of Riven's Wishes over the next couple of weeks.

Later in our Call Of Duty sessions we'd hit matchmaking with reverse psychological techniques, saying stuff like "I bet we WON'T find a match", to in fact, find a match. Well, thanks to an official COD blog post, my heady beliefs have been hit with the equivalent of a precision air strike. Matchmaking cannot be gamed. It is all-seeing and all, sadly, science.

Type-Moon and Aniplex have announced Fate/stay night REMASTERED, a remaster of the very first Fate game, and it's coming to Switch in 2024 (via Gematsu). This will be the first time ever that Fate/stay night has been officially localised in English released in the West.
Fate/stay night is a visual novel that first launched on PC on 30th January 2004 — which means today is the franchise's 20th anniversary, making this a fitting announcement. The remaster will apparently be based on the 2012 PS Vita version of the game, Fate/stay night Realta Nua, which in turn was ported from an earlier PS2 version.

CGI trailers that refrain from showing any actual gameplay have often been a source of discourse in the video game community. On the one hand, they can be pretty effective in building hype - particularly if it's for a highly anticipated release - but on the other, they often fail at demonstrating what the game will actually entail regarding its gameplay.
In his latest YouTube video, legendary creator Masahiro Sakurai takes a stand against trailers that don't show any actual gameplay, stating "In some cases, trailers like the ones seen on a game's Steam page won't show any gameplay footage at all - please don't do that!".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Makes the dream work.
You can tell as soon as its snazzy intro cutscene kicks in that Mario vs. Donkey Kong, a remake of 2004's Game Boy Advance puzzle-platform classic, doesn't intend to reinvent any wheels whatsoever. It fully and faithfully recreates the 20-year-old original's opening movie (albeit with a nice lick of paint) and then moves swiftly on to serve up modernised versions of all the levels you'll have played if you've been through this one before — every one of them almost identical to how you'll remember.
Yep, we've been spending plenty of time getting acquainted with Mario's latest (re)adventure over the past week or so and, four worlds in, it's pretty much as expected for the plump plumber thus far. This is an exacting retread in how it serves up levels that stick to the layouts, enemy positioning, and traversal options of its source material. Nothing much has changed here in terms of the core mechanics, puzzles, and so on that make up the bulk of the game, which is a good thing when your source material is so delightfully addictive.

Even though Mario is now known as the most iconic face in gaming, in his first appearance, 1981's Donkey Kong, he couldn't even get his name in the title. That was corrected in 2004 with the release of Mario vs. Donkey Kong, a side-scrolling puzzle game designed to carry on the legacy of the classic arcade cabinet. Twenty years later, that outing has been reimagined for the Nintendo Switch, and Mario's rivalry with Donkey Kong – as well as the gameplay – holds up surprisingly well.
After the local toy store runs out of Mario toys, Donkey Kong goes on a rampage at the toy factory, leaving with a sack full of toys and Mario in hot pursuit. As Mario, you'll go through a series of levels w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It seems we're spoiled for choice at the moment when it comes to Early Access survival games inspired by other franchises. Palworld has been making more money than God, but Keen Games' recently released Enshrouded has been doing pretty well, too.


A recent Twitter/X post from the developer is proud to announce that its title has "reached over one million players." This is after just four days. While that may pale in comparison to Palworld's six million sold in a similar timeframe, it's still a massive accomplishment.




In fact, Enshrouded is currently at the number three spot on Steam's Top Sellers list, just behind "Pokémon-with guns" – with Steam Deck still at number one, because of course it is. Whether either of these can be toppled by the newcomer remains to be seen at this stage.


What is Enshrouded?


If you haven't played it yet, Enshrouded is a survival and crafting game that's taking cues from the likes of Valheim. It's "set within a sprawling voxel-based continent" and tasks you with a journey "across the mountains and deserts of an open world."


It's currently only out on Steam at the moment, but Keen Games is "keen" (ha!) to release it on the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, hopefully later this year.


It definitely feels like this genre is getting quite full at the moment. There's just something about games that encapsulate survival released in alpha or beta states that's appealing to a lot of people. Last year it was Sons of the Forest, and now we've got Palworld and Enshrouded. 


However, given that the latter has a current player peak of 160,405, according to SteamDB, it's probably not likely to take on the might of the former.

Not only had we cleared out the 42nd floor of the cursed extra-dimensional horror house that was our school’s midnight alter-ego, I’d also just aced my midterms. I spent the afternoon helping my french foreign exchange friend sew a kimono for his estranged uncle, then killed some time before bed by consoling the small child I’d been hanging out with lately about her parent’s divorce.


So goes an average day in one of the very, very many days stuffed into Persona 3 Reload’s year long taste of demon-slaying high school life. A charming fantasy? Perhaps! There's plenty here for fans who don’t mind an old-school approach to grinding while exploring heartfelt, albeit cheesy, friendships. Those who don't get on with anime tropes, though, might find it exhaustingly written and repetitive.

Persona 3 is perhaps the most important entry in the Shin Megami Tensei spin-off franchise. By establishing several series mainstays, including the popular Social Links system, Persona 3 laid the foundation upon which the next two mainline entries would be built. Unfortunately, by today’s standards, that 18-year-old title is unapproachable in many ways. Persona 3 Reload remedies that, bringing forward the outstanding cast, story, and turn-based battles in a faithful remake with the modern amenities of Persona 5 Roya…]]></summary>

The rumour originated via Nick Baker, co-founder of Xbox Era, who posted a cryptic tease that may be hinting toward specific reveals during PlayStation's State of Play. Several games can be identified from the post, including Rise of the Ronin (which Sony has already confirmed will be featured), Death Stranding 2, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Silent Hill 2, and Judas. It's also possible that a new entry in the Metro franchise might be on its way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Celeste celebrated its sixth anniversary this month, and developers Extremely OK Games have marked the occasion by releasing a free Nintendo 64 homage to their excellent platforming game over on Itch. Made in just "a week(ish)", Celeste 64: Fragments Of The Mountain channels the spirits of Super Mario 64 and Banjo Kazooie as it tasks players with collecting dozens of strawberrys hidden around its snowy 3D landscape. It's well worth checking out if you've got a spare minute or so, though given how rock hard it is you may want to put aside a good hour or so if you want to truly master its controls and uncover every last secret.

It’s largely just a GUI that makes it easier to visualize your game’s content while also allowing you to plug in various code snippets that handle the functions in a game. It makes things almost too easy, which means one day, I can maybe get down to creating my spiritual successor to Hoshi wo Miru Hito.


Greater access to the platform also means that we’ll be seeing more games on the hardware, which brings us to The Adventures of Panzer: Legacy Collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frontier Developments has announced on Twitter that Planet Zoo is coming to consoles. What consoles? I don’t know. When? I don’t know that, either.


It’s happening, though! Frontier Developments dropped a teaser that shows a controller sitting on a breakroom coffee table (I think) while something unrelated goes on in the background. That’s it. You now know everything that I know.




That is unless you haven’t played Planet Zoo. Initially released in 2019 as a companion (spin-off?) of 2016’s Planet Coaster, it’s a management sim about building and running your own zoo. The Planet games are all about filling the gap left by games like Roller Coaster Tycoon and Zoo Tycoon. However, I feel they have their own distinct flavor.


What I mean by that is that Planet Zoo feels like it’s more about customization and building your dream zoo than it is about challenging you to keep it profitable and successful. Don’t get me wrong, there’s still some of that. You do need to keep your zoo profitable and successful, but it just feels so easy. Or maybe it’s just easy for me because I grew up on a hearty diet of tycoon games. I can’t tell anymore.


However, to me, it felt more like it gave you a tonne of tools and assets to allow you to customize your habitats at a very granular level. This would have really appealed to young Zoey, but old Zoey doesn’t have the same free time or attention span. I do have to wonder how the UI and all those tools will translate to a controller, but we’ll have to wait and see.


For now, you can grab Planet Zoo on PC. Having spent a few paragraphs talking about it, I think I'm going to reinstall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HoYoverse has released another round of its usual character teases for Genshin Impact, and if previous patterns hold up, it's a peak into Version 4.5. However, there's only one new character showcased this time, and it’s someone you might already be familiar with: Chiori of Chioriya Boutique.


Chiori’s element, weapon, and Constellation


Chiori’s drip marketing clearly shows her elemental Vision and weapons, locking her in as a Geo Sword user from Inazuma. Her art features a pair of wakizashi or small katana, showcasing a unique dual-wielding style. This isn’t entirely without precedent, since Alhaitham’s animations feature an additional sword on top of the one he normally equips. The remainder of Chiori's kit is yet to be revealed.


We've encountered Chiori before as an NPC during 4.3's Roses and Muskets event. She served as the costume designer for The Two Musketeers during the Fontinalia Film Festival. Now, Chiori is formally introduced as "The Thundering Seamstress" and Boss of Chioriya Boutique. We already knew that she was the boss of this small clothing store in the Court of Fontaine, and we got a taste of her direct, no-nonsense attitude during the event quests. It appears we'll soon witness her in combat as well.

Chiori’s Constellation is Cisoria, Latin for “scissors.” It's quite fitting for her as a fashion designer and seamstress. It might also serve as a subtle reference to her sharp wit and incisive personality.


When is Chiori coming to Genshin Impact?


Since Chiori’s introduction happened on the eve of Version 4.4, we can expect to see her sometime in Version 4.5 of Genshin Impact. If the six-week update schedule holds, Version 4.5 should start on March 13.

Hyperkin is no stranger to unusual collaborations with its products. Known for creating a range of video game controllers, many of which we're rather fond of for pairing up with our Switch, the peripheral-based store has revealed not one, but three of the most bizarre collabs yet.
Shown off on Twitter, three brand-new Bluetooth Pixel Art controllers and cases, all of which are perfect for the Switch, showcase the brand teaming up with cold-cut meat company Oscar Mayer, drinks manufacturer Kool-Aid, and condiment company Huy Fong. That's right — you can get a controller that looks like a hot dog if you really want.

If the final game truly fills out that screen, then we'd be looking at a fighter count that could exceed even Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, with 24 different varieties of Goku and Vegeta so far.

Despite the 164-character roster looking huge, you have to consider the multiple forms that Goku and Vegeta can take. These are all the forms that the two Saiyans transform into:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the 1,900 job cuts that Microsoft made last week, perhaps the most surprising was the coinciding departure of Blizzard president Mike Ybarra. It has been announced that Ybarra’s position will be taken over by Johanna Faries, an executive who helped oversee recent Call of Duty titles at Activision.


Ybarra stepped into the role of company president in 2021 with the departure of then-president J. Allen Brack, following reports of sexual misconduct, harassment, and discrimination within Blizzard. Ybarra initially shared the role with Jen Oneal but became the sole president when Oneal left the company shortly after.


Prior to starting work at Activision Blizzard in 2018, Faries was an NFL executive. Her work with Call of Duty was largely in regards to its esports league.


There was some concern by fans that Microsoft would install their own leadership to the company following Ybarra’s departure. While this isn’t the case, as Faries was already working at Activision Blizzard, I’m not sure it’s going to be of much comfort. Or maybe it will be if you’re someone who enjoys the esports side of Blizzard’s games. I don’t really have much of a horse in this race.


Faries introduced herself to Blizzard employees in an email where she identifies herself as a Diablo IV fan. She states that she’s aware that Call of Duties priorities differ from the way Blizzard does things and says she walks “into this role with sensitivity to those dynamics, and deep respect for Blizzard, as we begin to explore taking our universes to even higher heights.”

        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/embracer-group-reportedly-cancels-deus-ex-game-lays-off-workers-at-eidos-montreal/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=embracer-group-reportedly-cancels-deus-ex-game-lays-off-workers-at-eidos-montreal"/>
        <updated>2024-01-29T18:39:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to reporting by Bloomberg, Embracer Group is laying off 97 of the staff at Eidos Montreal and has canceled an unannounced title in the Deus Ex series. This is part of an ongoing series of job losses as Embracer contracts after a period of rapid expansion.


The Embracer Group acquired Eidos Montreal as part of a deal with Square Enix in 2022, which saw the latter company divest from its North American studios. This deal also included Square Enix Montreal and Crystal Dynamics, as well as a selection of properties related to those studios, including games like Thief, Tomb Raider, and Deus Ex.


Many have been anticipating a new game in the celebrated Deus Ex series since the release of Deus Ex: Mankind Divided back in 2016. Following the lukewarm reception to that game, Square Enix put the series on ice. The Embracer purchase brought some hope to having the series revived once again, but with this cancellation, it seems unlikely.


According to Bloomberg’s sources, Eidos Montreal had been working on the new entry of Deus Ex for two years, and it was “slated to enter production later this year.” The company will now “instead focus on an original franchise.”


A release by Eidos Montreal confirms the layoffs and clarifies that 97 positions were eliminated, it’s a continuation of job losses related to Embracer Group. The losses have included the closure of Timesplitters developer Free Radical and Saints Row’s Volition. 


It can be difficult to keep up with the volume of cuts made by Embracer, as it seems that a new round happens on a near-weekly basis. Embracer group is hardly the only company cutting staff, however, as massive job losses have been happening across the industry, with Microsoft laying off 1,900 staff members just a few days ago.


We’re not even out of January yet, and the industry has seen nearly 6000 people lose their jobs. It’s shaping up to be another rough year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you want to find out more about what's coming to the platform, there's nothing better than PlayStation's State of Play. Sony's next State of Play showcase is airing this week.


The first State of Play for 2024 comes Wednesday, January 31 at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET, which happens to be the last day of the month. We only have a small idea of what's going to be in the 40-minute show, save for a few titles, but that's part of the experience. In the announcement, it is stated that we'll see over 15 games during the event.




Games announced include Rise of the Ronin and Stellar Blade, which will receive extended looks. I'm particularly interested in Rise of the Ronin and how it will differentiate itself from aesthetically similar games that have flooded the market.


This year's showcase arrives a bit earlier than last year's first State of Play, but other companies have already been off to the races with their lineups for 2024. Xbox recently hosted its 2024 Developer Direct, locking in some release windows for games like Avowed, Hellbade 2, and Indiana Jones.


Nintendo, which usually has a February stream of some kind, still has yet to lock in a Direct. Most of the noise around it has been rumors and reports on a potential Switch successor. Whether or not we see a new Switch in 2024 has yet to be confirmed. But with Sony stepping up to the plate, we might start to get an idea of what their year ahead looks like.


You can watch the event on Twitter, YouTube, and Twitch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion in the Scarlet & Violet series is Paldean Fates, which brings new Shinies into the mix, plus various type-shifted Tera Pokémon and new special-illustration cards. Unfortunately, you can't buy these booster packs individually; instead, you must purchase special collections like the Elite Trainer Box or the Tech Sticker Collection. 
Despite this unconventional release method, Paldean Fates adds an absolutely massive number of cards to the Pokémon Trading Card Game. Those trying to collect them all have more than 240 cards to look for, including more than 135 etched-foil cards and several Trainer cards.
The Pokémon Company sent along a few of the collections and products that contain Paldean Fates booster packs so we could crack them open to see what we could pull. While I'm usually most excited about the Pokémon themselves, one of my favorite pulls this time was a Trainer card: the Nemona full-art Ultra Rare. But that's not to say I didn't pull my fair share of great cards starring some of my favorite Pokémon. I'm always a sucker for a cool Charizard card, and I love the Shiny Toedscruel ex that I found in one of the packs.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Paldean Fates is available now. For more Pokémon TCG content, including galleries of past expansions, interviews, and the latest news, head to our hub by clicking the banner below.]]></summary>

Originally released as a PlayStation 4 exclusive back in 2016, this will mark the first time the sandbox builder will be on PC. The PC version will include the Terra Incognita DLC as well as upgraded crafting features. Those who have purchased Dragon Quest Builders 2 on Steam will also get a discounted price.

Re-Rebuild the world of Alefgard


Even though the sequel has been available on PC since release, the original coming to PC is a good thing for fans of sandbox builders. The sequel certainly had its own charm, but the original was quite special. Destructoid's own Chris Carter gave the original a 9/10 when it was released back in 2016, assuring fans "You can breathe easy knowing that Builders is more Dragon Quest than Minecraft".


In Dragon Quest Builders, players must gather materials and craft unique items and buildings while rebuilding the ruined realm of Alefgard, as they recruit more characters and craft what they need. It's a fun merge of the RPG and sandbox builder genre, and if it sounds like a good time you can rest assured that it is.


The Terra Incognita DLC that is included in the PC version adds a Boss Monster Model Set, an Astronomy Set, a Pixel Ring, and a Magic Carpet. Those interested in playing both the original and the sequel will have the option fo purchasing a bundle of the two.


Dragon Quest Builders will be released on PC via Steam on February 13. It is already available on Android, iOS, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch.

Luckily for PlayStation fans, Sony is pulling the curtain back on some games coming soon to its platforms this Wednesday, January 31, at 2 P.M. Pacific/5 P.M. Eastern. Check out the X announcement below.
Get ready for a new State of Play! https://t.co/KDyuY2Uvfq

Tune in on YouTube, Twitch, or TikTok this Wednesday at 2pm PT / 10pm GMT for 40 minutes covering 15+ games, including extended looks at Stellar Blade and Rise of the Ronin, plus more from talented game developers from… pic.twitter.com/MQg76iv8Tt
January 29, 2024
The showcase will specifically show off extended looks at Stellar Blade and Rise of the Rōnin. The former title, previously known as Project Eve, is a stylish action-adventure game that's been teased since 2019. The last we heard, it was delayed into this year, so we're due for a proper look. The latter game is the next project from Team Ninja, the developers behind the Nioh series. It's the studio's most ambitious project to date – check out our December preview here.
As for the other 13+ games, we don't have much of an idea. We know it won't include Naughty Dog's recently canceled Last of Us multiplayer spin-off, and we've gone a while without big reveals for a lot of Sony's first-party studios, so hopefully, it can shed some light on the rest of the company's 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dust off your Atari 7800, because Plaion and Atari have announced that three of the console’s titles are getting a new cartridge run on May 24, 2024.


The games in question are 1990’s Fatal Run, 1986’s Food Fight, and 1990’s Ninja Golf. All of these are favorites on the platform, but Fatal Run and Ninja Golf were both featured as part of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. Food Fight, on the other hand, was only present in its arcade and Atari 800 formats.


If you don’t have an Atari 7800, there’s good news. The Atari 2600+ supports 7800 cartridges, though I had some issues trying to find a controller that was recognized by the hardware. Good news again on that front! Atari is also reissuing the CX78 gamepad. Also, Plaion is working on updating the console’s firmware, so hopefully, better controller compatibility will be added.


After the failure of the Atari 5200, the 1983 crash, the launch of the NES, and the sale of the company to Jack Tramiel, the Atari 7800 wasn’t really able to find its footing in the market. To make matters worse, the slow release of software left gamers unenthused. It didn’t quite find the audience that the NES or even the Sega Master System did, but some who played it are still affectionate toward the console.


If you’re like me and were too young to really get in on the platform while it was on the market, these reissues might be an exciting piece of history. 


The three Atari 7800 reproductions come with a box and cartridge, but that seems to be it. I’m not sure why Atari and Plaion don’t include instruction manuals with their re-releases, but that seems to be continuing with these. They’ll run you $29.99 and release May 24, 2024. They’re available for preorder in some places now.

If you have plans to attend NieR:Orchestra Concert 12024 , be aware that Zion discusses some of the fun and surprises of the event. For those who aren't able to go, though, we thought you'd like to know how it turned out after he was lucky enough to be in LA on Saturday for opening night...

I’ve attended more than my fair share of gaming-themed symphonies and shows over the years: The Legend of Zelda: Symphony of the Goddess, Distant Worlds: Final Fantasy and even Anamanaguchi shredding it up to the Scott Pilgrim: The Game soundtrack made some incredible memories. Although nothing prepared me for the way the NieR:Orchestra Concert 12024  would pay tribute to the series while creating something new and intimate for the audience. This concert, which is touring the world from now until March 2024, truly was a spectacular event for fans in the know, and a delightful celebration of NieR as a whole.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I bought Baldur's Gate 3 shortly after its release as a need than a want, when I was a year-and-half into my gender transition and hormone replacement therapy. Gender transition is not just an arduous journey of self-discovery, but also a profound and constant engagement with one’s own reality. I was desperate for some escapism, and Larian Studios’ much-anticipated new entry into the Baldur’s Gate fantasy RPG franchise offered the perfect rabbit hole to fall down.
As a child, my gaming habits were relatively stereotypical for a closeted girl: select female characters wherever possible, especially in RPGs. But the immersion almost always wears off. The trans inclusion in games like Dungeon Siege, Sacred 2: Fallen Angel, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and others is effectively non-existent, and the result for transgender and transsexual players is a feeling that, even in fantasy worlds, we are invisible at best. Nocturne, a trans supporting character in Baldur's Gate III played by Abigail Thorn, has changed that experience for me. In an interview, Thorn shared some of her thoughts and experiences regarding Nocturne and trans representation in games.

The game launched on January 25th, 2024, and has previously garnered 'overwhelmingly positive' reception over on Steam. It looks vaguely similar to Narita Boy in both style and gameplay, which we loved, but with slightly more chaotic energy and colourful visuals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though Silent Hill is coming back in a big way, many still wonder what could have been with P.T., which Konami pulled the plug on. While we'll likely never see a Kojima/del Toro horror collaboration set in the titular foggy town, fans will never stop dreaming.


In a video uploaded to YouTube (as spotted by DSO Gaming), user Maxim Dorokhov has offered their own interpretation of Silent Hill 4: The Room. That is to say, they've recreated the 2004 game entirely in Unreal Engine 5.




A look around the apartment that's been rendered in more up-to-date software gives this 20-year-old release a bit of pep. It's gloomy, pretty realistic looking, and with its first-person perspective, really does make me think of P.T.


Another tease for something that will never be


According to the report, this is not something that's likely to be made available for public consumption. It seems to be more about showing what UE5 can do in terms of rendering, and Silent Hill 4 appeared to be a good fit for showing off all this detail and moody lighting.


It's also just the apartment sections as well, but that's okay. SH4 is generally regarded as the weakest entry in the classic Silent Hill franchise. However, those moments in the apartment I found to be pretty standout stuff, especially for the time.


First-person horror was not so common back in the early 2000s, so to get to experience some of it in this game was quite something. It's a shame I never actually got around to finishing SH4, but then I was a lot younger then. I probably had some important kid stuff to be thinking about, like hopes and dreams.

Alas, the prospect of such a project has had fresh water poured over it this weekend, with Kitase explaining that, given it's already taken them ten years to make Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (with a third entry to complete the trilogy yet to come), a Final Fantasy 6 remake would likely take twice as long as that to actually make. And you know what? I'm good, actually. The Final Fantasy 6 Pixel Remaster is good enough for me in this lifetime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With more than 1.7 million people playing at the time of writing, Palworld feels like it can do no wrong. Well, unless Nintendo/The Pokémon Company has anything to say about it. Before the call to investigate Pocketpair's game, the modding community has taken to safeguarding itself from potential litigation.


In a news update posted a few days ago, Nexus Mods has decided to put a stop to anyone uploading mods for Palworld that is considered to feature Pokémon copyrighted material. Any modifications that contain assets or characters clearly from the franchise will be taken down.




The post (written by Community Manager Demorphic) goes on to say that the team doesn't "think it's worth the risk to allow this content to be shared in our community." Fearing the wrath of Nintendo's legal department, Nexus Mods does not want to put itself in a position where it has to "deal with the headache of legal threats." However, the website does say that non-Pokémon content is more than encouraged.


It's all fun and games until someone gets sued


It's fair to say that nobody really expected Palworld to do so well in such a short span of time. Released just ten days ago, it feels like it's all anyone can talk about. The Twitter/X post above shows that a good selection of people are already getting a bit sick of hearing about it.


We don't know what the future holds for the game, but if Nintendo is getting involved, it could well lead to some serious legal troubles. This is why Nexus Mods has decided to take swift action. No one wants to receive a cease-and-desist letter. Not from Nintendo.


Hey, remember when people were obsessed with Lethal Company? Good times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As if there wasn't enough reason to be skeptical about Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, it appears controversial DRM Denuvo has been added to the PC version of the live service game just days before launch. The Steam Page for Suicide Squad was updated just yesterday to include the following warning message: Incorporates 3rd-party DRM: Denuvo Anti-Tamper.




Tough Nut to Crack


While historically Denuvo DRM has done a decent job of serving its purpose: preventing the game from being cracked and able to spread via piracy, it comes at a cost to those who legally purchase games with it included. In order for the DRM to properly work, every installation must include the Denuvo Anti-Tamper.


Unfortunately, Denuvo often leads to performance issues restricted to PC versions of games. Recently released Tekken 8 made sure not to include Denuvo after Tekken 7 launched on PC with horrid performance issues due to Denuvo.


Over on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's Steam Discussion Boards, players are already voicing their displeasure over the recent addition of Denuvo.


Nothing new for Warner Bros. Games


Honestly, I can't remember the last title published by Warner Bros. Games that didn't include Denuvo. Mortal Kombat launched with it, as did Hogwarts Legacy. By that metric alone, it's not necessarily unexpected that Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League will launch with Denuvo integrated. I think what's more disappointing is that it was seemingly added last minute, with no indication of its inclusion until just a couple of days before launch.


Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League launches on February 2 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Players who buy the $100 edition can get Early Access today, though servers may be down unexpectedly.

Cast your minds back to June 2023, you might remember that internal staff at Square Enix were quite keen on the idea of a remake for Final Fantasy VI.
According to a recent interview with French Youtuber Julien Chièze, however, it seems that such a project would hypothetically require almost double the development time of Final Fantasy VII Remake/Rebirth (thanks, Shinra Archaeology Department and VGC).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is this, the Dark Ages?
There is a king’s ransom of strategy games on Switch, so it takes a lot for one to stand out from the crowd. Unfortunately, Rising Lords from developer Argonwood is memorable for all the wrong reasons. With hollow, tedious gameplay and a combat system that tries to combine too many elements, we were ready to leave Rising Lords in the Dark Ages almost as soon as we began playing.
Set years after the previous king was overthrown and replaced with a council, Rising Lords follows a young nobleman who unexpectedly finds himself thrust into the heart of a battle for land, eventually rising as a lord — see what we did there? — of note. The story campaign's plot plays out in a series of choose-your-own-adventure style encounters that help shape your youthful lord and his personality. It isn’t remarkable or groundbreaking but we found it enjoyable enough to keep us interested in the game beyond when the gameplay made us want to switch off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VR is at its best when it makes you feel like you're living in the actual future. Given how everything new and exciting ultimately becomes normal and mundane, this is perhaps an unfair expectation of technology that is now a decade old. Nonetheless, if you want me to sit with a shoebox pressed uncomfortably against my eyes for two hours like an ocular gom jabbar, then what's inside the shoebox better be pretty darned transformative.
Which is to say that LEGO Bricktales provided one of those moments. I was sat in my living room, with all its clutter visible through the Quest 3's coloured passthrough, and hovering above my table was a great big LEGO diorama of a jungle. All of it was rendered perfectly to scale, as if I could pick up the minifigs between my thumb and forefinger. Yet all of it was moving of its own accord, as if I'd somehow stumbled into a child's dream.

Non-Deluxe peons get to play it from Friday 2nd February. With just a handful of hours till the initial release we still don't have review code, which is generally a good sign that a publisher thinks the game in question is going to get a mild-to-severe kicking.

This entry in the series is from far from the first Prince of Persia game, but it represented a reboot of sorts and has become the game most identified with the franchise. It also is undeniably important to what would eventually become Assassin's Creed.
Join superfan Kyle Hilliard and Prince of Persia newcomer Wesley LeBlanc for a look at the 2003 classic. This isn't the first time we've revisited Ubisoft's classic platformer. You can watch our original Replay episode on Sands of Time from 2015 here.

Honestly, did no one remember that February's Next Fest starts in, you know, February, in a week a bit's time this year? I'm all for getting a few things early to make the deluge of demos a bit more manageable to cover, but this year has just been a teensy bit insane. Now there's too many things to look at in advance, but hey, I'm making steady progress, and you've probably seen the fruits of a couple of these this week already. Next on the list is Dystopika, a toy-like sandbox citybuilder that's sort of in the same vein as the lovely Summerhouse I played earlier this week, but also lives at the exact opposite end of the mood and vibes scale. Whereas Summerhouse is about creating diddly little cute streets with sunny Mediterranean vibes, Dystopika is effectively: Build Your Own Blade Runner.

You have to supervise them constantly, not relax and watch them grow organically while eating a sandwich and only occasionally intervening like a neglectful goddess.
Writer's Rush is sort of, sort of an idle game, I'd argue. It's a low pressure, low stakes, super light sim that takes the barest hint of the clicker and crosses it with sort of-sort of-sort of score attack, and somehow works without quite feeling like either. Because, I think, of its charmingly, intentionally daft representation of what being a novelist is like.

This report follows yesterday's news that Microsoft is laying off 1,900 employees across its Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax divisions. Alongside this news, Blizzard president Mike Ybarra also announced he was departing from the company, and we learned the aforementioned survival game had been canceled. 
However, Blizzard didn't really touch on why the game it had just announced exactly two years prior was canceled. Bloomberg's new report details development struggles around the game's engine, which was prototyped using Epic Games' Unreal Engine before "Blizzard executives decided to switch…]]></summary>

I was innocently carving myself a nice stone foundation last night when the Devil jogged my elbow and I dug a massive, raggedy trench straight through it. I've spent an hour now trying to fill in the trench and flatten it out, to no avail. There's always a jaggedy bit right in the middle, and I'm getting displaced trypophobia from the awareness that my efforts have seeded the terrain beneath with random cavities.
What's worse, there is no mention of enhancing the floor-levelling functionality in this Keen Games forum post on Enshrouded's various launch issues, which they are even now racing to fix. Instead, it's all talk of frame rates, multiplayer stability and dedicated servers not appearing. Somebody rush me a cement mixer, stat, or I'm moving back to Valheim.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth isn’t exactly spawned from the most hardware-bothering of game series. Most previous LADs, be they Kiryu’s Adventures in Punching or the more turn-based reboot have all been technically gentle affairs, and Infinite Wealth is ultimately another one. At the same time, it shares with Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name a newfound interest in PC-specific tricks. That means a full selection of DLSS, FSR and XeSS upscalers, plus DLSS 3 frame generation. Real yakuza might use a gamepad, but it seems real fuzz-haired RPG fantasists use graphics cards.

I'm excited, therefore, that Adventure mode is coming soon to the Steam version of the game, and excited even more so that it's aiming to make it even more accessible.

A new update on development which outlines exactly how the new premium version of Adventure mode differs from the original, including its plan for tutorials to guide new players.

Cut to several hours later and I've had to forcibly shut the game down and wrench myself away from it just to write this post, because listen, you need to go and play Balatro's demo right now, because hot damn this is the good stuff if you're into roguelike deckbuilders. I also say this as someone who's never played or understood a game of poker in her life, because let's face it, regular poker is quite boring. Balatro, on the other hand, is poker that's turbo-charged with magic Joker cards, tarot card multipliers, and blind conditions that make a successful hand increasingly tricky to pull off. And it's coming out in full real soon, too.

I wrote Game Informer's Skull and Bones cover story back in 2022, and have played the game several times since then in previews, betas, and more. 
Despite what various delays had me believing, Skull and Bones is actually shaping up to be, at the very least, a fun and competent experience. Because I've played so many of its disparate parts rather than the whole, I believe there's something really good in the game. However, without playing the full package, it's tough to say how it all comes together, a critical aspect for any live-se…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black Forest Games, the studio behind the recent Destroy All Humans! 1 and 2 remakes, has reportedly laid off about 50 people. This news comes from Kotaku, which learned from a source with knowledge of the situation that these layoffs were announced yesterday, January 24, and that more information about them would be provided next week. 
Game Informer has reached out to Black Forest Games and will update this story if it learns more. 


Kotaku writes that its source says creative directors and most, "if not all," of the managers at Black Forest Games will keep their jobs following the layoffs. At approximately 110 employees as of last year, 50 job cuts would equate to a roughly 50 percent reduction in staff at the studio.

Today, we learned about the most recent instance of this – Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition is coming to PC on March 21. The news comes via the PlayStation Blog, where they revealed that both the base game and its 2023 expansion, Burning Shores, will come to the new platform as a package deal.

That's tough. But thankfully I don't need to decide, as there's a demo of a game out right now that combines both interests. In Aeruta you play as an anime girl who defeats monsters and uses their innards to fuel her bakery business. Perfect.

That amounts to about 8% of the division.

Your titular tiny heroine can't jump very far on her own, you see, so to save her beloved sunflowers from the spiky thorns of an ominous-looking tree, she'll need to fire them around the environment to help hoist her over obstacles to get to the, err, root of the problem.

The roots of my enthusiasm go back to pinball machines - both the fancier, arcade variety that transmogrify into e.g. screaming robot skulls when you achieve a high-enough multiplier, and the crappy, play-at-home variety that are basically a canted wooden sheet with some numbers drawn on it. But it wasn't till I embraced the holy medium of videogames that I realised the full potential of balldom. 


Initiated, of course, by Sonic the Hedgehog, I descended into a frothing ballpit of ball variations, encompassing everything from the squashy rolling UFOs of Exo One through Katamari Damacy to the overcrowded chutes of Marble World and the spectacle of Overwatch's Hammond clearing out a capture point by means of sheer, delicious torque. I am always up for a game in which you either control or become a ball, and Go Mecha Ball looks like one of the better ones.

This news comes by way of Kotaku, which reports that its source with knowledge of the situation said the job cuts affected only staff working on an unannounced game at the studio, codenamed Project Gemini, that is to be published by Square Enix. 
Kotaku reached out to People Can Fly after its source sent screenshots confirming that layoffs happened at the studio, and development director Adam Alker confirmed the news. Alker cited budget limitations and a shrinking scope for Project Gemini as for why it was laying off "over 30 people." The publication notes that another 20 outside of the 30 laid off were removed from the project and moved to other projects at People Can Fly.

The closest we've come to a "Dinn-like" is probably 2022's outstanding The Case Of The Golden Idol, though as I said in my review, its fill-in-the-blanks murder tableaus felt just about distinct enough to be their own separate thing. 
Happily, the "Golden Idol-like" appears to be having a bit of a moment of its own right now, as Playstack, the publishers of Golden Idol, have just announced the delightful-looking Little Problems, a detective game that turns its word-shuffling problem-solving to the altogether more relatable conundrums of everyday life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this evening, The Pokémon Company issued a press release seemingly addressing the recent conversation surrounding the new Steam Early Access release Palworld and its suspiciously familiar-looking collectible creatures. 
“We have received many inquiries regarding another company’s game released in January 2024,” the company states. “We have not granted any permission for the use of Pokémon intellectual property or assets in that game. We intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pokémon.”
While The Pokémon Company doesn’t explicitly name Palworld or its developer, Pocketpair, in its statement, we presume it’s investigating the record-setting Steam title based on the specified release window and recent controversies surrounding the game’s alleged infringement of Pokémon IP. 
“We will continue to cherish and nurture each and every Pokémon and its world, and work to bring the world together through Pokémon in the future,” the company states in closing.

By the time I saw the credits on Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, I felt like I had been through the emotional ringer. I was mentally exhausted. I think that's by design. Infinite Wealth is developer Ryu Ga Gotoku's (RGG) most ambitious project by a long shot – an epic tale told across multiple characters and continents, featuring the conclusion of some nearly 20-year-old plot threads that leave at least one character, quite literally and relatably, asleep in the streets. Some of this is the best work th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nier Reincarnation, the story-driven mobile RPG set in the popular Nier universe, will have its services ended this April. While the game will continue to receive support until then, its final story campaign will serve as its last big hurrah. 
Reincarnation first launched on July 28, 2021 for iOS and Android and takes place within an unspecified point in the Nier timeline. Like the previous titles, Reincarnation is an RPG set within a mysterious prison world called The Cage, with players controlling different protagonists divided across multiple story arcs. The game has also hosted several crossover events with games such as the remake of Nier Replicant, Final Fantasy XIV, and Persona 5.
The shutdown news came the same day as the launch of the latest chapter of its final story arc, The People And The World, dubbed Act II: The Return. Check out the trailer below.


In a shutdown notice, Square Enix states, 
Until service concludes, Square Enix will offer 10 free summons per day, weekly gem gifts, and other perks. Sales of items on the Premium Shop have ceased. You can read the full rollout of final updates and events in Square Enix's blog post. 
Former editor Jason Guisao was impressed with Nier Reincarnation, hailing it in an opinion piece as one of the strongest mobile titles available, writing that "Lengthy narratives and skill-based gameplay loops have come in console/PC-ports like Genshin Impact and PUBG Mobile. Nier Reincarnation, however, employs a happy medium. Heartfelt plotlines with striking visuals, Keiichi Okabe’s mesmerizing score, unintrusive microtransactions, and simple, but rewarding, combat controls establish Reincarnation as one of the best console-like games on mobile devices."]]></summary>

That's $100 below the original launch price of the chip and the exact same price as the slightly slower but otherwise identical Ryzen 5 7600. (It's even cheaper than Intel's $204 Core i5 13400F, a chip that the 7600X beats convincingly in most games.) 
In the UK, it's the 7600 that's the better deal, at £189 versus the 7600X at £209, but both are fine value options too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roots Of Yggdrasil - an inkwashed, roguelikey, card-playing, turn-based citybuilder, inspired by Norse myth - shot to the top of my wishlist after I read Katharine's preview last week. And look, here it is in Early Access. Roots isn't one of your traditional, SimCity-derived town sims in which you steadily colonise a single map (at least, until you lose patience with your glittering urban creation and press the Godzilla or Hurricane button). As per the roguelike element, it's a game about being on the run. 


In Roots, you take charge of a band of warriors fleeing an expanding purple smog, the Ginnungagap, in a flying longship. To escape its coils, you must land on floating islands, play cards to raise settlements, and harvest energy for your vessel from the titular roots of the World Tree. Succumb to the advancing mists, and you'll time-rewind back to your Holt to unlock new mechanics and upgrades. There are also various big-league mythological celebrities to meet and recruit, and a variety of randomised encounters and events to shake up each run. Here's the launch trailer.

Educate me, wrestling fans.
Valheim isn't waving a folding chair or a small flight of stairs, mind you. It's holding a development diary for the forthcoming Ashlands update, due sometime in the first half of 2024. The update introduces the titular Ashlands biome, a blend of graveyard and volcano level notable for the presence of burning skellingtons, some of whom emerge from glowering stone totems.

Ideas dropped during development include a big focus on story, four playable characters, elemental shields, demonic weapons, and more. The mod Doom Delta brings to life many such ideas from sources including an old design document and leaked alpha builds, which I think makes it fanfic? A new version of Doom Delta launched last week, offering a curious vision of the many Dooms Id didn't make.

Case in point: over the weekend, it was discovered that humans, in addition to Pals, could also be stuffed into balls and set to work in your base camp, but now they've only gone and started capturing the in-game bosses, too, thanks to a surprisingly easy-to-achieve exploit involving my bestest of friends, the island police force.

Both concerts were set to be a part of Nintendo Live events in December of last year and this month, too, in Tokyo, Japan, but these events were canceled over safety concerns, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. Now, everyone will be able to watch these concerts when they hit the official Nintendo YouTube channel next month. 
More specifically, The Legend of Zelda orchestra concert will go live on Friday, February 9, at 5 a.m. PT/8 a.m. ET, and the Splatoon 3 Deep Cut concert will be posted on February 10. 
Here's what Nintendo has to say about each:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I realised several hours into my Enshrouded playthrough that I have an unspoken internal checklist for what makes a great open-world survival crafting game. Great building, a sense of scale, a beautiful atmosphere, and the ability to die in extremely stupid ways. In Minecraft, it's digging straight down into lava. In Valheim, it's getting crushed by the very tree you'd just chopped down. And after dying for the third time by trying to climb a slightly-too-steep hill, slipping down and building enough momentum to send me careening off the cliff to my death, I realised that Enshrouded, too, ticks all the boxes for maybe one day being listed among the titans of the genre.
One paragraph in, and I've already compared Enshrouded to Valheim. You'll see that quite a bit throughout this review, and for good reason. Enshrouded has come the closest for me to recapturing that feeling of when the world collectively discovered Valheim for the first time. But that's both an accolade and a reservation. Because it's not quite there... yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As much as I love looking at and admiring sandbox citybuilders like Townscaper, I am terrible at actually playing them. I get the same kind of blank canvas choice paralysis I do in games like Minecraft, or anything where there's no real clear objective for what I'm meant to be building. I sit there with a big toybox of lovely things to stick together, but always end up deflated and disappointed with my own lack of imagination. But Summerhouse, the sandbox citybuilder (or townbuilder, more like) from solo developer Friedemann is just teeny-tiny enough to give me a sense of creative satisfaction. I've been playing its gorgeous little demo this week in between Palworld sessions, and yes, more of this please, this is utterly delightful. Happily, we don't have to wait too long for the final game now either, as it's coming to Steam on March 8th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Pocketpair has shared the Early Access roadmap for its hit "Pokémon with guns" survival game, Palworld, alongside news that the game crossed 7 million copies sold in just five days. For reference, it took Marvel's Spider-Man 2, a PlayStation 5-exclusive game starring arguably the most popular superhero in the world, 11 days to cross the 5 million mark. This roadmap includes PvP, raid bosses and other endgame content, Steam-Xbox crossplay, bug fixes, additional features, and more. 
If you've managed to dodge the discussion around Palworld, which has taken the internet, Steam, and Xbox by storm, Game Informer has a great primer for you to read right here. And if you don't know what the game looks like in action yet, check out Game Informer's recent Palworld stream below:

        <updated>2024-01-24T13:45:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo revealed during a Direct last September Splatoon 3's Side Order DLC would be coming to the game sometime in the spring of this year. Now, just a few months later, Nintendo has revealed exactly when: February 22, 2024. That's when Wave 2 of the Splatoon 3 expansion pass, which features Side Order as the star of the show, goes live, and it's when players can explore the Spire of Order, a brand new location. 
Nintendo announced this news with a short teaser trailer today that shows Agent 8 sleeping on a train. The teaser then transitions to the Spire of Order where a mysterious voice is calling out to Agent 8. 
Check it out for yourself below in the Splatoon 3 Side Order DLC release date trailer: 


For the uninitiated, Agent 8 is the protagonist from Splatoon 2's Octo Expansion. In Side Order, Agent 8 will meet a new character named Acht, who claims to go "way back" with Marina, one of the hosts of Splatoon 2. Marina's co-host, Pearl, seems to make an appearance of sorts in Side Order as a robot that accompanies Agent 8 on their journey. 
With the Spire of Order devoid of color, Acht gives Agent 8 color chips to modify their abilities, like boosting run speed and increasing damage. It's likely Agent 8's colored ink will be used to bring color back to the spire, too, but we'll have to wait until February 22 to find out. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Splatoon 3 review, and then check out what else is in the Splatoon 3 expansion pass. 
Are you going to check out Side Order next month? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

The monster-catching survival sim continues to set concurrent play records on Steam, and Pocketpair are presently focussed on fixing bugs. Beyond that, though, the sky appears to be the limit, as you might expect of a game that shifted a million copies in eight hours. In particular, Pocketpair seem markedly more confident about the odds of adding PvP to the game, having downplayed the idea in interviews before release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 will crashdown on our planet's surface on February 8th, 2024, and turns the topdown co-op alien shooter into a flashier, fancier third-person version of the same. A new trailer release today details how its 'Galactic War' systems work - that is, the macro-scale conflict within which your missions and bug hunts take place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some indie hits create a legion of copycats, but others, not so much. I don't think there are too many Papers, Pleaselikes, for example - perhaps for obvious reasons given that game's grim subject matter.

Lil' Guardsman is a Papers, Pleaselike though - and a seemingly delightful one. You play as 12-year-old Lil, who is a substitute guard at the castle gate for a fantasy kigndom, and you must decide who to admit and who to deny entry. It's out now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games have announced that they will shortly lay off "about 530" people, or 11 per cent of their global workforce, so as to "create focus and move us towards a more sustainable future", in the words of CEO Dylan Jadeja. The "biggest impact" will be felt outside of core development, though the reductions will affect at least one major internal team - the developers of Legends Of Runeterra. Riot are also binning off the Riot Forge publishing label, under which third-party developers create smaller-scale games based on Riot's own intellectual properties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Half Mermaid, led by Sam Barlow, is known for making video games using FMV, and they often require the player to sort through footage to solve mysteries. But for the studio's next projects, it seems the mystery will begin before the games are even announced – today, two Steam listings were posted on Half Mermaid's developer page, but most of their information is redacted.
The games, currently called "Project C" and "Project D," have very few concrete details listed. White text blocks give the page a redacted look, so only a few words in each sentence are legible, and the images and videos in their galleries are surreal and vague. Obscure details are still details, however, so here's a breakdown of what we know about each game so far.

I'm currently burning one called Starry Night, which is a nice fresh scent but it's nowhere near as strong as I would like. I can never find fresh scents that are as long-lingering as the fruity or woody ones. Anyway, I have been discussing my new interest (and interrupting work meetings with pretend candle unboxing videos where I tell them to like and subscribe and check out my collab with WickManiac) with the rest of the Treehouse, which prompted us to talk about the idea of gamer candles. They exist! They're just candles of lies.

Currently, those playing on Game Pass still don't have the ability to join or create dedicated servers for up to 32-player multiplayer like their mates on Steam can. Instead, they remain limited to just 2-4-player co-op via the use of friend codes, meaning that Game Pass players aren't having quite the same experience as their Steam counterparts.

This might seem odd advice, given that PlanetSide 2 is a shooter in which hundreds or even thousands of players fight each other simultaneously, but the thing about planet-sized wars is that they require plenty of legroom, and the thing about crowds is that you can lose yourself within them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically the only sort of strategy games I like are city builders, so I was interested in the playtest for El Dorado: The Golden City Builder, which casts you as the leader of an ancient Mayan-ish city. The playtest is only the prologue, but the eventual goal is to take over the Yucatán peninsula, and if nothing else it's refreshing to see a city-builder that doesn't feel overwhelmingly European. It also has a complicated system of religion. Whereas in a similarly polytheistic game like Zeus, the gods would turn up to stomp on buildings and/or bless them, at fairly large intervals, in El Dorado I was getting a home immolated every few days. Building shrines that have an area of effect, and that require resources to run and protect your town, is its own supply chain in El Dorado. This is a very interesting idea that I liked.
But. The aforementioned deities are figures from Maya mythology, and the Yucatán peninsula is the bit where the Mayans lived, so I just find it a bit sus the word "Mayan" does not appear anywhere on the Steam page or in the press release materials. Sometimes said materials say "the Yucatán peninsula", and sometimes "the mystical land of Jukatan", which could well be an innocent translation mistake, but doesn't make me less sus. I've hedged my bets by saying "Mayan-ish" - just as an uncharitable person could say the devs are doing...

Seeing as you voted the seminal immersive sim your seventh-favourite RPG of all time, I thought you might like to see it too. It's very good.

I made it several hours into Stasis Colon Bone Totem before getting frustra-bored and giving up. That may sound damning, but it's actually very good indeed, because usually that happens within about ten minutes. I can't say it defied my hatred of the genre as much as a The Last Express or The Cat Lady, but it had a good enough run to deserve talking about. Not least as I'm still curious about its setting.

Speaking to IGN, Dragon's Dogma 2 director Hideaki Itsuno threw his own hat into the ring, saying that he's keen to avoid fast travel in DD2 and would prefer that "players travel normally and experience the world around them". If you're someone who argues all games should let you teleport to the objective, then Itsuno thinks you're wrong. Hey, he doesn't mess about, and I don't disagree with him, as long as the game isn't actually wasting my time.

Well, in swaggers the frankly ginormous Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth to tie off the loose ends and give us a follow-up that links all the best bits of Yakuza into a far more satisfying reward loop. Some of the refinements make for superb silliness, while others are a bit eh - not everything is perfect. But spending time with Ichiban and his pals in the sun-soaked Hawaii and beyond is the real treat. It's a wonderful, happy JRPG and it will never fail to brighten my day. Thank goodness for Yakuza.

Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth can be deathly serious when it wants to be. A character with a negative first encounter with the game’s protagonist, Ichiban, soon reveals he is in over his head with the local Yakuza and spent time in jail, leading to heartbreaking difficulties with his significant other. Ichiban is sympathetic and builds him up with his unique and often excessive brand of optimism. The moment is well-written and genuinely moving. Those moments (at least in the first 11 hours) are rare and hit hard as a result.

And speaking of Princess Peach: Showtime, in the latest gameplay trailer for it released today, we get a glimpse at several new iterations of the titular character, including Ninja Peach, Cowgirl Peach, and Kung-Fu Peach, as well as new looks at others like Patissiere Peach, Detective Peach, and Swordfighter Peach. 
Check them out for yourself in the new Princess Peach: Showtime gameplay trailer below:

Developers RGG Studio revealed, a full two weeks before launch, that Valve had awarded it coveted Verified status – a mark of honour for games that run, control, and generally operate well on the handheld.
What that golden sticker doesn’t explain is that to keep above a suitable 30fps, Infinite Wealth does demand that you swing the stolen bicycle of quality reductions directly into the soft skull of its graphical settings. It’s perfectly doable, mind, so if LADding around Hawaii sounds like as much fun to you as Ed’s review makes it seem, read on to find out how Infinite Wealth gets on with the Steam Deck and Steam Deck OLED.

The bar for the fighting game genre has been uppercut to astronomical heights in recent years. Exceptional one-on-one combat remains the primary bullet point, but other series have complimented their packages with robust suites of destinations, from cinematic story campaigns to comprehensive training dojos. Although Tekken 8’s fighting remains a treat thanks to some neat tweaks to its strong formula, the rest of the package, while respectable, falls short of some of its contemporaries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nvidia tools used to create that raytraced Portal mod and other fanciness are now in open beta, inviting all and sundry to jazz up everything from Deus Ex to Garry's Mod. Nvidia's RTX Remix tech lets people fancify old games by injecting fancy modern lighting, new models, textures 'remastered' by AI, new environmental decoration, and other such fanciness, even if the game doesn't have mod support. I'll be curious to see what people make with this, though I am wary of artlessly pumping new tech into old games.

Season 1 will kick off in March and includes the most famous villain in the DC roster: The Joker. Not only is The Joker joining the game, but he'll be a new playable member of the Suicide Squad. 
Notably, this take on The Joker is not the Mark Hamill-voiced character from the Batman: Arkham series. Instead, Brainiac is pulling Elseworlds together in an attempt to merge them into a unified multiverse. This is how The Joker in Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League joins the roster. In his universe, he was already a member of the Suicide Squad. His playstyle is fast and dynamic and requires players to stay moving, accor…]]></summary>

While that reveal included details about the survival aspects of the game, including multiplayer, crafting, and farming, viewers honed in on the idea of it being Pokémon but with guns. You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it's smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. 
Following various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely's Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…]]></summary>

Outsiders of the Ace Attorney series might not be familiar with the name Apollo Justice, but fans know the character is a big deal. He's second only to Phoenix Wright in terms of playable appearances, and his new collection, the Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy, gathers all of those outings in one convenient package. While there's not much new content, quality-of-life improvements and a visual overhaul do a lot to modernize Apollo's courtroom saga, making it a worthwhile journey for fans new and old.
The collection includes three games: Apollo …]]></summary>

Many speculated Piranha Bytes was another casualty in owner Embracer Group's purge of studios that began last year after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023.


Studio closures at the hands of Embracer include Saints Row developer Volition Games and reformed TeamSplitters team Free Radical Design. Game Informer reached out to Piranha Bytes following last week's speculation to see if it was, indeed, another closure at the hands of Embracer, and today, studio CEO Michael Rüve responded, stating the studio's situation right now is difficult but that people shouldn't w…]]></summary>

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for Orion Burger, the classic game by Sanctuary Woods. The engine also adds a few niceties that the original didn't have, such as mouse wheel handling, and using the spacebar to skip walk animations - something the original didn't do properly.
Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game's logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation. And please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, luck be with you. And remember, with the aliens cheating on the tests they set up for you, this will be no easy task.
