From pop culture icons to customizable outfits for existing characters, there are endless possibilities when it comes to choosing who you want to be when you drop into a match. However, you're not able to choose just any skin you want, since many skins are exclusive to seasons, or when they appear in the shop. That makes for plenty of rare skins. Here are the top 10 rarest skins that you can find in Fortnite as of 2024.

10. Honor Guard


The Honor Guard skin, first released back in Season 7, was only available by purchasing the Honor View 20 smartphone. Since then, it hasn't been released in any other capacity, making it among one of the rarest Fortnite skins. It's unlikely you'll come across this skin anytime soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since Gray Zone Warfare is in its Early Access period, it's bound to have a few hiccups along the way. Many players have encountered performance issues, making playing almost impossible. To help with this, here are a few ways to fix Gray Zone Warfare's lagging issues.


Gray Zone Warfare laggy performance solutions


Players can fix Gray Zone Warfare's laggy performance by using the following methods:



Decrease your Quality settings


Ensure that the proper system requirements are met


Use the best Early Access settings


Make sure your internet connection is stable enough


Verify the game file's integrity


Wait for more updates or the servers to clear up



While the first method may lower graphic quality, it has proven to be effective in improving Gray Zone Warfare's performance. Simply go to settings, select the Graphics tab, and scroll to Quality Presets. Set it to a lower setting (Low or Medium) to see a noticeable difference.


Screenshot by Destructoid


If you're still experiencing lag issues in Gray Zone Warfare, check out our guide on the best Early Access settings for a complete overview. You should also ensure that the correct system requirements are met, where you may need to update your graphics card driver.


Due to the game's online matchmaking, a stable internet connection is crucial. An ethernet connection can help with slow performances. 


In addition to internet connection and in-game settings, verifying Steam files can improve the GZW's lag. Right-click on the game's file on the platform and head to Properties. Select the Installed Files tab to locate the 'Verify integrity of game files' button. 


Those who have tried all these methods may need to wait until more updates have been implemented. Since its arrival, the Gray Zone Warfare channel has announced a few hotfixes. So, check for any new updates for the GZW lag problem.

Returnal: Fallen Asteria and The Art of Returnal are the first two official books that Housemarque has produced for Returnal. The former seeks to tell the PC and PS5 game's story in a new form, a graphic novel, while the latter will lay bare some of the conceptual and final artwork the team made for the game. As someone who is a huge fan of video game artbooks, I'm particularly excited to delve into this one because the game world is astounding on PS5 and PC. That's why I've outlined where to buy them below, so no one misses out.

Now, 100 Thieves founder Matthew "Nadeshot" Haag has weighed in on why he thinks franchising fell short for the Call of Duty League.


Activision recently re-committed resources to competitive CoD on April 16 by reaching a new agreement to support organizations more in the future, but the future didn't always look so bright. Before striking a deal, rumors circulated, questioning if the league could financially survive, and Activision found itself entrenched in a $700 million legal battle with OpTic Gaming over an alleged "unlawful monopoly" over the Call of Duty League.

The BP50, Holger 556, MTZ-556, HRM-9, and RAM-9 were tested as potential replacements or additions to the current Call of Duty League weapon pool. Sledgehammer Games intended to increase weapon variety in the competitive game mode, and the results confirmed that the event was a success. 


The MW3 posted detailed weapon evaluation data on Twitter. Sledgehammer Games admitted that at the start of the test period, the MCW held on to a 40 percent pick fate, followed by the WSP Swarm at 17 percent and the Rival-9 at 15 percent. However, by the end …]]></summary>

You can fight through the Commonwealth solo, so I’m going to focus on the stories every companion has to tell to determine who’s the best traveling partner. Because of that there are going to be some notable absences. Look, I love Dogmeat. He's such a good boy, but in Fallout 4, he really doesn't have much of a story or, you know, any character traits to speak of. He is simply the best boy, and above any and all rankings.


When you're on the road, you need a friend to keep you entertained, and you need someone you can really care about. With that in mind, here are the best companions Fallout 4 has to offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of Madden 25 releasing this upcoming summer, NFL Hall of Fame member Barry Sanders provided a grim update for football fans. 


Ironically, in 2013, Detroit Lions legend Barry Sanders was the Madden 25 cover athlete celebrating the sports-sim franchise's 25th anniversary. Now, just a few months ahead of the 2024 iteration of Madden 25, Sanders confirmed that he is discontinuing his relationship with the brand and its products. 


Image via EA Sports 


Accompanied by a video montage of Madden 99 gameplay starring the legendary running back, Sanders left fans in disbelief with a statement: "I apologize for those that were expecting me in the games." Sanders did not provide a reason for no longer wanting to be involved, but he won't be in Madden titles moving forward. Over the years, EA has released several different versions of the running back in the Ultimate Team game mode, and Sanders is usually one of the best cards in the game mode. 


EA has received criticism for its handling of legends in Madden. Players are able to step into the shoes of all-time great icons in the online game mode Ultimate Team, but they aren't available in offline game modes. So even if users want to have legends in Franchise mode or custom games against their friends, that's not an option. The Madden devs haven't revealed plans for the upcoming installment, but even if EA has a change of heart, the title will be missing one of the greatest football players of all time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard revealed today that the upcoming fourth season of Diablo 4, titled Loot Reborn, will not have a seasonal-specific mechanic. In fact, all of the systematic changes and updates in Loot Reborn are also coming to the Eternal Realm, affecting all characters and servers as opposed to just seasonal ones. This asks the question: why bother making a seasonal character?

Big core changes...


A lot of the changes to Itemization as well as the new Tempering system, revamped Codex of Power, Masterworking, and addition of Greater Affixes have all been received positively from players who played the PTR. For the most part, Diablo 4 at its core seems to be headed in the right direction. A lot of the useless base affixes on items have been removed, and equipment can now be u…]]></summary>

Some of the major changes involve guilds. While Blizzard is keeping some guild perks, they are removing the guild leveling system. While they have removed guild levels, any items that were previously tied to levels are now obtainable from the start, depending on the player's guild reputation level. When people join a guild or are a part of one, they will obtain items and perks immediately upon joining. The two major perks that are being removed, however, are the two receiving backlash from players.

Well, one big ol' balance patch later, and this is my new go-to primary rifle. 


Why are people flocking to the Adjudicator in Helldivers 2?


From yesterday's patch:



BR-14 Adjudicator

Full auto is now the default fire mode


Reduced recoil


Increased maximum mags from 6 to 9





The patch notes are minor-looking. Quaint, even. But don't be fooled, dear reader, these are meaningful changes. Enough to transform this once joke of a weapon into the bane of any enemy smaller than a mid-sized SUV. The real kicker here is the reduction of recoil. Before, the weapon was much too weak to be used as a single-fire …]]></summary>

Manor Lords: Farming Guide


In the beginning of the game, Wheat should be your primary crop because it feeds the townsfolk and could determine whether they survive the first few winters in Manor Lords. There is no harvest during the winter, so you’ll want to ensure there’s a surplus of grain after the harvest in autumn, as well as a Windmill and Communal Oven to churn out bread. Once you’ve got some Wheat stocked up, your next focus in Manor Lords should probably be growing Barley and making ale.

Helldivers 2 Update 01.000.300 brought with it a slew of weapon and balance changes, including one to ricochet that's killed more than a few Helldivers in the last 24 hours. However, one change that's not mentioned—which leads me to believe it could be unintentional—is to the Punisher Plasma, which will now rebound off of the inside of a shield backpack's shield when it's active, causing what you might expect as a result: hot death.

In fact, we experienced the game exclusively on the PS5, so while we've got a good idea of how it runs on Sony’s hardware, we’re sadly not able to discuss how the Switch version fares.
That said, two hours is still a hefty amount of pre-release time to spend with Vengeance, so we can wholeheartedly confirm that if you’re a fan of the original, or if you’ve dipped your toes into some of Atlus’ other games, then you can be confident that you’re in for a wild ride (if only for the ever-amusing presence of the phallic-shaped demon, Mara).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I spent around two hours with Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance, the Persona 5: Royal-fied version of the original SMT V. Vengeance promises many new things: a revised battle system, a new story branch, new areas, and more. What I found when I played, was several punches to my metaphorical ribs. A few to my gut. Sure, I spent some time with the new stuff, but really, I spent most of my time being absolutely demolished in turn-based battles against various demons of a phallic and non-phallic nature. I will now attempt to summarise my time against these creatures, wish me luck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I once went back to a gathering after a friend-of-a-friend’s metal gig that I distinctly remember not because of either the party or the show, but because we drunkenly went to a big Tesco afterwards to get snacks. I also distinctly remember making a not-completely serious but also somewhat true statement at the party about how that Tesco trip was the most fun I’d had in months, after which one of the metal men sneered at me. I felt self conscious at the time, but I’ve since grown comfortable enough with myself to realise that the metal man was a joyless fool, and going to big supermarkets is at least as fun as going to average metal gigs. There is nothing a drop D power chord can evoke in me that compares to the feeling of blurrily espying a chocolate trifle in the reduced to clear section. So I wish to bring your attention to Supermarket Times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Harold Halibut has the vibes of a game that should be 4-6 hours long and is, inexplicably, 10-12. It's inexplicable not only because it's a slow game low on interaction - the game is really just a plot delivery mechanism; a TV show you can walk around where you advance the story by pressing A - but also because it's a game created using handmade miniatures. It's a sci-fi animated dolls house under the sea, self described as "a cross between a game and a stop motion film", and if my game required that amount of labour I'd edit that script down. Then again, there aren't that many locations, so maybe you'd really want to show them off.
I love miniatures, and Harold Halibut is beautiful. It's also a lovely story about finding yourself and your place in the world, even if that place is unexpected, and having the courage to take that step. There are unexpected silly bits and strange bits and bits where people break into song, and bits where you read undelivered letters. But, at the same time, I totally understand why some people would find it boring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Endless, unfortunately.
There are a whole bunch of, well, let's say 'Wii-centric' video games from the history vaults that, in theory, seem like they might be a bit of fun to revisit on Nintendo Switch. You know the sort of thing, usually pairing some new-fangled/novelty control scheme with an activity you'd never tried in a game before; making cakes, driving a quad bike...eh...bobsleighing with the Jamaican Olympic team? The Endless Ocean series fits right into this mould and, as it turns out, revisiting its chillaxed dives — even with up to 30 other players in tow — wasn't a very good idea.
Now, before we get into the negative stuff, let's start by pointing out that if you're looking for an incredibly low-energy, low-effort sort of gaming experience where all of the focus is on simply scanning marine life and then reading a tiny informational excerpt about each of them in order to expand your underwater knowledge, this is 100% the game for you. In fact, you'll likely never find another game more suited to your very specific needs. Please enjoy. For the rest of us, as much as learning about all the amazing creatures that live under the sea is a captivating pursuit, we're not sure we can justify the price tag given that there is precious little else to do here.

Here's a little something to make your Switch OLED suddenly seem rather inexpensive, an ultra-rare Nintendo DS studded with 2,000 Swarovski crystals is set to go on auction this week where it is expected to pull in bids of at least £15,000. Fifteen. Thousand. Pounds (thanks, Swindon Advertiser).
The super shiny handheld, commissioned by Nintendo and designed by NYC Peach, features a bejewelled pink paw print on the top of the clamshell to tie in with the release of Nintendogs in 2005. It is one of only five designs to have been made at the time (one of which still resides in the New York Nintendo store) which, combined with all those darn crystals, means that it was always going to fetch a pretty penny.

Developer C2 Game Studio and publishers Versus Evil and tinyBuild have today announced that the newly retitled Astor: Blade of the Monolith (formally Monolith: Requiem of the Ancients) will be bringing the fantasy fight to Switch on 30th May.
In this action RPG, you will play as a lone hero (honestly, is there any other kind?) making your way across a desolate landscape in the hopes of solving the mystery of his creators' disappearances. If it sounds very action-RPGy, that's because it is. The developer has cited the likes of Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, and The Legend of Zelda as points of inspiration for Astor's creative combat and fantasy world — both of which look rather nice in the new trailer (above).

So why am I here telling you about it? Ollie couldn't do Sid Meier's Pirates! last month 'cos he was sick, and this month he's moving house or some other ridiculous made up thing that grown adults can no longer afford to do, so Deathbulge is stepping up to the plate. And it is kicking that plate into the outer atmosphere and playing a sick guitar riff. If you want to join in you can find Deathbulge on Steam.

It includes one new character, one secret character, three weapons, one stage, and a bonus go-cart racing stage. But perhaps most importantly of all, Poncle say they'll answer the question that's been on everyone's lips: "Why is it called Santa Water?". This is something that's puzzled me since the game's inception, and therefore, I will be thrusting myself back into the game where there are, in fact, no vampires at all. I need to know.

After speeding into pole position last time, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has been outpaced by Sony's Stellar Blade which makes its chart debut at number one. Topspin 2K25 is yet another new release this week, serving up a podium spot in third.

Does the suggestion that everything may be a lie also apply to the suggestion itself? Is this an unreliable Steam page? Perhaps the game is secretly a cheerful Playmobile platformer with plentiful ledge-assist, rather than a horrible point-and-clicker that starts you off in a dark cell with a bunch of obviously cursed artefacts, and gets steadily worse.

The Bethesboss had a chat with Kinda Funny and confirmed that Shattered Space, the first big DLC for the brave little space RPG that could, has a release window of "in the fall". Shattered Space adds new locations and stories and gear, and is the sort of DLC that was announced before the game came out, and you got it bundled with some of the super mega hyper awesome pre-order editions (you can still get it bundled with the Starfield Premium Edition if you want to spend an extra 30 quid). 
Before that, though, Howard says we should expect (via VGC via the video) "a big update that's coming really soon", and that "we redid the map stuff, so we have some city map stuff." This is the literal first thing I complained about when I reviewed Starfield. Vindication! This is one of a number of changes teased on Starfield's Reddit community at the end of last year.

The 'Pan European Game Information' board (or PEGI, for short) has listed Hi-Fi Rush for the Nintendo Switch following the game's launch on PS5 last month.
The listing comes with a release date of 30th April 2024, but honestly, we wouldn't look too much into this specific detail since, well, it's today. Yes, Hi-Fi Rush was shadow-dropped on Xbox for its initial release in January 2023, but we can't imagine the same thing happening again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been five years since Game of Thrones ended and a good while since we had a decent video game based on George RR Martin’s fantasy writings that aren’t Elden Ring lore. Yet it seems that Game of Thrones’ cultural cachet still has enough draw to inspire new games of its own. And not just an arguably underrated-if-also-not-particularly-great action-adventure RPG or fairly okay Telltale adventure game, either, but a whole honest-to-goodness Game of Thrones MMO currently in development, according to new rumours.

      <p>The Jackbox Party Packs have always allowed for adult-themed responses, but it was never solicited or directly encouraged by the games themselves. For those who have wanted a more&nbsp;<em>mature</em>&nbsp;experience, Jackbox Games is finally granting you your wish, as it has announced Jackbox Naughty Pack, a new release of three games that promises spicy prompts and dirty fun later this year.</p>

<p>We don't know what kinds of games will be included, but Jackbox Games teases "spicy surprises and maybe even some familiar faces." Does that tease a new, mature-themed You Don't Know Jack? Will we get dirtier iterations on some classic Jackbox titles? Or will these be all new games that just so happen to include some favorite characters from past games? Unfortunately, for now, Jackbox Games is being tight-lipped with the contents of Jackbox Naughty Pack.</p>

<p>However, the studio did release a teaser trailer, which you can view right <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dun3ye7EC6Q">here</a>. Jackbox Naughty Pack will arrive sometime this year, and Jackbox Games promises more details this summer.</p>


<p>Are you excited for a spicier take on Jackbox Party Pack? Do you and the people you play Jackbox games with typically go mature-themed with your answers, or are you more of a family-friendly Jackbox gamer? Let us know what you hope from Jackbox Naughty Pack in the comments below!</p>]]></summary>

Metroidvanias stand apart for me only in hindsight - it's all about the precise ratio of abilities to ability gates, of jump-doublers to overhangs, all things that take time to assess properly. Echo Weaver sets itself apart early, however, by declaring that "time is your currency" and that "when faced with eternity, knowledge is the only gear you need", a phrase that, admittedly, I would probably have extended to "...oh, and a spacetime-folding glaive that works like a throwable fast travel point".

We are still a little way off the release of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door on Switch on 23rd May, but thanks to last week's hands-on previews, we now have confirmation of the game's frame rate. Nintendo's latest remake will run at 30FPS (down from 60FPS on the GameCube original), but this is not a decision that the developers will have made lightly, suggests Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon director, Abebe Tinari (thanks, My Nintendo News).
The director recently took to Twitter to state that they "can empathise" with the Paper Mario devs, drawing from their personal experience on Bayonetta Origins to explain why the game might not run at the higher frame rate that many were expecting.

With the release of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door on Switch fast approaching its 23rd May release date, many of us are undoubtedly wondering just how the game will actually compare to the GameCube original.
Sure, you can come to some reasonable conclusions based on the trailers and preview footage, but there's nothing quite like a good comparison video, is there? Well, lucky for you, we've got one right here. We take a look at some footage from the original GameCube release and the new remake on Switch, before splicing them together for a good ol' fashioned side-by-side comparison.

I was charmed by Aquarist and it's basic-asset using weirdness, and I intended to write a lot more about it.

In the real world, a bug stops me progressing past a very early point of the story. In the world of the game, my father has locked me in his fish basment and will not let me leave.

This will be the studio's next original game, after they wrapped up Layers Of Fear last year with, confusingly, Layers Of Fear (the natural progression for a series: Layers Of Fear, Layers Of Fear 2, and then Layers Of Fear again, although it was going to be called Layers Of Fears at one point).
Bloober Team are currently doing a lot of IP work for other people, with the Silent Hill 2 remake due out later this year, and a game codenamed "Project R" in concert with Skybound Entertainment. Skybound are The Walking Dead company, so I wouldn't give you long odds for a bet on what Project R is about. Neither would I be surprised if Project C is unveiled this summer by a man named Geoff with shiny shiny trainers. I'm interested to see what it is, and honestly I'm hoping it's a brand new standalone thing, rather than a forced sequel to Observer or 2021's The Medium (where I got the header).

And yes, we’re only hearing about this a mere month after the last big Amazon discount splurge, Spring Deal Days. My life is a calendar where every square has "deals" written on it in increasingly scratchy Biro.
Still, let’s keep it summery, eh? Prime Day 2024 may not be a surprise (and is still lacking a specific launch date), but unless the US government announces a second June-based Black Friday or something, it likely represents the next mass serving of PC gaming deals for you to take advantage of. SSDs, graphics cards, or anything else that’s been unusually pricey lately are all but guaranteed to get slashed back down, so there are definitely worse times to be in the market for an upgrade than Prime Day.

But those of us who've been destroyed by unpredictable little brothers going ham on a joystick know a secret. Sometimes spamming works. One Tekken 8 player is proving this point.

A helicopter will soon join the fray. Many things will soon explode, and you will take a short break from the minigunning to calmly physics some boxes into a set of steps with a crane. This FPS is not so much writing a love letter to a bygone era of noughties shooters, as it is standing underneath the window of its respected elders earnestly serenading them with a busted old keytar from the attic. There are bum notes and the singing voice is not exactly boy-band beautiful, but the love is unmistakably there. And, hey, singing is hard.

And by people, I mean oxen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lethal Company is a fun game but I know what you're thinking: it lacks feline energy. Whilst the simplistic game loop of collecting scrap on monster-infested moons and selling it to an equally monstrous company is enjoyable at first, it can get old pretty fast. As both Alice and James have attested with their experiences of this month's RPS Game Club pick, Lethal Company is a game that lacks a certain direction the more you play. I soon found myself settling into an existential crisis, reminiscent of my tumultuous stint in retail. A recurring thought back then was why bother stacking shelves, only to have someone buy the products and make me re-stack them again?
In the vain hopes of gaining a higher purpose in Lethal Company, I stumbled across the 'Needy Cats' mod. Essentially this mod adds a variety of cats to your game that will wander around the facilities and yelp for attention.
Perhaps I'm just a glutton for heartbreak, but I decided that the game needed a galactic sanctuary full of adorable balls of floof. I hearkened back to my time playing Stray, the adorable cat adventure set in a post-apocalypse where humanity was all but wiped out. Could this be the prequel to Lethal Company? What if all Apocalypse games share the same universe, all orchestrated by The Company secretly pulling the strings of fate? Or maybe I just wanted to look at cute cats instead of terrifying mannequin monsters. Either way, the cats needed help. What follows is a diary log of my adventures which soon lead to increasing madness and ultimately, disaster.

We've had some good chat on the matter. Although, I've mostly been preoccupied by the various hardworking monsters in the game. Now, it's your turn to hit us with your questions (or your shovels). Let's chat about all things Lethal Company, today (April 26th) at 4pm BST.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Great was the consternation of singleplayer horror likers at the popularity of Lethal Company, a landmark creepfest and satire of corporate piecework that is best enjoyed in groups of four. When will developer Zeekerss give us a proper singleplayer campaign mode, the loners of the gaming community wondered, peering from their boltholes and eyries. A Lethal Sole Trader, as it were - or failing that, how about some bot support? Well, this particular monkeypaw finger has curled. It curled about four years ago, actually, when Zeekerss released singleplayer-only horror compilation It Steals. 


I've been playing It Steals (available on Itch and Steam for £4 or $5) as part of our latest Lethal Company-dedicated Game Club, and let me tell you, it makes Lethal Company look positively, er, Nonlethal. There are many points of comparison between games, but while Lethal Company is geared more obviously for laughs, with its whoopie cushions and ReactionTube-friendly co-op mechanics, It Creeps just wants to scare you shitless. It's also brilliant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[James made the observation that Lethal Company, a co-op game about being haunted space binmen, and this month's pick for the RPS Game Club, gets less fun the better you are at it. This is true! It's also janky, and the RNG on the weird, warren-like buildings prompted me to ask "Who designed this? What is this for? What kind of office is this??" out loud, as I faced yet another dead end full of pipes. And yet! There's something about it that endears me to it far more than other similar games like Phasmophobia. Games like this all largely rely on you making your own fun with the tools they provide, but I think we should give the Lethal Company devs props for their tools, because they are weird and make no sense, and allow for some fantastic slapstick.

They're mostly just there to give you an early quest involving goat banditry or windmill rats or some such other domestic drudgery. Or, in the case of Tristram’s mayor in Diablo, to fret behind the scenes about how to properly fit considerable cathedral repairs into this month’s budget. Well, no more must this valuable civil servant hide behind balance sheets, occasionally popping out to cut a big ribbon in celebration of a nearby mausoleum being turned into a Wetherspoons. Tristam is a 72 hour Ludum Dare project where you play as said town’s mayor. And this time: It’s ceremonial!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Escape From Tarkov, the extraction FPS from developer Battlestate, recently put up a new Unheard edition of the game for pre-order, and tarkov escapers aren't happy about it. The price for this bundle - which includes a new mode, a bigger stash, and assorted gubbins - comes in at $250, or around two actual hundred actual pounds, but the price alone isn’t necessarily what’s got a section of the player base so tarked-off that a few of them are even loudly considering a lawsuit. 

The actual issue is twofold: the edition is being called pay-to-win, and is also the only way to access said new PvE co-op mode, despite players previously shelling out notable nuggets for what was pitched as access to "all subsequent DLCs" as part of the now-delisted Edge of Darkness edition.

The proposal boils down to a 'Know Your Customer' regime for companies operating cloud services, with the goal of countering the activities of "foreign malicious actors." Yet, despite an overseas focus, Americans won't be able to avoid the proposal's requirements, which covers CDNs, virtual private servers, proxies, and domain name resolution services, among others.

      <p>Dragon's Dogma 2 launched a little over a month ago and has already managed to sell <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240402.html">2.5 million copies</a>, but Capcom is still releasing updates to patch minor issues with the game. While a large volume of complaints have been about the lack of a performance mode, this update (like the last update) does not address that issue. However, it does aim to clean up a number of irritating errors involving the behavior of pawns, the player's AI companions.</p>

We thus use this as an excuse to spend some time talking about The Lord Of The Rings games we'd like to see, plus our favourite Rings games from days gone by (and also Gollum, and also we do impressions of Gollum).
Nate has been playing an impressive number of games, including one that did not allow him to invent the stick and therefore hampered his progress. We also talk about AI NPCs again, because one of them tried to get James drunk. Plus: some lovely recommendations to round off your weekly pod (one of them is a long life meat product).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The announcement trailer for Lost Legions opens with a Roman Emperor bellowing “GIVE ME BACK MY LEGIONS” like a kid who’s just had his pudding taken away. I'd just had a big swig of coffee before watching, and was instantly swept off by visions of an apoplectic Roman bigwig rampaging through the forests of darkest Germania, gluing abducted legionnaires together into a sort of Octavian katamari... and then they revealed that it’s another open world survival game, with no less than two trailer beats dedicated to the act of hacking down a tree. 


I mean no disrespect to developers Tarock Interactive - they're not to blame for my addled imagination - but there are many open world survival games and as a weary Ed Thorn recently noted, the majority are heavily frontloaded with wilderness carpentry. I don’t think survival games should emphasise wood-chopping in their announcement footage. It's like doing a Call of Duty montage of people getting shot three seconds from spawn. Still, if there's no katamari mechanic, the idea of raising a small army of mostly AI-controlled Roman soldiers behind enemy lines has a certain charm. Without further ado, here’s the trailer.

And from the times I've played Lethal Company, I've come to think it's also a game about appreciating the mundane, too.

By now, I can confidently say that the RPS team are scrap collecting experts and can easily meet the quota set by the enigmatic Company.

Cue immediate death by a vengeful face-hugging bug. I'm expecting my first round of xenomorph child maintenance fees any day now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fallout 4's "next generation" update goes live today. Timed to capitalise on the Fallout TV show's mad popularity, it'll encumber the 2015-released open world wasteland RPG with widescreen and ultra-widescreen support, Creation Kit fixes, and a "variety of quest updates" across Steam, Microsoft Store and GOG. There will be new items for the Creation Club, including the Makeshift Weapon Pack, which lets you blast people with a piggy bank like Elon Musk, and a new quest, Echoes Of The Past, in which you try to "stop The Enclave from spreading their dangerous ideology and gaining a foothold in the Commonwealth".
They're also bringing the game to the Epic Games Store and upgrading it to Steam Deck Verified status. Such days of bounty we do live through, but beware - it's possible the update will break existing Fallout 4 mods, which will be a problem for the very large numbers of you who've been downloading mods after watching the show. Indeed, the possibility of today's update messing with mods has already seen the creators of the promising Fallout: London delay release to assess the damage. If you're similarly concerned, you might want to disable auto-updates right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most of my time in Lethal Company is full of tomfoolery, panicking, and ultimately letting the quota down. As I run back and forth from the ship, only able to carry four things at a time in my puny arms, I frequently see the various monster inhabitants of the game excelling at pretty much everything. The Forest Keeper has brawny strength and can travel across the map in a blink of an eye, the Eyeless Dogs can sniff out an intruder in next to no time and The Butler has dedicated his life to maintaining a mansion even after the owners have long since gone.
This had me thinking - surely the various monster inhabitants of Lethal Company would make for a much better worker than myself?
Sure, most of them are ravenous killing machines - but that fits with the core values of The Company. After all, most of your time spent in the game will be collecting scrap on distant moons to meet an arbitrary quota set by The Company. You'll then feed your pilfered belongings to the insatiable maw of a tentacled horror (otherwise known as the boss). You may be able to sympathise depending on your occupation.
So, if the monsters in Lethal Company were given the chance to work for said company, which of them would make it as an employee of the month and which would crash and burn harder than me getting thrown from the airlock five times in a row?
Join me as I peruse the CV's of my favourite monsters in Lethal Company (as far as I know only half of them have opposable thumbs) and advocate for which of them should be my replacement as The Company's new hire. After all, once this month's Games Club is finished I'm not sure they'll even let me back on the ship.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The closest I have come to having any interest in sport is when I got really into reading about football hooligans, or like, Blood Bowl, but I do absolutely recognise the romance of it all. SUDDEN DEATH is a delicious free slice of playable art-pie that celebrates that romance. It is - says dev Cécile, who co-made the project with Nat Pussy and MOTHER GOOSE for collective Domino Club - “a game about love and sports. it's gay, it's very australian, and it's great.” You can tell it’s Australian quickly, because people call chips ‘chippies’, which makes me chuffed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alien-infested submarine sim Barotrauma has received a chunky update, bringing two new-ish monsters into its lethal aquatic world. The shrimp-looking Mantis may be recognisable to veterans (it once appeared in pre-Steam builds). And the Viperling is a venomous variant of the existing Spineling (a thorny seaworm with hull-piercing porcupine-like spikes). But don't worry, the medical systems have also seen a "mini-rework", which means drugs like morphine are "less of a 'solution for everything'". Wait. What?


Submariners in the game can still use morphine, opium and fentanyl to ease the pain of a monster attack, broken bones, wrecked organs, or be-bulleted body. However, the developers feel these drugs have been over-used. So they've rebalanced the opiates as part of their Blood in the Water update. Now the drugs have "a much higher risk of causing addiction and overdoses, and morphine heals much more slowly, making it less viable for combat-heavy situations." Well. Guess I'll just die.

It must be the baleful influence of Creative Assembly's latest free update for bellowing strategy bonanza Total War: Warhammer 3. Out 30th April, the update introduces Epidemius, Proctor of Pestilence - a new Nurgle Legendary Lord who gains rewards based on how many ickle diseases you’ve spread to other factions (already my favourite aspect of playing Nurgle in the game). Does Epidemius also get buffs if the player is infected by something? I hope so. It would be a consolation to know that my ailing trachea is contributing to the Nurgle cause.


That’s not the only new addition in TWW3 patch 5. They’re also bringing a Gold Wizard hero, who is sort of Magneto but blingier, and a cursed crown that will make everybody hate you. Let’s dig in.

These represent perhaps the first major challenge to mechanical keyboard hegemony, but you may be wondering: who’s Hall? What’s their effect? And does it actually make for a better gaming keyboard? Time to found out.

      <p>Stellar Blade is out this week and our review, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/stellar-blade/more-than-a-pretty-face">which you can read right here</a>, is positive. We liked the game and were impressed by the depth of its action and world-building. Ahead of its release, but after spending some time with the game, we had a chance to reconnect with Shift Up CEO and Stellar Blade director Hyung-Tae Kim <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/26/stellar-blade-feature-angel-from-heaven">after speaking with him earlier this year</a>…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lots of Soulslikes have about as much joy, and the same colour palette, as a burning cowpat. They are grim and dark and often have gimmicks that are a bit middling: mechanical arms that spew gunk, or turning to stone. Or they stand out with incredibly deep combat, with dense menus and rainbow loot. So, Another Crab's Treasure comes as a refreshing surprise, what with it's crustacean theme, platforming, and shell gimmick that actually complements fights in clever ways. Not only that, but it's colourful and funny, with plenty of challenge for veterans and plenty of difficulty tweaks for those who just want a good time. Trade cowpat for coral, I'd say.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sand Land is like a sanitised manga-ish Mad Max Fury Road, where there are fewer explosions and nobody huffs paint and screams "Witness me!". So, arguably, a less cool Mad Max. In this incarnation it's an open world action game with light RPG elements; in previous incarnations it is a manga and anime by the creator of Dragon Ball. My takeaway from playing Sand Land the game is that it is a tremendous advert for the manga and anime, in the sense that everything good about Sand Land the game is from those, and I would rather be reading or watching them instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I went to see Civil War this weekend. I liked a bunch of it, didn't like a bunch of it. One thing I thought was very obvious is that it sanitises its titular conflict of any political context. On the one hand, I understand this as part of the theming, said almost directly into the camera by Kirsten Dunst's photojournalist character: as journalists they're there to observe, so other people ask questions. On the other hand, the civil war being between the government and the Western Forces, an alliance between California and Texas feels extremely "Republicans buy sneakers too", if you ask me.
It made me think about the Fallout TV show. One of the things I like about it is that it doesn't pretend The Brotherhood Of Steel aren't absolute mad lads (pejorative). Like, they're clearly not good news, and there isn't any attempt to make them seem like they are - just that they might seem that way from the point of view of a traumatised child being rescued from a fridge like a tiny Indiana Jones. Many of the video games I like pride themselves on offering choice to the player, but in reality they smooth over any bumps in the road to make the choices appear equal - rather than telling the player they are choosing between bad and good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When, in town building simulation Manor Lords, you erect your first manor, it feels natural to place it in the center of your humble 14th century European settlement. It presents as a locus of power, where your character avatar resides. Also, it’s right there in the title. I built mine down a side road, between oxen posts and granaries, for no real reason but free space. The more I play, the more it feels a fitting place. Not sidelined, exactly, just not especially loud. I need the taxes it brings to pay mercenaries to see off bandits, but lords - their whims and ambitions - don’t set the tone here. Parchment and seals aren’t as important as tilled earth; as winter snow, spring thaws and autumn harvests. So, despite the title, this sedate, curious, and intricate sim isn’t really about lords, nor manors. Not half as much, anyway, as it is about manure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Royale-battler Fortnite will soon allow players to hide a handful of emotes the developers concede are "sometimes used in confrontational ways". This includes the emote reported as the most-used in Fortnite's seven-year history. That's either a worrying indictment of the game's players, or a (more?) worrying indictment of universal human psychology. What is the offending animation? Well, turns out people don't like being laughed at.

So, Reedpop's EGX expo and MCM Comic Con are joining forces. They'll both take place side-by-side in the ExCel London this year, on 25th-27th October.


EGX, of course, will feature a bunch of classic and upcoming games, while Comic Con is laser-targeted at our respected allies in the world of on-paper image-based storytelling with speech bubbles. EGX's headline partner is TikTok this year, which makes this a perfect nexus of entertainment artforms. All we need is a puppetshow now and possibly a semaphore stand, and the ritual will be complete.

What fate the Warcraft grunt when he is too old to work work? It's probably pretty bad, right? Now let me slop Innkeep down in front of you like a big bowl of rat stew. Developer Daniel Burke furnished me with a little playable slice, and boy, Innkeep is a grim old time. I mean that as a compliment.
In it you run a big pub with room for a lot of grizzled adventurers, in a dog-eat-dog dark fantasy RPG sort of a world - think a roadside pub in one of the early seasons of Game Of Thrones, before everyone hated it. You do a lot of plate-spinning drudgery like cooking, cleaning, and serving, but also eavesdropping, rumourmongering, and knowing when to slip in a ribald joke as a distraction while you size up a mercenary's sword.

Attempts have been made at cosy automation and automated cosiness in the past – Satisfactory is on the sunnier side, providing you enable the right settings, and Shapez 2 has lots of rounded edges. But IDK, there’s something about the ravages of mass industry that doesn’t quite gel with zoomorphic raccoon baristas and other such wholesome trappings. Have you ever encountered a cuddly smokestack? How about a cuddly just-in-time network?
Combine cosiness with automation, and a lot of the time, you end up with some kind of macabre joke, like Palworld. Or at least so I thought before I discovered Sweet Transit, out now, which seemingly resolves everything by means of a hearty injection of trains.

      <p>Taming a wolf in Minecraft is one of the game's simplest joys, and no matter how many times I start a new world, I always hoard bones in case I encounter one. But once you've adopted a canine companion, you probably hide them away in a house for safe-keeping, shielding them from the horrors of the game's hostile mobs. Today, Minecraft is adding a way to make them a little stronger – wolf armor.</p>

I've always felt that I, too, would like to one day find an artwork that I could describe in the same way. Partly because it sounds like an interesting experience, but mainly so I could steal that line and feel like one of those elite, urbanely perceptive, multiple trouser-owning critics.
Well, today is not that day, because indie horror IRIS isn't, in fact, actively hostile towards the act of playing it. It's more a case of passive disdain. Is it a ‘good’ game? Probably not. Ah, but is it enjoyable? Buddy, not even slightly. But it is intriguing. I am intrigued, reader.

      <p>Jack Black seems to have more or less confirmed his rumored role as Steve in the upcoming Minecraft movie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The actor took to Instagram on Tuesday to post a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5yyqluSQpc/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">short video</a> of himself on a film lot observing a rainbow before entering a trailer labeled “Steve, Minecraft.” The interior features promotional art of Steve as the actor smiles at the camera.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2024/01/03/jack-black-joins-live-action-minecraft-movie-reportedly-as-steve">report in January</a> stated Black would be voicing Minecraft’s mascot but had not been officially confirmed by the film’s production companies, Warner Bros. and Legendary. Although this <em>technically</em> isn’t an official announcement either, I'd say there's roughly a 99.99 percent chance that Black is involved.</p>

<p>The Minecraft movie, which has been in development in some form or another since 2014, is directed by <em>Nacho Libre</em> director Jared Hess. The cast includes Jason Momoa (<em>Aquaman, Game of Thrones</em>), Danielle Brooks (<em>The Color Purple</em>), Jennifer Coolidge&nbsp;(<em>The White Lotus, American Pie</em>), and Emma Myers (<em>Wednesday</em>). <em>Minecraft</em> is scheduled to hit theaters on April 4, 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jack Black is obviously no stranger to video game movies. He voiced Bowser in <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> and portrays Claptrap in the upcoming <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2024/02/21/the-borderlands-movies-first-trailer-looks-as-ridiculous-as-the-games"><em>Borderlands</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Total Eclipse, a real-time, curse-breaking, 3D adventure (with a dash of Indiana Jones flair), is ready for public testing!
Originally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.
Step into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.
Embark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). 
Can you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?
Our modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
