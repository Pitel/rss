This week's Japanese charts are in from Famitsu (via Gematsu) and things are looking rather PlayStation-heavy compared to what we are used to seeing.
It's the new releases that are dominating the competition this time around. Persona 3 Reload's PS5 version tops the charts with 76,368 copies sold, while its PS4 counterpart takes the bronze. Another PS5 title, Granblue Fantasy: Relink slots into the podium line-up, leaving the only Switch newbie, Jujutsu Kaisen: Cursed Clash to take bronze with 25,242 sales in its opening week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not to denigrate either the efforts of either the comms or dev teams, but when a game has been knocking around my consciousness for a while, eventually I just move it it from a mental box marked "in development" to "probably out now, innit" without any input from anyone else. Inkulinati, a turn-based strategy game where you play a medieval artist duking it out with another artist on the pages of an illuminated manuscript, is one such. It's been kicking about on Steam since at least 2019, and in fairness to me it did launch in January last year - it just went into early access. These factors contributed to me being sort of surprised at the reveal of the actual release date for 1.0, which is February 22nd.

As a child in the UK, I had a lot of experience with the Mega Drive and PlayStation. It wasn’t until I was maybe eight or nine years old that I started becoming aware of Nintendo and that’s because I was obsessed with Pokémon after being gifted a stunning teal Game Boy Color for Christmas.

With rumours of a potential Switch successor landing in 2024, there's much talk on exactly what the system will entail and whether it will retain the overall concept of Nintendo's hybrid console.
One of the most recent rumours doing the rounds is regarding the console's screen size, with one analyst noting that it will likely come packing an 8-inch LCD screen. This is a full inch larger than the current Switch - OLED Model, and Digital Foundry has discussed the potential implications this might have on the successor's form factor and Joy-Con compatibility.

The associated joint statement from developers Blackbird Interactive and publishers Gearbox arrived within hours of me posting about said Homeworld 3 demo and saying that while I am fully onboard with many aspects of the new space strategy game, I do have reservations about its controls. 


Naturally, and self-flatteringly, I'm now petrified that I'm single-handedly responsible for the delay. Please come back, Homeworld 3! I didn't mean it! I'm pretty sure I'll acclimatise to the control scheme with practice! True-3D starfleet management is always a bit fiddly! Besides which, I might not get to review it now!! I'm moving flat in May!!!

The Legion Go debuted at £649, a price at which we found it largely compelling, but now it's dropped to something a bit more reasonable - £649. 
That £50 discount doesn't make it a budget option by any means, especially with the most affordable Steam Deck at £349 and an OLED model at £479, but it's still a welcome price drop on one of the most intriguing PC handhelds we've seen yet.

That's a far cry from the situation two decades ago when very little content was made available online and ISPs' customers were viewed as the enemy. In a recent interview, an ISP that fought for seven years to prevent the imposition of piracy filtering and blocking said it's ready to cut pirate IPTV streams as quickly as the law allows.

It will now launch on February 22nd, instead of its original date of February 14th - which is a damn shame, if you ask me, as nothing screams "romantic Valentine's night-in" like trying to backstab your other half in a bid to rule hell in Satan's absence. Alas, we'll just have to make do with the altogether more pedestrian date of a regular Thursday in February, as the team need just a bit of extra time to ensure it's "as polished as possible" before release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PlayStation exclusive Helldivers 2 has caught the attention of many players for various reasons. The hype has resulted in a tsunami of purchases, putting Helldivers 2 in a good position. 


On Steam, it reached the top of the charts and then floated around the second or third place on Thursday morning just before launch. This indicates the game has found some popularity, and people are curious about what Arrowhead has been cooking up. 


Unlike its predecessor, it is a third-person over-the-shoulder shooter, not a top-down one. We got our first glimpse of it during the State of Play in 2023. It appeared to be the third-person shooter to compete with franchises like Counterstrike and Helldivers 2. 


If you're new to the series (like myself), there is a trailer that explains the story so far. There is also free content in the pipes to keep the online element consistently alluring.




One of the best parts of Helldivers 2 is that it has cross-platform functionality, meaning that if you purchase the game on Steam, you can still play it on PS5 for free. It's also possible for friends on PC and PS5 to play together. 


Destructoid will cover Helldivers 2 to ascertain whether it is the online third-person shooter Sony desperately needs or a sign that the genre has outgrown itself.

Nintendo withdrew from EVO in 2022 after Sony jointly acquired the event in 2021, and while EVO issued its statement at the time about how "saddened" it was by Nintendo's decision, it's apparently still happy to welcome it back with open arms.

        <updated>2024-02-07T23:28:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blackbird Interactive and Gearbox Publishing announced today that the upcoming space RTS Homeworld 3 has been delayed a couple of months and will now be released on May 13. According to the post, recent feedback from Homeworld 3's public War Games demo and insights from Homeworld veterans made the team aware of final tweaks to make Homeworld 3 the best experience possible.




Important to get it right


Homeworld 3 has seen a handful of delays in the last year. Originally scheduled for the first half of 2023, the RTS was first delayed to February 2024. At the end of last month, it suffered a roughly one-month delay to March, and then now another two month delay to May. Delays are always a bummer. 


But, it's more important than ever to ensure quality. You can only launch once, and in the case of Homeworld 3, there's a pretty devoted fanbase of players who still love to play Homeworld and Homeworld 2. Assuming Blackbird and Gearbox intend for players to delve into Homeworld 3 for as long, it's important they get it right.





Addition of War Games


There's actually a Homeworld 3 demo available right now on Steam Next Fest. The demo features a new Homeworld mode, called War Games. Commanders manage a fleet through numerous waves of enemies to claim powerful artifacts and augment their ships to complete objectives. It's essentially a roguelike mode for the space RTS which is a pretty innovative approach.


I was able to play about an hour of the demo and thought the mode itself was a pretty fun addition to the genre. However, the UI and camera controls felt a bit rough around the edges. Hopefully, these extra two months will give Blackbird the time to add some extra love and polish ahead of release.


Homeworld 3 will now be released on May 13 on PC. Those who purchase the Fleet Command or Collector's Edition will get access three days early on May 10.

They're all hefty undertakings, and to say I've got a bit of the brain drain is an understatement. I need something easy, something satisfying and new that doesn't require every cylinder to fire. 


That's why I tried Infinite Craft, but that's definitely not evidenced by the time I spent in Infinite Craft. For the unfamiliar, it's a charming word game that gives you four elemental words: Wind, Fire, Water, and Earth. Those elements can combine with themselves or each other to form new things, those things make other things, and suddenly you've created Yellowstone National Park.

The announcement from Disney says it will be a multiyear project, for a new persistent universe that will be a "world class" games experience and also interoperate with Epic's ever-popular pop-culture mash-up machine, Fortnite. This new universe will have opportunities for people to "play, watch, shop and engage" with the likes of many of Disney's franchises. From classic Disney and Pixar to Marvel, Star Wars, and somehow James Cameron's Avatar, it's all here.


All of it will be powered by the Unreal Engine. And the deal is, of cours…]]></summary>

As someone who played Star Rail at launch but dropped it soon after, I wanted to see if it was worth revisiting. Luckily, I was granted access to a preview of Honkai: Star Rail’s newest update, so I hopped onto the Astral Express to check out the new area: Penacony, the Planet of Festivities.


A bit of background about me: I’m a Genshin girl. I started playing Genshin Impact on release day in 2020, and I’ve been smitten with Teyvat ever since. So when HoYoverse’s newest game, Honkai: Star Rail, debuted in April of last year, I eagerly waited at the login screen, rushing in just as the servers went online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite his vague in-ring involvement, Muhammad Ali joins the WWE 2K24 roster when the game releases on March 8. He is shown briefly in a recent trailer published Tuesday. 




Muhammad Ali will be joining a roster of over 200 WWE Superstars when the sports entertainment game releases next month. With him being a boxer, his moveset will likely revolve around punches as shown in the trailer. 


Ali has appeared on WWE programming twice. First and most notably, the boxer was a guest referee during the first Wrestlemania 40 years ago. It was during the main event with Hulk Hogan and Mr. T (from The A-Team fame) against "Rowdy" Roddy Piper and Paul Orndorff. Despite his place of authority, he did lay in a punch or two against Piper and fought off one of his allies trying to insert themselves into the match. 


Another reason why Muhammad Ali might be in WWE 2K24, despite being arguably the best boxer of all time, is that he actually fought a wrestler in the ring before. He interrupted a match with Gorilla Monsoon and matched his fists against Monsoon's grappling prowess.




This year's WWE game will be looking back at 40 years of Wrestlemania, so it makes sense that Ali is included. If you're going all the way back to the original Wrestlemania, you'd probably want to include such a notable appearance.


Other confirmed wrestlers in WWE 2K24 include Cody Rhodes, Andre The Giant, Chyna, Hulk Hogan, and Kevin Nash, among many others. Due to recent events, Brock Lesnar may or may not make it into the final roster, especially after his removal from the mobile title Supercard.

If you’re like me, you have probably been hoping to one day have a life simulator of reasonable quality that isn’t funded by a megacorporation that would try to monetize Hell if it had the ability to do so. That looks to be what Paralives is aiming to provide.


The trailer focuses on things I wouldn’t do in real life, such as exercising and having friends.

Split into two parts, the first arrived with the flashback sequence, telling the events of Cloud and Sephiroth's trip to Nibelheim. It was emotional and powerful.

It should really come as no surprise that this happened. First off, I'm the guy who gets side-tracked by everything in an RPG. I went out of my way to not spend all my review time in Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth on Dondoko Island, and I spent ages chasing better Gwent cards for my deck in The Witcher 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insomniac Games intended to deliver Marvel's Spider-Man 2 New Game+ mode before the end of 2023. Unfortunately, the development team couldn't meet the original deadline, but now it's set to launch a NG+ for Peter and Miles next month.


With 2024 in full swing, Insomniac is eyeing a new timeframe to release New Game+ for Spider-Man 2. The team announced today that the highly requested feature, plus a few other additions, will be coming to the quite-popular Sony sequel in March. 




Insomniac confirms New Game+, fresh suits, and other additional content will be part of the update on March 7. The Spider-Man 2 developer also teased that "highly requested features" are being added at the same time as New Game+, but we won't hear about those until closer to the update's release. 


Any fans hoping for story DLC to drop soon should probably continue to hold tight. The initial Spider-Man on PlayStation 4 saw the first wave of its City that Never Sleeps content come out a little over a month following the debut of the base game. Spider-Man 2 was released on October 20, and there is no confirmation either way from Insomniac whether additional story content is coming.


The unfortunate Insomniac hack late last year may have indicated there's more in the works. However, internal plans and development cycles frequently change, so nothing is certain until it's officially official. 


There are certainly lingering storylines that fans would be excited to see utilized for potential Spider-Man 2 DLC (where the Crimson Hour story goes next, for one). Time will tell if we get just that, or whether we'll have to wait for what's next for the franchise further down the line.

We know that Paradox’s ambitious competitor Life By You will arrive this June (assuming no more delays), while EA’s own free-to-play evolution of the OG life-sim series - currently codenamed Project Rene rather than The Sims 5 - is probably still a while off yet. Dropping somewhere in the middle will be Paralives, the promising Patreon-funded up-and-comer led by indie dev Alex Massé, which has been given a fresh look and confirmation of a release date sometime next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artisan Studios, the developer behind Astria Ascending, has announced their next project. Lost Hellden is an action JRPG that is coming in 2025.


Alongside the announcement is a trailer that demonstrates the art style they’re using, which is confusingly called “Deep 2D.” They explain it: "You play in 3D in hand-painted artworks with dynamic lighting and weather.” To me, it looks like 3D polygonal models with hand-painted textures over hybrid 2D pre-rendered backgrounds. Maybe they’re referring to the way the lighting and real-time weather give the 2D backgrounds some tangible depth. That sort of sounds like how it was done in the 2002 remake of Resident Evil. 


Trailer via Gematsu


Anyway, I’m getting off track. It looks pretty convincing. It reminds me of a more high-fidelity PS1-era JRPG, and I mean that as a compliment.


The gameplay looks like instanced battles that mix “action and strategy.” It features eight characters that you can customize to your play style.


The team working on it features Hitoshi Sakimoto on audio and music, best known for compositions on Final Fantasy XII, Tactics Ogre, and Valkyria Chronicles. The illustrator is Takeshi Oga, who worked on the Gravity Rush and Siren series. That’s some good pedigree.


Lost Hellden is planned for 2025 on PC and consoles.

From the moment it launched in March 2017, Switch quickly carved itself a niche as the console for couch-co-op gaming. Crack off the Joy-Con and in mere moments you have a a multiplayer setup suitable for wherever you happen to be. Soon, a crowd of zany, co-op party games — many inspired by the success of Overcooked! — hit the eShop, and these days it can be tough to tell one colourful co-op caper from another.
At first blush, PlateUp! — the work of indie developer It's happening — looks similar to other pleasant, four-player fare, but taking time to fork through its gameplay and sample its delights reveals a culinary co-op game with a very different flavour. Having launched on Steam in 2022, it's built up over 11,000 'Overwhelmingly Positive' reviews — pretty tasty, we're sure you'd agree.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After reviewing the Ryzen 7 8700G and the Ryzen 5 8600G as these new Zen 4 processors with RDNA3 integrated graphics, the latest AMD 8000G series CPU in the Linux benchmarking lab at Phoronix is the Ryzen 5 8500G. The Ryzen 5 8500G is a 6-core / 12-thread processor with RDNA3 graphics that retails for just $179 USD. Here's a look at how it's performing against other AMD and Intel processors on Ubuntu Linux. The Ryzen 5 8500G ends up being decent on the GPU side but making me genuinely excited is the Zen 4C prospects in the low-power space for AI workloads at the edge, low power servers, and other different deployments for great low-power performance. Under load this AVX-512 wielding budget desktop processor was typically pulling 50 Watts or less!]]></summary>

Just in time for Super Bowl weekend, Saber Interactive has today announced a new wave of DLC for its arcade gridiron title, Wild Card Football.
The 'Legacy QB Pack' is pretty much what you would expect, adding four legendary quarterbacks for you to slot into your lineup. Included this time are Warren Moon, Steve Young, Kurt Warner and Randall Cunningham, each of whom comes with their own unique outfits.

Instead, as of the February 7 season two launch, players can play ranked Resurgence. Additionally, Fortune's Keep, a Resurgence map from previous versions of Warzone, has returned. Unfortunately, the Fortune's Keep reboot is the only playable map for Warzone's new ranked system. 


That means players who enjoy the classic one-life (and a gulag) Battle Royale game mode will have to continue grinding without a rank. According to this developer blog, Battle Royale players can expect a "ranked play experience to return later in the year."


How does the Resurgence ranked mode work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another great Octo Expansion.
A few years ago, a cute new action-adventure game called Eastward released on most platforms, blending some appealing EarthBound-esque visuals with a narrative-driven game loop that’s vaguely reminiscent of the older Zelda games. We really enjoyed it, despite its flaws, and it seems that developer Pixpil had some more ideas it wanted to explore for the unique world it built, as it’s now released a sizable DLC called Eastward: Octopia. This siloed expansion adds a lot more than just a few new levels and scenes, effectively acting as a half-sequel of sorts that completely changes up the gameplay. We’d even go so far as to say that it’s a superior game to the original.
Octopia’s narrative takes place in an alternate universe separate from the main timeline of Eastward; in this world, things are decidedly cheerier and brighter, while there isn’t a hint of miasma to be found anywhere. The story kicks off with Sam and John arriving by train at a mysterious place called Octopia, an abandoned amusement park that’s long since fallen to ruin. The two purchase a small house and a plot of land there to start afresh, and set out to rebuild Octopia to its former glory through their farming efforts. Plenty of alternate-universe counterpart characters from the main plot of Eastward eventually move there to join them in this endeavor, but everyone is just a little different in this iteration.

One creative on the YouTube channel Pierre485 has done just that and has turned Nintendo's list of numbers into a bar chart race that documents the ever-changing order of the Switch's best-sellers.

I've played many variations of this mode - which was originally a mod, Gun Game - over the years in other games, and it's always a laugh, for the simple reason that it can be tuned to allow less proficient FPS players to catch up with their brethren, by introducing less powerful or harder-to-master weapons at certain levels as "speed bumps".

He shoots sauce and says things like "You just don't cut the mustard, Batman!". Maybe when you have to put out at least one issue a month, you throw a lot of villain spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks, and once something does you then go about making "guy who has a thing for the calendar" more of a rounded character - a sinister dude with a weird backstory.

To do this, the trio fly off to the south of Italy — sounds good to us — but what awaits them there looks to be something a whole lot more trippy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty received Lies of P-themed DLC back in September, now the puppet souls-like will reciprocate. Neowiz revealed today that a new free Wo Long-themed DLC pack will hit the game next week on February 13. Here is the pack in action which includes weapon and armor costume cosmetics.




The two Souls-like action RPG's are going to collide once more as Lies of P fans will get access to several pieces of cosmetic DLC as part of the free pack including:



Azure Dragon Crescent Glaive weapon


Armor of the Honorable and Bandana of the Honorable costume



Also launching today is the Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty Complete Edition which includes all the released Wo Long DLC including the Lies of P weapons that were released in September.


It's always great to see two great games come together for a fun collab. It's a bit basic with it just being a single weapon cosmetic and an armor costume, but for free DLC I'll take what I can get these days.

      <p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth continues to look fantastic. During today's PlayStation State of Play devoted to the upcoming exclusive title, we got a new look at various impactful scenes set to take place in this retelling of the middle portion of the Final Fantasy VII Remake series. </p>

<p>The footage in this trailer shows off various scenes we haven't yet witnessed and characters we've seen very little of. The main thrust is Sephiroth's quest for the Black Materia and the party's efforts to save the world. As you might imagine, it's all set to the amazing soundtrack fans have come to expect from the game.</p>

<p>You can check out this cinematic trailer below.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Want to dive into Cloud and co.'s post-Midgar adventures early? You’re in luck. Announced at the State of Play today, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is getting a demo, and it's out today on the PlayStation Store. 




The demo will get you access to the first chapter of Rebirth, with a party of Cloud and Sephiroth in the game's opening. Sometime between today and the release of Rebirth, the demo will also be updated to extend to Cloud, Aerith, Tifa, Barrett, and Red XIII in Junon. There was no mention of whether save progress would carry over or not.


Pizza in the Sky


Final Fantasy games have been consistently getting demos lately. Last year, we got the fantastic Final Fantasy XVI demo and, before that, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origins. In fact, in 2020, Square Enix released a demo for Final Fantasy 7 Remake which covered the first chapter. 


News of this new Rebirth demo leaked a little ahead of schedule last night, via the Explore page. 


As a fan of Final Fantasy 7 Remake, I’ve been hyped about Rebirth for a while. Plus, I just finished Crisis Core Reunion, so I’m up-to-date on whatever craziness Tetsuya Nomura and the team have in store. I’m way too curious as to why a certain black-haired SOLDIER is still alive and squatting.


The demo should be available today on the PlayStation store for players to plunge their swords into, and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth releases on February 28 on PlayStation 5. 

The post Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth has a demo available today appeared first on Destructoid.]]></summary>

The latest survey comes by way of the Japanese site Capcom Town, which is currently hosting a "super election" with 10 simple questions to answer. There are nominal rewards involved for reaching certain participation milestones, but the rule rub lies within the content of the questions themselves.


Let's take a look at what could be cooking at Capcom in the next decade or so.

Sure, plenty of games have solid slices showcasing a few cool gameplay elements that make me intrigued, curious, or interested to see the final build. But it's really rare for a demo to feel so crafted that it might as well be a standalone work, impressive in-and-of-itself, outside the bounds of previewing.


Horror games are usually the ones that thrive in that space. Some of my most well-remembered demos, like Signalis, Slay the Princess, and the two letters at least a few of you are screaming at the screen right now, were all horror games; so sure, maybe it's that. Few genres create small slices that stick with you in the same ways horror can.

Cannibal Abduction is not that innovation. It is very much submerged in the conventions of the slasher horror genre. But even having said that, it is an enjoyable, bite-sized sampling of what the genre offers.

The Early Access release date for Nightingale has been shifted forward by a couple of days and will now begin on February 20 as opposed to February 22.





“Having the game release at the start of the week not only allows our community to get into the game earlier but also gives us time to address any launch issues ahead of what’s sure to be a busy weekend. All in all, we’re excited to get the portal network up ahead of schedule.”
- Aaron Flynn, Inflexion Games CEO



Walk the Realms, Realmwalker


Nightingale just had a successful open-stress test on February 2, opening the window for an earlier release. I had a chance to jump in and play for a bit, and it's become one of my most anticipated upcoming releases.


Even though we're in a time of frequent survival crafting game releases like Palworld and Enshrouded, Nightingale has been five years in the making by a team of over 100 developers at Inflexion Games. The team is comprised of many industry veterans including CEO Aaryn Flynn, former GM at Bioware who worked on Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and the Mass Effect franchise.


Players traverse a "Victorian gaslamp fantasy" world with up to five friends, exploring many diverse Realms they access through portals. Along the way, you'll craft unique Realm Cards that influence what lies inside the next portal. You can also plop down your own Estate and build your own home inside these realms.


It's a very ambitious project but from what I saw in the stress test, it looked to be as special as advertised. 


Nightingale releases in Early Access on Steam and Epic Games Store on February 20.

The clue is in the name, as all the characters look like 2D paper cut out dolls, and all the environments are like papercraft models. It's pretty gorge.
Third Eye Open, out this year, is inspired by the Joss-Papercraft of Southeast Asia (indeed, the start menu is a stage). You play as Ting, a pre-adolescent girl living in Malaysia with her parents. Ting discovers her supernatural ability to see ghosts at a camp, where she meets Xiu, a ghost girl about her own age. The two become friends, and the demo starts in media res when the two are back home.

The open-world missions are described as "more akin to that of a Far Cry than anything we've seen before in the Call of Duty universe." However, it doesn't just mean players can walk around large spaces and explore where they'd like. It also means drivable vehicles, a typical fast travel system, and we'd speculate a few more mechanics not found in typical Call of Duty campaigns. Although linear campaign missions wil…]]></summary>

Rocksteady’s long-awaited live service shooter is aggressively unambitious and seemingly petrified of risk, marrying tight, combo-ratcheting, flow-state combat with some awfully familiar and conventional loot-chasing guff.

      <p>Project Orion is still a deeply mysterious game. We know it is a follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, we know CD Projekt Red is developing the game in North America (Boston, specifically) as opposed to Poland where the main studio is based, and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/01/03/cd-projekt-red-not-interested-in-being-acquired-says-ceo">eventually development will expand to Vancouver, with support from the main Polish headquarters</a>.

This is despite the fact that the game will also have an HD art style over top of the 8-Bit backbone (not available on NES) that you can toggle on or off. Allegedly. That’s not actually in the demo. All you get is a taste for is the NES version, which strikes me as an odd decision. I personally love the NES and don’t have much interest in their “HD” visuals, but anyone who prefers fidelity won’t really have much to chew on just yet.


On the other hand, there’s enough here to tell us that Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland is at least shaping up to be a good…]]></summary>

But I do like the Steam Deck, as well as feeling a sense of being vaguely useful. Thus, instead of moaning about holding down a button for 20 seconds to plant some berry seeds, I’ve tested how Palworld adapts to life on Valve’s handheld – and worked out which are the best settings to use with the Deck’s modest hardware.

Recent events have led to community speculation as to whether the statues are working as they should, or even if they’re holding people back. 


Pockets of the community all over have been investigating this possible bug and the results seem to point to one thing - Lifmunk Effigies are not only bugged, but they’re bugged in a way which makes player’s capture rates significantly worse. 




I have to point out that Pocketpair has neither confirmed nor denied the existence of such a bug, but in the latest round of patch notes, it mentioned an issue linked to Lifmunk Effigies, though it wasn’t this one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every so often, there are games that come out that are made with real models. They're sometimes called "handmade" games, implying pure coders use their prehensile toes, but I really like it every time I see one because I love models. I like little versions of regular things! I just think they're neat. But it really is every so often, presumably because it takes even longer to make a tiny little man out of twigs and spit and scan him into a computer than it does to make him in the computer to start with. Cute miniature puzzle game Lumino City is ten years old, and Trüberbrook is coming up on five. And I first played a tiny snippet of Harold Halibut in 2018. Now, a larger snippet is available for everyone in the Steam Next Fest.
Harold Halibut is a sort of sci-fi, slightly retrofuturist point and click puzzle game about an undersea society on an alien planet. These people's ancestors blasted off to an ocean planet using the technology of a big science corporation and now, though they can't remember why, they're all pootling about under the water looking at fish. In this world of exaggerated sea-science nonsense, Harold stands out as a sort of beige lab handyman.

Continuing from this success, Konami has now announced Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days, which is a collection of classic franchise entries.


More specifically, Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days is coming out to celebrate the IP's 25th anniversary, and Konami claims it's bound to "excite nostalgic Duelists across the world." Now, the vast majority of the collection's content is still unknown at this time, though Konami did reveal that one of the included games would be 2000's Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters 4: Battle of Great Duelists, a Game Boy Color title that came out exclusively in Japan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2021 I went through a bit of a rally phase with WRC 9, as I discovered the joys of watching people play rally games beautifully. And as much as I enjoyed my brief stints with those semi-realistic rally games, I've since longed for more of a blend between a rally-er and a colourful arcade jaunt. For those seeking a similar swinging-the-back-out experience, I'd recommend giving #Drive Rally's demo a go. It might not be as colourful as I'd like, but it's got lovely, errr, dirt feel?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Action-RPG colossus Elden Ring is reportedly getting a free-to-play mobile adaptation with in-app purchases, which takes inspiration from miHoYo's Genshin Impact. It's being published by Tencent, who apparently acquired the licensing rights to Elden Ring back in 2022 and put a few dozen people to work on a prototype, even as the company acquired a 16% stake in Elden Ring developer From Software.
All that's according to Reuters, who cite three sources "familiar with the matter". I realise that "free-to-play mobile version of Elden Ring with in-app purchases" is a phrase tailormade to give certain players hives and/or cause the speaker to be struck by lightning, but much as I can't help looking over cliff edges, I do find the idea fascinating.

While this high-speed FPS has been playable in a number of semi-open alpha tests already, trying it out is now as easy as sliding into its Steam page and hitting the big green demo download button.
The demo launch is accompanied by a shiny new trailer, showing more of Rivals’ skiing shenanigans, aurally satisfying airshots, and flag-throwing tricks that I will never, ever be able to successfully pull off in a real match. Also, a confirmation that it’s launching into early access, though there’s no date beyond “soon.”

The show almost feels like the embodiment of how excessive and unself-aware the time period was. Big ‘roided up guys and ladies in spandex with radical names battling the general public in colorful and ridiculous feats of strength. I barely remember it, and I still think it was awesome. I was a bit too young for it, but my sister and I would watch Gladiators 2000 (the children’s version of American Gladiators) some mornings before school.

To be fair, this is essentially two 32-inch 4K 240Hz monitors without the gap in the middle, with a Mini LED backlight that delivers 1000-nit HDR highlights, an absolute beast of a monitor... but I'm guessing that most people that can drop nearly $2000 on a monitor aren't waiting for a deals post on Rock Paper Shotgun to do so. 
Still, I can dream, and this monitor is pretty cool, so let's take a closer look at this absolute bargain.

That's more than £75 cheaper than the 13th and 14th-gen equivalents, which add on only meagre levels of performance, and a great price for a CPU that can use the same DDR4 or DDR5 motherboards with PCIe 5.0 support. If you're building an Intel-based gaming PC, I'd argue that this is the best budget option going!

      <p>As part of our Apex Legends magazine cover story, we interviewed several key Apex Legends developers – Steven Ferreira, Evan Nikolich, Josh Mohan, and John Larson – about how Respawn Entertainment is shaking up its battle royale with a new Legend Upgrade System in the game's twentieth season. We learn how the team has gradually been auditing the core systems in Apex to trim the fat accumulated since the battle royale entered the scene five years ago and how exactly those gameplay changes affect the core player base.</p>

      <p>Yu-Gi-Oh is celebrating its 25th anniversary, and Konami held a special event in Tokyo to commemorate the occasion. In addition to touting an AI learning opponent feature for Master Duel and VR experience with Duel Links, a collection of classic Yu-Gi-Oh titles served as the big new game announcement.</p>

<p>Dubbed Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection, this compilation consists of the very first Yu-Gi-Oh games ever released, including titles only available in Japan. Konami only revealed one game in the collection: Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters 4: Battle of Great Duelists for the Game Boy Color, which launched in Japan in 2000 and never came to the West.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yu-Gi-Oh Early Days Collection has no release window, but it will be available for Switch and PC via Steam. Konami plans to announce the other titles in the collection in the future, so you can start building your wishlist now. There are a ton of Yu-Gi-Oh games (to say the least), but as a long-time fan, I’ll be happy if Forbidden Memories, The Eternal Duelist Soul, or (perhaps less likely) The Duelists of the Roses make the cut.</p>]]></summary>

Still, in case you need a helping hand cutting through the many hundreds, if not thousands of free demos that are currently jostling for your eyeballs on Steam, we've put together this shortlist of recommendations to get your started. 
There are 15 picks here, covering everything from citybuilders to horror games - and a lot of these are games we've never written about before, either. But, in case you are looking for demos of more well-known PC games, we've also listed some of the big obvious choices you might want to check out as well (and all the other demos we've written about over the last couple of weeks). You know, because we're nice like that. So come and join us for 15 (plus!) Next Fest demos to get you going.

But in the years that followed, after you'd been sent to the slammer for crashing through my window bellowing about cheap Audible subscriptions, I might have checked out games like Ghost Trick and Phantom Brigade - each sort of an exercise in placing actions on a timeline like audio layers to produce a winning composition - and thought "hey, that hysterical burglar was onto something".
I wouldn't say there's an abundance of games in which you place actions on timelines, mind you. But those that do exist are neat, as Marge Simpson would say. Take Tarnished Blood.

The iconic Counter-Strike map is, I have argued, "one of the fundamental shapes of video games".

A new player-made map pack for Quake offers 30 new singleplayer levels based on multiplayer levels from other games including Unreal Tournament, Valorant, Perfect Dark, and Mario Kart 64. Yes, of course it has a de_dust2.

Indeed, an unannounced single-player Titanfall game was quietly shelved last year, and if there’s any burning sense of unfinished business among series devs Respawn Entertainment, it wasn’t evident during my recent visit to try out Apex Legends’ Season 20 update.
Even so, it turns out some still carry the fire, at least as source of inspiration for Apex lore and mechanics. I asked Respawn’s narrative lead Ashley Reed whether Titanfall was keeping in anyone’s minds, and was told that if anything, the references need reining in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there’s a secret to how Apex Legends has endured the past five years, an era marked by as many FPS failures as successes, then it might be this: there are no sacred cows in live service. Since its surprise launch in February 2019, developers Respawn Entertainment have chopped and changed everything from hitbox-shrinking Naruto run animations to entire character designs and ability kits, gutting and reworking gear and class mechanics along the way. The incoming Season 20 update, titled Breakout, represents the latest large-scale rejig, adding upgradeable skill tress for its playable Legends that promise MOBA-esque progression and the maddest fights yet.
Then again, if you actually ask Respawn’s Apex team how they reached this point – as I did when I visited their Los Angeles offices for a Season 20 test run – you’re unlikely to get just one answer. Rather, the battle royale’s unusual longevity in a fiercely contested space is more often attributed to those ongoing work-and-rework efforts themselves, the scope of which sometimes remains a surprise to the developers themselves. As does, according to lead game designer Devan McGuire, Apex’s success.

It's all thanks to a drastically expanded Evo experience system, one that now not only boosts your shield capacity, but unlocks the branches of a MOBA-style skill tree that permanently buffs your character for the duration of a match. Even for a season with no new playable Legend to headline, it’s an update that feels exciting and genuinely game-changing – if a little scary at the same time.

Here are a few games we're aiming the ol' scrying crystals at this week: alchemy-themed puzzle adventure CLeM (6th Feb); 1980s-styled "Tetris + flying car" puzzler Space Garbage (6th Feb); Coven-building "4X card game" WitchHand (7th Feb); spoofy sci-fascist shooter Helldivers 2 (8th Feb); alt-theological dark fantasy The Inquisitor (8th Feb). Mind you, this week it's all about the demos. That's right, it's time for another Steam Next Fest - have you had a chance to play any demos so far? Participating developers have taken to stuffing them up a few days in advance to beat the rush.

Broadly speaking, pirates face threats to their security, finances, even their identities. So how do they feel after 120+ days of threat message exposure?

It’s packed with 40 new features, 80 changes, and almost 150 fixes. In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

      <p>I am not reviewing Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League for <em>Game Informer</em> (that privilege belongs to looter-shooter expert Matt Miller), and for that I am grateful. But it’s not because the game is terrible. It’s because even after five hours, I still have no idea how I feel about it.</p>

      <p>It's February, which means Steam Next Fest is upon us! If you're unfamiliar with what this festive celebration of games is, every year, Steam holds its Next Fest to highlight (mostly) indie games coming out this year and beyond with fun, often bite-sized demos. And the best part is the demos are completely free!&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Game Informer&nbsp;</em>got access to some of these demos before their launch when Steam Next Fest begins on Monday, February 5, and enjoyed quite a few. That's why in today's installment of New Gameplay Today, hosts Wesely LeBlanc and Kyle Hilliard want to showcase three games: Pepper Grinder, a fun momentum-based platformer, Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge, a cozy frog farming sim, and Dystopika, a chill cyberpunk city builder.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check out gameplay of all three of these demos in the NGT below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p>All three of these games are set to launch sometime later this year, but if you're interested, you can try each out (and dozens more) as part of Steam Next Fest, which begins Monday, February 5, and ends Monday, February 12.&nbsp;</p>

I'd arranged with some pals to play an online board game with them that evening, and when news hit that it might actually be a reasonably big deal for us PC folks, I ambitiously thought: I can proooobably do both at the same time??? Reader, I was wrong, at least for the most part. The first 30 minutes of it was arguably fine, but then the 10-minute trailer for Death Stranding 2 arrived and I simply had to throw my hands up in defeat. I honestly did not understand what I was watching, and even several re-watches later, I'm still not 100% sure what Kojima thinks he's playing at.
But hot damn, do I love it anyway.

I was instantly smitten with this one when it was first unveiled at the end of 2022, and the more I've seen of it, the more it's risen into becoming one of my most anticipated games of 2024. Happily, its Next Fest demo doesn't disappoint, as it not only feels wonderful in the hands, but ooof, it really knows how to do a good plinky plink coin jostle. My word.

Now, Jump Over The Age has confirmed that, yep, "there's around a year left of development" to go on the game, putting its release firmly into 2025 territory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Devolver Digital have confirmed they're cutting 28 people's jobs at Artificer, the Polish studio behind Showgunners, the turn-based tactics game about a dystopian murderous gameshow. Most are gone immediately, while some will stay on until Artificer release their yet-unannounced next game. Artificer were previously owned by Good Shepherd Entertainment, a publisher Devolver bought in 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was just yesterday that I was espousing the benefits of the newly released Ryzen 7 5700X3D processor - a cutback version of legendary 5800X3D that breathes new life and exceptional gaming performance into classic Ryzen 1000, 2000, 3000 and 5000 systems. I was thrilled to see the 5700X3D debut at £233 at Amazon - before stocks were exhausted and it went back up to £240, anyway. 
Now though, the faster 5800X3D has dropped to nearly the same price, just £234 - an even better deal given its higher clock speeds and (very marginally) faster performance. If you're still running an older Ryzen processor and your motherboard can be updated to support the 5800X3D, then I highly recommend this processor, especially if you're using a comparatively low-res 1080p or 1440p display as you're more likely to be CPU-limited at these resolutions!

      <p>Silent Hill: The Short Message shadow dropped yesterday following the conclusion of the PlayStation State of Play for the affordable price of free-ninety-free. The PS5-exclusive adventure follows a troubled teenager named Anita as she searches for her friend Maya in a decidedly not-okay apartment building. From the first-person perspective to psychological tricks and an oppressive atmosphere, The Short Message sports heavy P.T. vibes. If that sounds too terrifying, or if you don't own a PS5, you can watch me play the brief adventure from start to finish in this archived live stream.&nbsp;</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dig back far enough into the history of any word and you'll find something sinister. Take "cute". Nowadays it means pretty, lovable or charming, albeit perhaps with an undertone of mistrust or contempt, as in the phrase "that's a cute observation, Edwin". But the word originally evolved from "acute", which very broadly means sharp or intense. "Acute" was once a Middle English word for a short-lived fever - it's related to "ague", a word you've likely come across in a medieval fantasy RPG somewhere, which refers to fits of sweating and shivering. The word "cute", then, is secretly diseased, and so, perhaps, is the experience of cuteness. There's a psychological phenomenon called "cute aggression" which refers to the desire to physically envelop, dominate and even abuse the thing you find cute - "I just want to squeeze you till you pop".

      <p>Last year’s remake of Resident Evil 4 was a <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/resident-evil-4-remake/refinement-not-reinvention">fantastic game</a>, and the addition of a revamped Separate Ways DLC made it <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/resident-evil-4-separate-ways-dlc/go-your-own-way">even better</a>. But if you’ve been holding out on jumping into Leon’s mission to save Ashley, now may be a good time to take on Las Plagas with the announcement of Resident Evil 4 Gold Edition.</p>

<p>Launching on February 9, this version includes the base game, Separate Ways, and the Extra DLC pack (previously only available in the Deluxe Edition) of character skins, weapons, and items. Of course, The Mercenaries mode serves as free DLC. The price is unknown at the time of publishing, but if you haven't picked up the game on console, PC, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/11/07/resident-evil-4-remake-is-coming-to-apple-devices-in-december">iOS</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2023/09/14/resident-evil-4-remake-vr-and-story-dlc-detailed">PS VR2</a>, this looks to be a good way to get everything in one neat package.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Resident Evil 4 Gold Edition is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

Listen, it was very early in the morning at the time, and it must have come at a peak eyes-glazing-over moment for me. However, having now played the first 30 minutes of Tales Of Kenzera thanks to its just-released early Steam Next Fest demo, I have seen the error of my ways. The demo might only cover the game's opening, but this 2.5D Metroidvania already looks to be quite the promising newcomer in this ever-crowded genre - so much so that it may even be able to go toe to toe with Ubisoft's Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown. Yep, I went there.

Last year's multimedia horror extravaganza game has a new patch, and of note is that it includes chapter select but, interestingly, also the "much-requested option to tune down the horror flashes", according to the notes here. What is a horror flash, you ask? It's that thing where a horror game or film or TV show suddenly flashes up a semi-transparent image of like, a monster, or a screaming woman, or a big weird eye. A jump scare meets the Kuleshov effect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not that Yakuza (or Like A Dragon as it's now called) hasn't felt comfortable in its skin over the years, but Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth feels particularly confident. I think that's down to a lot of little improvements to its RPG systems that I mention in my review, but also two other things: a radio and trolleys.

Or maybe not. The above claim surfaced yesterday, while everybody was going nuts about Hideo Kojima's latest shenanigans, and has swiftly been shot down by Hasbro subsidiary Wizards of the Coast, originator of all things D&D that haven't been created by D&D's vast and imaginative modding, fanshipping and spin-off-making communities. Curious.

It's bloody complicated!) and thus are using the news that Day Of The Devs is a non-profit (what does non-profit even mean? What does profit mean? It's bloody complicated!) as a flimsy excuse to talk about indie games. Plus: Steam Next Fest kicks off next week, and there were indie game demos a-plenty, so we talk about some favourites of those, too. Plus: we've been playing JRPGs! And I was wrong, it's episode 4. Please ignore every time I say it's episode 5. I told you my notes aren't to be trusted.

      <p>In 2013, an unassuming Xbox Live Arcade game was released called Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Early looks made it seem like a pleasant environmental puzzle game about a pair of brothers going on an adventure, but actually playing the game showcased an impressive and specific point of view from its creator, Josef Fares.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[They say ammo scarcity is an artform in FPS games, but I'd argue no game makes a single sniper bullet work harder than the freshly announced Children Of The Sun. I mean, why waste them when you're a young telekinetic hellbent on getting your revenge on the cult that raised you and held you hostage for your entire life? One bullet goes a long way when you can alter the path of its trajectory with each fresh kill you land - as long as they're visible in your immediate eyeline, that is. There are no swoopy swerves going on here, and the thrill of each level is working out the best (and quite literal) angle of attack to take down every last target. I've been playing the first handful of levels of Children Of The Sun over the last week or so, and no word of a lie, this murderous mix of Hitman, Holedown and Sniper Elite has shot straight into my gooey, beating heart.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A great 3D platformer seems to be a rare and special thing these days. I think Psychonauts 2 was the last one that really took my breath away, but outside of that (as well as obviously every 3D Nintendo platformer), I often struggle to think of many games that could be considered its equal. There's always something holding them back, isn't there? Whether it's a wonky camera, slightly unwieldly controls, or the platforming itself is just a little too pedestrian to ignite the imagination.
So where does Penny's Big Breakaway fit into the equation? This is the next game from former Sonia Mania dev Christian Whitehead's new studio, Evening Star, and yep, you can definitely tell this was made by some real Sonic heads. Penny and her (strangely toothy) sentient yo-yo, err, Yo-Yo, feel like a ball of energy just waiting to bust out across the colourful scenery of their home world of Macaroon, and golly, they sure can fly with just a couple of timely button presses. Alas, there is a but. For me at least, Penny and Yo-Yo are perhaps a bit too energetic for my platforming tastes, and having spent a few hours with an early preview build, I often found them quite a rambunctious pairing to keep under control.

Straight off the production line are fixes to crashes, as well as enemy pals getting stuck in walls.

Breeding also becomes easier, with the removal of some annoying flourishes. There's a lot more and it gets progressively sillier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well look at that, a new trailer for Rise of the Rōnin - the fancy samurai action-RPG from Ninja Gaiden household Team Ninja. Set in 19th century Japan's Bakumatsu era, the game is a mixture of open-ended exploration, sneaking and agile traversal that puts me heavily in mind of Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series. Unlike most Assassin's Creeds, however, this one has a pretty in-depth, rigorous melee combat system, with bosses that look like they're going to grind my gears no end. Will it be as vicious as Nioh 2? I'd better start stocking up on comfort food.

And in true Kojima fashion, the video game is said to be just as much a movie as it is a game.

It's out in 2025 on PS5, with a PC release date still to be revealed, and appears to be as free-wheeling and self-serious yet whimsical as you'd expect from a Kojima joint. I got as far as the pet anime dragon before my brain squirmed out through my ear.

      <p>V Rising, the popular survival action RPG, is branching away from PC and making its way to PS5 sometime this year. The news was announced during today’s State of Play.</p>

<p>The game, which first entered Steam Early Access in May 2022, puts players in the immortal shoes of a weak vampire who awakens after slumbering for centuries. Players must regain their strength and rebuild their castle, which, among other things, involves enslaving humans to do their bidding. Whatever your method of rebuilding your might and fending off foes, you’ll have to plan around a day/night cycle since sunlight is a big no-no for your well being. V Rising can be played alone or alongside friends in multiplayer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Interestingly, since Sony doesn't have an Early Access style program, one has to wonder if V Rising’s arrival will coincide with an impending 1.0 launch on PC. V Rising was a <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/05/31/v-rising-reaches-15-million-copies-sold-in-just-two-weeks">big hit when it first arrived on Steam</a> and has garnered positive reviews, so here's hoping the experience translates well on console.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Hot on the heels of the latest Death Stranding 2 trailer during Sony's most recent State of Play livestream, Hideo Kojima, the head of Kojima Productions, announced that alongside Sony, his company is making a brand new IP. Not only that, but it is, as Kojima put it, an "action espionage" game.</p>

<p>If that genre sounds vaguely familiar in relation to Kojima, that might be because the tagline of his global breakthrough, Metal Gear Solid, released in 1998, used the tagline "Tactical Espionage Action." In normal people's terms, that means a stealth game.&nbsp;</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WEpK67JDLu8" width="640"></iframe>

<p>Kojima's return to the stealth genre, one he pioneered decades ago with the Metal Gear series, is still quite a ways off. As he tells it, development will begin in earnest after Death Stranding 2 is released sometime in 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He then went on to say a bunch of stuff that didn't make a ton of sense, though maybe one day it will in retrospect. This new game will also apparently be a movie "in terms of look, story, theme, cast, acting, fashion, and sound," Kojima said, before adding that with this new game, Kojima Productions hopes to "transcend the barriers between film and video games."</p>]]></summary>

      <p>PlayStation and developer Team Ninja have released a new trailer for Rise of the Ronin, and it features plenty of bloody gameplay and new details about the Bakumatsu period in Japan.

      <p style="margin-bottom:11px">Today’s PlayStation stream brought some great news for players on Sony consoles. Dave the Diver is headed to Playstation in April, meaning that players who weren’t able to catch the game on Switch or PC will now have a chance to join Dave on his adventures.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px">As we highlighted in <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/dave-the-diver/a-refreshing-departure">the game’s review</a>, Dave the Diver was one of the welcome surprises of last year, offering a novel and amusing mix of gameplay experiences. Part of the game focuses on scuba diving and fishing, while another section of the game is about managing and growing a sushi restaurant, using the ingredients you gathered from the ocean. The game has a whimsical, lighthearted vibe and consistently entertaining gameplay, which together has garnered a lot of praise.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px">Alongside the release on PlayStation consoles, we also got a tease of a new crossover coming to Dave the Diver, in which Godzilla shows up in the strange waters of the Blue Hole. If we get to make sushi from a kaiju, it will be an awesome day, indeed. That new expansion to Dave’s adventure is set to arrive in May.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Capcom gave fans another look at Dragon’s Dogma 2 during today’s State of Play presentation. Today’s trailer focused purely on gameplay, showing off some of the monster-climbing action.</p>

<p>The trailer doesn't offer a ton in the ways of storytelling set up, instead serving as a flashy highlight reel of what's likely the game's strongest suit: action. Whether you're slaying beasts with swords and axes or blasting them with magic, Dragon's Dogma 2 looks as thrilling as fans would expect.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Today's PlayStation State of Play delivered a new Death Stranding 2 trailer and, perhaps unsurprisingly, it is weird as hell. The trailer opens with Fragile and a friend, or someone very reminiscent of Fragile, performing surgery while a pair of additional hands cover her mouth. Later in the trailer she says, "These days I am Fragile in name only," before explaining her efforts to create Drawbridge, which apparently was started when Sam went off on his own after the events of the first game.</p>

      <p>Today during Sony's most recent State of Play, Konami unveiled a brand new Silent Hill project. Silent Hill: The Short Message is a new free experience that'll be available later today.</p>

<p>Check out the trailer below to see it for yourself. Though as a quick heads-up, there are brief scenes of self-harm.</p>

<p>The Short Message trailer looks conspicuously like the alleged leaked images for a new Silent Hill game we saw back in February 2022 that Konami DMCA'd. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23070560/silent-hill-reboot-images-leak-konami-bloober-team"><em>Polygon&nbsp;</em>detailed at the time</a>, the leaker "Dusk Golem offered some hints at its narrative, naming two characters (Anita and Maya) and hinting that SMS messages would factor into the game somehow." This lines up with much of what's in the trailer.</p>

<p>Despite the previous leak, The Short Message was still a bit of a surprise, as it's yet another new Silent Hill project but wasn't one of the many annoucned back in 2022, which revealed the upcoming Silent Hill 2 remake, the maligned Silent Hill: Ascension, as well as Silent Hill f and Silent Hill: Townfall. It appears the future of Silent Hill is as bright as it is foggy.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

      <p>In 2011, as the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise turned 20 years old, Sega and Sonic Team decided to celebrate with Sonic Generations, a game that remade various iconic and fan-favorite zones from Sonic's past in both 3D and modern 2D versions. The title was one of the more well-liked Sonic games of the era, alongside Sonic Colors and Sonic Unleashed. During today's PlayStation State of Play, Sega announced a new version of Sonic Generations called Sonic x Shadow Generations.</p>

      <p>We finally got a thorough look at Silent Hill 2 thanks to today's State of Play. The footage showed protagonist James Sunderland fighting monsters just as he did the original and also teased a number of memorable moments from the original game with the new visuals.</p>

<p>We still don't have a release date for the remake from developer Bloober team, but the trailer did reiterate that the game is in development for PlayStation 5.</p>

However, mobile versions have recently been spotted, but you’ll want to think twice before downloading them.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several major music labels including Capitol, Sony, and UMG, sued the Internet Archive over its phonograph archiving project, Great 78. Hundreds of millions of dollars in potential damages are at stake but IA says that many of the claims are simply too late. IA has asked the court to dismiss those that occurred over three years ago, citing an RIAA cease-and-desist letter as evidence.

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for Orion Burger, the classic game by Sanctuary Woods. The engine also adds a few niceties that the original didn't have, such as mouse wheel handling, and using the spacebar to skip walk animations - something the original didn't do properly.
Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game's logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation. And please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, luck be with you. And remember, with the aliens cheating on the tests they set up for you, this will be no easy task.
