Reader dear, I'll let you in on a little trade secret: I do not wake everyone up at 7am to ask them what they're playing. I actually make them tell me on Friday. I have felt tremendously guilty about deceiving you across the 353 previous WAWAPTW posts. The weight of that is honestly why I've left. It feels good to finally come clean. Whew! Alright, now tell me, what are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on!

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate director Masahiro Sakurai is back at it with a new "Grab Bag" video - this time discussing the "most incredible year for the game industry". In his own "personal opinion", it's 1986 - a year that marked the beginning of multiple major franchises, the arrival of the NES in Europe, and the origin of the legendary Konami code.
This particular year saw the birth of series like The Legend of Zelda, Dragon Quest, Metroid, and various other key franchises like Castlevania and Kid Icarus. As Sakurai notes, many of the series in his latest video feature in some way or form in Smash.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pufferfish is a delicacy in some places. You can get in on the “eat dangerously, die satisfied” mindset in Stardew Valley if you use the right bait and fish in the right spot.


Pufferfish are ocean fish, and they can only be caught on the mainland during the Summer. However, for every other season, they can be caught on Ginger Island. This means that you’ll be fishing from the beach on the mainland, or Ginger Island’s Pirate Cove, or South, Southeast, and Western shores.


If you’re in need of a Pufferfish and it isn’t Summer, you can also use Magic Bait which let’s you catch any fish regardless of the season.


The Pufferfish can be a bit tricky to catch as they tend to move up and down quickly as if they’re bouncing in the water. You might want to use a Trap Bobber for Pufferfish to make it less likely that they’ll escape while you’re trying to reel them in.


You can also sometimes find them in garbage cans during the Summer, for some reason. And, like many things, it is sometimes for sale at the Traveling Cart for 600 to 1000 G.


Once you have a Pufferfish, you can turn it into sashimi. It can also be used as an ingredient in Quality Fertilizer and Maki Rolls. It also can be used as part of the Specialty Fish Bundle in the community center fish tank.

Fragment of Harmonic Whimsy’s 4pc effect grants up to 54% DMG bonus when a character’s Bond of Life increases or decreases.


Bond of Life is a debuff that prevents a character from receiving a certain amount of healing. Any healing they receive will reduce their Bond of Life bar instead of replenishing their HP. Bond of Life must be fully cleared before they can begin filling their HP bar.


Bond of Life can be applied by certain enemies (like Fatui Operatives) or from certain weapon effects…]]></summary>

Through 16 MLB games, Witt Jr. ranked second in the league for fWAR, average velocity, and hard-hit ball percentage. On top of that, a .321 batting average, 25 hits, and stellar defense make the young shortstop one of the best players in baseball at the moment. There were some shouts for Marcel Ozuna and Mookie Betts to win the award instead, but ultimately, the devs gave the nod to Kansas City's lead man. Let's jump right into how players can get their hands on this card.

The SEAF Artillery found on a map adds an extra Stratagem to the mix, but it works best when you choose the right payload.


There are multiple payload variants. The best payload options you can use for the SEAF Artillery can be based on preference, but it also depends on the difficulty and enemy type in Helldivers 2. If you're against bugs, tossing down a napalm strike to defend points is ideal. But when fighting Automatons, a calculated EMF strike is wiser. For high-level missions, you can pick smoke to cover your retreat. Both factions die to explosives, though, and those are likely the ones you want to know about the most.

Players will of course first want to equip a grenade, which can be accomplished by pressing B on the controller to open the Pip-Boy. Under the Weapons section of the Inventory (INV) tab, select the type of grenade you want to wreak havoc with, and then press A to equip it.

These optional quests award in more experience points and Requisition Slips, so they're worth tracking down. Here's how to find them.


A good way to find out what missions include Secondary Objectives is by looking for the light blue icons on the maps before you begin. In my experience, Secondary Objectives start appearing at Medium difficulty and beyond. Look for blue icons that can look something like crashed pods with smoke or beakers. These icons indicate a Secondary Objective, and their location on the map can usually be seen before the mission starts.

Here is everything you need to know about the new program. 


After the two-week Goalazo promo that paid homage to some of the most iconic goals in soccer history, it's finally time for one of the most exciting promos of the year. TOTS honors the best-performing players from every major league in the world. EA will release full squads of boosted players from competitions like the Serie A, Premier League, and La Liga. Based on previous years, all signs pointed toward EA FC 24 starting with the Community TOTS, which is decided by a player vote.  


However, this time around, the devs introduced Team of the Season Live.

First, we’re going to tackle how to find one, then we’ll discuss what to do with it.


Places to get a Prismatic Shard in Stardew Valley


A Prismatic Shard is a rare find, but it’s not one that’s unique. Like many things in Stardew Valley, it’s usually a matter of chance to find one, but here are some places:



You’re guaranteed to find one when you first reach the top of the Volcano on Ginger Island.


There’s a chance to get one from Iridium deposits in the Volcano, Quarry, and Skull Cavern.

While visiting Massive Entertainment to be among the first to get my hands on Star Wars Outlaws, I enjoyed playing through stealth sequences, shootouts, conversations, and open-world speeder gameplay.

Thankfully, in addition to playing a chunk of Star Wars Outlaws during my time in Malmö, Sweden, I also had a chance to ask the developers how the game works once you jump into your ship and leave the planet or moon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finding the best loadout in Warzone is the only way to ensure you're winning gunfights. For some, pinpointing the right weapon is a nearly impossible task, especially if you don't own Modern Warfare 3. If you do own the previous Call of Duty installment, Modern Warfare 2, there is an SMG that's viable on the battlefield.


What is the best MW2 SMG for Warzone?


For season 3 of Warzone in the Modern Warfare 3 era, the best MW2 SMG is the FSS Hurricane. It was always a decent option, but it's currently able to compete with some of the meta options. No, it's not meta, and certainly won't beat the HRM everyone is using right now. However, it provides consistent and easy accuracy, a fast time-to-kill, and excellent mobility. 


If you don't have MW3 guns leveled up, or just want a huge change of pace from all the MW3 weapons, the FSS Hurricane is a good choice. With the newly unlockable JAK Cutthroat stock, it's a whole new gun.


Best FSS Hurricane loadout for Warzone

Building the FSS Hurricane SMG from MW2 for Warzone requires some familiar attachments and one new one. The latest unlockable aftermarket part, the JAK Cutthroat stock is essential for building the gun. Here's the best loadout right now:



Zehmn35 Compensated Flash Hider Muzzle


Schlager PEQ Box IV Laser


XRK Edge BW-4 Handstop Underbarrel


Sakin ZX Grip Rear Grip


JAK Cutthroat Stock



These attachments provide optimal mobility and decent range for an SMG. The FSS Hurricane is versatile enough to pair with a sniper if you're feeling accurate today. It also has a high headshot multiplayer, so every shot to the head will speed up the time-to-kill quickly, rewarding great aim with fast kills. Try it out and see how it feels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

Director and producer Naoki Yoshida acknowledged as much today, via a Lodestone post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision has continually attempted to one itself by creating more ambitious cosmetic items, and CoD Mobile looks like it's continuing to push the boundaries further than anyone thought was possible. 


The CoD Mobile devs introduced the MG42 as a new weapon in Season 4 and confirmed "Witch Warden" as a Mythic skin for the new LMG. Activision revealed that the weapon features an animated miniature battlefield across its body, and an exclusive song was created by the legendary composer Hans Zimmer for the camo.  


Players still have to wait before the Mythic gets added to the store, but a CoD Mobile leak provided a sneak-peek at what the miniature battlefield weapon inspection animation looks like. In the video shared, the weapon inspection animation features a fully animated cutscene depicting a short snippet of war in which a squadron falls in battle. The cutscene is accompanied by the new Hans Zimmer song, voice lines, and an animation that shows a picture of the fallen squad. CoD Mobile players were blown away that the devs were able to put all of this on a weapon for an inspection animation.




"Inspection animation got a whole cinematic Cutscene," replied one user. That isn't to say this remarkable cosmetic item doesn't come without pitfalls. The animation takes about 30 seconds to play all the way through, making you an easy target while you are staring at your weapon during a match. 


"While you're doing that, they've already killed you 50 times," a second player joked. It's unclear when Activision plans to add this cosmetic item to CoD Mobile. Season 4 recently kicked off on April 10, and the devs did not reveal in the announcement blog when this new Mythic will get added.

An exact release date hasn't been shared, but Capcom's announcement Twitter says the patch should be ready before the end of April. Although it does add these new fixes and adjustments will be added to "each platform as soon as they are ready," which may mean the patch will release at different times across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.




Regardless, the biggest inclusion is an adjustment to Dragonsplague, which has been wreaking havoc in Dragon's Dogma 2 since it causes infected Pawns to go on a killing spree and raze entire villages if left untreated. It's also very tricky to spot, and the game makes little effort to war…]]></summary>

Aventurine is a Preservation Imaginary character that acts as a damage repellant to any team he is on via his constant application of meaty shields. While protection through shielding is his primary role, uniquely, Aventurine's kit also allows him to be a very solid sub-DPS (via his follow-up attack and Ultimate) without sacrificing support effectiveness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XDefiant is back with another test session for gamers. Not only will it give you a chance to play it, but there are also some rewards for those who jump in and try the game out for themselves. Here's what you need to do to unlock them. 


The development of XDefiant has not been smooth, with delays pushing the game back from the intended Autumn 2023 release to an unconfirmed Summer 2024 launch. Before that, Ubisoft is hoping to test out the game's servers after making changes to the netcode, with the XDefiant server test session taking place on April 19. 


If you jump into this test session, here's how you can unlock special rewards throughout the weekend. 


Players who jump into the action can get free rewards. Image via Ubisoft 


XDefiant server test session rewards


There are three rewards for taking part in this XDefiant test session, and the good news is that none of them are too hard to unlock. 



MP5 Shamrock Weapon skin: Play in the XDefiant server test session.


M9 Ember Weapon Skin: Play in a party.


Three Weapon XP Boosters: Reach Level 18 in XDefiant. 



Are these rewards permanent?


Yes, all rewards earned during the XDefiant server test session are permanent. That means anything you manage to unlock this weekend will be in your inventory when the full game releases. 


How long do I have to earn these rewards?


You can only unlock these rewards during the XDefiant server test, which means you need to get them before Sunday, April 21 at 1PM ET when the servers go back offline.

That said, fans have a pretty good idea of where the show will go next based on how Season 1 ended.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Fallout 4 is far from the most beloved entry in the series, it breathed fresh and non-radioactive air into the series through Survival Mode. That's the name they gave to a difficulty setting that's not just the hardest possible in this game, but also one that brings extra setbacks. The Wasteland is never kind to visitors, but Survival Mode can make it an utter nightmare, so let's look at how to make surviving it a possibility.


Optimal stats for Survival Mode in Fallout 4


The most important stats for survival mode are Strength and Endurance, with Intelligence taking a distant third place. You can neglect pretty much every other stat to get the two main ones as high as possible. That's because, in this mode, nothing beats the ability to carry stuff, take damage, and heal up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are you all excited about the Fallout 4 next-gen update? I'd imagine many of you are. Except possibly those who have been waiting for the fan-made project Fallout: London, which has had to be delayed. And also those who are in the modding community.


Much like when Stardew Valley released its big 1.6 update, many were concerned that the changes would break a lot of mods, or at least make them incompatible. This is expected to be the case for Fallout 4 custom content after the big update rolls out.




Nexus Mods recently issued a statement about this, addressing concerns people will likely have about the possibility of broken mods.  It's expected that a lot of them will become unusable once the game gets upgraded to next-gen, but as the post itself says: some of the information is speculative until proven otherwise.


What's a vault dweller to do?


Until the patch rolls out, no one can be 100% certain which modifications are going to be compatible and which need updates of their own. Nexus Mods provides a link to a forum post, which provides information on how you can stop the next-gen update from happening on your game. The advice relates to GOG, Steam, and Xbox Game Pass (PC) versions of Fallout 4.


However, it's going to be largely up to the mod creators themselves to make sure theirs are compatible. Major ones, such as the all-important Fallout 4 Script Extender (or F4SE), are likely to be on the case, but unless teams get early access to next-gen, they might have to scramble for a solution fast once it launches.


As for when it's actually releasing, you can expect to see your copy of F4 being upgraded from April 25. The patch will not only give a boost to the game to make it look its best for the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but it's also coming with new content, including some free Creation Club items.

Remember the Indie World showcase from earlier this week? It was sweet, huh? Well, to show just how sweet it was, Nintendo has today taken to Twitter to release its regular infographic highlighting all of the titles that were featured.
Now it's true, this Indie World graphic might not be quite as stacked with icons as those that we have seen from full-fat Directs in the past (even the February Partner Direct one was beefier, if we're honest), but it's still a handy one-stop shop to see the full lineup at a glance either and we are particular fans of some of the logos on show.

Best Lockwood 680 loadout for MW3


Modern Warfare 3 is all about smaller-scale maps, compared to battle royale, so the shotgun is an excellent way to do well on them. The best loadout for the Lockwood 680 in MW3 takes full advantage of the strengths of this weapon, while also alleviating some of the weaknesses that hold it back from true greatness.…]]></summary>

It'll reduce the infection frequency of dragonsplague, which is spread when pawns mingle with other pawns online, and make the symptoms more obvious. Pawns already get glowing eyes when they're dragonsplagued - I guess they'll be all the glowier in future.

The team behind Ori and the Blind Forest – and its sequel Ori and the Will of the Wisps – has been thanking fans for quick feedback, but many will be wondering whether it's coming to other platforms.


While it's only available on Steam at the moment, there are plans to release No Rest for the Wicked on current-gen systems, including the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. There's no release date for these versions yet, but the stores for both PlayStation and Xbox do have pages for the game, with options to wishlist it.




Sadly, for anyone hoping for a PS4 or Xbox One port, it doesn't appear as though the studio is looking to release the game on these platforms.

More specifically, Bungie has clarified that a fairly substantial portion of Destiny 2: Into the Light will leave the game with the release of The Final Shape DLC early in June. According to what we now know, everything included as part of Into the Light will be effectively sunset on June 4, with only the baseline Brave weapons  — not the holo-foil ones, mind  — and the Onslaught activity itself sticking around for Year 10.

If you cast your mind back to 2021, you might remember how PowerA set out to light up our gaming lives with the Spectra controller. This officially licensed pad appeared much the same as your standard Pro Controller on the surface but it was capable of putting on an LED light show while gaming.
All in all, it was a pretty neat device, though its wired requirements kept us tethered to the TV in a way that we weren't so keen on. 'A wireless version sure would be nice,' we thought to ourselves all those years ago. 'PowerA should really get on that.'

Mostly, though, I think it’s because of my brain doing the thing where, say, you notice a yellow car on a walk and then see dozens of them. I was going to write a car make there but I don’t know any.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fabletown gang will be back, developer Telltale Games has promised in a new development update for The Wolf Among Us 2, its sequel to The Wolf Among Us it announced in 2019. This update, which reveals the studio is still hard at work on the game, arrives after an unspecified number of layoffs hit Telltale Games last October. 
"We've been quiet because we've been heads down, focusing on the promise of [The Wolf Among Us 2]," the update reads. "While we can't give a big update yet, here's a little something for you: in-progress shots from the current build. The work continues. The Fabletown gang will be back. Thanks for being fans." 
The four in-progress shots from the current build of The Wolf Among Us 2 can be viewed below: 

The Wolf Among Us 2 was originally due out last year but was delayed out of 2023 in a March update from the studio. 
For more about the game, watch The Wolf Among Us 2's official trailer, and then read about how the game's first episode will catch you up on what happened in the first game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and K-Pop singer NakedBibi, or Bibi for short, have teamed up to create a new song and music video inspired by Stellar Blade, the upcoming action game from developer ShiftUp. Stellar Blade hits PlayStation 5 exclusively next week on April 26 so this new track, appropriately titled "Eve," is coming at a perfect time to keep excitement for the game going. 
The song itself is pretty great, too, and the music video visuals are very reminiscent of Stellar Blade itself. If you're excited about the game, or a fan of NakedBibi, it's definitely worth your time. 
Check out the "Eve" Stellar Blade music video by NakedBibi for yourself below: 


If you haven't yet checked it out, there's a free Stellar Blade demo available right now on PS5 to give you a taste of what's in the final release. For more about the game, read Game Informer's exclusive interview with Stellar Blade's director for behind-the-scene details and more. After that, read about how Stellar Blade will have no microtransactions, with one exception. 
Stellar Blade hits PS5 on April 26, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's starting to feel like ConcernedApe (aka Eric Barone) may in fact be a modern day Sisiphus, destined to work on Stardew Valley forever. Following on from the mega update of 1.6 a month ago, and 1.6.3 soon after that, the hardy perennial farming game has a new 1.6.4 mini update. The key addition this time is more new layouts that will appear after you reach the bottom of the mines, and more layouts for the volcano mines too. If you've not played Stardew Valley you might wonder why there are deep mines and volcanos, and to you I say "Pah! You should play Stardew Valley."
1.6.4 also has a lot of bug fixes (including fixing disappearing pets, new pets being a key feature of 1.6) and some balance changes, as well as a host of fixes for modders and modded players. ConcernedApe said early on that 1.6 would be an update for modders, so it's nice to see that being supported. You can read the full patch notes here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Prime Video has renewed its Fallout television show for another season, confirming that Season 2 is in the works following an earlier report. This news arrives just over a week after the series' release on April 10, which premiered two days earlier than expected to rave reviews from both fans and critics. 
We loved Fallout Season 1, and you can read about why in Game Informer's Fallout review, so we're excited to revisit the wasteland with Lucy, Ghoul, Maximus, and others. As for when to expect Season 2 of Fallout, that remains unknown. The announcement simply confirms another season is coming with no details on Season 2's production.

Fallout joins a string of other hit Amazon Prime Video series currently airing on the streamer service, like The Boys (with a new season dropping June 13) and Invincible, which just had its second season wrap up. It also joins a string of other successful video game adaptations, like HBO's The Last of Us, which is getting a Season 2 next year, Peacock's Twisted Metal, Netflix's Arcane, and Netflix's Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. 
Fallout Season 1 is available to watch on Amazon Prime Video.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It'll grow on you.
Kudzu came to this reviewer during a significant birthday celebration. The day was filled with echoes of our past. There was the music on the radio – uncanny remixes of early-to-mid-90s techno songs that used to hype up pre-teen candyfloss-fuelled visits to funfairs. And there was Kudzu and its unsubtle similarity to all-time classic Zelda: Link’s Awakening in its 1993 original Game Boy iteration. It’s crazy to think that we played Link's Awakening to death now 30 years ago.
Time flies fast like an arrow from Link’s bow indeed. We started Pie for Breakfast Studios' Kudzu wondering if a new "non-linear adventure game" for the Game Boy — because it's available both on Switch as a digital download and as a physical Game Boy cart from Mega Cat Studios — was going to hold the attention of our ageing minds.

The letter, addressed to Cities fans and signed by Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen and Paradox Interactive deputy CEO Mattias Lilja, also promises refunds for anyone who bought Beach Properties. Or, in the case of those who got it through snapping up Skylines 2’s Ultimate Edition, compensation in the form of three Creator Packs and three radio stations. The contentious DLC is also going free to anyone who’s yet to put money down.

In 2021, Romi Hoshino received a three-year prison sentence after a criminal prosecution but in a subsequent civil action, the publishers hoped to recoup millions in damages. Commenting outside the Tokyo District Court on Thursday, Hoshino was clear: "I have no intention of paying anything."

Kingdom Come: Deliverance faced a rocky launch in 2018, with outlets (including Game Informer) criticizing its widespread bugs and general lack of polish, but it found success regardless, going on to sell two million copies and release a slate of DLC and updates. Six years later, Warhorse Studios is getting ready to launch a sequel and invited Game Informer to take a look at some early footage and trailers. While it's too early to speak to any performance issues, it's clear Warhorse has greatly expanded its work on the first game, and fans of the medieval ages may be in for a treat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warhorse have revealed Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, sequel to the 2018 open world action-RPG which you will likely remember for a couple of reasons: 1) its ostensibly faithful but inevitably skewed representations of race, gender and class in medieval Bohemia, which were amplified by its creative director Daniel Vávra's qualified endorsement of Gamergate, and 2) being a moderately entertaining, buggy and mucky chivalric fable in which you have to worry about keeping your sword sharp and eating food before it rots. 


Going by the announcement video, the new game is the same game but with more cash to burn. It's the work of 250 people, with Jan Valta returning as composer. According to Vávra, "what we are making now is what it was supposed to be in the beginning, but we were not able to do it because we didn't have enough resources and experience."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It ain't real, folks!
For years decades now, Banjo-Kazooie fans have been clamouring for a new entry in the dormant platforming franchise, and while 2008's Nuts & Bolts was certainly likeable in its own way, there's just no escaping that niggling thought in the back of our minds: we need 'Banjo-Threeie'.
We're not sure what Microsoft is planning to do with the Banjo-Kazooie franchise (if anything), but YouTube channel Project Dream has given us a rather lovely treat in the form of a fan-made trailer for the hypothetical sequel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jack Black seems to have more or less confirmed his rumored role as Steve in the upcoming Minecraft movie. 
The actor took to Instagram on Tuesday to post a short video of himself on a film lot observing a rainbow before entering a trailer labeled “Steve, Minecraft.” The interior features promotional art of Steve as the actor smiles at the camera. 
A report in January stated Black would be voicing Minecraft’s mascot but had not been officially confirmed by the film’s production companies, Warner Bros. and Legendary. Although this technically isn’t an official announcement either, I'd say there's roughly a 99.99 percent chance that Black is involved.
The Minecraft movie, which has been in development in some form or another since 2014, is directed by Nacho Libre director Jared Hess. The cast includes Jason Momoa (Aquaman, Game of Thrones), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), Jennifer Coolidge (The White Lotus, American Pie), and Emma Myers (Wednesday). Minecraft is scheduled to hit theaters on April 4, 2025. 
Jack Black is obviously no stranger to video game movies. He voiced Bowser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie and portrays Claptrap in the upcoming Borderlands.]]></summary>

It's time for your latest look at the Japanese game charts from Famitsu (via Gematsu) and after three weeks of ruling over the competition, Princess Peach: Showtime! has finally been knocked off the top spot.
It's a new Japan-only visual novel, Utakata no Uchronia, that takes the crown this week with a debut of 11,553 sales. This romance story has shot to the top of the charts, followed closely by Mario Kart 8 Deluxe which speeds into second — as it approaches its seventh birthday, no less. All this pushes Nintendo's latest down to third.

Now, the general consensus as to why it was delisted is that the publishing rights to the game had reverted from Nintendo back to Square Enix in December 2023, but this hasn't been confirmed by either Nintendo or Square Enix. Regardless, it's back now, so if you're thinking of picking it up, then you can - hooray!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The problem with deciding to play every single Nancy Drew mystery puzzle game for a column is that, because they have been coming out since the 90s, Her Interactive have built up enough steam that I may never catch up to the front of the plucky citizen detective train. They have today announced a release date of May 7th for Nancy Drew: Mystery Of The Seven Keys, along with the official trailer.
This time Our Nance is heading to Prague, for a sort of old-world-meets-new story about hacking, medieval myths, and a stolen necklace. Nancy is hired to find said heirloom, and interview a bunch of suspects, one of whom is creepy puppet guy up there (there are no screens of Nancy because she never actually steps out from behind the camera in these games; she may as well be a cryptid). I realise this may not be of interest to regular readers of this site, but while I may not have seven keys, I do have one to the back end of this website, so nobody can stop me.

Apple's latest update for iOS on iPhone has enabled something that the company would have most certainly preferred to keep under lock and key: the ability to download apps from outside the official App Store.
The change is a result of the Digital Markets Act in the EU, which is intended to enforce a fairer digital economy with better competition, although Apple has been staunchly against opening up its ecosystem for years. Currently, this change is only applicable in Europe, but it's possible that other global regions may follow suit at a later date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friends, I have officially discovered another game I can play with my life partner, who regards most games with enormous suspicion and fatigue. That game is Morels: The Hunt 2, released this week, and as you might guess, it is about finding and identifying various species of mushroom in lush, photorealistic wilderness locations. There are also unicorns, crystal skulls and robot parts. Slightly confused by the unicorns, crystal skulls and robot parts, if I'm honest. It feels a bit like developers Abrams Studios are unconvinced as to the popular appeal of mushroom hunting, and have garlanded the concept with random mythology so as to widen the Venn diagram overlap between "fungi fans" and "people who want to live in cyberpunk Narnia".

Let me try to pack the premise, at least, into a clean paragraph: you are the Watcher, a clone of the immortal ALLMOTHER, who herself is the sole survivor of a disease spread by the arrival of enormous aliens, the Occupants. The ALLMOTHER's many clones reside in an underground bunker, the Orchard, while their deified parent fights the Occupants elsewhere. Your job within the Orchard’s theocratic hierarchy is to relive and interpret the ALLMOTHER's memories of life before the fall, a thousand years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The surreal pop synth of Sayonara Wild Hearts may have been the game that put Swedish developer Simogo on the map for PC players, but for me their earlier iOS puzzler Device 6 stands in my memory as being one of the most distinctive video games I've played. An interactive mystery novel at its heart, Device 6 took full advantage of its mobile-based hardware, asking players to turn and rotate their device to read certain lines of text, and scroll through its chapters searching for audio visual clues to solve its puzzles. I've often lamented that it never made its way to other platforms, even though part of its magic is inherently tied to physicality of its tactile origins.
Happily, after playing a few hours of Simogo's latest game, Lorelei And The Laser Eyes it's clear this equally classy detective story shares much of the same DNA as Device 6. It has the same love of riddles and mysterious, cryptic puzzles, only now they're writ large in a fully explorable 3D setting - a monochrome and maze-like hotel belonging to a reclusive artist. But Simogo's love of text hasn't been diminished in the process. Early on you find an instruction manual for Lorelei And The Laser Eyes within the game itself, which straight away tells you to have a pen and paper nearby to help solve its numerous conundrums. Heck, publishers Annapurna Interactive even sent me a full-blown notebook in the post just to hammer it home. They're not kidding, either. Even the opening section of the game had me scribbling down names, sums and symbols, much like Tunic, Return Of The Obra Dinn and Outer Wilds did before it. Which is just as well, really, as I'll definitely be needing some reminders when I come to play the full version on May 16th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I briefly posted about this in The Maw, but was unsure at that point if SteamWorld Heist 2 was coming to PC day and date with the launch on Switch. That date is August 8th, by the way, and the answer is: yes it is! Though it was revealed at Nintendo's Indie World Showcase earlier this afternoon, strategy action-adventure-with-robots sequel SteamWorld Heist 2 isn't a timed platform exclusive, so that's fun!
SteamWorld Heist 2 is, if you hadn't guessed, a sequel to SteamWorld Heist, which came to PC in 2016. The first was a side-on tactics game where you, leading a team of robots, shot teams of other (bad) robots in turn-based skill-heavy tactical battles. While that all took place in space, the sequel has achieved splashdown, and you'll be chuntering about the seas with a new lead character (Captain Leeway) and a new bunch of crewmates. It's a robot pirate game, in other words.

The studio nailed the tone of Peter, Miles, and their supporting cast, but it was the care put into the rest of the universe that makes Insomniac's universe stand apart. Yes, the Easter eggs and references to heroes like Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Black Panther, and more make this feel like an established universe full of superheroes, but Insomniac took things to the next level with its rogues' gallery. 
As a longtime Spider-Man and Marvel fan, I've delighted in watching my favorite villains – and those I rarely think of – pop up throughout the multi-game journey. Check out all the villains in Insomniac's Spider-Man universe below, and…]]></summary>

You have to spend a bit to get the top performance, especially now with memory manufacturers slowing production and SSD makers offering fewer discounts as a result. Fortunately, the 2TB T500 does have a decent discount going at the moment, worth $51:
The T500 takes the title of best high-end PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD for gaming in the RPS best SSDs for gaming guide, and boasts ridiculous sequential speeds of up to 7400MB/s and 7000MB/s for read and writes respectively.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years before she worked on top-drawer point-and-clickers Return To Monkey Island and Thimbleweed Park, Australian game developer Jenn Sandercock was a junior designer on Team Bondi's historical open world game L.A. Noire. Eventually published by Grand Theft Auto developers Rockstar in 2011, L.A. Noire took seven years to make and is an especially notorious example of crunch culture and mismanagement. Sandercock joined in the middle of one such crunch period, and wanted to make life a little easier for her exhausted colleagues. "Everyone looked so miserable after literally years of hard work & crunch," she wrote on Twitter in 2018. "So late one night after work I baked 2 cakes for the office. I sent out a mass email & we all took 30 minutes to eat cake and talk." Sandercock began hosting weekly "Cake Days", baking a fresh batch in her own time to share around the office.


Rockstar were unimpressed, however. They thought Cake Day was evidence of poor productivity and, according to Sandercock, badgered Team Bondi leadership into forcing her to only share cake during official lunch hours. "Apparently the higher ups thought our entire office slacked off ALL the time because we had cake once a week," Sandercock wrote. She herself was told "that I was jeopardising my career". Sandercock hasn't let the demise of Cake Day cramp her creative interest in food, however. In fact, she's found a way to combine baking with game design. Sandercock is now the author of Edible Games, a book of recipes and instructions for concocting games out of food, and food out of games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With huge winter game releases behind us and huge summer announcements right around the corner, the games industry is set for a relatively quiet month or two. Luckily, Nintendo plans to briefly step in to fill that void. Today, it announced the next Indie World Showcase, a live stream event focused on the latest indie titles to come to the Switch, for tomorrow, April 17. The showcase will air at 7 AM PT/10 AM ET and last for around 20 minutes.
New #IndieWorld Showcase incoming! 💡

Tune in tomorrow, 4/17 at 7am PT for roughly 20 minutes of announcements and updates on indie games headed to #NintendoSwitch in 2024.

Watch live here: https://t.co/jGiccyBhME pic.twitter.com/V31Dfuxs0N
April 16, 2024
It's in the name so it might be obvious to some, but don't expect any first-party games or hardware announcements out of this event. An Indie World Showcase is also not the same thing as a Nintendo Partner Showcase, which is just a show about third party games. This can include indie titles (the last one had a trailer for Another Crab's Treasure, for example) but also includes larger developers, like Sega or Atlus.
If that's confusing, you can get a sense of the games that have been showcased in this type of presentation in the past by visiting the official Indie World site. Fans will most likely be clamoring for a trailer or release date for Hollow Knight: Silksong, the sequel to the 2017 bug-themed Metroidvania. But while it's (hopefully) right around the corner, there's no specific reason to believe it will appear at this event other than the fact that it's an indie game coming to the Switch.
We won't know until the Indie World Showcase properly airs tomorrow. When it does, you can watch it right here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a mild-to-moderate outcry, Ubisoft have clarified that queasy worm gangster Jabba The Hutt isn't, in fact, a Star Wars Outlaws special edition or season pass exclusive. The apparently much-beloved star slug will appear in every edition of the game, but if you scrape together the credits for the Gold or Ultimate Editions, you'll get access to a Jabba's Gambit mission as part of the game's season pass. 


It's a timely clarification, because I've just checked on Xitter and yes, #Jabbagate has been trending... in reference to unflattering photos of Donald Trump in 2016. And also, Steven Gerrard in 2020. And... Wrestlemania in 2017? Jabba is quite the meme these days, it seems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Set in 1975 on an oil rig in the Scottish North Sea, horror game Still Wakes The Deep is less about supernatural events, and more about the people who experience them. Here, that’s Scottish electrician Caz McLeary and the crew of the Beira D rig. In bringing the rig to life, The Chinese Room turned to archival footage, oil and gas legislation, blueprints, and photographs. For lead designer Rob McLachlan, though, it was conversations with former platform workers that painted the clearest picture of what life on the rigs was really like.

A new early access release trailer highlights said fights, alongside the devs saying that there's going to be no microtransactions, no always-online requirement, and no anti-cheat software bundled in. I don't want to speak too soon, but so far, it looks like we're onto something pretty darn good here.

Do these brazen publishers and developers not know that this, the year 2024, is the Year of Shadow the Hedgehog?
Sega said as much only a few days ago. They've announced a series of fan celebrations for Sonic Adventure 2's Ultimate Lifeform, beginning in the traditional style with a Shadow-themed MotoGP bike and an associated LEGO tie-in. And now, the earth quakes underfoot as we learn via The Hollywood Reporter that Keanu Reeves, forgotten star of 90s romantic drama A Walk in the Clouds and also those recent John Wick films, will play Shadow in the forthcoming movie adaptation Sonic 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remain the least qualified person alive to appraise Manor Lords an actual strategy game – my village stewardship is proving inept, even by medieval posho standards – but I have delayed economic and social ruin long enough to know it runs well on the Steam Deck. Just as it’s smooth low-end performer on desktops, Manor Lords can easily keep its head above 30fps in handheld mode, and that’s usually more like 40-45fps with the right visual settings.
Still, there’s scope for it to become a much more Deck-friendly game, if not by its April 26th release date then hopefully at least during its early access phase. Faster performance would be nice, sure, but what this citybuilder-meets-RTS-battler really needs for optimal portability is a more refined set of controls.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I sort of reject that the Fallout TV show has Easter eggs hidden in it because it, as a whole, is the equivalent of one of those fancy Hotel Chocolat ostrich-sized patisserie collection bastards that cost 40 quid. However. Eagle-eyed viewers of the Fallout show noted that episode 6 gives you a number for Valt-Tec that you can actually get in touch with - 213-25-VAULT (or, 213-258-2858). Charges apply, as well as international codes if you're outside the US, which makes it 001-213-258-2858. 
If you text the number you get a reply from Vault-Tec saying "The next available appointment is 33 weeks from now, please stand by!" (handily captured by X user FanaticalGuy cos my response hasn't come through yet). And then the significantly less immersive "Reply Y to get recurring marketing and other texts from FallOut", which is quite funny. There is speculation that this is just a reference to Vault 33, the vault where main character Lucy was born and raised. On the other hand, 33 weeks from now is November, the month when both Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 came out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keanu Reeves is joining the cast of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, according to a report by The Hollywood Reporter (and first broken by The John Campea Show). The outlet’s sources report that the John Wick and Matrix star is voicing Shadow the Hedgehog.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is set to premiere on December 20 and will pit Shadow alongside a returning Dr. Robotnik (played by Jim Carrey) against Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. The returning cast includes Ben Schwartz, Idris Elba, James Marsden, and Colleen O'Shaughnessey. The film's first trailer premiered in front of a select audience at Cinemacon in Las Vegas last week and it provided the first real look at Shadow. Unfortunately, the trailer has yet to be publically released. 
Paramount has yet to officially confirm Reeves' casting, but if this is true, he will join fellow new cast members, including Krysten Ritter, Alyla Browne, James Wolk, Sofia Pernas, Cristo Fernández, and Jorma Taccone. Shadow's debut was teased at the end of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, but his voice performer has been a tantalizing mystery since the third film was announced in August 2022. 
Meanwhile, the standalone Knuckles series premieres on Paramount Plus on April 26. You can watch the first full-length trailer for that here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV’s next expansion, Dawntrail, arrives this summer alongside the game’s first graphical update. As such, Square Enix has released a new benchmark software to let PC players test how well their machines will handle these new bells and whistles while getting a small head start on Dawntrail.
Available as a free download for Windows, the benchmark software uses playable characters and actual maps to assign a performance score to your PC. This will provide a peek at the new graphical update, which spruces up the game with enhanced textures, shadows, material qualities, and other elements. You can download the benchmark here. 
The benchmark includes a character creator for players to craft a fresh hero ahead of Dawntrail’s launch. It also includes access to the new female Hrothgar race. Existing characters can also be imported into the benchmark, and the appearance data from these characters can be imported into the full release of Dawntrail on Windows. 
Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail launches on July 2. You can learn more about the expansion here. The game currently has a crossover event with Final Fantasy XVI that runs until May 8]]></summary>

Early in conversations, Lucasfilm Games and developer Massive Entertainment agreed that telling a scoundrel story was the way to go. Through these discussions, Massive decided it wanted to portray a "resourceful underdog" for its main character rather than the trained soldiers that star in The Division.

Version 50 brings a new map and some new creatures to contend with, alongside some changes that make being a shovel-wielding monster-slayer or speedrunning the game a bit less easy.

The reason? Fallout 4’s long-in-the-works next-gen update is now due to drop just two days after London’s planned launch date, which its fan devs say will “simply break” the ambitious project.

Marxist policy choices mean the faction are now protesting in my coal mines, shutting down a vital heat pipeline and fomenting further dissent among the now freezing broader populace. It is, regrettably, time to talk. They want me to pass the Apex Workers decree, a darwinian shift towards culling the weak while enhancing the strong. That’ll mean a tasty increase to production efficiency, so I’m not complaining - but the Technocrats will, so the vote won’t pass unless I can persuade the Machinists, their less extreme cousins, to support the bill. Not to worry: I promise the Machinists they can choose the next law we vote on, and watch a chunk of undecided voters shift towards implied eugenics.
The Frostpunk 2 beta has rammed home how different my role is to Frostpunk 1’s dictator. I’m more of a smooth talkin’, palm-greasin’ mayor tasked with keeping a dozen ideologically-opposed plates spinning above a city that could be one harsh blizzard from disaster. I like it, even though at times this jaunt to the a-popsicle-ypse can feel less like solving a crunchy puzzle and more like wading through politics soup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite currently being in the midst of a crossover event with Avatar: The Last Airbender, Fortnite is teasing an upcoming event with a returning collaborator: Star Wars. The details have yet to be disclosed, but attentive fans of the science fiction juggernaut will notice something about the start date right away. The event is set to take place on Friday, May 3. The following day, May 4th, is known to many as Star Wars Day.
We have a good feeling about this...Star Wars is returning to #Fortnite. pic.twitter.com/6MCkDkolNb
April 15, 2024
The most newsworthy piece of info here, however, is the fact that the teaser indicates collaborations across several of Fortnite's new modes. This includes the classic battle Royale mode, the survival/crafting Lego mode, and the rhythm Festival mode, though Rocket Racing was notably excluded. Crossovers between Fortnite and other IPs usually just include cosmetic bundles, but this seems to imply that it will provide content for three different areas of the game.
The current Elements event pass technically includes a Lego variant skin as well as a guitar for Festival mode, so this Star Wars event could be as simple as that, but it's not unreasonable to speculate that Star Wars is a big enough property to warrant a larger scale crossover event. That said, this is just speculation.
Previous Star Wars crossovers included a Darth Vader boss battle, lightsabers, blasters, and force abilities, as well as a huge roster of skins spanning the movies and shows. Most recently, Ahsoka joined the fray as a part of the Chapter 4 Season 4 battle pass. 
If you're interested in more Star Wars video games, you're in luck – we just launched our latest cover story, which features an exclusive look at Star Wars Outlaws. We've also got a hands-on preview, a video interview with the developers, and an entire hub devoted to this month's coverage of the game.

LawBreakers was the first game from Boss Key Productions, a studio co-founded by Gears Of Wars lead designer Cliff Bleszinski, and it had delightful ultraviolence beneath its uninspiring genric look. Alas, it did not sell well. Boss Key closed less than a year after launch, and the game soon followed. But after years of work, a group of fans this weekend successfully ran the first public test for a workaround to play the game again. While there's no clear launch plan yet, more playtesting will follow.

I've been on the Goggins hype train for over a decade at this point, and it's great that - oh sorry, I'm being told that the Fallout TV show is in fact about Bethesda's post-nukepocalypse RPG series of video games, and as such has given a massive player bump to said video games on Steam.
Posted on Xitter by SteamDB yesterday (HT to our pals at Eurogamer), it appears Fallout has more than doubled its concurrent players on Steam since the show dumped all its episodes last week.

I played the Steam demo for Ants Took My Eyeball (which is a 2D action roguelite where you go into an anthill to fight ants, who took your eyeball) and I very much liked the design, weapons and idea, but not the controls so much. Not my cup of tea, but have a go of the demo. But you know what got me to play an action platformer roguelite when those games aren't really my cup of tea? That godamn name is what!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 2017 low-gravity hero shooter LawBreakers is coming back from the dead. However, this isn’t an official revival but rather due to the work of a dedicated group of fans.
LawBreakers was created by Boss Key Productions, a team led by Gears of War lead designer Cliff Bleszinski. Upon launching for PlayStation 4 and PC in August 2017, it garnered a generally positive critical impression (read our review here). However, it failed to find its place in the competitive multiplayer shooter market of the time, resulting in poor sales and low player engagement that eventually led to its early demise in September 2018. 
Now, a team of passionate fans has worked to bring LawBreakers back. Dubbed The RELB Project, the project has been in the works since at least 2020. Its FAQ states that “This is a project to bring back the game LawBreakers, it's done by creating 'fake' servers that the original game client uses. You can join by downloading the launcher, patching your game and playing like normal.”
RELB’s website allows you to download the launcher. Despite this revival being an unofficial project, Cliff Bleszinki (who has been vocal about wanting to see LawBreakers come back) has given it his blessing and enthusiastically shared RELB’s Discord on Saturday. 
Somehow LawBreakers is coming back, see below!!!
https://t.co/1COV57FZQ5
April 13, 2024
The RELB Project is still very much a work in progress, but the team held its first series of public playtests this past weekend. Although several modes and features from the game were disabled, these sessions appear to have been largely successful. The next playtest has not been scheduled, and the team is currently seeking more developers.
What did you think of LawBreakers and are you excited to see it playable again? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/faq/2024/04/13/what-is-the-difference-between-roguelike-and-rogue-lite"/>
        <updated>2024-04-13T20:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rogue-lite and roguelike genres have been growing in popularity over the years They’re challenging games where players attempt runs with different abilities and random elements that generally force the player to restart from zero or near-zero for each attempt. They are born from the 1980 game Rogue which established many of the mechanics now considered staples of the genre.
But the difference between rogue-lite and -like has always been confusing, so we asked an expert from Evil Empire, the co-developer of Dead Cells, to explain it to us. Lucie Dewagnier is the game director of the upcoming The Rogue: Prince of Persia (a rogue-lite) and defines the subgenres like this.
“Roguelike is – like the game Rogue – a game where you play, you die, you hit replay, but nothing is kept between your attempts. You will always replay the game from a blank slate. 
Rogue-lite may add some things like permanent upgrades and enhancements that make your future runs – your future tries – easier and has progression systems that do not exist in roguelikes.”
My hope, and I presented this plan to Dewagnier, is we drop the -lite and -like suffixes from the genre name and just refer to all games as existing within the Rogue genre. Dead Cells, Hades, Undermine, Returnal, etc. are no longer variations of rogue-lites and roguelikes – they’re all Rogue games.
“Yeah, even now there are games like Spelunky that are part of Rogulikes, but they have progression systems with new content you can get, so maybe it’s rogue-lite? Maybe it’s Roguelike? They’re Rogues.”
To read more about Evil Empire and Dewagnier’s next game, The Rogue: Prince of Persia (which is a rogue-lite, “With a ‘T’,” Dewagnier says), head here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet series rolls on with the latest expansion. This newest set, Temporal Forces, continues the Ancient and Future conventions introduced in Paradox Rift, giving players new strategies featuring a variety of easily playable Basic Pokémon. 
The Pokémon Company sent along a bunch of booster packs for us to open to see what we could pull. The set is one of the smaller recent expansions, but still large by the long-established standard of Pokémon TCG. Players picking up Temporal Forces can expect to pull from a pool of more than 160 cards. In addition to the additional Ancient and Future Pokémon, Temporal Forces reintroduces Ace Spec cards, first implemented during the Black & White series of cards. Those Ace Spec cards were some of the more unique cards I pulled, but the full-art Pokémon and ex cards most wowed me; I particularly love the Arbok and Minccio full-arts I grabbed. 
Check out my favorites I pulled from Pokémon Trading Card Game's Scarlet & Violet – Temporal Forces expansion below!

 Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Temporal Forces is available now. For more Pokémon TCG content, including galleries of past expansions, interviews, and the latest news, visit our hub by clicking the banner below.]]></summary>

But Pac-Man Mega Tunnel Battle apparently came out on Google Stadia - ah, that’d be why - back in 2020, and served up a massively (or at least medium-ly) multiplayer spin on the arcade classic. With Stadia dead and buried, Mega Tunnel Battle is chewing its way out of the streaming console’s grave with a new subtitle and a fresh Steam release next month.

True, their size and layout defy explanation - what is this, a swimming pool for Slender Men? - but look, there are cute covered slides you can ride down in first-person. You know, like the ones you used to enjoy as a kid. Always that element of anxiety though about getting stuck halfway down, am I right?

It is, as it appears, an unabashed homage to Castlevania, but with none of the -vania, making it much more like the original (or the game boy ones, and possibly a few others in the series I don't know about): a straightforward, linear platform game about whipping monsters and not stepping on spikes. Ten a penny, right? But CNSBL captures it so well that it had me looking up old game boy tunes it vaguely reminded me of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch Online’s Super Nintendo catalog is three games larger today thanks to the additions of Super R-Type, Wrecking Crew ‘98, and Amazing Hebereke.


Super R-Type is a side-scrolling sci-fi shooter launched in 1991, and it’s essentially an enhanced port of the arcade game R-Type II. It includes elements from that game while featuring new stages and enemies of its own.  
Wrecking Crew ‘98 is the Japan-only sequel to the NES classic Wrecking Crew. First released in 1998 for Nintendo Power’s download service before getting its own cartridge, this marks the game’s first release in the West.
Amazing Hebereke is a 1994 fighting game by Sunsoft that pits up to four players battling to knock each other out. The game is a spin-off of the Hebereke series (known here as Uforia: The Saga, of which its long-awaited sequel recently launched).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the Triple-i Initiative earlier this week, Gearbox Publishing and developer Wabisabi Games unveiled RKGK. Sporting an eye-popping art direction that blends anime and graffiti art influences, this promising-looking action platformer is coming this year.
RKGK (pronounced “Rakugaki”) unfolds in a Cap City, a futuristic metropolis caught in a vice grip by the oppressive B Corp led by the villainous Mr. Buff. The plot centers on rebellious graffiti artist Valah, who rages against this machine by using her art to bring life back to the city and inspire its citizens to stand up and rebel.


Valah gets around by using her graffiti paint to stylishly grind on rails while chaining jumps, dashes, and glides. She also has appears to have her own drone to soar across the cityscape. High-speed platforming is the name of the game, and maintaining a smooth flow state sends her into Defacer mode, transforming the world into a dreamy animated version of itself. Although the trailer doesn’t show off gameplay, it depicts Valah spraying paint to destroy B Corps’ robotic minions. You’ll also be able to create graffiti art using an array of paint and cosmetic tools. Check out the screenshots below for an in-game look at RKGK. 

RKGK is Wabisabi Games’ debut title and looks to follow in the graffiti-soaked dystopian future footsteps of games like Jet Set Radio and Marc Ecko’s Getting Up (remember that?). It’s coming to PC later this year.]]></summary>

As an early access game, no less.
Having dug into the latest build’s GPU performance and graphics settings, I have found a few loose strands of technical flax that Manor Lords could do with snipping away. Yet it’s generally in good shape, both for early access and a solo developer project, successfully balancing strong visuals with relatively light hardware demands that should help it run on older PCs (or handhelds like the Steam Deck). Several hours in, the ugliest things I’ve seen are my road layouts.

This you pulverise, in a downward direction, with the aim of finding a huge chest of gems at the bottom somewhere. Your drill is the machine gun on your ship, your efforts governed by about two minutes worth of depleting fuel and a hull that can take three hits total. It's cyberpunk by Gimli.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like co-op shooter Remnant 2, because it doesn't pretend to be much more than what it is: a dodgerollathon where, in between dodge rolls, you fill demons with bullets. I've been meaning to go back to it, so it's convenient that there's more DLC arriving soon. Dubbed The Forgotten Kingdom, it adds a new Invoker archetype, fleshes out an existing jungle biome, and introduces more gear, more monsters, and the like. Yes, count me in.

The update is slated for this month, April 25th. A new quest, “Echoes of the Past,” sees you going up against the Enclave. Alongside this are new workshop items including previously released Creation Club content, such as Enclave uniforms, weapons and armor skins, new power armour, a Tesla Cannon, and a Heavy incinerator.

The samurai epic, which tells a fictional story within a historical Japanese period of revolution, is one of the studio’s most ambitious titles from both game design and story perspectives. We got the opportunity to sit down with producer Yosuke Hayashi and director Fumihiko Yasuda to probe into how Rise of the Rōnin got made.
One aspect of the game that sets it apart from other Team Ninja titles is the monsters or demonic enemies that pervade its other games are nowhere to be seen in Rise of the Rōnin. Being set against a historical backdrop, Rōnin is limited just to human enemies of various fighting styles.

It’s anyone’s guess what Warhorse has in store, but there’s a solid chance the new game is a Kingdom Come sequel. Despite receiving mixed reviews at launch, it has gained a passionate following, and it was ported to Switch last month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sketchy Fables is a hand-drawn, first-person adventure created by solo developer Alle Jong using 10,000 drawings. And it's something you simply have to see, whether you're interested in first-person exploration games or not, because it's a sight to behold. 
As someone who cannot draw, I'm always fascinated (and impressed) with people who can. That Jong was able to create an entire game using 10,000 drawings is all the more fascinating, and if the trailer below is any indication, it's a game I can't wait to check out. 
Watch the Sketchy Fables gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


There's not much more information to find about the game. Its Steam description reads, "Sketchy Fables is a first-person exploration adventure." Diving into the details of the Steam listing, Jong says it plays like an interactive cartoon and features a diverse game environment to explore full of villages and rural landscapes. 
It's also "focused on personal exploration with many random encounters and discoveries," according to the page. 

As for when Sketchy Fables hits PC, that remains unknown, but it's a game we're keeping our eyes on so hopefully we'll have more to share sooner than later.

But it's The Troop that grabbed me most. It's a little surprising, given its modest look, and the stiff competition. I think what clinched it is that The Troop has revealed to me something that I already sort of knew, but hadn't quite caught hold of: that a tank warfare game is all about the pause.

What's going on? Is chasing trends a bit of a risky click? Should Age Of Empires II get a battle royale mode? All these questions and no more, just these ones, are discussed in this week's episode of the Electronic Wireless Show podcast.

Picture it: the post-apocalyptic America of Fallout, radroaches and stimpacks and all, except that this being a TV adaptation, the first hour doesn't consist entirely of trying to persuade Bethesda's face editor not to make your character look like their soul has been sucked out. Instead, you can kick back with a can of Nuka Cola and watch flesh-and-blood stars Ella Purnell, Walton Goggins and Aaron Moten rove the wasteland. I caught the first couple of episodes last week, and while I find the show's aesthetics off-putting - it's kind of a Fallout themepark, rather than a convincing world - I do think there's the makings of a fun tale here.

In particular, the thorny issue of whether The Pirate Bay should be blocked in the Netherlands, dragged on for years. But now, as BREIN continues its battle against pirate IPTV providers, the ISPs' sales of bundled TV services are also feeling the squeeze. Suddenly, all three agree; something more substantial is required to counter the growth of pirate IPTV.

However, EA has denied Grubb's reporting, telling IGN, "We don't normally comment on rumors but there is no validity to this story." 
On Giant Bomb's Game Mess Mornings show, Grubb said, "They were working on it, they were working on Dead Space 2 and they are no longer working on it. It is on the shelf because the first game had lackluster sales, is how it was phrased to me."
He continues, adding, "As it stands right now, they were working on it; it was in the concepting phase...pre-production, and now that work has been put on the shelf."

Dubbed V Rising: Legacy of Castlevania, this DLC includes new cosmetics that allow you to take on the aesthetics of hair, clothing, and forms of Konami's Castlevania franchise, and it will give players the chance to fight Simon Belmont, too. 
As for what to expect, the Legacy of Castlevania Premium Pack will give players Alucard's Cloak, Alucard's Coat, Alucard's Leggings, Alucard's Gloves, and Alucard's Boots. "The complete set can be crafted in-game when you unlock the tailor bench," the DLC's Steam description reads. "It costs cloth and coarse thread to make and is purely cosmetic. Using the new armor customization feature, you can don the garb of the Vampire Prince at any level of your vampire journey." 
Check out the V Rising: Legacy of Castlevania Premium Pack DLC trailer for yourself below: 


We learned last month that V Rising is coming to PS5 later this year, and according to the trailer above, the Legacy of Castlevania DLC will be available on the platform when the base game launches on it.

Pocketpair briefly pulled back the curtains on Palworld Arena during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase, which is where we saw some of the gameplay from the arena in action. 
If the trailer is any indication, it appears to support splitscreen co-op and gives players the chance to fight head-to-head in an arena to see whose party of Pals is the strongest. 
Check it out for yourself in the Palworld Arena trailer below: 


"The Pal Arena makes its way to Palworld in 2024," the trailer's description reads. "Battle against other players, pitting both yourself and your pals against them. Train the strongest Pals and defeat all your rivals." 
That's all we know about the Palworld Arena, but since it's arriving this year, we might not have to wait too much longer to learn more. 
In the meantime, catch up on all things Palworld with Game Informer's Palworld primer, and then read about the latest update, which added the first Raid boss to the game alongside additional Pal and base changes, and more.

When I had the chance to go hands-on with The Rogue: Prince of Persia, I had only watched the credits roll on Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown a few nights ago. Before that, the last time I watched credits roll on a new Prince of Persia game was in 2010 with The Forgotten Sands. I was surprised and happy to play a new excellent Prince of Persia game this year, but considering how long I had to wait for that one, I was not holding my breath for another – not even the Sands of Time remake I have been patiently waiting for.
Which is to say it was incredibly surprising when Ubisoft reached out about its new Prince of Persia rogue-lite. It’s not a mode in Lost Crown or a spinoff, as I initiall…]]></summary>

The game comes from developer Evil Empire, the co-developer of Dead Cells, and the lineage shows.

Released during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase, this new Mouse gameplay trailer highlights the grappling hook, helicopter, and Spinach power-up. 
As you might expect, the grappling hook allows players to target designated points in a level for rapid movement and traversal. The helicopter adds vertical traversal to players' arsenal with reduced descent speed, and finally, the Spinach power-up augments and enhances melee combat (in a nod to Popeye). 
Check out the latest Mouse gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


"Mouse is incredibly important to all of us here at Fumi Games, and we're committed to making sure that it lives up to all of the expectations," Fumi Games CEO Mateusz Michalak writes in a press release. "Our goal has always been to create a game that combines our passion for animation with our passion for first-person shooters. We are genuinely committed to collaborating closely with the Mouse community to craft a game that truly resonates with players. 
"We'll aim to share more details – whenever possible – as development progresses. Our partnership with PlaySide and our dedicated and talented team is working hard to bring you the finest grandboomer cartoon shooter ever created." 
Here are some new screenshots from Mouse for your viewing: 

Mouse was revealed back in 2023; it's due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC in 2025.

As you can see, Operation Guns looks like an exciting boost of weaponry, characters, enemies, and more to Vampire Survivors.

Revealed with a gameplay trailer during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase, Kill Knight plunges players into an Eldritch abyss of horrors where waves of enemies stand in the way of their one goal: kill the last angel. 
"Once a loyal knight, betrayed, and banished to the Abyss," a press release for Kill Knight reads. "A desecrated corpse inside reanimated armor. You rise to an eternal death. Branded Kill Knight, you have one purpose – kill the last angel. Players must learn to exploit enemy weaknesses, enact brutal executions, and weave through the Knight's Arsenal to tactically manage resources as they dance with death in the Abyss and take the fight to global leaderboards against friends and foes alike." 
Check out the Kill Knight reveal trailer for yourself below: 


In Kill Knight, players are challenged to master the demon within as they descend through the voids of an eldritch arena and harness a devastating arsenal of armor and weapons against swarms of otherworldly horrors. As you can see in the trailer above, Kill Knight features fast and visceral top-down arcade-action combat with a disgustingly horrific otherworld to traverse through. There are five fatal layers to get through, each more deadly than the last, according to PlaySide Studios. 
As you survive waves of enemies, your Kill Power will increase, which in turn increases your speed and damage. Plus, there are plenty of challenges to unlock your Knight's Arsenal "and evolve your playstyle." In Master Mode, all five layers become one extended arena, and you can track your skill on a global leaderboard, too. 
Here are some Kill Knight screenshots for your viewing:

        <updated>2024-04-10T17:14:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Danish developer Northplay and publisher Ghost Ship Publishing have revealed Dinolords, a medieval real-time strategy game where you fight Vikings and defend your lands alongside dinosaurs and more. In a new teaser trailer published during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase, we get glimpses of dino-powered armies, action RPG combat mixed with real-time strategy, and more. 
"We're honored to be showcasing our brand new trailer thanks to the Triple-i Initiative amongst so many incredible games and developers that make up the amazing indie corner of the games industry," Northplay CEO Michael Flarup writes in a press release. "We've poured a lot of love into Dinolords and we can't wait for players to get their hands on it when it launches into Early Access next year." 
Check out the new Dinolords reveal trailer for yourself below: 


Northplay says while mixing real-time strategy with action RPG gameplay, players will also have to gather resources, build cities, construct fortifications, and command units in widescale medieval warfare. 
Dinolords takes place in an alternate history in which the King of Denmark launches the first dinosaur-powered conflict with his invasion of England, according to a press release. Players take on the role of an English Lord, defending their land against the ferocious invaders and taming their own primeval beasts for battle.
Here are some Dinolords screenshots for your viewing: 

Dinolords is set to hit Early Access in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Wētā Workshop and publisher Private Division have announced the first trailer for Tales of the Shire, the cozy Middle-earth/Lords of the Rings-inspired game announced last year, is coming later this month. More specifically, we'll finally get a good look at the Shire in the new trailer on April 22. 
Attention, dear Hobbits! Mark your calendars for our #TalesoftheShire trailer on April 22! pic.twitter.com/aZXvmR8qUs
April 10, 2024
As for what to expect, Wētā Workshop has shared little about the game beyond its initial reveal teaser. We know the game promises to let players live their best cozy Hobbit lives, and that sounds great on its own, but we're excited to see what that entails from a gameplay perspective. If I had to guess, Tales of the Shire will fall somewhere between a life sim and a farming sim, akin to something like Animal Crossing but with Hobbits. 
Fortunately, we don't have to wait too long to find out because the first trailer for Tales of the Shire arrives on Monday, April 22.

        <updated>2024-04-10T15:05:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year’s acclaimed Dave the Diver is coming to PlayStation next week on April 16. The scuba diving exploration/restaurant simulator has also been enhanced with a few Sony-exclusive perks.
Dave the Diver is also coming to PS4, but a new trailer shows off the PS5 version's DualSense-specific features. That includes using the controller's haptic feedback to "sense the movements of the deep sea." The adaptive triggers add a kick to firing Dave's speargun and a vibrating tension to the harpoon gun. Sound effects, such as phone call ringtones, are emitted through the controller speaker. 


Dave the Diver stars the titular diver as he explores undersea environments to locate and capture various marine species. After fishing, players then use these ingredients to operate a growing sushi restaurant.
As editor-in-chief Matt Miller wrote in his 8.75 out of 10 review, "You might question whether a sushi restaurant management sim crossed with underwater diving is your cup of tea, but that would be missing the point. Dave the Diver is a unique and memorable vacation away from expectations, and it's the very fact that you don't usually play games like this that makes it so satisfying."
Dave the Diver is already available on Switch and PC, and has a Godzilla-themed crossover coming in May.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has released a new gameplay trailer for the Adventure Mode in the upcoming Switch-exclusive Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble. In it, we get gameplay of the up-to-four-player mode that features 200 stages set across various different worlds, and it looks like a blast. 
Featuring both local and online four-player co-op, Adventure Mode will be available on day one when Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble launches on Switch on June 25. Optional assist features, like Rewind and Ghost Guide, allow players to customize how their monkey ball experience plays. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble: Adventure gameplay trailer below: 


"While visiting a tropical island, AiAi and the gang meet a girl named Palette, an adventurer searching for the Legendary Banana," a press release reads. "They agree to join her on her journey across wondrous worlds to collect special parts said to be the key to localizing this prized relic. Along the way, they'll meet new friends and encounter mysterious rivals."
Adventure Mode features 200 new stages set across different worlds, such as Banana Farm, Rose Garden, Floating City, Golden Temple, and Stone Valley. Each brings its own unique twist and challenge to the Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble experience. 
In Adventure Mode, players can utilize the Rewind feature to rewind to a previous point of a stage and re-attempt a particularly challenging section. The Ghost Guide option adds a transparent monkey alongside the player that demonstrates how to proceed, while the Route Guide will point you in the right direction if you're unsure of where to go. Plus, you can restart at any checkpoint within a stage at any time. 
Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble hits Switch on June 25.

I’ve always admired the games and dabbled with them for a few hours here and there, but it was never a series that inspired excitement in me. I am, however, a fan of the Fallout series executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. The two worked together on Westworld and though my fandom faded over time, I will always hold up the first season as some of my favorite television ever. I went into Amazon’s Fallout adaptation with unsure expectations. Video game movies and TV shows have improved in recent years, but I will always be hesitant. And time has frequently proven that one successful project from a creator (or a pair in this case) does not automatically equal success in another.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today marks two years since the official reveal of Kingdom Hearts IV, and while Square Enix hasn't shared any news about the game, fans of the series can celebrate with a new recording of the franchise's best song by Hikaru Utada. As pointed out on X (formerly Twitter) by Genki_JPN, Utada's new Science Fiction album, which they released yesterday, features a re-recording of "Hikari," the Japanese version of "Simple and Clean." 
If you're a Kingdom Hearts fan, you likely already know which song this is. However, if you haven't touched the series in a while, or if you've never played the beginning of Kingdom Hearts, it's the Japanese version of the song in this famous game opener below: 


As for the new recording of "Hikari," its place on Science Fiction makes sense because its Utada's first greatest hits album, if you will, meant to act as a compilation with new mixes of old songs, re-recordings of fan-favorite tracks, and more. You can listen to the album, which features 26 tracks, starting today. 
If you're interested in hearing the new recording of "Hikari," you can listen below:

Originally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.
Step into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.
Embark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). 
Can you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?
Our modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh MMy — a new ScummVM release!
Please welcome the first ScummVM release of the year: ScummVM 2.8.1.
ScummVM 2.8.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on fixing bugs that were uncovered since our last stable release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines: AGI, AGS, GRIM, SWORD2, MM (which is now enabled — yes, we really skipped it in 2.8.0 by accident), mTropolis, NANCY, SCUMM, TWINE, Ultima, and V-Cruise.
The Android, Atari and macOS ports received multiple bug fixes, mostly for improving overall stability and preventing some crashes we’ve seen under certain circumstances.
The detailed list of improvements is available here.
As always, you can find the latest release on our Downloads page.
Go grab it while it's hot — enjoy!

The titans of industry were inspired to produce more goods when I visited their factories. But as the years have passed, so do their eyes pass over me, to eye curiously my replacements. Will you try the new style, ma’am? It’s so much better than that old thing. I’ve watched my friends grow old and die. My brother got caught in traffic and caused a horrific level crossing collision. I get sick more often, wheezing to a halt wherever I am. When I visit the doctor for a spot of renewal, they tell me, “Sorry, I can’t help. You’re too old.” When will I be autoreplaced?
