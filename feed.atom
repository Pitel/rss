Nintendo's pink puffball Kirby celebrated his 30th birthday earlier this year. It seems he's not done just yet, either - with the battle royale Tetris 99 announcing a brand new themed event based on the party game Kirby's Dream Buffet.
Between 15th and 19th of December players will be able to unlock this Kirby's Dream Buffet theme by accumulating 100 event points. This new theme comes with background art, music and Tetrimino designs.

It might be December, but that hasn't stopped video game releases from rushing out the door. The latest one is Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII- Reunion - otherwise known as the prequel to the legendary 1997 RPG, Final Fantasy VII.
Crisis Core originally made its debut on the PlayStation Portable in 2007 and now returns with updated 3D models, full voiceovers, new music arrangements and much more. It stars Zack Fair, who is a rather important character in the Final Fantasy VII mythos. You can learn more in our review:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a tactics veteran on board, too
Adglobe and Binary Haze Interactive have announced their next project, heading into the realm of tactics. Redemption Reapers is a tactical RPG set to arrive on PC, PlayStation 4, and Switch in February 2023.
This new RPG is being developed by Adglobe and published by Binary Haze, both of which collaborated on 2021's Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights. But rather than tackle the Metroidvania genre again, they're looking towards tactics.
Redemption Reapers follows the Ashen Hawk Brigade as it battles against an invading legion. It looks very grim, with the hordes of monsters rampaging across the countryside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkYM9qfdXwU
Longtime Fire Emblem developer Masayuki Horikawa is working on the project, so it's got some of that lineage. Redemption Reapers also has a strong voice cast cued up, and a fairly different look from the usual tactics RPG.
"Following the success of Ender Lilies, we aimed to approach a new genre ideal for sharing our love of dark fantasy stories," said Binary Haze CEO Hiroyuki Kobayashi in a press release. "Redemption Reapers’ tactical RPG combat and emotional storytelling combine for a memorable experience we cannot wait to share with the world in early 2023."
Search for redemption
We certainly saw a lot of tactics in 2022. Games like Tactics Ogre: Reborn, Triangle Strategy, and Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope have made for a hefty backlog for most tactics fans.
Still, there's always room for something fresh and new. Ender Lilies, from what I've seen other folks say about it, certainly seems like it did that. And Redemption Reapers could see this team-up work out for a surprise hit once again.
It won't be a long wait, either way. Redemption Reapers aims to charge into a stacked early 2023 season, with a February launch window in mind. We'll see how it holds up against the horde in a few months' time.

Since its inception nearly three decades ago, Need for Speed’s best entries have combined style and substance to produce thrilling homages to the street racing scene. Need for Speed Unbound feels like the ultimate realization of that philosophy, creating one of the franchise’s best in years.
Sliding into the driver seat of the nearly 150 cars in Need for Speed Unbound feels terrific. Blasting down a straightaway in a McLaren delivers a remarkable sense of speed but nailing a corner drift in a Mitsubishi feels just as good.…]]></summary>

Chained Echoes is a new RPG from developer Matthias Linda, a communication designer who started working on the game in his spare time after work back in 2016. The project went on Kickstarter in 2019, and launched on December 8, 2022 for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC via Steam.
It would be fairly easy to call Chained Echoes a love letter to the SNES' golden age. It wears its inspirations so prominently on its sleeve, it opens with a direct reference to the start of Chrono Trigger. There's no …]]></summary>

Video game movies have been the subject of plenty of ridicule over the last handful of decades. Wounded fans have long complained that out-of-touch Hollywood bigwigs just don't get the things they're adapting, and conventional wisdom has always held that video game movies are simply bad.
Fortunately for me, conventional wisdom is wrong. Yes, there are a lot of awful video game movies made by lazy filmmakers trying to cash in on a brand name. But there are also a lot of really excellent films based on video games - particularly in recent years. Video game movies show no sign of slowing down, so I'd like to go through ten of the finest examples ever made.

Licensed video games have always been like the interior of an abandoned barn. Sometimes you might find a long-abandoned car that is in dire need of restoration, but more likely, it’s just full of spiders. Die Hard on NES is neither of those things. It’s more like finding a long-abandoned lunar lander in an old barn. You wonder how it got there and if it’s a good idea to try it out.
It’s an absolutely bizarre game that transcends the discussion of whether it’s good or crap. It’s fascinating. The design is something that isn’t exactly without comparison, but the way it functions is out of this world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And the soundtracks are coming to streaming services.
Hold the phone, readers — it's Snowboard Kids' (Snowboard Kiiiiiiids~) 25th anniversary, and we now feel really ancient. More importantly, the game's publisher, Atlus, acknowledged the game's birthday by announcing that all the games' soundtracks would be available on streaming services on Christmas day!
If you missed out on this back in the day, Snowboard Kids is one of the greatest snowboarding games around — 1080 Snowboarding wishes it could be this good (we kid, we kid). But this colourful Mario Kart take on snowboarding saw you play as one of six racers — Slash, Nancy, Jam, Tommy, Linda, or Shinobin — each with a fun design and personality traits that meant each of us at Nintendo Life Towers has one we can relate to the most. (This writer always liked Nancy because look at those '90s-as-heck pink dungarees and those bunny ears — and she always donned a lot of pink on the slopes, too.)

Armored Core VI: Fires Of Rubicon marks the return of the mechs they used to make before Demon's Souls set them on a different, swordier path, and IGN have just published a big interview that pokes into what bearing the Soulsbourne lineage might have on a game about flying mechs with guns and missiles. 
Armored Core director (and Sekiro lead designer) Masaru Yamamura welcomed Sekiro comparisons, while FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki was keen to stress they're treating it as an Armored Core game rather than a Soulsborne game.

The year is coming to a close, and so it's time to look back at what 2022 held, particularly for Xbox fans. Microsoft had a seemingly quiet year, but this year's nominees for Destructoid's best-in-class Xbox games spoke volumes.
As a reminder, our awards season here at Destructoid runs December-to-December. So while Halo Infinite wasn't eligible last year, it is this year, and it's likely better off for it. While 343 Industries' FPS struggled right out of the gate, a series of updates have been gradually turning the narrative around. The recent Forge beta and quality-of-life improvements are starting to make Infinite feel a bit more like what folks might have hoped for at launch, and so it's worth noting that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can you even buy a PS5 yet?
2022 has been a pretty action-packed year for Sony's premier gaming brand. And while arguably the first year that saw its two-year-old platform, PlayStation 5, accelerate its sales past the 25 million mark, the past 12 months have still seen a wide variety of new releases squeezed onto its best-selling predecessor, PS4, hardware that simply refuses to go gently into that good night.
Even visual stunners such as Guerrilla Games' Horizon Forbidden West and Sony Santa Monica's God of War Ragnarok were causing the PS4's modest CPU to sweat away, ensuring that the full transition to the ninth generation remains mired in a strange limbo. It's a good situation for the players, as the PS4 has an incredible install base of over 100 million users. But, as someone who previously worked retail for many generations, I can't remember a gaming generation that took this long to become mainline.
Still, there were some PS5-only releases, many of which boasted incredible visuals, dazzling effects, and very welcome high-speed load times. All in, it's a pretty good time to be a PlayStation owner. Many new titles are still compatible with PS4, while its bigger brother spearheads the charge into the next half-decade of gaming... Even if the physical console itself is still far, far too large for anybody's TV stand.
Here are the nominees for Destructoid's Best PlayStation Game of 2022:
Cult of The Lamb
Elden Ring
God of War: Ragnarok
Horizon Forbidden West
Sifu
Stranger in Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin

Ah, water. Calming, tranquil, fun. You’d struggle to find a game that doesn’t have some body of water in it. But Wavetale dives into the deep end. This adventure title from Thunderful sees players exploring by walking, running, and gliding on water. Initially released for Stadia, it has now spread to PC and consoles. For the most part, it’s relaxing to play, although it struggles a little on Switch.
Wavetale takes place in the aptly-named Strandville, a town that has been literally and figuratively flooded by baddies known as the Dirty Paws. You play as heroine Sigrid – a sarcastic, cynical young adult whose temperament comes through in the talented voice over actor’s sighs and mumbles. She lives with a grandmother who won’t even let her dip her toe in the surrounding sea, because the world beyond is covered with dark perilous clouds (‘Gloom’). Naturally, she longs to explore those uncharted waters.

It looks like updates for Mario Strikers: Battle League are coming to a close, and they're doing it with two familiar faces. The Wave 3 update adds Bowser Jr. and Birdo to the soccer title, in what Nintendo says is the final free update for Mario Strikers: Battle League.
Shown off in the latest trailer, Bowser Jr. is a balanced competitor with accurate passes. I guess the little dude learned teamwork somewhere. Birdo, meanwhile, is an offensive powerhouse with powerful shots. See them in action below:

While Mario Strikers has added three batches of post-launch characters and other updates, like special gear and arenas, it looks like the free updates are coming to a close. Over on social media, Nintendo UK says this is the "final free update" for Mario Strikers: Battle League.
Though the door may still be open for paid DLC somewhere down the line, it looks like this particular sports spinoff is coming to a close soon.
End of regulation
Mario Strikers: Battle League went live back in June of this year, and it seemed to deliver some high-octane soccer to fans. Soccer hadn't seen much love in the Mario sports-sphere in some time, so it was nice to see this particular line of spin-offs get a new entry.
While most of the Switch-era sports spinoffs have seen a decent number of free post-launch updates, it's sad to see this particular one come to a close. Whether this means we'll see another entry on the way soon or not isn't clear yet, but since the Switch seems to be sticking around a while, I'm hopeful we see some other sports entries revived. Mario needs to play some baseball again, is all I'm saying.
The third free update for Mario Strikers: Battle League goes live on December 13.

Bandai Namco has proudly announced that Tekken 7, one of the longest-life fighting games of all time, has smashed past an amazing 10 million sales. The announcement was made on the official Tekken Twitter, accompanied by an image of the entire cast at a very confusing dinner party, where people seem to float in mid-air, perspective is for the weak, and Kazumi brought a tiger.
Tekken 7 initially launched in Japanese arcades in the spring of 2015 (yep), before the expanded and rebalanced Fated Retribution hit the coin-op market one year later. This edition of the game would launch on PC and consoles worldwide in the summer of 2017 as simply Tekken 7. Since launch, the development has rolled out a lengthy series of DLC updates, bringing with them new modes, mech…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Synced is an upcoming free to play third-person looter shooter developed by NeXT Studios, and is Tencent's crack at a live-service game akin to The Division. It has roguelite bits to help it stand out a touch, with the ability to command your own shiny gem pal to bash enemies. But from what I've played so far, its lack of clarity makes its grind for currencies and mod slots and whatever else a tired affair that probably won't pull you away from the bazillion other games that require a lifetime investment.

I like getting a bajillion frames per second as much as the next PC owner, but good gravy, are the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 a pair of oversized, ruinously expensive brutes. AMD’s two new high-end GPUs, therefore, have a golden chance to be the more modestly designed, affordable alternatives that prospective 4K players were waiting for.

After the curtain fell on Keighley-fest '22, some Xbox fans took to social media to express their concern, disappointed that they didn't walk away with their own Death Stranding 2, Forspoken, or Bayonetta Origins. Vice President of Xbox Marketing, Aaron Greenberg, seemingly took note of this, and soon popped up on Twitter with a brief message hoping to reassure Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S owners.

At last week's The Game Awards show, Nintendo and Illumination unveiled a new clip from the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie, showcasing the main guy himself exploring Mushroom Kingdom alongside Keegan-Michael Key's character, Toad.
Something that long-time fans of Mario will have immediately noticed was the lovely background music, which was almost entirely comprised of tunes inspired by the video game series. While it probably isn't necessary to point out which game each and every tune comes from (we know you're a clever bunch, after all), it's nevertheless fun to see it in practice. Which is why YouTuber SuperWiiBros08 has uploaded a new video highlighting which Mario game each tune was inspired by.

The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series, which rolled out across late 2021 and early 2022 feature the original games in their entirety, spruced up with crisp HD visuals, overhauled U.I., tweaked gameplay, and beautifully rearranged scores, overseen by Final Fantasy's veteran composer Nobuo Uematsu.

Epic Games is facing a class-action lawsuit from parents who claim that the team knowingly developed Fortnite to be highly addictive (thanks, TechRadar).
Concern over the game's level of addiction have been a hot topic of conversation for a good few years now. The lawsuit was first opened up back in 2019, with lawyers claiming that Epic Games hired psychologists to assist in making the title as addictive as possible and provided players with no warnings of these effects. The case has been under review ever since and has now been deemed worthy of approval.

Anyway, yeah, a lot of the Roiland shtick does still make me laugh, but there isn't a strong enough game around it to really hold up High on Life.

Teased during the OG Unwrapped Presentation earlier this year, Outright Games has now announced that it will be bringing DC's Justice League: Cosmic Chaos to the Switch for some family-friendly fun on 10th March, 2023.
If you were to look at the state of the DCEU at the moment, the phrase 'family friendly' might not immediately spring to mind. You've got several iterations of Batman beating seven shades out of criminals, two attempts at a Justice League movie which are better off forgotten and projects being cancelled left, right and centre. Nonetheless, PHL Collective and Outright Games have looked at this landscape and and decided that a family-friendly open-world adventure is the way to go - fair enough!

I’ve been excited about Forspoken since its reveal as Project Athia in 2020. The fish-out-of-water game set in a medieval fantasy realm is developed by Luminous Productions – an internal Square Enix team that helped develop Final Fantasy XV, a game I quite enjoyed despite its problems. It also features the talents of Uncharted series creator Amy Hennig and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story writer Gary Whitta on the narrative side, which makes me interested in playing through protagonist Frey Holland’s journey. 
On paper, it’s precisely the type of RPG I like to spend my time playing. After going hands-on for a few hour…]]></summary>

We seem to be learning more and more about Super Mario Bros. The Movie each day, with official announcements, regional differences and leaks contributing to the growing mound of material. The latest addition to join the pile is a McDonald's advert - reportedly showing in Portugal - which contains brand new footage of a much more capable looking Mario in action (thanks, Nintenduo).
The latest advert (below) appears to have been pulled straight out of the early 2000s, it is true, but it does provide a first look at what Mario might be like once he gains a better understanding of his abilities. Here hurdling a Toad before wall jumping up a set of item boxes to avoid the pearly whites of a trio of Piranha Plants, this isn't the Mario-in-training that we have seen in the past few trailers but one that appears a lot more ready to get let's-a-go-ing.

Digerati later shared their own video response on Twitter, with owner Sarah Alfieri saying Digerati have been “blindsided” by Grindheim’s statement.

In the mid-2000s, Nintendo may have easily dominated the handheld gaming space with the DS and its incredible lineup, but never let it be said that the PSP didn’t have its fair share of absolute bangers. One of the most memorable PSP titles was Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core, a prequel to one of the greatest games Square’s ever managed to produce. Mixing fast-paced hack ‘n’ slash combat with a story that was just as endearing and heartbreaking as the original Final Fantasy VII, Crisis Core quickly built a strong reputation for itself. Now that Square is in the process of, uh, redoing Final Fantasy 7, the developer has seen fit to bring Crisis Core to modern audiences to bring them up to speed on certain plotlines and characters ahead of the launch of Rebirth next winter. We’re pleased to report that this remake has been a resounding success; Crisis Core was always a great game and now it looks and plays better than ever.
Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII- Reunion, to give it its full title, places you in the role of Zack Fair, a peppy, cocky, and impressively skilled mercenary working for a paramilitary group called SOLDIER, which exists to maintain the interests of the hegemonic Shinra Electric Power Company. Though Shinra is of course the nefarious, puppy-kicking megacorporation you’d expect it to be, Zack genuinely dreams of being a ‘hero’ and wants to do the right thing. His world starts to unravel, however, when a high-level SOLDIER operative named Genesis goes rogue and takes a stand against Shinra. What follows is an increasingly bizarre journey into a world of aliens, clones, and genetic modification that somehow manages to stay coherent and alluring all the way through.

Fans have since been clamouring for a console release and now it looks like Square Enix might be about to answer our prayers.

The package itself comes with some NFC cards, a Joy-Con add-on device, and perhaps most interestingly, a bottle of hot sauce (not actual hot sauce, although the first publisher that includes some hot sauce with an upcoming game gets a thumbs up from us). It's a bizarre game, and you should really check out the video below for a proper look at what's included.

In a complaint registered with The U.S. District Court, Digerati has stated that the developer has "trampled" on the team's contractual rights and it is therefore opening a lawsuit to order Conradical to "perform its obligations under the Licensing Agreement to ensure the success of The Outbound Ghost."

"Sony is trying to protect its dominance on the console. The way they grow is by making Xbox smaller," said Spencer (as noted by VGC). "[Sony] has a very different view of the industry than we do.

Netflix's animated series Sonic Prime is mere days away from its premiere, launching this week on December 15th.
To whet your appetite, a new clip from the show has been released on the 'Netflix After School' YouTube channel to showcase one of Sonic's first encounters with an alternate reality version of Tails. After Sonic saves Tails from an approaching vehicle, he recounts how the two originally met and became friends, after which Tails gives an alternate take on his "origin" story. Both versions of the tale showcase retro pixel art visuals similar to the original Sonic games, which - while lacking some of the platformers' character and charm - is a lovely little touch.

The latest UK boxed charts are here and it's a familiar scene for many, with no new entries into the top ten for this week (Cuphead's physical release came in at number eighteen, with the Switch version making up 79% of the copies sold).
God of War Ragnarok reclaimed the crown to come in at number one, climbing up two spots from last time, which GamesIndustry attributes to an increase in PS5 stock for the UK. Meanwhile, FIFA 23 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II slip down one spot each, with sales down 18% and 14% respectively. The Switch version of FIFA 23 continues to perform moderately well, making up 24% of the total split between platforms.

Each minute, a couple of million dollars of production glitz is poured into your flickering eyeballs, while you stuff your slack jaw with popcorn. Papetura is both exactly like that and nothing like that at all at the same time.
Produced mainly by lone creative Thomas Ostafin, Papetura burst onto crowdfunding site Indiegogo in 2015, but it didn’t reach its funding target. However, after four more years of refusing to be discouraged, the game made it to Steam in 2019. If there’s a clearer example of a gaming passion project, we don’t know what it is. So, while the megabucks aren’t flying at your face as you play, every background in the game, every animation, every puzzle, and every scene is made of pure, highly concentrated graft. And it feels like an indulgence and a privilege to play.

Hi folks, and welcome to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
Last time we took a look at one of the Sega Genesis' finest games, Castlevania: Bloodlines (also known as Castlevania: The New Generation). It was a close call and it looked like Japan might have run away with the crown, but ultimately, the North American variant - with its bold colours and busier composition - took home the win with 42% of the vote.

In case you missed it, one of the big Nintendo-related announcements at The Game Awards this year was the reveal of Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon. This new Switch game is arriving early next year on 17th March, and as result, there's already a fair bit of information about it.
The latest update comes directly from Nintendo's website, revealing the digital version of this new storybook spin-off will require around 3.5GB of free space. Unsurprisingly, this is much smaller than the recent release Bayonetta 3, which took up 16GB.

There are a ton of great games to look forward to over the next couple of years (many of which are not on this list), but I had to take the time to highlight some of the games that have me amped.
It's actually a pretty good mix of DLC and sequels to some of my favorite titles, and also some new IPs that will be breaking out onto the scene with their debut title.

World of Warcraft's Corrupted Blood pandemic from back in 2005 is one of the most notorious, and yet fascinating, things to ever happen in the game. It even has its own Wikipedia page titled "The Corrupted Blood Incident." For those who may not be familiar, basically what happened was that there was a debuff associated with a certain boss fight at the end of a raid. The debuff could pass between players in close proximity, and while it was intended to be active only in the boss' region, a bug allowed Corrupted Blood to spread across the entirety of Azeroth, the game's fictional world.

Following on from last week's much-celebrated and long-awaited release of Tetris: The Grand Master, retro publisher Hamster returns to its bag big of Namco classics this week, with the arrival of 3D maze chaser Pac-Mania, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to arcades in 1987, before finding itself ported to myriad home computers and consoles, Pac-Mania was something of a very big deal upon its launch, due to its fresh adaptation of Pac-Man's genre-defining gameplay from an all-new 3D perspective. Choosing an oblique 3/4 viewing angle, and sporting some delightfully cartoonish sprites, Pac-Mania offered a new approach to the pill-munching action of its 1980 predecessor.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber MegaMan52.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJFLJ5w88U
Once again, our boy is charged with dashing around a symmetrical maze, gobbling up power pellets, and staying one step ahead of the ghostly gang of Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde, and "Sue". As a major game-changer, Pac-Man now has the ability to leap over his enemies, offering him a handy escape when cornered. Later stages introduce new ghosts... erm... "Funky and Spunky" both of whom also have the ability to take to the air, intercepting Pac-Man's avian action. A popular release in arcades and on the home market, Pac-Mania remains one of the most recognizable of the Pac-Man sequels.
Pac-Mania is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8. It should be noted that it is also included as part of Bandai Namco's compendium Pac-Man Museum +.

Riot Games is suing over the similarities it's found in a NetEase game to its own Valorant. A new suit filed by Riot claims that NetEase's Hyper Front is a copy of the tactical shooter Valorant.
As reported on by Polygon, Riot has field suit over NetEase's Hyper Front, which is also a team-based tactical shooter. According to the filing, Riot claims Hyper Front is a copy of "substantial parts" of Valorant.
Valorant launched on PC in 2020, and Riot is currently developing a mobile version. Meanwhile, Hyper Front was released in 2022 for mobile platforms on iOS and Android.
In the suit, Riot lays out the similarities. It's not just the number of players, but Riot points directly at maps, character designs, weapons, and even the raw numbers from the weapons. There are actual spreadsheets in the filing, comparing the data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRao6FARFRo
Rushing the point
Riot does note that NetEase made modifications to Hyper Front following the first complaints. However, the infringement goes further.
"All of our creative choices are mirrored in NetEase’s game," said Riot Games layer Dan Nabel to Polygon. "We don’t think that changing the color of a character ability or slightly modifying the visual appearance changes the fact that it’s copyright infringement. It’s like that old saying, ‘You can put lipstick on a pig, but it’s still a pig.'"
Riot Games is seeking an injunction, which would likely essentially shut down Hyper Front, and "substantial", but unspecified, figures for damages. It's also litigating the claim in several courts around the world.
"We don’t want to rely on one particular market to have this issue resolved," Nabel told Polygon. "NetEase is a global publisher, as are we. We want them to know that we take the matter very seriously."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An ambitious title that just misses the mark.
The world wasn’t ready for Romancing SaGa when it was first released back in 1992. It wasn’t until the PS2 remake in 2005 that the title would make its way to western shores, where it quickly gained a passionate following among fans of its non-linear storytelling, expressive characters, and multiple-choice approach to protagonists. Playing through this remaster of the JRPG cult classic, dubbed Romancing SaGa – Minstrel Song – Remastered, reminds us of how special it is, despite some baffling design decisions.
Unlike the 2005 remake, this is more of an upgrade on the Romancing SaGa experience rather than a complete overhaul. It comes with updated, shiny HD visuals and new playable characters, as well as a handful of quality-of-life changes to improve the experience for new players. But even as a remaster of a 20-year-old JRPG, Romancing SaGa – Minstrel Song – Remastered is an ambitious title that tries to do many things that even modern games struggle with.

I knew exactly what I was getting into with Samurai Maiden, I’m just not exactly sure why I went with it. I guess I was hoping it might do something different. You could easily describe it as an Isekai, though technically, the main character travels back to the past; she then goes into Yomi. It’s about her trying to survive, kind of, while she’s being helped by ninjas from both her own and parallel dimensions. It’s a little bit yuri, and pretty shoujo.
I guess with it tying in the Sengoku period, I was hoping it might do something unique.
Nope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Basics have produced some great computer gear in their history - memorably, once selling a full-size mechanical keyboard for £23 that I reviewed and found surprisingly good value for money. Today though, it's something different: an Amazon Basics branded Micro SD card in a 256GB capacity, selling for just £15.67 rather than its UK RRP of £26.99. 
Here's what I've learned about the card, and why I reckon it's worth picking up if you're in need for a memory card for your Steam Deck, Switch or whatever.

In the debate between 1989’s Final Fight and 1991’s Streets of Rage, I’m in the latter camp. Don’t get me wrong, I love Final Fight and understand that Streets of Rage was just Sega’s answer to Capcom porting their seminal brawler to the SNES. I also realize that Streets of Rage is a blatant rip-off of Final Fight. However, I just love the sense of style and the fact that it’s better suited to consoles.
However, Streets of Rage doesn’t have Mike Haggar, former pro-wrestler and beloved mayor of Metro City. Haggar is amazing not just because he’s built like a pizza oven, but also because his backstory is so sparse you can apply whatever features you want onto him. Is he a mayor who only knows how to address crime with his fists? Maybe. Or perhaps he was working on addressing crim…]]></summary>

The Devil's Moon event for excellent cowboy swamp simulator Hunt Showdown kicks off on December 14th, no doubt sending players off to squish environmental objects for points that unlock new weapons and cosmetics in the manner of previous events. This one is different, though, in that it also introduces a "wildcard condition" called Inferno that sets large swathes of the map on fire. It is dramatic. Come see.

Dragon Quest Treasures has finally arrived for Nintendo Switch, and with a 77 score on Metacritic as of this writing, most reviewers seem to think it's a pretty good time. In my review, I found it to be a delightful way to pass the hours with a charming world and addictive gameplay. And as much as I do like the game, I'm aware that it doesn't exactly do the best job of informing the player of everything they can do in it. Some things you'll only learn via hint screens or in passing dialogue, so to better help those treasure hunters who are starting their journeys today, I thought I'd collect seven Dragon Quest Treasures tips to get you going the right way.

Supergiant Games is working on Hades II, its first-ever sequel, as it confirmed at last night's Game Awards. The reveal trailer has tons of tidbits, details, and plenty of new gods and goddesses to see.
The first Hades received a lot of acclaim, due in part to how it interpreted Greek myth into Superigant's version of the Underworld. For Hades II, that doesn't seem to have changed.

In a new FAQ about Hades II, Supergiant shares some details about what it's calling a direct sequel to the first Hades. And while mythology is certainly back in focus, Supergiant's turned towards one specific area: witchcraft.

It's knuckle-up time, as developer Sloclap has released a new update for its time-hopping brawler Sifu — The fall update, now available on all platforms, adds several new features, skins, and game modifiers for the super-challenging beat-'em-up adventure.
The core of the new update lies in an exciting new Replay Editor, which will let players take a directorial eye to their highlight reels of window-smashing, chair-tossing carnage. The editor features a free-moving camera, cut 'n' copy tools, speed modifiers, and visual effects, all of which might not quite have you recreating the best fist-throwing flick since Yes, Madam, but will allow you to showcase your finest fights at the heart-stopping best. Annnnnnd ACTION!

In addition to the replay editor, the Sifu Fall update also includes a selection of brand-new game modifiers. These include the youth-sapping "Vampire" mode, a "Free Throw" option for all you grappler fans, and the mighty "Touch of Death" modifier for Bruce Lee-style one-punch knockouts. Three new outfits have also been added to the protagonist's wardrobe, including two versions of the "Wing Chung" ensemble, and a bonus "Stunt Double" outfit for Deluxe Edition owners — which contains the perfect jacket for those late-night drives.
Sifu is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

Okay, maybe that's just my bad decisions talking. You're stranded on a wrecked space station after a failed pirate attack, and must get back to your ship. It's not super secret, but I almost don't want to say more than that, because this is a game overflowing with possibilities in a way that even Fallout seldom matched. It is not quite ready, but if the bugs can be ironed out, and perhaps more crucially, the save system reorganised, this could easily become one of the best RPGs of its kind.

From there, savvy survivalists will be able to build and trade among their local community, gain favor of the Great Houses, build and equip an arsenal of weaponry, work with spice harvesting corporations, and build themselves up among the corporations and nobility that holds fort over the lucrative lands. Of course, you might just get eaten by a sandworm on your first day — which honestly sounds like less work and perhaps the better option.
Funcom notes that it will roll out further trailers and gameplay overviews over the coming months, giving players a general overview of Dune: Awakening's gameplay, options, and features ahead of its official beta launch. A date for the beta was not announced, but we do know that Dune: Awakening is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. So you'd better get your house in order.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch each Friday at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.


If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I haven't been active in fandom spaces for years now, but lurking on the edges of social media forums dedicated to games I find cool does technically fall under the remit of my job. And let me tell you, the lead-up to a night like The Game Awards is always something else. Fringes of the Tomb Raider fanbase were getting hyped for the announcement of the next game because… well, it just feels like about time, right? The same went for Life Is Strange, but then, Life Is Strange fans have been predicting the imminent reveal of LIS3 literally on a weekly basis ever since True Colors launched, so they're bound to be right eventually. Ace Attorney stans were using numerology to predict that AA7 would finally get announced. Incredible scenes of completely baseless hype, and despite myself, I wanted to believe.
I genuinely daren't check in on any of those conversations today, because, honestly, it wasn't a massive night for long-running franchises, and I don't think I can handle the lamentations. And, while I'll admit that my initial skim of the trailers for familiar names came up a tad short, I'm not at all disappointed, because it looks like 2023 is going to be a stellar year for devs doing something cool with a new IP while learning a lot from their older projects.

Alongside the news that The Last of Us Part I is coming to PC in March 2023, Sony also took time at The Game Awards to offer a release window for a PC port of Housemarque's dazzling space adventure, Returnal — As revealed in a short trailer, the time-skipping title will hit Steam and Epic Games Store in early 2023.
Launching in April 2021 as a showcase piece for the burgeoning PS5 platform, Returnal is the story of an intrepid space explorer, Selene, who crash lands on a mysterious planet, playing host to the remnants of some lost, undiscovered civilization. Meeting an untimely end soon after jettisoning her spacecraft, Selene finds herself resurrected back in its cockpit, doomed to relive life, after life, after life until she can uncover the mystery behind this strange world and, hopefully, find her way back home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iNGNYuR5_8&ab_channel=PlayStation
Developed by shmup enthusiasts Housemarque, Returnal combines the team's love of bullet hell gameplay with its proven talent for creating eye-popping visuals, dramatic lightning effects, and wide palette of splendid colors, in order to create a compelling third-person adventure. Celebrated for its challenging action, lush environments, and intriguing story of self-reflection, Returnal was an early hit for Sony's fancy new hardware and was almost custom-made for the splendor and power of the PC platform.
Returnal launches on PC via Steam and Epic Games Store in early 2023.

In the spirit of the holidays, the group reconvened to tackle another literary classic: Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, benefitting a children's hospital.

How about new IPs such as Ken Levine’s Judas, Dontnod’s Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, and Crime Boss: Rockay City? Did new trailers for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Tekken 8, and Final Fantasy XVI raise your anticipation for those titles or put them on your radar? How head-turning was that weird Bayonetta prequel?

At the time I'd been in the market for a new – and entirely necessary - underfoot experience, so I turned to a local Carpet Man to procure said plush. In the end he seemed pleased that I rebelled against the majority and opted for a sunny corn colour.
But the latest Armored Core VI trailer from this year's Geoff Awards had me in a contemplative mood. "Perhaps", I thought, "Carpet Man would appreciate FromSoftware's use of grey". Even though there isn't a fuzzy floor surface to be seen, could the trailer have triggered grey's redemption arc?

Not to the extent that I will ever bother to learn anything about them, or to identify one with any more specificity than “the pointy type”, “the blunt type” and “the chugga chugga choo choo all-aboard type”, but to the far milder extent that I simply enjoy watching them whizz around the place like big metal worms, and hearing their various little noises and honks. It’s trains! 
Just as a train might be lured into a station with the promise of fresh passengers (which are like treats to trains), I have been drawn inexorably toward Choo-Choo Charles, a ramshackle joke-game about a scary train that chases you around. Marooned on a perpetually dark island, you’re stalked by a monstrous locomotive with a set of great big spider legs and an unquenchable thirst for human blood.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the same way that shoulderpads sometimes become cool again, and everyone is buying over-sized hair scrunchies like wot I used to have when I was 11, games journalists are destined to be trapped in repeating discourse cycles of ever-decreasing size. This is why I will often specifically advise people to never, ever pitch me opinions about BioShock. Any opinions about BioShock have already been had. There are no more opinions to have about it.

My state of peace in this area was just scuppered by that utter bastard Ken Levine, the creative director and writing lead on both BioShock and BioShock Infinite, when he revealed some of the new game by his studio Ghost Story Games (aka The Developers Formerly Known As Irrational). As observed by everyone who saw the reveal at The Game Awards last night, Judas is basically BioShock in space. The bad news is that this will put more fuel in Thomas The Take Engine, but the good news is that, if it is indeed like BioShock, we can save ourselves a lot of time. When Judas comes out please just return to this article and insert a specific title and delete options as applicable.

This time around we'll be playing as Melinoë, modelled after the Greek goddess of nightmares and madness. She's also Zag's half-sister — yet another of the dozens of children, step-children, and foster-children of Hades knocking about the place — which brings me to my main take-away from the newly-confirmed existence of a Hades sequel: the title character is a really bad dad.

The Lords Of The Fallen was previously announced as a reboot to the 2014 game of almost the same name (they added a The this time), although it now seems to be a sort-of sequel. Judging from this trailer the devs would be quite happy if someone thought it was Dark Souls 4 by mistake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 16 got a fiery new trailer tonight, as well as a final release date of June 22nd 2023. At least that's the date for PS5 players. For us folks on PC, tonight's Game Awards trailer confirmed in tiny small print that Square Enix's next JRPG epic won't be landing on "other platforms" until December 31st 2023 at the earliest. So, unless Squeenix are going to deliver us a belated Christmas New Year special next year, I think it's safe to assume that FF16's PC release won't be available to summon until 2024. Still, based on what we've seen in its new "Revenge" trailer tonight, I reckon it will be well worth the wait.

I’ve been a card-carrying Transformers fan since Generation 1, so I’m somewhat confused by the trailer shown at The Game Awards tonight for Gears studio Splash Damage’s upcoming co-op action game Transformers: Reactivate. Yes, theoretically any rather large robot that changes shape counts as a Transformer. Possibly a GoBot, I’m not going to judge anyone on their lifestyle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A generation of fans may love From Software for its litany of Souls games, but the studio was once primarily known for its other beloved series, Armored Core. Tonight at The Game Awards, the studio revealed a new entry in its mech shooter franchise: Armored Core IV: Fires of Rubicon. 
A cinematic trailer set the table, which begins on a rather gloomy (and lava-filled) note before the mechs emerge to kick up the tempo a few notches. Fires of Rubicon is the first entry in the series since 2013’s Armored Core: Verdict Day, so fans have waited a long time for tonight’s news. Check out the trailer below.

Few concrete details are apparent from the trailer, but the spirit and visual styling of Cyberpunk 2077 remains in clear evidence. We know that Phantom Liberty is built as a spy-thriller set in a new district of Night City and that V somehow works together with the government of the New United States of America, and presumably alongside the newly revealed Solomon Reed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer for its upcoming sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, and it's another dark and terrifying look at the Soulslike series. 
Lords of the Fallen was released back in 2014, and GI Games revealed its long-awaited sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, during Gamescom's Opening Night Live back in August. A new trailer showcasing another look at the world of this sequel was released during The Game Awards 2022 tonight, and while it only featured a few glimpses of gameplay, it seems The Lords of the Fallen is shaping up to be a worthy successor. 
Watch The Lords of the Fallen gameplay teaser below: 


The Lords of the Fallen is set 1,000 years after the original Lords of the Fallen, and it's been designed with cooperative play in mind, according to Hexworks. Two players can play together in uninterrupted online play and experience an "expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative," according to a press release from earlier this year. 
The Lords of the Fallen will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. A release date has not yet been revealed, but it's due out sometime in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision has announced Crash Team Rumble, a 4v4 team-based online multiplayer game starring Crash Bandicoot and his furry/scaly friends. The game sees Toys for Bob, the studio behind Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, step back into the developer role for the Crash Bandicoot series, but with a decidedly different approach in tow.
Crash Team Rumble puts players in the shoes of Crash, Dingodile, and the Bandicoot's stable of friends and enemies. Each character has their own powers, personality, and playstyle as they duke it out in 4v4 competitions across a wide array of arenas. The teams compete in a variety of activities to bank the most Wumpa fruit in their drop-off zone while simultaneously defending it.
"We're so excited to unveil our fresh new take on multiplayer in the Crash universe with Crash Team Rumble," Paul Yan, co-studio head at Toys for Bob said in a press release. "Crash Team Rumble has something for everyone – easy pick-up and play for those who just want to jump in, while also providing skilled gamers the opportunity to leverage and master their hero's unique abilities."
You can see the reveal trailer below.


Crash Team Rumble comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2023. The game features cross-platform play, so you thankfully won't need to coordinate with friends or agonize over which version to pick up.]]></summary>

While Dontnod is known best for its work on the Life is Strange series, Banishers is an action/RPG, and it might share more in common with the studio's 2018 game Vampyr. For a better look at the game, check out the teaser below.


In the reveal trailer, a man sits across the table from a woman, holding her hand. Another person in the room calls the man a banisher, one who hunts ghosts. Then, the woman at the table dissolves away into a blue light, indicating that she was a ghost the whole time. Afterward, we get a glimpse at what gameplay might look like, with the man and his ghostly companion leaping into battle with an undead creature called a bonewalker.
Outside that brief trailer, we got a release window. Near the end of 2023, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

While the trailer didn’t offer a wealth of new details about the game, it did show off a pretty epic battle between the forces of Heaven and Hell. The forces seem to be led by Tyrael on one side and Lilith on the other side, and two massive armies clash over the course of the battle.

However, if you were hoping to get in on some PC / console crossplay action regarding the game's multiplayer, you may be disappointed, as publisher Sega confirmed to me today that they have "no plans to support crossplay between PC and consoles for multiplayer at launch".

Those cel-shaded visuals instantly got my attention when the new trailer for free-to-play MMORPG Blue Protocol popped up at The Game Awards this evening - and that Hiroyuki Sawano soundtrack ain't bad either (that's one for the Gundam Unicorn and Attack On Titan fans out there). It's being developed by Bandai Namco, but for some reason New World and Lost Ark publisher Amazon Games will be the ones bringing the MMO to the west in the second half of 2023. Either way, you can watch the trailer below and repeat my own very succinct inner monologue, if you like. Repeat after me: “Ooh, cel-shading. Nice.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 launches in August 2023, developer Larian Studios announced during tonight's The Game Awards. The announcement arrived alongside a new trailer and details surrounding the game's Collector's Edition.
The Collector's Edition includes a 25-centimeter Mindflayer vs. Drow battle diorama made from high-quality PVC/ABS plastic, an approximately 160-page hardcover art book, character sheets, a cloth map, a tadpole keyring, 32 die-cut stickers, three Magic: The Gathering booster packs featuring characters from Baldur's Gate 3, an oversized metal Baldur's Gate 3 D20 die, and a Collector's Edition certificate. The Collector's Edition will cost $270 and will be limited to 25,000 units worldwide.
On top of that news, we also received a trailer showing beloved characters Minsc and Jaheira's return, as well as the gameplay debut of the City of Baldur's Gate. You can see the trailer below.


Prior to the August 2023 1.0 launch, Larian will release Patch 9, which will include various improvements to the Early Access version, including a new playable class. Details of that will be revealed during a special streamed panel on December 14.
Baldur's Gate 3 has been in Early Access since 2020, so this August 2023 release window is a long time coming. Since that Early Access launch, Baldur's Gate 3 has achieved a "very positive" rating on Steam user reviews, with nearly 50,000 reviews logged as of this writing. According to the Steam page, version 1.0 will include all classes and races, and most spells from the Dungeons & Dragons Player's Handbook, plus Acts 2 and 3 of the Baldur's Gate 3 story.]]></summary>

In case you've forgotten, Nightingale is a PvE crafting survival game with a strong Victoriana vibe, but since our chat with them back at Summer Games Fest in June, and an early access delay into the first half of 2023 to accommodate the switch to Unreal Engine 5, we haven't heard too much about the game.


I got to natter with Flynn, director of production Leah Summers, and art director Neil Thompson earlier this week, ahead of the debut of a new trailer for Nightingale at The Game Awards this evening. They filled me in on how the game's blend of fairies and reality-hopping realmwalkers has progressed over the past year - and it turns out that players have had a lot to do with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for Tekken 8 and it features our first look at gameplay. 
The trailer showcases various Tekken 8 fighters, including series mainstay Jin Kazama. His mother, Jun Kazama, makes an appearance in the trailer as well to tell Jin that together, they'll "cleanse the world of its evil and corruption." 
Check out the Tekken 8 gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Tekken 8 is looking great. The trailer above is mostly focused on teasing details about the game's story, which will seemingly feature Jin and the struggles of his family dynamic (thanks, Heihachi). There are also quick clips of Tekken 8 gameplay, although it's void of the UI that showcases each fighter's HP and other elements. 
Tekken 8 was revealed earlier this year during a PlayStation State of Play held in September. That reveal trailer focused on Kazuya and his son, Jin, and you can watch it here. 
Tekken 8 will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam. It does not yet have a release date.

We got another glimpse at Inflexion's survival craft ‘em up during tonight's Game Awards, which showed off some of the magical enchantments you’ll get to encounter. Case in point: flying brollies. Have a watch below and tell me this don’t look like a right lark, guv’nor. What? I’m British, I can talk like Dick Van Dyke if I want.

        <updated>2022-12-09T02:10:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Death Stranding 2 – the sequel to one of the best games of the previous console generation – was announced tonight during The Game Awards. As you might expect from director Hideo Kojima, it was baffling. 
The trailer begins with Fragile, played by Lea Seydoux (No Time to Die, Crimes of the Future), running from some kind of threat while carrying a BB (a baby in an artificial womb; it's a whole thing) in tow. We then get a brief look at Sam Porter Bridges – the protagonist of the first game, played by Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) – who Fragile tells, "It's time for you to hit the road and start a new journey." Then everything truly goes off the rails. 
Giant mecha vehicles (not too unlike the titular Metal Gears from Kojima's previous series at Konami, Metal Gear Solid). Primary antagonist Higgs dressed like President Amelie Strand and playing an electric guitar. A BB pod full of tentacles. The ominous question, "Should we have connected," casting doubts on the entire objective of the first game – connecting the United States – all quickly flashes onscreen. If it sounds like a lot, it is. Check it out for yourself below:


We're calling it Death Stranding 2, but from the looks of it, the game is actually named DS2. Also, aside from the previously mentioned movie stars, it features Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon) and Shioli Kutsuna (Deadpool 2). 
During a brief interview after the trailer, Kojima revealed he and his company, Kojima Productions, are also working on another video game project and other "visual" works.
No real release information was given, though the game is once again being published by Sony. The trailer also said the footage was captured on a PS5. So, it might be safe to assume Death Stranding 2, like Death Stranding before it, will have some window of exclusivity on Sony platforms. Guerilla Games will also be acting as a support studio, and its proprietary engine, Decima, will once again be used for the game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new clip from Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League reveals that Kevin Conroy, who passed away earlier this year, will return to play Batman. Conroy made his first appearance as Batman in 1992’s Batman: The Animated Series and has continued to play the character in countless shows, movies, and games. He portrayed Batman in the Arkham games, the series Rocksteady is best known for.


Unlike the Arkham games, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a co-op shooter. Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, King Shark, and Deadshot are on a mission to stop the Justice League after supervillain Brainiac corrupts them and forces them to wreak havoc on humanity. While it sounds like a bleak premise, this trailer also gives a good look at the dark humor the Suicide Squad is known for.
Rocksteady also announced that the game would be coming out on May 26, 2023, just a few months from now. This news comes following years of delays and will set it eight years after the studio’s last game, Batman: Arkham Knight.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-12-09T01:44:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kratos voice actor Christopher Judge has revealed that he initially quit when he learned that someone other than God of War (2018) director Cory Barlog was directing God of War Ragnarök. Longtime Santa Monica Studios lead Eric Williams directed the sequel, which released last month. 
Fortunately for all of us, though, Barlog was able to convince Judge that quitting was not the right call. Judge touched on this during his lengthy speech at The Game Awards 2022 after accepting the award for best performance in a video game.


Here's what he said: 
"I think it's kind of common knowledge that we were honored to go to Tribeca after 2018, and when Cory took me outside and said he wouldn't be directing the next one, I literally did quit. I quit. And he said, 'Nah, I vouch for Eric.' And I said, 'Eric Williams better be a beast.' Eric Williams is a motherf---ing beast."
It's unclear if Judge legitimately quit or if he was just using these words to express his initial disappointment that Barlog was not returning to direct Ragnarök. Nonetheless, Barlog vouched for Williams, and now we have Ragnarök, one of our highest-rated games of 2022 here at Game Informer.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helping to ramp up an evening of world premieres at The Game Awards this evening, Supergiant Games revealed its newest game. Hot on the heels of the wild success of Hades, Supergiant is doing something it’s never done before: crafting a sequel.
After its previous work on titles like Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre, the studio’s new game takes us back to the roguelike playstyle of the original game, but with a new female lead fighting their way through hordes of enemies.
Instead of Zagreus’ attempted escape from Hades, Hades 2 sees players attempting to descend to fight against the titan named Kronos. The character is dubbed the “Princess of the Underworld” but given the previous game’s nod to Greek mythology, there’s a good bet that this new character has some interesting ties to the big players in that well-known pantheon.
Beyond the intriguing trailer, there’s no word on release date or console platform plans, but we do know to expect new details on Early Access in 2023, and that the game is coming to both Steam and Epic Game Store on PC.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-12-09T01:34:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost Story Games, the team led by BioShock creator Ken Levine, finally unveiled its first project. It's called Judas, and if you're a BioShock fan, you'll be happy with what you're about to see. 
To say this title follows in BioShock's footsteps would be an understatement. From its industrial sci-fi look to its first-person dual-wielding, superpowered action, Judas sports the familiar trappings of Levine's work at Irrational Games. Ghost Story describes it as a single-player, narrative-driven shooter and provided this tantalizing synopsis:
"You are the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to make or break alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you broke – or will you leave it to burn?"


Levine formed Ghost Story games in 2014 after he closed Irrational, only taking on a small group of designers from the former studio. They've been working on its first title ever since, though whether that game has always been Judas remains to be seen. After years of mostly silence, many wondered if we'd see anything come out of the studio; it was reported earlier this year that the team's first project had gone through a rocky patch. Thus, it's nice to see the fruits of their labor finally.
Judas doesn't have a release window, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At long last, Street Fighter 6 has a release date. Hot on the heels of a second beta test announcement (and retailer leaks earlier this morning), Capcom announced that the next entry arrives on June 2. On top of that, we received a new trailer and details on the Deluxe Edition.
When Street Fighter 6 launches, it will deliver new innovations like real-time commentary, multiple control schemes, and World Tour mode. The base game includes 18 characters ranging from iconic names like Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, and Blanka to new faces like Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly. For the full list of characters coming to the base game, head here.
The new trailer showed off the World Tour mode, which lets you customize your avatar and travel the world to locations like the US, France, and more. We also got a new look at several previously announced but not-yet-revealed characters, including Dee Jay, Manon, Marisa, and JP.


An earlier leak on Amazon also revealed Street Fighter 6's Deluxe Edition, which includes the base game, the Year 1 Character Pass featuring four characters, colors 3 through 10 of each Year 1 character, and a bonus 4,200 Drive Tickets for in-game purchases.
We recently flew to Osaka, Japan for our most recent cover story and came away impressed with the studio's vision and our extended hands-on time with the game. For more on our trip to Capcom's headquarters, including a fun Rapid-Fire interview and deep dives into the character designs, visit the cover hub by clicking on the banner below. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2, 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Piccolo Studio, the makers of 2019's Arise: A Simple Story, unveiled its next project, After Us, during The Game Awards.
Set on a dead Earth after the extinction of humans and wildlife, players control Gaia, the Spirit of Life, who must recover what’s left by restoring the souls of perished animals while learning how they met their fate. Unfortunately, the ravaged planet is now occupied by dangerous oil-drenched creatures called Devourers that Gaia must contend with as she clears the world of their corruption. After Us places a big emphasis on traversal, as Gaia can glide, jump, and dash across abstract environments, spreading beauty along the way.  


After Us will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next Spring.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 12/9/2022:
A "brief playable teaser" for Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon is available now within Bayonetta 3. According to Nintendo, "Players who purchased the Old Picture Book at Rodin’s shop, The Gates of Hell, using in-game currency and unlocked it with three keys will be able to access the teaser."
Original Story, 12/8/2022:
Hot on the heels of Bayonetta 3's release in October, tonight during The Game Awards, Platinum Games and Nintendo announced Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon. 
Stepping away from the series' traditional gameplay and visual style, Origins plays out in a cel-shaded art style and an isometric camera angle. It was hard to get too good a grasp on the gameplay from the trailer, though it does look akin to the Viola chapters from Bayonetta 3 – where the player character's combat actions are deemphasized over summons instead. Additionally, it appears that the main summon is Cheshire, who indeed was Viola's only summon in Bayonetta 3. Though time will tell if Origins fairs better. 
Narratively, you play as a young Bayonetta – or Cereza, as is her actual name. You can get a better idea of the overall story and see the game in action in the trailer below:


Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon will be released on Nintendo Switch on March 17, 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Upstream Arcade and publisher Good Shepherd Entertainment have revealed Mike Mignola's Hellboy Web of Wyrd, an upcoming roguelite action game with an art style reminiscent of classic Hellboy comics. 
This news was revealed during the pre-show segment of The Game Awards 2022 by way of a fancy trailer showcasing some of the game's methodical but (literally) punchy combat. The game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC sometime in the future, but a release date was not revealed. 


"Hellboy Web of Wyrd is a roguelite action adventure with an original story created in partnership with Dark Horse Comics and creator Mike Mignola," the game's Steam page reads. "When an agent goes missing, Hellboy investigates. Prepare for monstrous toe-to-toe brawling." 
As you can see in the trailer above, it's clear Upstream Arcade is aiming for Hellboy Web of Wyrd to feature a visual style reminiscent of Mike Mignola's original Hellboy comics. It's easy to see how characters, enemies, and more from those comics could be integrated into the game with such an art style as well.

Unfortunately, we'll have to wait to learn more but Hellboy fans will want to keep Web of Wyrd on their radar (especially given how tragically few Hellboy games out there exist).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Cells is getting an official Castlevania DLC crossover sometime early next year, called Dead Cells: Return To Castlevania, as announced today during The Game Awards pre-show. The news was announced via a brief animated trailer. 
The trailer didn't reveal too much about the DLC, nor did it show any looks at gameplay. Though, given Dead Cells is a Castlevania-inspired indie rogue-lite, we likely assume the core formula will remain roughly the same. The game's Steam page offers a bit more info: A gateway to a striking castle has suddenly appeared, and an imposing warrior called Richter asks you to help him vanquish the great evil within. Enticed by the promise of new loot rather than a sense of moral duty, you strike out through the grounds and corridors of the gothic castle to find and kill this mysterious Dracula.


 Additionally, the Steam page boats 51 classic Castlevania songs, 12 newly reimagined tracks, and a brand-new storyline. Gameplay unfolds throughout a fully-explorable Dracula's castle and will feature 14 Castlevania weapons, readapted into Dead Cell's gameplay, three "epic" boss fights, and 20 outfits from "Alucard, Richter Belmont, Simon Belmont, Maria Renard, Trevor Belmont, Sypha Belnades, or even Dracula himself."
No specific release date was given, but Return To Castlevania is expected to be released sometime during "Q1" 2023. It will be available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

In other Vampire Survivor news, earlier this week developer Poncle announced DLC called Legacy of the Moonspell.

According to a press release, the Commission, whose purpose is to protect consumers by promoting fair market competition, voted 3-1 to file a lawsuit to prevent the deal's closure. Thus, a federal judge will weigh in and make a decision. Among other reasons, the FTC cites Microsoft’s record of using previous acquisitions to “suppress competition from rival consoles" and points to the publisher's purchase of ZeniMax in 2020 as an example, stating:

Not the case with Tiny Glade, a lovely looking upcoming game where you really do just build dioramas of cute villages, castles, meadows, and ruins using friendly tools that help you make it look good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s still so much we don’t know about the next stealth strategy game from the makers of Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun. Until yesterday, all we had was a codename (“Süßkartoffel”, or Sweet Potato), and a few other scant business facts developer Mimimi Games posted about on their blog last year. In fact, the only concrete thing we really know about it right now is that it’s not going to be Shadow Tactics 2. 
However, in chatting to Mimimi this week about leaving real-time tactics behind in favour of their new "Stealth Strategy" label, I’ve managed to glean a few more details. Alas, Mimimi still aren’t ready to reveal Süßkartoffel’s official name just yet, but head of design Moritz Wagner told me it’s not only going to be much more beginner-friendly than their previous games, but that it will also be much more like one big sandbox this time, resisting the urge to limit players by strict level constraints. To me, it all sounded a bit like they were aiming for something akin to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, so I asked him about whether that was an accurate assessment of it. “Yes and no,” he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The makers of Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun and Desperados 3 have been thinking a lot about real-time tactics recently. Not just because they’re knee-deep in making their next tactics game at the moment, currently known as Codename Süßkartoffel (the word for "Sweet Potato" in their native German), but because they feel the genre as a whole doesn’t quite convey what’s so special about their catalogue of excellent stealth ‘em ups anymore. It’s a fair cop – despite appearing in our best strategy games list for many years, even I’ve struggled to come up with a succinct way of describing them. Thus, it’s time for a change, say the studio. 
In a blog post published today on Mimimi Games’ website, the studio announced they’re going to be referring to their work as “Stealth Strategy” games going forward, and they’re hoping this new genre label will help prospective players better understand their special blend of silent assassination tactics. This kind of shift isn’t without its challenges, though, so I caught up with the team at Mimimi to talk more about this newfound shift, and how it’s going to lay the foundations for what’s to come in Codename Süßkartoffel.

The colorful adventure game was first revealed at the same event in 2020. It stars a young woman who leaves her isolated village to explore the world for the first time on her bike. Unfortunately, the world is on the brink of suffering a mysterious catastrophe, and the woman collects memories of her experiences before everything falls apart. The bulk of the gameplay, naturally, consists of cycling to different locations and meeting the colorful personalities who inhabit them. You’ll document your adventures by taking photographs and making recordings. 


Season: A Letter to the Future will be available on PlayStation consoles and PC (both Steam and Epic). It's worth noting that pricing differs by platform. The game costs $29.99 on console and $24.99 on PC with an additional 10% launch discount until February 7.]]></summary>

Still, I will write about the game here! Sorry supporters.
Anyway, what I want to talk about is Xenoblade 3 – so far, at least – never losing sight of its inner tutorial. I've been hit with new, sometimes dizzying tutorials, tens of hours into the game's story. Rather than being bummed out by this, I'm ecstatic. In fact, I'd argue it's what makes the experience so special.

The game was almost unplayable on PC because shader compilation was causing stuttering whenever anything new happened for the first time, which is not ideal in any game, but especially not an atmospheric horror game with jump scares. It's hard to be terrified by something if the game pauses for over a second when it happens.
Anyway, the point is that a patch was released over the weekend, and another yesterday. I'm out of town right now, so I haven't been able to install the second, but I did play test the first one, and whaddaya know? The Callisto Protocol ran smooth for me, using a PC with the recommended specs.

That's because it's designed to undercut the likes of the WD SN850, Seagate Firecuda 530 and Samsung 980 Pro, offering slightly slower sequential speeds at a lower price point. That tradeoff is one that I'd make in almost every situation, as you'll definitely notice the extra money in your wallet more than you'll notice a fractional difference in game load times!
The P5 Plus's 1TB model is the one discounted today, with a drop to £90.86 - that's the lowest price we've ever recorded for this model and a good value for a high-end SSD suitable for PC and PS5.

But Mina The Hollower was never meant to be the studio’s next game. It was a side project of Yacht Club Games designer Alec Faulkner - one that no one but him knew existed.
After raising over $1.2M on Kickstarter in February, I wanted to learn more about Alec’s journey from intern to game director, how he pitched his “Gothic Prototype” to the Yacht Club, and ultimately, how the team rallied behind him in hopes of delivering another series as prolific as Shovel Knight. The result is a 36-minute documentary covering the making of Mina The Hollower, which you can watch below.

Final Fantasy VII is experiencing a strange identity shift. The ongoing remake is changing the original canon in bold ways while spin-offs like the 2006 PlayStation 2 game Dirge of Cerberus are being folded in for larger roles in the main story. And then there are new spin-offs, like First Soldier, the online mobile battle royale shutting down early next year, and also plans for another remake called Ever Crisis, a mobile game that will reexamine Final Fantasy VII’s timeline. With all that swirling …]]></summary>

Competition regulators from the UK, the EU and the US have been questioning the deal, so in an attempt to reassure them last month Microsoft apparently offered Sony a ten-year commitment to keep selling Call Of Duty on Playstation. Today, Xbox Head Phill Spencer announced that they've made a similar 10-year CoD commitment to Steam and, uh, Nintendo, on which no CoD games currently exist. 
Nintendo have signed, while Valve CEO Gabe Newell says his company won't bother with a legal agreement, in part because they don't believe in "requiring any partner to have an agreement that locks them to shipping games on Steam into the distant future".

If Men Of War 2 and Company Of Heroes 3 weren't enough to keep you busy on the WW2 side of global historical conflicts, Petroglyph Games' The Great War: The Western Front will also be stepping into the trenches of WW1 at some point next year as well – literally, in this case, as planning, digging and capturing these muddy lines of defence will play a vital role in both its pre-combat Theatre Commander mode and busy real-time strategy battles. Recently, I got to play through one of its RTS battles, but what I found was a strategy game quite unlike its WW2 rivals. 
In some ways, this shouldn’t be surprising. As Petroglyph Games’ lead designer Chris Becker tells me over email, “WW1 is known for being a war of attrition and a battle of inches,” leading to fewer sweeping power plays when it comes to securing a victory. Indeed, your main concern here isn’t so much the winning of each individual battle, but maintaining your side’s National Will, which Becker says will be "in constant fluctuation" throughout the campaign – and with both the Allies and Central Powers to pick from here, that could mean very different things depending on who you choose. "It’s essential that players continue to monitor this, as the relentless toll that the war will take on National Will can result in overall victory or defeat," says Becker. "Authenticity is at the heart of this, we wanted to truly represent what 'victory' meant in the war - even with success, there is cost."

        <updated>2022-12-07T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Numskull Games and developer Dinosaur Bytes have released a new trailer for its nostalgic platformer, Clive 'N' Wrench, showcasing what to expect in the Christmas World level of the game. 
This trailer arrives alongside news that the 3D platformer inspired by the likes of Spyro the Dragon and Jak & Daxter will get a retail release in the U.S. and Canada as well as a retail release in a "number of international retailers in February 2023 alongside its European launch." The game will be available digitally as well on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via Steam and GOG. Physical releases will include standard and collector's editions on PlayStation and Switch. 
Check out the new Christmas World showcase trailer below: 


"No 3D platform is complete without an ice world and Clive 'N' Wrench takes that to eclectic levels with Iceratops, the game's very own prehistoric winter wonderland," a press release reads. "Mixing together Christmas cheer and the demise of the Dinosaurs, Clive 'N' Wrench are in for a challenge if they want to collet all the pocket watches and Ancient Stones the world has to offer.
 
Check out screenshots from the game below: 

"Clive 'N' Wrench is a brilliantly crafted 3D platforming paradise full of challenges, collectibles, and charismatic characters," the press release reads. "Starring Clive the rabbit and best friend Wrench, the monkey on his back, players will jump, roll, hover, and spin their way through time and space in a magical 1950s refrigerator on a heroic quest to thwart the tyrannical Dr. Daucus." 
Clive 'N' Wrench will feature 11 levels taking the titular characters through prehistoric winter wonderlands, ancient Egypt, the Wild West, and more. Clive 'N' Wrench will be released on February 24, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How the heck do you review Dwarf Fortress? Much like the procedurally generated world spat out at the start of every game, there’s already a huge pile of established lore and history out there from the 16 years it’s been around. It’s like being asked to review Lord of the Rings. It's a vast undertaking, and there aren't any friendly eagles on hand to cut through its dense mythos. Prior to releasing on Steam, I had put a few dozen hours into what is now known as Dwarf Fortress Classic (which is still available for free from Bay 12's website), split over several different periods of time. Thing is, I never really got very far. I’d find a good tutorial, lose a few fortresses to horrible mistakes and then really get established. But then I’d be distracted by the realities of everyday life and by the time I got back to it, I’d forgotten everything and all my resources were hopelessly out of date because of all the wonderful, lovingly detailed updates. Then the cycle would start again. 

The good news is that this new version of Dwarf Fortress released on Steam does an admirable job of making the game considerably more approachable. I was apprehensive at first, but then something clicked and I lost the first of what would be many afternoons over the past fortnight, safe in the knowledge that when I eventually stepped away from this goliath, I’d be able to come back without feeling overwhelmed and have to start all over again. It’s still good ol’ Dwarf Fortress, but this is the most accessible the game has ever been while still being deep, demanding and a legend worthy of being inscribed on a mudstone goblet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ixion starts by asking the question "What if Homeworld was a management sim?". It then proceeds to answer that question in a comprehensive and convincing manner. Bulwark Studios' star hopping epic takes the operatic, elegiac grandeur of Relic's RTS classic, but replaces the space battles with a chewy mixture of stellar logistics.
Also like Homeworld, it's a darned stylish thing. The game commences with a spectacular intro cutscene wherein a futuristic space-shuttle launches from Earth, breaking through the atmosphere to dock with a gigantic, revolving space-station like a chromed hubcap off some petrolhead's pride & joy. The cutscene neatly transitions into the play-perspective, where you see that same shuttle slide into the docking bay from the cold void outside. Welcome to the Tiqqun, Administrator. Your long journey starts here.

Unlike Dragon Quest 11, Treasures is an action game with open environments and a focus on collecting valuables.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiple beta releases often indicate lots of bugs to be fixed, but in this case we got carried away adding features and thought more testing was needed. New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details). If you’ve been working on an entry for the title game competition, it’s time to finish and submit it! Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>
