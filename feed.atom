We're also continuing to see the rise of expansions for some of the most famous games out there, from World of Warcraft: The War Within to Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail. 


With all that said, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer number of game releases as the months go on, especially if you're partway through a playthrough and learn that more games are launching the same week.

This could lead to you making frequent trips back home to store items in your chest, or otherwise selling or dropping items that you would preferably like to keep. Rather than doing this, there is a relatively easy way to give yourself some space to work with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite's Fall Guys collaboration event has officially arrived, and with it comes multiple obstacle courses in Creative Islands and Battle Royale mode. However, to access the course in BR mode, you'll need to find special statues known as Bean Idols, which only appear in a certain area. Hfere's how to find Bean Idols during the Fortnite X Fall Guys event.


Bean Idol locations in Fortnite X Fall Guys event


Bean Idols are golden statues that spawn exclusively in Classy Courts. As you exit the Battle Bus and glide toward this landmark, you'll spot the obstacle course in the sky, with light beams surrounding it. Each light shows the location of a Bean Idol.

If you're already on the ground in another region, you can run over toward the obstacle course and Fall Guys character icon on your map near Classy Courts. As you approach the area, you'll spot the lights in the sky, allowing you to find the statues and participate in the obstacle course.


What do Bean Idols do in the Fortnite X Fall Guys event?


Bean Idols are the key to participating in the Battle Royale version of the Fall Guys obstacle course. Once you interact with the statue, your character will turn into a Fall Guys bean. A timer will begin immediately after, giving you a limited time to complete the obstacle course to maximize your rewards.

Although other players won't directly hurt you during it, they can sabotage your efforts and slow you down. You can also get caught in the Storm if you're unlucky with circle spawns, so keep an eye on your map and the Storm timer as you're running the course.


Your rewards after completing the Fall Guys obstacle course depend on your time. Earning gold will reward you with valuable, rare weapons and consumables, while lower tiers will give you more common items. Nonetheless, they're great prizes to claim as long as you don't get eliminated shortly after.

We had Deviator last week - now, it's time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of Perennial Order. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a "plant horror" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable "Instinct" abilities and one-hit deaths.
In a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it "Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those "painterly" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as "rotted" and "unhallowed" and "manky". It's out on 6th September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In College Football 25's Dynasty mode, the 3-star rated schools arguably represent the best starters.


A school with a 3-star Prestige Level is right in the middle of the road between the elites and the ones that might not be good enough. Most of these schools have decent squads, but there's still room for improvement. By selecting one of the names from the following list, you have a comfortable start on the one hand, and on the other, there's still work to be done.


Top 10 3-star schools to pick in College Football 25 Dynasty mode


The term "10 best" doesn't automatically mean the best ten teams that have a Prestige Level of 3 or 3.5 stars. Instead, I have considered ten fun save ideas you can have at this particular Prestige Level.

BYU Cougars

Schools like Washington St. Cougars and BYU Cougars might have decent Prestige Levels, but their squads are pretty weak for this level. There are schools at 2 and even 1-star Prestige Levels in College Football 25's Dynasty mode with better squads. However, a decent program rating will help you during recruitment.


Of course, there are plenty of schools at this level with great squads, but the room for improvement creates a challenge that's not too difficult but also not too simple.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Choosing a school with a 2-star Prestige Level in College Football 25's Dynasty mode has a healthy balance of challenges.


Usually, the schools with a 2-star Prestige Level have decent squads to begin with, so you have a solid base upon which to build. However, the Prestige Level is still not high enough to attract the biggest talents right away. In fact, schools at this level represent what I call an "average pick." You can have a lot of fun with these schools, and there are some decent choices worth considering in Dynasty mode.


10 best 2-star schools to consider in Football 25 Dynasty Mode


In case you aren't aware, the star rating of a school in College Football 25 isn't a grade of its squads. Instead, it's a composite average of all your program's grades. This opens up some unique challenges - a few squads have good ratings but relatively poor program ratings, while it's the exact opposite for some.


School
Prestige Level
OVR
OFF
DEF


Army Black Knights
2.5
74
76

Boise State Broncos
2.5
81

If you're up for a challenge, the Army Black Knights could be an exciting save. While the school has the weakest starting squad on this list, it enjoys a better program rating than most of the other names mentioned here. On the other hand, the Memphis Tigers have a relatively poor Prestige Level rating compared to the quality of their squad.


Do understand that picking a school with a 2-star Prestige Level can be a substantial challenge and could require many hours to set up a strong foundation.

Došlo k úspěšnému startu a vypuštění sond z rakety Ariane 6, Boeing vyslal Starliner na oběžnou dráhu, kde nyní jeho pasažéři neplánovaně už druhý měsíc setrvávají. KiCAD má novou verzi a blíží se konference k jeho dalšímu vývoji. Objevil se nový čip kombinující RP2040 s ethernetem a povedlo se na čipu vytvořit pulzní safírové lasery. Jsou vám tyto novinky málo? Pak jsou na Virtuální Bastlírnu připravená i obecnější hardwarová témata!

Za HW lze probrat zajímavé nově objevené parazitní jevy v SiC MOSFETech, jak se dá operační zesilovač "zaseknout" nebo k čemu jsou dobré ztrátové koaxiální kabely a kde je sehnat. Samozřejmě bastlíři narazili i na kuriozity, například doutnavkovou logiku nebo plošňák, jehož součástí je ohýbačka na THT součástky.

Software ani tentokrát nezůstane stranou - kromě již zmíněné nové verze KiCADu se dá podívat na stavbu linuxového managovaného switche, NanoKVM, převod videa z DisplayPortu na eink nebo emulátor NESu na Picopadu.

Jak je zvykem, s postupem večera se jistě přejde i k lehce bizarním tématům - kupříkladu, co provedl CrowdStrike, jak zprovoznit Doom na erotických hračkách pro pány, jak vypadá nestandardní 12V USB nebo jak se ztrácí některé části audio záznamů z CD, protože je většina SW neumí správně přečíst.

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 7. srpna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

Request playtest access through Steam


The most straightforward way to get into the Alpha is to request access to the alpha playtest through Steam. It’s easy, and it only takes a moment.


Simply visit the Steam store page for Delta Force: Hawk Ops. Scroll down past the media scroller, and beneath “Coming Soon,” there is a window that says “Join the Delta Force Playtest.” Click the button that says “Request Access.”

Sadly, nearly 14 years later and we still haven't had a new Fallout from the Avowed studio. Oh well, at least we still have plenty of mods to keep us amused.


And amused I am, thanks to this one from Nexus Mods user SadWeeble in which NPCs in New Vegas literally explode randomly. The game itself is already known for its dark humor and elements of the slightly absurd, so this should basically fit right into your normal playthrough.

As this is an Early Access roadmap, there is the possibility that time frames may change and the update schedule may alter slightly. Regardless, this roadmap provides a good idea of what players of Fields of Mistria have to look forward to from the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Villagers and Studio Plane Toast are closer to nailing down a release date for their post-apocalyptic adventure, Caravan SandWitch. It will be out in September for PC, PS5, and Switch. The exact day hasn’t been announced.


Based on the name, if you asked me what Caravan SandWitch was, I would have guessed that it was a whimsical food truck game. Not so, as it’s actually a sci-fi, post-apocalyptic exploration game set on the planet Cigalo. It’s post-apocalyptic in the sense that humans ruined the environment, as we’re wont to do. There wasn’t an actual apocalypse there in the cosmic or religious sense.




Caravan SandWitch is billed as a “semi-open” world. It’s a journey, and along the way, you meet folks and help them with their problems. You drive across a “Provence-like” world in a van. There is no combat, no death, no timer. The art style and aesthetic execution look top-notch based on the trailers.


It’s been in development for a while, starting off as a small indie project that was described as an anti-Mad Max. There was also a demo released a while back. From what I hear, it did a good job highlighting the graphics and movement system, but ended abruptly before you got to any real meat. Hopefully, the meat is good.


We’ll find out next month when Caravan SandWitch launches on PC, PS5, and Switch.

Cat Quest has been a beloved series for close to a decade now. From offering a unique world in the first game to adding co-op in the second, it has always tried to shake things up for the action-RPG genre. Cat Quest III feels like another switch-up for the series, taking what felt great about previous games and seeking to tell a charming pirate adventure that keeps you surprised. After sinking 15 hours into The Gentlebros' latest adventure, it is safe to say everything about Cat Quest III is fantastic.
The adventure began with us choosing our feline Purrivateer and arriving in the Purribean, an archipelago filled with Pi-rats to defeat who are on the hunt for the North Star Treasure. With our spirit companion, who is also searching for the North Star Treasure, we piloted our ship and ventured across land and sea to find the mythical treasure, defeating Pirate Lords in a variety of dungeons and uncovering a myriad of secrets along the way.

Those familiar with Nintendo hardware and their development codenames will know that the GameCube was once known as the 'Dolphin'. In fact, this is probably one of the more well-known codenames in console history, aside from maybe the 'Revolution' for the Wii and the 'NX' for the Switch.
A prototype of the GameCube had been known to exist, but the only photo of the fabled device was so blurry it could have potentially passed as a UFO or Bigfoot sighting. Now, however, we've got a fresh new look at the 'Nintendo Dolphin' courtesy of ConsoleVariations on social media. The account posted an image of the console with a clear view of the logo and disc tray.

If you're squinting at the trailer and visuals and thinking "Wait, isn't this already on Switch?", then adjust your glasses. Stumble Guys is the latest game to blend the battle royale with crazy party games. It's colourful, it's full of costumes, and the player characters have big, black, oval eyes. No, it's not Fall Guys — it's Stumble Guys.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games has rolled out the new LEGO Fortnite v30.40 update, which brings fast travel feature through the Battle Bus. Players can now build new bus stations in their worlds, and use them to fast travel anywhere within their world.


Bus Stations will already be established in your existing worlds with this new update, but players can build their own by destroying the current Bus Station. This will give them Rift Shards, which is required for the Station. Players can get on to a Battle Bus from the station and travel to another Station of their choice.

This LEGO Fortnite update has also made it possible for players to edit the settings of their existing worlds. This means players no longer have to create a new world just to try out a world with different settings.


LEGO Fortnite players can now change all settings of a world but there are some restrictions still there. Fortnite players cannot change the world mode, and Player Elimination settings cannot be changed as well. Moreover, locked settings from Expert mode cannot be changed.


LEGO Fortnite also offers a new Pirate Lifestyle Bundle that players can purchase from the Item Shop. Update v30.40 has also added five new styles for existing Outfits in LEGO Fortnite including an Indiana Jones outfit, and outfits for Abyss, Antheia, The Cube Queen, and Ember.

My feelings about the series have settled back from self-righteous fury over its Pentagon-sponsored war-fellating to a quieter, regretful sense that there have maybe been enough Call Of Duty games now, and that it would be nice if we could fill that infamous late October/early November release slot with, I don't know, games about witches instead, or maybe just turn it into a public holiday and spend the week lying on a mattress regarding the ceiling. Still: I've skinned and filleted enough COD in my time to know that Black Ops 6's new "omnimovement" system is going to ruffle as many feathers as it smooths. The short version is that it turns you into Max Payne.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In his Vampire Survivors review, Matt Cox described the game as something he could play with "one hand in a packet of crisps". I think about this quite often, actually, as someone whose largely offline friends (or Fortnite/FIFA pals) ask me to recommend them a game that's good or interesting. Show them something popular like Elden Ring and, despite its grandeur, it might prove too much in all facets. But Vampire Survivors? It's an easy sell: simple, digestible, ridiculous value.
All of this is to say, One BTN Bosses is from the same school of the easy sell. You can fight bosses with one hand in a packet of pickled onion Space Raiders, after all.

Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure. Potion-punk. Slime-swing. Limit breakcore etc.

I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.
The only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: "Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article." My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To celebrate the release of Helldivers 2's first major update, Escalation of Freedom, developer Arrowhead Game Studios is giving away a new free armor set. Some players can get this armor early, though others will need to wait for it to arrive a few days after the early access giveaway. 


The TR-40 Golden Eagle armor is a lovely set that's clearly inspired by the fan art the community has been creating for their beloved Eagle-1. This is the name of the pilot who flies across the battlefield, deploying all the Eagle Stratagems. Don't confuse them with the pilot of the Pelican extraction ship, who is very much a different character in Helldivers 2 lore and is simply on pick-up duty.

You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.
It doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.

Star Wars Outlaws is set to release at the end of this month, and it will be the first-ever open-world Star Wars game.


We already know that those who have pre-order Star Wars Outlaws will get access to the Kessel Runner bonus pack, which offers cosmetic items for Kay and Nix, her speeder.

There are also two story expansions planned for Star Wars Outlaws. The first story expansion, Star Wars Outlaws: Wildcard, will be released in Fall 2024. Ubisoft teased the Wildcard expansion, saying that Kay will “infiltrate a high-stakes Sabacc tournament” in this expansion.


Alongside the story expansion, there will be two cosmetic bundles coming out as well, called the Hunter's Legacy and Cartel Ronin which will offer cosmetics for Kay, Nix, and Kay’s Trailblazer spaceship.


The second story expansion is titled Star Wars Outlaws: A Pirate’s Fortune. This expansion will be released in Spring 2024, and Kay will be running into “veteran pirate Hondo Ohnaka, who is looking to settle old scores with a ruthless gang of pirates” during this expansion, as per Ubisoft.


Star Wars Outlaws will be released on August 30, 2024, for PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC.

Slated for 2025 on Nintendo Switch, Fate/Extra Record is currently only confirmed for Japan, but Bandai Namco's involvement in the Type-Moon-developed dungeon crawler makes a Western release fairly likely. The remake will boast overhauled visuals and a new combat system, both of which can be glimpsed in the new trailer alongside the usual visual novel mechanics and explorative segments.

When the Switch arrived on the scene in 2017, one of the launch titles included 1-2-Switch - a multiplayer party game utilising the many features of the Joy-Con controllers. Somehow, this title got a sequel in 2023 called Everybody 1-2-Switch and while it dropped out of sight pretty quickly, it has now made a surprising comeback.
As highlighted by Vooks.net, more than a year after its release, the sequel has returned to the top spot in Australia as the best-selling video game. Yes, between 22nd - 28th July 2024, it managed to beat heavy hitters like Grand Theft Auto V and outperformed sports titles like NBA 2K24 and EA Sports College Football 25.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've just begun a new game of Fields of Mistria, you're going to have a lot of quests to complete in the coming in-game days. There's definitely no shortage of things for you to do, but first and foremost, the bridge needs to be fixed. 


After Balor guides you over the broken bridge and into town as you first arrive, you'll have a few days to settle into your new farm home before the residents of Mistria arrive with their first big request. They need to repair the bridge in order to enable travel in and out of Mistria, and as a perk of this, the Saturday Market can begin being held again. 


How to get a Pickaxe and repair the bridge in Fields of Mistria


Screenshot by Destructoid


At some point in the first week of your new life in Mistria, you'll receive a letter in the mail from Adeline, asking you to aid in repairing the bridge. After receiving this letter, head east to the bridge in order to trigger a cutscene. 


After this cutscene, a donation box will appear next to the bridge, and you'll need to donate the following resources: 



60 Wood


60 Stone



You should already have an Axe to gather the needed Wood, thanks to an early morning meeting with Eiland, when you discovered the statue of Caldarus behind a tree on your farm. He'll give you the Worn Axe as a reward, and you can then use it to gather the 60 required Wood.





To get a Pickaxe, you'll need to pick up a quest from the Request Board in town. The quest you need is called ‘Do a Bro a Favor’, and simply requires you to head to the Blacksmiths and talk to Olric. When you speak to him, he’ll give you an Worn Pickaxe which you can then use to mine any small rock and get between one and two Stone. 


Once you've got 60 wood and 60 Stone, you can head back to the bridge and place the resources into the box. Then all that's left to do is head back to Adeline to hand in the quest, triggering another cutscene and successfully repairing the bridge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the best ways to streamline your gameplay in Fields of Mistria is by unlocking new skills and perks. However, doing this requires you to earn an almost-currency outside of Tesserae — Essence. 


Once you’ve removed the tree from in front of Caldarus’ statue and replaced his head, he’ll come to you in a dream and tell you about Essence and how to get it, but it may be a little unclear from his description, so I’ve got you covered.

Once you’ve unlocked the ability to get it, Essence can appear randomly from many daily activities, including:



Farming


Mining


Fishing



You’ll automatically absorb these Essences, so they’re easy to miss, but to see how many you have, simply check the UI. Essence appears just under your Tesserae, displayed in the top right corner of the screen. 


How to spend Essence in Fields of Mistria


Once you’ve stacked up some Essence, you can spend it by approaching Caldarus’ statue and pressing Q. After doing this, you’ll be able to select one of the disciplines with skills and perks to unlock:

Select an area in which you’d like to improve, and you’ll be given a list of available skills and perks. Clicking on each of them will tell you what it does, and the amount of Essence it costs is shown underneath.

As you increase your level in each skill, you'll be able to unlock more useful perks and better skills to use.

Back in 2021, we saw the release of Half-Life: Alyx. Despite launching to critical acclaim, it was a VR exclusive, meaning those without headsets were left unable to experience the latest iteration in Valve's long-running series. Still, it was a positive sign that Valve is willing to revisit its iconic franchise, offering hope that a Half-Life 3 could finally be on the way. 2007's Half-Life 2: Episode Two is the last time we saw a non-VR Half-Life, so it's a wait that could realistically span two decades before …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Valorant being in open beta now, console players can get in on the fun that PC players have been experiencing for years. That being said, is Valorant crossplay compatible between PC and PS5? Here’s what we know.


Is Valorant crossplay compatible between PC and PS5?


Unfortunately, Valorant does not support crossplay between PC and PS5, nor does PC have that option with Xbox consoles. Due to the nature of the game, PC players do have a massive advantage over console players. This isn’t a game like Overwatch or recent Call of Duty games where the TTK (Time to Kill) is high enough so that those playing on a controller can have a fair gunfight. 


The good news is that if you have a friend who plays on PC and you wish to play with them, cross-progression is an option. Whether you want to bring your console account to PC or they bring their PC account to an Xbox Series X/S or PS5, it’s possible.


Is Valorant crossplay between PS5 and Xbox?


Luckily, PS5 and Xbox players can match up and squad up together on Valorant. Since players on both consoles are on the same playing field, there are no advantages or disadvantages over the other. 


Just make sure you actually have the feature enabled so you can broaden your search pool when matchmaking.

How to enable crossplay on Valorant (PS5 and Xbox only)


By default, you should have crossplay enabled on Valorant if you’re playing the open beta on PS5 or Xbox. However, just to double-check that it’s on, press your menu or options button on your controller to bring up the Options menu.


From here, select Settings. In the General tab, find the Privacy section and see that “Allow Crossplay” is set to on. You can also set other important options like limiting friend requests and hiding names.


So, unfortunately, you can’t match or link with PC players if you’re on PS5 or Xbox, but you can with other console players.

There were some issues with the pacing of this season, though I’d argue that’s largely because of the way the showrunners have chosen to adapt Fire & Blood, George R. R.…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The mayor of a small municipality in Brazil recently hosted a public screening of the blockbuster hit "Inside Out 2". The open-air town square event was a great success, but not without critique. Watermarks on the meters-high screen showed that the public was watching a pirated copy of the film.  When the press got wind of it, the major countered that "everyone was happy", which is hard to argue with, especially since there are no official cinemas nearby.

It's an extraordinarily unique kit for the path, and perhaps worth checking out even if she's not your usual cup of tea. 


If you're eager to build March 7th in Honkai's 2.4 update,  here's everything you need to know to put together the best build for March 7th's Hunt path. 


Strongest March 7th Hunt Build in Honkai: Star Rail


March 7th's Hunt path has many typical characteristics of your typical Hunt character, but, thanks to her kit, she can also play similarly to a Harmony character, though admittedly not quite as strong.

Multiple towns and biomes have been featured in a new The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom trailer uploaded Monday. It shows the castle town of Hyrule, the hot Gerudo Desert, the scenic Jabul Waters, the green Faron Wetlands, as well as Kakariko Village near Eldin Volcano. 




The Echoes of Wisdom trailer also teases the conflict between the Sea Zora and the RIver Zora, which Zelda will likely help resolve during her journey.

Since appearing first in 2009, the PvZ series has been a staple for lovers of tower defense games. With the emergence of more powerful hardware, EA has experimented more with the main franchise. While Plants vs Zombies 3 is yet to go live globally, let's look at how the rest of the fully-released titles hold amongst each other.

It's no secret that EA Sports is optimistic about the Rush game mode, which will be implemented in Ultimate Team (along with FC Clubs and Career Mode). While Ultimate Team has plenty of finer elements that the developers could have showcased, the audience mostly got an explanation of how Rush will work. It's pretty obvious that Rush, being an upcoming addition to Ultimate Team, got so much attention. But that meant not seeing other pieces of the mode, some of which have been core parts of Ultimate Team over the years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the launch of the Beta Playtest for the mech-centric PvPvE title Mecha BREAK, we're quickly realizing just how much of a difference there is between the 13 different mechs. We've put together this Mecha BREAK Tier List to order the raw power potential of each of the Mechs available in the Beta Playtest.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Mecha BREAK Mech Tier List


While every Mech in Mecha Break has its uses, some are certainly overall more stronger than others. However, as this is an early Beta Playtest, it's very likely that the mechs will continue to receive balancing tuning ahead of release. As such, this Mech Tier List for Mecha Break is based purely off of the state of the beta playtest. 


All mechs in the S Tier category are very strong and versatile, and always a solid option for any battle on any map in any mode in Mecha Break. Those in the A Tier are overall strong as well and should be able to hold up in every scenario, but may be weaker than an S Tier counterpart. The mechs in the B Tier have specific uses that make them advantageous in certain scenarios, but overall not as versatile as those in the S or A Tier. Finally, the lone mech in the C Tier, Falcon, is a bit under tuned at the moment and needs a little bit of lover to be considered a competitive option compared to the other mechs.


Using this Tier List, you can choose which Mechs you want to focus on farming currency for in order to unlock them. Of course, be sure to pick a mech that fits with your playstyle so make sure you're having fun! Here is our Mech Tier List:


S Tier



Aquila


Hurricane


Panther


Stego



A Tier



Luminae


Pinaka


Skyraider


Welkin



B Tier



Alysnes


Inferno


Narukami


Tricera



C Tier



Falcon

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ever Banega FUTTIES SBC is now live in EA FC 24 Ultimate Team, and you can complete the challenge to add a new promo card to your squad. 


Banega becomes the latest entrant to the FUTTIES promo. Since he's part of an SBC, all players have an equal chance to get the card. Let's take a look at how you can unlock the item, and if you should complete the challenge at all. 


EA FC 24 Ever Banega FUTTIES SBC tasks


The Ever Banega FUTTIES SBC is a beginner-friendly challenge in EA FC 24. There's just one task to complete in order to unlock the card. There are certain conditions that have to be met during squad submission. 


Task - Ever Banega FUTTIES



Min. 1 Players from: Argentina


Min. Team Rating: 86



EA FC 24 Ever Banega FUTTIES SBC solutions


Here's the solution to complete the Ever Banega FUTTIES SBC in EA FC 24. 


Task - Ever Banega FUTTIES



Fabinho 84


Gabriel Megalhaes 84


Dani Parejo 86


Gregor Kobel 87


Niklas Sule 84


Ewa Pajor 87


Thomas Muller 84


Luka Modric 87


Romelu Lukaku 84


Leroy Sane 84


Lautaro Martinez 87



The Banega FUTTIES version has one shortcoming - the lack of pace. 85 Pace is decent, but it's the endgame now, and you need midfielders with at least 90 Speed. The item has four excellent playstyles+, including Incisive Pass and Pinged Pass. The 5* Weak Foot is a bonus, while Anticipate+ allows the card to be used in a defensive role to an extent. 


Don't expect god-like things from the FUTTIES version of Banega - it's a good card meant for beginners.

Red Candle Games is best known for cult horror hits Detention and Devotion, both of which are absolutely excellent and well worth picking up. But the studio's newest game is something completely different from the team, and while the game is currently exclusive to PC, a new rating suggests that it will be coming to Nintendo Switch.
Spotted by Gematsu, Nine Sols has been rated for all consoles including Switch in Taiwan. The game is a blend of Hollow Knight and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, a potent combo that combines beautiful 2D platforming and combat that focuses heavy on parrying and breaking enemy guard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Entry to Valhalla secured.
Since the release of Volgar the Viking in 2013, fans have been itching for a full sequel to the Rastan-inspired action platformer for over a decade at this point. Now the time has finally arrived. Thanks to a partnership between developer Crazy Viking Studios and retro specialist Digital Eclipse, we can step back into the boots of Volgarr as he embarks on a quest that will prove more deadly than any he’s faced. The result is a game that, frankly, feels improved in just about every conceivable way, making Volgarr the Viking II not only one of the best 2D action platformers on Switch, but one of the best of all time.
Let’s start with the obvious: Volgarr II is brutal. There have been several adjustments made to make the game more approachable to newcomers, which we’ll get into in more detail later, but you should know that this isn’t for the faint of heart. You will die in Volgarr II, and you will die a lot. Like the original, getting through each stage is an exercise in learning the layout, anticipating every enemy position, and observing their attack patterns and weaknesses. When entering each new area for the first time, attempting to storm through as quickly as you can is simply not an option; you can be sure that there will be something lying in wait to bring your journey to a swift and bloody end.

We can also see a standard Super Star nestled in the sandy beach, which suggests that Mario and Luigi's vacation getaway probably wasn't Isle Delfino, where the native Shine Sprites boast a different design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the neat things about Norland's fantasy medievalism is that specialist knowledge is tied to characters. So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having "wise conversations". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like "manners" from the teachers you assign to them.

It seems just yesterday I was getting very jealous at Matthew Castle (RPS in peace) for getting to preview the sequel to my beloved Shadows Of Amn. Fast forward several turns, Larian’s RPG banger is officially one year old since release, and there’s now a much higher chance that strangers at pubs will understand why my failed romance with Jaheira as a youth was such a deeply heartbreaking experience. Baldur’s Gate 3 itself looks to be done and dusted following the upcoming patch, but Larian now seem to be gearing up for their next charm offensive with a new “community focused” YouTube channel, as well as further teasing their two games currently in development.

Nintendo's share price has tanked by more than 15% on Monday morning amid global fears of a US recession and rising tensions in the Middle East.
As highlighted by Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of industry consultancy Kantan Games, almost every major Japanese gaming company saw a drop in share price as Japan's Nikkei fell by more than 12%, its biggest drop since the so-called 'Black Monday crash' of 1987.

Nintendo has had another fairly quiet month on the Switch — Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition was the big one, with the likes of Ace Combat 7's long-awaited Switch port proving to be a top-tier rerelease. But the eShop has been booming, as per usual. That's what we focus on for eShop Selects, and as usual, our staff and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from the list of games we've reviewed, and we give you the winners (and the best of the rest).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never learned to drive, but every so often a well-meaning friend tells me I'd be good at it, because 'look, Edwin, you play all those driving games, surely they've taught you the basics'. Friend, here is what driving games have taught me: traffic lights are there for regional flavour; drifting is the same thing as cornering; other cars exist to serve as bumper cushions when overshooting a turn. Certainly, nobody wants a guy whose ideas about automobiles come from 2018's Wreckfest to be involved in the school run. On which note: THQ Nordic have just announced Wreckfest 2 - a fresh helping of destruction derby with fancified visuals and newly animate drivers who flinch and gesticulate when other drivers smash into them. Witness the carnage in the announcement trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a hell of a thing to showcase a remake weeks after kiboshing the developers of the original game. In early July, Gothic creators Piranha Bytes were reportedly shuttered as part of Embracer Group's mad race to trim costs, following their decade-long acquisition binge. Watching THQ Nordic's new Gothic Remake trailer, below, feels a little like watching a vivisectionist parade about in somebody else's skin. Still, the remake's developers Alkimia Interactive aren't to blame for Embracer's fuck-ups, and I am selfishly happy to see Gothic return as an Unreal Engine 5 production - even if I didn't play the original back in 2001.


Sin did play the original game, and in her 2016 retrospective, she paints an absorbing picture of a dark fantasy "microsociety" in which every community "has a reason to exist, a means of providing for itself, a social order, and a long term goal". It's a setup that reminds me of my beloved Roadwarden, even as the sight of grumpy lizards slinking through undergrowth has me silently mouthing "fus roh dah".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Titan Quest 2! Now there's a name you can set your watch by. No colons, no bespoke jargon, no tortuous subtitles like "Gaia's B.O.U.N.T.Y." or "Hyperion's Wild Rumpus" - just the steadying prospect of a titanic quest that, who knows, may involve actual titans. The action-RPG beneath the moniker appears similarly straightforward: it's about following a plot thread through a mythological world in top-down view, smashing Ancient Greek giga-crabs and the like to obtain shinier, pointier varieties of gear. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that there's an endgame in which you farm monsters for crafting materials.


Like Pandora opening her box, but without the accompanying tidal wave of sickness, curses and death, THQ Nordic have released a new trailer that talks you though all of this in detail. Here it is...

Every level would introduce a new goo type or a twist on the basic bridge-building puzzle that challenged you to get a gaggle of gurgling balls to the nearest pipe. World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes. That pursuit doesn't always result in pleasing new levels, though. There is a "hit and miss" feeling to things this time around. But those hits are hits. For anyone who has spent the last 16 years yearning for more sticky structure-building: I hope you like comically unpredictable fluids.

According to Totilo, Bungie leadership "overstated their studio’s financial prospects to Sony" after the latter bought Bungie in 2022 for $3.6 billion.

It got shut down last year as Activision focused their efforts elsewhere, making the map unplayable. But you can now revisit those bullet-strewn beaches. In theory, anyway. Activision have released it as a 4GB open-source project that can be explored in a 3D model-viewing tool. That's cool. But among their reasons for doing so, there lies a predictably grubby logic: they want people to use the data to train AI.

In my brief time with massive Fallout 4 mod Fallout London, I’ve read a delightful terminal entry about a scientist who named his favourite radiated shrew “Big Dave,” thwacked several of said Radshrews with a walking stick, gulped down some expired pink wafers, and been informed of train delays due to “leaves on the track.”
“A British transport joke!” I said to myself, marinating in the sufficient amount of crown-mandated mild amusement. “Our organ-floggingly expensive yet vital public services are crap!” I was having a good time. Then the game public transported me straight to my desktop, and continued to do so at regular intervals over the next few hours, ranging from “just as this conversation was getting good” to “just as my save was about to load.” My upper lip almost quivered, I tell you.

I actually cannot remember when the beef started, but my mum reliably informs me that I was terrified to tears by this bear as a child. He yet survives, but mark my words: when the Woody Copters finally fall from their rusted hinges, I will salt the earth.
Happily, I didn’t spot any bear mascots in Planet Coaster 2’s new deep dive trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While he's "blown away" by the beach scenes in the first GTA 6 trailer, former Rockstar North technical director Obbe Vermeij thinks the forthcoming open worlder might underwhelm players hoping for a palpable technological update on GTA 5, which has been reworked and re-released extensively since its 2013 launch. This has less to do with GTA in itself, Vermeij says, than with the fact that changes in computing capacity today simply aren't as dramatic as in the days of the very first PlayStation. It's becoming rare, he suggests, that you see a "jump" akin to GTA going 3D.

So it comes as great news, then, that the devs have somehow taken that perfect dome, expanded it and polished it to an even greater sheen. We're talking about new guild assignments, new gadgets, better world generation, a new world, new monsters. The list is enormous and designed expressly around improved replayability - take that, Las Vegas Dome.

Among the wonderful sights contained in space-poking adventure game The Great Fluctus are: beans, slug milk, alien volleyball, egg arguments, and massive frog. Additional screenshots suggest this frog later acquires wings. Like a captive Generation Game host, I am helpless but to shout out more incredible sights as they flutter past on the conveyor belt of pure flippin' videogame before me. It’s got dance parties with horrible gorilla aliens. It’s got building, namely the Statue Of Liberty out of goop, just as George Washington’s goop clone intended. It’s also got just sitting on a bench, enjoying some lovely serene space scenery.  Feast your famished face on the trailer.

Specifically, laidback intercity services with nobody else in the quiet car and certainly, none of those screeching smaller bipeds, or "children" as they are scientifically known. That idyll is now lost to me thanks to Covid: I have vulnerable family members and continue to be careful about social distancing. As such I spend most train journeys these days lurking between carriages, trolling the door sensors and scowling furiously at anybody who visits the loo. But now, thanks to the obscene magic of video games, I can get my fill of authorial locomotivation once again.

In a pastime that’s had several decades to perfect the art of hitting men with sharp objects, that’s quite the accomplishment. Since releasing in 2022, Torn Banner have lavished the player base with free horses, angry peasants, and most recently, the Regicide update - hosting a climatic tete-a-tete between two angry crownmen. With work on No More Room In Hell 2 well underway though, Torn Banner have decided to call it on Chiv 2, which they now consider “feature complete.”

Original story:
Earlier this month it was reported that Skibidi Toilet, the YouTube phenomenon, may be heading to film and television via director Michael Bay. Now Invisible Narratives, a production company co-owned by Bay, has apparently sent a DMCA takedown notice to Garry Newman, citing the large number of Skibidi Toilet games and assets advertised within Garry's Mod.

Skibidi Toilet uses assets derived from Half-Life 2, however, and owes a lot to the Garry's Mod machinima scene. And the animation's original creator, best known as DaFuqBoom, is claiming innocence over the DMCA.

Peel back the curtains of American cultural hegemony however and you may find the true pulsing core of British comedy that lies beneath: innuendo. No American network is in a bidding war to import Vic and Bob or remake Bottom, and Carry On and Benny Hill are assumed to be anachronisms in our modern times, but Thank Goodness You're Here! enters the conversation with a nudge and a wink. It's a cheeky 2-3 hour adventure through a small northern town, and it's here to educate the entire world of our nation's obsession with sausages and bare bottoms.

It's being developed by Rotoscope Studios and it's a low-poly, 90s-inspired mix of dystopian RPG, survival, third and first-person shooter, with some roguelike bits slapped in there, as well. Whew, that's a lot. Potentially too much. But hey, I am here for something ambitious and interesting, of which it ticks both boxes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the first Something Of Mana game to come out in 15 years, Visions Of Mana is bound to be exciting some of you out there. Well, funnel all that anticipation into your mouse-clicking finger, because developers Square Enix have just put up a playable demo of the bright JRPG on Steam. I'm not sure how much the demo offers, as we're only told it includes "a section of the story, battles and exploration." But that's better than nothing, and with a full month before release, you have plenty of time to scope it out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Cleanfall you essentially play a Roomba that is trying to reverse the apocalypse because the apocalypse is messy. A Roomba capable of tunnelling through miles of procedurally generated, monster-infested crust so as to reorganise the Earth's core and bring about its ultimate objective - a sparkling living room. I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation. There are sprawling underground ecosystems to discover, yes, weird plants to harvest, fractious clumps of tentacles to appraise, avoid or slaughter. But all of these things are contemptible details to be swept up and bagged and thrown in the dumpster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller has posted a lengthy blog on Steam about the transition from 6v6 player matches in the first Overwatch to 5v5 in the poorly received free-to-play sequel. It's a juicy read for armchair designers and lapsed Overwatchers like myself, packing in analysis of class roles and the shift from the free choice of heroes to single hero picks and enforced team compositions.
In broad strokes, Keller summarises how the Overwatch experience has drifted away from "player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players". It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now "exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.

They often feel like a casualty of Marvel movie bloat. Mortal Kombat 1 was marketed as a "reboot", for example, but is really just a continuation of previous nonsense, with developers NetherRealm saying "I don't know, stick a multiverse in it." Yet from that multiverse now arrives another bad guy, bringing new story chapters for the fighting game's first big expansion, as well as extra characters like the liquid metal murderer from Terminator 2, a Conan of the barbarian persuasion, and the masked killer of the Scream movies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The immersive sim has seen a revival in recent years. Not only from larger studios like Arkane, keeping the faith alive with their time loops and space stations, but also from a bunch of smaller developers bravely exploring a typically ambitious genre. RPS has always had an affinity for these systemically luxuriant simulations, historically lauding the likes of the original Deus Ex as the best game ever made. But given everything that has come since, is that still the case? Only one way to find out: make a big list.

Let me start again. Animal caretaking horror game Zoochosis is about being a stressed-out zookeeper in a hideous zoo where the giraffes have tendrils coming out of their chests and the kangaroos have rows of chattering teeth in their marsupial pouch. There, got it right in the end. We've known about the development of this terror-heavy tourist attraction since its announcement early this year. But now the upcoming horror sim has been given an autumn release date in a new trailer.

That’s thanks to initial production units not being up to standards, an AMD executive admitted, and comes shortly after rivals Intel copped to a potentially chip-killing fault in their latest Core processors. Ah well, there’s always – oh, wait. No. Those are the only two.

The poems I've engaged with the most are those read out during wedding ceremonies, those that pop-up before the start of a horror game, or The Tiger by 6-year old Nael that occasionally pops up as I'm doomscrolling. But thanks to the multiplayer web game "fridge poetry", where you drag words to create poems, I might become a day-to-day poem guy. Going off my first effort, I don't think many will appreciate my career switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grit And Valor 1949 certainly evokes the tactics of Into The Breach, with its stompy machinery and floating tile battlegrounds. But, despite all appearances, this one isn’t actually turn-based at all. A tiley, tiny real time strategy then? Aye, and one that’s actually pretty frantic as it happens. Missions are snappy, intense skirmishes. You’ll fight off waves while trying to protect your useless, freeloading command vehicle. This threat, combined with on-the-fly tactical consider-me-do's like utilising cover and keeping rock-paper-scissors matchups in your favour ends up spawning something quite distinct. Please, do stomp on, preferably with less hypens for all our sakes.

And for some, it'll deliver what's needed: a fairly good time. A time marked by a loop that does hack 'n slash, management, and a dash of base repairs to an average degree. For me, though, and possibly many others, I simply don't think this mix ever truly captures what makes even the simplest of tower defence games so captivating.

The series was more satirical than King's Quest, less preachy than Police Quest, and not quite as adult as Leisure Suit Larry. Spearheaded by Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe - a pair of devs who called themselves "Two Guys from Andromeda" - Space Quest was renowned for its humour, and there was a nice sense of progression throughout most of the series, with Roger Wilco leveling up from working class spaceman to the head of his own Star Trek ship.

Even if the fallen culture you’ll defend against waves of gribblies offers fascinatingly few concrete details on its origins, there’s a lithe and impressionistic otherworldliness and use of colour in Cataclismo’s art that evokes unearthed layers of history. Also, everyone is just so gosh darn likeable, with their foppish hats plopped atop stretched bodies, and dialogue that remains resolute, chirpy, and eager, even when you’re click-marching these poor folk straight to their deaths.
Still, none of this will stop me will sacrificing every last man, woman, and child of these beleaguered warriors if it means preserving a single one of my immaculately crafted staircases.
