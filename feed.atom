In a live broadcast earlier this week, producer and director Naoki Yoshida outlined future ambitions, including making it possible to play all "main scenario dungeons of A Realm Reborn" with NPC pals instead of other players.

Yoshida also mentioned the game's first planned graphical update, and a partial roadmap of new content to come in future patches.

Bungie’s latest expansion for Destiny 2, The Witch Queen, is now live and so is the accompanying Season of the Risen that will run until May 24. 
To help celebrate the launch of this new expansion and subsequent season, the studio, which is being acquired by Sony, released a Season of the Risen overview trailer that highlights what Guardians should expect. As expected, it’s all centered around Savathûn and the Hive, which is now in possession of the Light. You can watch the trailer below:

As you can see, this season will be all about kiling Light-wielding Hive (and just good ole regular Hive, too). It seems a Cabal friend will be joining the fight to make it a little easier well. And of course, who could forget about the overarching villain, Savathûn the Witch Queen, who is sure to make virtually everything this season more challenging. 
Destiny 2’s Witch Queen expansion and Season of the Risen is now live. When you need a break from Savathûn, read this opinion piece about why Destiny 2’s recent season conclusion shows the good and bad of living game content and then watch this Destiny 2: The Witch Queen launch trailer. Check out this amazing Destiny 2 Savathûn statue after that.

Square Enix has released some new financial results for its first three quarters of Fiscal Year 2022-23, something companies like EA and Activision Blizzard did earlier this month, and in it, the company reveals that Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy did not meet sales expectations. 
This news comes alongside Square Enix revealing in its quarterly results that its net sales were lower this year than the same period in the previous fiscal year, which saw the release of titles like Final Fantasy VII Remake and Marvel’s Avengers on new-gen consoles. Speaking specifically to the release of Eidos-Montreal’s Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, Square Enix acknowledges that it reviewed quite well – Game Informer gave it a 8.5 out of 10. However, it underperformed financially. 
Click here to watch embedded media
“The HD Games sub-segment launched ‘Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy’ in Q3,” the results read. “Despite strong reviews, the game’s sales on launch undershot our initial expectations.”
Square Enix says that it has been using sales initiatives that it kicked off in November of 2021 to increase sales and the company intends to “work to continue to expand sales to make up for the title’s slow start.”
Hopefully, those sales can get Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy up to expectations, and even past it, because it certainly warrants a sequel that we’d like to see. For now, read Game Informer’s Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy review and then check out these Adidas sneakers inspired by the game. Read about this patch that added ray-tracing to the game after that.

Eyes up, Guardians! Savathûn, the Hive god and Witch Queen has harnessed the Light to do her bidding. With it, she has molded part of her throne world into an opulent white cathedral and has gifted her Lucent Brood with powers, not unlike those the Guardians wield. Survival for Earth's champions is a must, and doing so means taking the fight to Savathûn's home turf and facing her terrifying Light-wielding forces head-on.

Bandai Namco released a new launch trailer for Elden Ring, which hits consoles and PC this Friday, and it promises a celebration of war for champions of the Lands Between. 
As you might expect with an Elden Ring trailer, or really any From Software game trailer, it’s not easy to parse together exactly what’s happening. A narrator talks about a celebration of war, possibly in a tournament-like setting, while another talks about heroes becoming forsaken and more. It’s a lot to wrap one’s head around but even if you aren’t determined to piece together the new lore presented in the trailer, there’s plenty to see.

There are some new looks at bosses and enemies as well as new settings and locales, too. We even get a look at a boss that looks very celestial and Bloodborne-like – could there be a Bloodborne connection in Elden Ring? Who knows? For now, only time will tell and fortunately, we don’t have to wait long because Elden Ring hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this Friday, on February 25. 
If you’re curious as to when exactly you can head into the Lands Between, check out the Elden Ring global launch times. Read Game Informer’s Elden Ring cover story after that for tons of details about what to expect and then check out this exclusive Elden Ring gameplay featuring Castle Mourne.

No news is good news, they say — except when it's about Switch ports, in which case "no news" is sometimes a synonym for "please don't ask us about the Switch port".
In the case of Mediatonic's Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout, a battle-royale-style multiplayer game that met with great success in the early pandemic days of 2020, no news about the Switch port that they promised doesn't necessarily mean they've forgotten about it or given up.

The Hive queen named Savathûn has infiltrated all the major storylines, insinuating herself into the events shaping the story. Now, at long last, the Witch Queen’s trap is sprung, as she co-opts humanity’s most precious resource – the Light that gives power to its Guardians – and uses that power to make deathless warriors of her own.

You can see why, then, this canny fusion of droid and handheld has us so excited. Twitter account From4-LOMtoZuckuss spotted this amazing custom job by illustrator and toy designer Greg Dmnt, which takes a K-2SO action figure and combines it with part of a DMG-01 console. The finishing touch is a swanky new paint job, which looks pretty cool if you ask us.

His friend, Jeff Palmer, suggested they both go work for Nintendo. Palmer’s cousin Cliff worked there as a gameplay counselor; he got paid to play video games all day. Hudson and Palmer could do that, too, the latter said.
“Jeff sold it to me like, ‘Hey, we’re gonna sit in a cubicle and play games all day and answer phone calls,’” Hudson recalls. “And I was like, ‘Hell yeah.’”
In 1987, Nintendo launched its Nintendo Power Hotline. If a player encountered problems beating a video game, they could call the hotline and get advice from what Nintendo called a gameplay counselor. It was effectively a call center. It was also so much more than that.

I still appear to be untold miles away from the cool kind of jungley beachy bits from the promo screenshots. So far, though, I'm having a lot of fun, riding around on my big metal robot cow in its stunning world - a very beautiful game, is this, with lots of lens flare and dripping water and waving grass. A big and interesting world, and I am very much looking forward to playing more and reading insightful criticism and analysis of it. I would also like someone to explain the Pullcaster to me, because it's one thing in Horizon Forbidden West that, as far as I can tell, does not need to exist whatsoever.

The MLB The Show 22 Tech Test is heading towards its conclusion, with Sony San Diego also keeping busy promoting the baseball sim ahead of its early April release. Its Switch debut is a big deal, of course, though we were left rather disappointed in our hands on of the current test build.
To be fair to the marketing team, it's being honest in its promotion of the Switch-specific version, using genuine footage of the hybrid system's version rather than the spruced up 4K / 60fps performance seen on the more powerful PS5 / Xbox Series X|S. As you can see in the latest trailer above, it's utilising superstar two-way player Shohei Ohtani to promote it, while putting a big emphasis on portable play and having The Show on the go.

Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions’ latest movie, Uncharted, which is a prequel of sorts to the game series of the same name, have a hit on their hands. 
Fans of Naughty Dog’s Uncharted series were…apprehensive, to say the least, when it was first revealed that Tom Holland (Spider-Man: No Way Home) would be playing Nathan Drake alongside a Victor “Sully” Sullivan portrayed by Mark Wahlberg. That apprehension remained with each trailer revealed for the movie and while that feeling might still be felt, now that the movie is in theaters, it seems it might be destined for a sequel…]]></summary>

Tin Hearts first came onto our radar last year when it was unveiled by its publisher Wired Productions in a 'Direct'-style event. The trailer above set the scene nicely for a Victorian-era setting and, seemingly, gameplay reminiscent of Lemmings or even Mario vs. Donkey Kong. We recently had a slightly longer look in a media event, and it certainly strikes us as a game worth following.
In the new footage there was an extended look at how gameplay is shaping up, and we were immediately struck by a 'Pikmin' effect; the toy soldiers are tiny in the larger space of the real world. The video shows some variations in gameplay, too - in some parts the players was a 'spirit' controlling soldiers and items to get them to safety, which is where the Lemmings comparison comes in, but there were also brief snippets of a third-person perspective right behind an individual trooper. Overall, the scale of the toys and the recreation of the large spaces around them looked impressive.

And so we come to the end – for now – of Tetsuya Nomura’s iconic and in-no-way-confusing Kingdom Hearts series. Additionally, then, this is the end of our excursion into the nebulous Cloud; pun extremely intended. Yet, of course, for all the shade we throw at the concept of Cloud Versions and the myriad flaws they bring to the table, Kingdom Hearts 3 feels like the only game of the three that actually necessitated a Cloud Version to run on Switch. Of course, “necessitated” isn’t really the case; it could have been cut down/compromised to work, but if 1.5 + 2.5 ReMix doesn’t get a port, then there’s no way Kingdom Hearts 3 was going to.
This game was a long time coming, but we’d say that with the Re:Mind DLC (included here), it’s a very worthy sequel to the extremely large and feature-packed Kingdom Hearts 2, building on the series by adding features from previous games while remaining faithful to the feel and delivering a relatively satisfying conclusion to what is apparently the first major arc in the Kingdom Hearts series. Only took them 17 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark Souls begins by creating the universe. “In the Age of Ancients, the world was unformed, shrouded by fog,” intones the opening cinematic. “A land of gray crags, archtrees and everlasting dragons.” Those two sentences do a lot of heavy lifting. “We needed to conjure an image of the world in its previous static state, where concepts that we take for granted - the finite nature of life and all conceptual contrasts - were nonexistent,” says Ryan Morris, lead translator at Frognation, the Tokyo and London-based consultancy that has handled the majority of From's Souls or Souls-type projects, from the original Demon's Souls to this year's Elden Ring. “I think of the singularity that existed before the Big Bang.”

After announcing over the weekend that most ongoing Pokémon games like Pokémon Masters EX, Unite, and Sword And Shield will be receiving an update leading up to this year’s Pokémon Day on February 27, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl have received a new update. 
Titled Ver 1.2.0, this update is now live in the latest Pokémon remakes and it brings with it new Union Room and Colosseum features, some fixes to improve gameplay, and a stop to the use of “illicit” Pokémon. Here’s a full breakdown of what update Ver 1.2.0 entails:

Finally, I could live out my dream of sliding down tree branches like Disney's Tarzan, all while playing another gorgeous adventure from the makers of Old Man's Journey and Secrets Of Raetikon. Admittedly, I was surprised when I saw it was going to be part of this week's Steam Next Fest. The developers have said upfront that the game is only around an hour long, and with this week's demo stretching to a generous 20 minutes, part of me's now quite sad that I've already seen a third of it in action. 
The other part of me, however, is absolutely thrilled, and it's all down to my gibbon's sick, speed-boosting backflips.

Update: And another one bites the dust! Well, sort of — Nintendo Switch Sports is bringing the Wii Sports series back on Switch on 29th April, which means Wii Sports Club comes off this list.

Back in 2020 we asked you in a poll which games you'd most like to see return from Nintendo's previous console generation for an encore on Switch. Since then, we've seen a good handful of games from that selection make the generation jump, including The Wonderful 101: Remastered and Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water.

Ninja Issen is a game that first popped onto our radar in Summer 2021, as it was confirmed for Switch as part of Indie Live Expo. Originally planned for a 2021 release, it's now been shifted to a target of Summer 2022 and could be a bit of a sneaky hit to watch.
As you can see in the trailer it's heavily stylised and is aiming to deliver a 'hyper ninja action experience', which seems like an accurate description. It combines this with a cyberpunk aesthetic and seemingly a soundtrack that'll keep you awake to the action.

I'll be honest; I came up with this headline before I thought about what this article would really be about. Because, realistically, what can I say here? "Remember that blockbuster gaming franchise that everyone loves and has just gotten a film adaptation? They should make more of those." It's kind of a "no duh" situation. I'm not the first person to say they liked *good thing* and want another *good thing*. I should probably say something a little more sensational. Okay, fine: Uncharted is an incredibly unique, industry-shaping series that resonated with me powerfully, and we deserv…]]></summary>

He’s becoming one thick, square, sweaty muscle. Luke, on the other hand, looks way different from his recent debut in SFV, sporting a much more realistic hairstyle and veiny arms that would make John Cena jealous. We have almost no information on the game as of now, but that won’t stop us from thinking about the possibilities of what may come with SF6 or what we want the next big chapter in the series to be.

WWE 2K22 launches on March 11 and Visual Concepts/2K have slowly begun rolling out roster reveals. Every wrestling fan knows that the quality of the roster makes or breaks any wrestling game but that's become especially crucial for 2K22. The game arrives in the wake of a pandemic era that saw over 100 wrestlers fired by WWE, leaving fans worried and skeptical about who's left to plug up the holes. 
Using 2K’s official roster list, as well as combing through trailers and marketing materials, we’ve put together a list of over 70 confirmed superstars for WWE 2K22. It’s worth noting that 2K’s own roster lacks names that have appeared in trailers while other faces have been confirmed via their character portraits instead of an in-game model. We're also sure you can use this list to connect the dots on who will appear (such as missing tag team partners) that have not been formally announced. We’ll update this list as new wrestlers make the cut. 
Here is the confirmed roster so far with the most recent additions in bold. 
AJ Styles
Akira Tozawa
Angel Garza
Bret Hart
Candice LaRae
Cedric Alexander
Dakota Kai
Faarooq
Fabian Aichner
Jerry Lawler
Jim Neidhart
Jordan Devlin
Kane
Liv Morgan
Mace
Marcel Barthel
Maryse
Natalya
Otis
Papa Shango
R-Truth
Raul Mendoza
Sami Zayn
Santos Escobar
Sonya Deville
Stephanie McMahon
T-Bar
Ted Dibiase
Trent Seven
Trish Stratus
Vince McMahon
Note: Jeff Hardy and Samoa Joe were previously confirmed, but given both have since been released from WWE, there's a good chance they’re no longer in the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo premieres on Paramount+ next month, and its showrunners have already answered one of the series’ biggest questions: yes, you will see Master Chief’s face for the first time.
IGN’s Ryan McCaffery interviewed Halo’s cast and creators and when he popped the million-dollar question, the show's executive producer and 343 Industries Head of Transmedia Kiki Wolfkill confirmed Chief's face will be shown. She explains it as a storytelling necessity by saying, “We set out to tell a character story and a personal story, and once we really got into what that story was, it became clear that you really needed to see the person in the armor and under the helmet. So you will.”

One of my favorite things about being a longtime player of Bungie’s Destiny franchise has been observing the studio’s ever-changing approach to content delivery and narrative. I consider the studio’s work to be at the forefront of living narrative delivery, helping to shape how the industry thinks about ongoing world-building and storytelling. They’re certainly not the only studio exploring innovative ideas in that space. Developers are chasing ways to k…]]></summary>

But rather than shrug and instantly release a sequel, for once Ubisoft kept working on the multiplayer tactical FPS with updates and overhauls, and today it boasts PC player numbers four times higher than launch. Over the weekend, Ubisoft laid out their plans for Year 7 of content updates, including brand new maps for the first time in years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Prime’s Fallout TV series has found one of its lead stars. Walton Goggins has been confirmed to star in the show, according to a new report by Deadline on Friday. 
Goggins’ most notable TV roles include portraying Boyd Crowder on the Western crime drama Justified, voicing Cecil Stedmen in Amazon’s hit series Invincible, and Baby Billy Freeman in The Righteous Gemstones. Goggins film credits include The Hateful Eight, Ant-Man and the Wasp, and the most recent Tomb Raider film. His role in Fallout series is unknown, but Deadline reports that he’s rumored to portray a Ghoul, a human mutated by radiation in the Fallout universe. 
The Fallout show, which still has no official title, was first announced in 2020. Besides sharing the same general premise as the games, plot details are practically non-existent but the series is helmed by Amazon Studios and Kilter Films, with Bethesda involved as well. Westworld co-creator Jonathan Nolan (brother of Christopher Nolan) will direct the premiere episode and serves as executive producer. Nolan’s Westworld partner Lisa Joy is also involved along with Geneva Robertson-Dworet (Captain Marvel) and Graham Wagner (Silicon Valley) serving as showrunners. The show is currently in pre-production and has no premiere date. 
If you're looking for more video game series to look forward to, here's a list of upcoming animated adaptations. On the live-action end of things, Paramount+ is getting a spin-off show based on the Sonic the Hedgehog films, and HBO's The Last of Us apparently won't be premiering until next year. There's also a little-known series called Halo debuting next month.

Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn famously arose from the ashes of its ill-fated first iteration in 2014. Since then, the MMO has exploded in popularity thanks to several well-received expansions, including its latest, Endwalker. If you somehow thought Square would be slowing down after eight years, you’d be grossly mistaken. During its recent Letter from the Producer Live presentation, the publisher discussed its plans to support the game for the next decade.

As a Street Fighter fan who grew up loving SF II, was less hot on III, got back on the wagon with IV, and completely skipped V, I’m a bit out of the loop, so I'm not entirely sure myself. I'm confident the gameplay itself will be fine, but the reason I never got around to playing the fifth game was due to its infamously botched launch. SFV released missing desired features (like an arcade/story mode) for so long that I stopped caring and had occupied myself with other fighting games by the time they arrived. So I suppose my number one request for Street Fighter 6 is not to do that again. 
I’d also like to see a completely new art direction. Although I loved SF IV’s aesthetic, which was carried over to a lesser extent in V, I believe it's run its course. A new look would really freshen things up and make it feel like a true sequel. The reveal trailer looked mostly unlike the past two entries, though that could just be for the cinematic. We’ll have to wait for gameplay footage/screenshots to see how Street Fighter 6 truly appears. Oh, and make the game multiplatform this time around with cross-play and all that good stuff. 
Now that my boring requests are out of the way, it’s your turn: what do you want to see in Street Fighter 6?]]></summary>

Far: lone Sails was first released in 2018 and it gained quite a fan base – Game Informer gave it an 8.25 in our review – thanks to its unique premise, meditative gameplay, and interesting world design. Developer Okomotive is back with a sequel to it with this year's Far: Changing Tides and it promises to bring all of the environmental puzzles with it. 
This time around, your goal is to move a ship...somewhere. In order to do that, though, you'll need to find new ways to keep the ship powered, discover how to break through an obstacle, and more. In this new installment of New Gameplay Today, your hosts, Game Informer editors Wesley LeBlanc and Ben Reeves, talk about the game's opening 15 minutes and some of the first puzzles in it. 
How does it feel compared to Lone Sails? What's the narrative like thus far? Does Changing Tides bring all of the Limbo and Inside-esque worldbuilding with it that Lone Sails did back in 2018? Wesley and Ben talk through these questions and more in today's New Gameplay Today. Thanks for watching, and be sure to let us know what you think of this upcoming puzzle game from Okomotive, which hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on March 1.]]></summary>

Capcom’s weeklong countdown clock has expired and on the other side is the announcement of Street Fighter 6.
The reveal fittingly came at the conclusion of the Capcom Pro Tour. The cinematic teaser showed a face-off between Ryu and Luke, the final DLC fighter to join Street Fighter V who Capcom previously said would play an important role in the franchise's future. The art style resembles a more traditional 3D look compared to the ink brush style that defined Street Fighters 4 and 5, though this could only be for the trailer and not indicative of the in-game graphics. Unfortunately, nothing else was revealed other than the promise of more information coming this summer.

Shortly after the reveal, Yusuke Hashimoto, the director of Bayonetta 2 who has also worked on the Resident Evil series and God Hand, announced on Twitter that he's among the game's designers. 
Street Fighter 6, the newest entry in the Street Fighter series, has finally been revealed!

But wait, there's more! Capcom also announced the 10-game Capcom Fighting Collection, a bundle of classic and niche fighting games that includes a wealth of Darkstalkers titles. You can read more about that announcement here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nově oznámená verze Relačních rour v0.18 přináší řadu změn – podporu mnoha nových formátů, protokolů a transformací (ASN.1, INI, MIME, YAML, JSON, CBOR, HTML, QR, X11, XPath, XMLTable…). Nová je i podpora datových typů v CSV.

Umožňují pracovat jednotným způsobem s řadou formátů (ASN.1, INI, MIME, YAML, JSON, CBOR, HTML, XML) a vytěžit z nich informace podobným způsobem jako to dělá databázová funkce XMLTable s daty ve formátu XML. Můžeme tak vytáhnout zajímavé informace např. z X.509 certifikátů, e-mailových zpráv nebo (i nevalidních) webových stránek.

Můžeme se napojit na systém X11 a vypsat si otevřená okna, obrazovky či vstupní zařízení nebo zachytávat i generovat události (pohyby myši, stisky kláves).

Z obrázků můžeme načítat čárové a QR kódy a to včetně souřadnic kódu (na obrázku jich může být víc).

Filtry pro čtení a zápis CSV nově podporují datové typy (text, číslo, boolean) a to jak explicitně uložené v CSV, tak jejich autodetekci.

Filtry pro pro práci s INI soubory podporují řadu dialektů (formát INI není standardizovaný) včetně klasických unixových konfiguračních souborů typu klíč=hodnota nebo javovských .properties a MANIFEST.MF souborů.

Relational pipes jsou datový formát pro popis relačních dat + související nástroje, které slouží jako vstupní či výstupní filtry nebo transformace. Myšlenkově navazují na klasické unixové roury (skládání příkazů, každý program dělá jednu věc) a relační databáze.]]></summary>

After tackling Metroid in season 1 and then Halo in season 2, Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast turns its gaze to one of Sony's biggest properties: Uncharted. Last week, we kicked things off with Drake's Fortune, and now we move on to Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, the superb sequel that catapulted the franchise into the stratosphere.  
Uncharted 2: Among Thieves launched October 13, 2009, just shy of two years after Drake's Fortune. Now that it had a solid foundation to work with, Naughty Dog set out to create the video game equivalent of a summer blockbuster film. That included eschewing cutscene setpieces in favor of technically impressive gameplay moments that still offered control over the action, such as the game's famous train sequence. The writing and characters shone even brighter, from Nate himself to newcomer Chloe Frazer to everyone's favorite girl next door, Elena Fischer. Uncharted 2 also introduced a surprisingly solid multiplayer mode, rounding out a stellar package that went on to win numerous Game of the Year awards (ours included). 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and IGN Senior Editor Jonathon Dornbush (@jmdornbush) as we unpack the development history and impact of Nathan Drake's magnum opus.

But around the edges of the launch trailer there's plenty of signs of Ice-Pick's typical dread and anxiety.

In the first 10 minutes of Infernax, I faced a choice to kill or spare someone who asked to die. I chose to kill them, and without a moment’s hesitation, my character’s mace crushed through their skull. Their face was mangled, with eyes popping out the sides, as the mace destroyed everything between their nose and the cowlick on the back of their head. It is a brutal introduction to the “kill or spare” choice system that presents itself a handful of times throughout Infernax, and it was only a taste of the carnage tha…]]></summary>

Cyberpunk 2077 received a massive 60+ GB update called Patch 1.5 earlier this week, and it’s been aptly referred to as the new-gen update for CD Projekt Red’s latest RPG. Perhaps you waited until you had a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X to play it, knowing full well how terribly the game runs on prior-gen consoles. Maybe you were hoping to get your hands on a graphics card from Nvidia’s impossibly rare 30XX series. No matter what situation you…]]></summary>

Well, Ubisoft have made their stupid-ass stance on NFTs quite clear, so let's move on to question two. In a recent financial conference call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said they think they're good to stand independent, but if someone had a juicy offer, well, they might think about it. But that's a noncommittal business answer, really, just business as usual.

Cuphead made me shout obscenities at a flower. Its cheerful dragon tempted me to head-butt my television. And the candy princess? Oh, you don’t even want to know. I didn’t appreciate it until much later, but those early maddening hours with Studio MDHR’s run-and-gun platformer were like a kiln, hardening my skills and turning me into the best damned Cuphead player that I could be. That trial by fire is ultimately one of the most satisfying …]]></summary>

Today, the long-anticipated sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, and to celebrate, we're going to stream the early hours of the game. Join associate editor John Carson (AKA the King of Late Night) on Twitch at 2:30 p.m. Central as he jumps into the post-post-apocalyptic world of Horizon Forbidden West.

You may be thinking, "But, John, where's Super Replay? I want to see Marcus be a badass Jedi." I hear you, and I'd like to see that as well. We're giving the Replay crew the day off to enjoy the long holiday weekend, and they'll be back to their usual antics next Friday.
Horizon Forbidden West is the newest game from PlayStation powerhouse studio Guerrilla Games, and the second entry in the Horizon franchise. Set in the distant future where civilization as we know it has crumbled and mechanical beasts roam the land, Horizon follows the adventures of Aloy, who was once a societal outcast, that has become a hero to many of the villages and tribes she meets in Zero Dawn. Forbidden West brings Aloy, well, further west to discover a way to stop a blight that's killing the land and, in turn, what remains of humanity. Check out cool robotic creatures and the beautiful open-world vistas that await Aloy on the stream this afternoon.]]></summary>

Square Enix announced back in December that its Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster would be releasing this February, and now we know it’s coming next week on February 23. Since revealing that release date, Square Enix has released some footage from the remaster and fan response has been mixed. 
Unless you’re talking about this tweet made by the official Final Fantasy Twitter account on February 13, which seemingly nobody was happy about. As you can see in the tweet below, it features an infamous move from Final Fantasy VI where you can use meteor strike to essentially suplex the Phantom Train. In the original release, the train flips over a la like a suplex. …]]></summary>

Ironically for a game about a never-ending timeloop, I just never had enough minutes to fit it into my schedule. But! I have been rectifying that this week, and cor, it's a bit good, isn't it? I'm particularly enjoying just letting rip with its big chunky guns when I mess up trying to be all sneaky-like. In my painstaking attempt to do a completely clean, blood-free ghost run in Dishonored 2 all those years ago, I'd sort of forgotten just how powerfully satisfying Arkane Lyon's eye for action really is, and I've been having a lot of fun rediscovering this as I beast my way around Blackreef's four main locations. 
As you'd expect from an Arkane game, each one of these maps is absolutely huge, full of nooks and crannies and secret passageways just itching to be exploited as you try and take down all of its slightly mad Eternalist cult leaders in a single cycle. But the thing I've been most intrigued by in Deathloop so far isn't its weird cubby holes or how maps change over time. It's all those huffing great arcade cabinets littered about the place. And some of them look very familiar indeed...

Stealth and patience are crucial to victory in a world where aliens aren't just shambling meat sacks, but a horrifying hivemind that's best tackled quietly.
But after spending a little hands-on time with Extraction's new game mode Spillover, it seems it  does away with what makes the base game tick. You plant bombs, then fend off hordes of aliens. There's something missing here.

Skull & Bones was announced in 2017 and other than a few trailers and gameplay showcases, things have remained mostly quiet on it. In fact, much of the news that has since come out about Skull & Bones has been regarding delays, directors leaving, and more. Just last month, it was revealed that one of the game’s co-directors departed from Ubisoft. 
It seems that Ubisoft is confident Skull & Bones will finally escape the clutches of development hell soon, though, because in the company’s most recent quarterly earnings report, Ubisoft CEO Frédérick Duguet said it could release next fiscal year. More specifically, if Dugu…]]></summary>

Then, a week later, Microsoft announced that it was acquiring Activision Blizzard, the company behind Over…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dirigo Games impressed former RPS neck honcho Adam Smith with Depths Of Fear, and later added  two excellent games to to The Bundle. Syscrusher was a very brief but smooth and exciting shooter, and Stowaway an atmospheric monster horror. Their new game, Kingdom Of The Dead, combines the two; a striking fast paced FPS about a... paranormal vigilante cowboy, I think? It does not sit you down and explain itself, and I actually kind of like that about it.
You're part of, or possibly all of, a kind of 19th century X Files, except instead of talking and analysing the situation, you already know that the way to deal with undead weirdness is to roll up with your revolver and kick its face in. Interesting as the premise is, it's really about blasting around some fun environments for a few hours, and I've enjoyed it more with every level.

WWE 2K’s simulated grappling can be fun, but there’s something satisfying about booking your own shows, managing contracts, and drafting wrestlers, which is why 2K22’s MyGM mode is attractive. I got to sit down with this latest reinvention of the fan-favorite mode, guiding my chosen brand through a 15-week ratings war. 
Conceptually, this mode has always been an interesting conundrum. Pro wrestling is a scripted sport by design, and that includes having characters portray authority figures who run things on TV but have no actual power in real life. That begs the quest…]]></summary>

Horizon Forbidden West introduces six skill trees: Hunter, Warrior, Survivor, Trapper, Infiltrator, and Machine Master. Each contains numerous abilities that allow players to sculpt the Aloy of their liking. Whether she’s a melee-focused butt-kicker or a stealth-oriented machine hacker, there’s no wrong answer in terms of what you choose. It can, however, be paralyzing to know where to start. 
Though it’s ideal to focus on maximizing one or two trees, each has staple abilities that every player should have, no matter their playstyle. The best part is these essential s…]]></summary>

Horizon Forbidden West’s new setting is teeming with exotic, dangerous, and never-before-seen machines. We already broke down the fearsome Slitherfang, and Guerrilla divulged some additional details on previously revealed robotic creatures. But, for those who haven’t kept track of the game’s fearsome new faces, here’s a handy round-up of the new machines that have been revealed thus far.

Horizon Forbidden West, Guerrilla Games’ upcoming sequel to its 2017 hit Horizon Zero Dawn, launches this week. And though it’s landing at an unusually busy time for game releases, this follow-up title is at the top of many fans’ most anticipated lists. Horizon Forbidden West appeared on our magazine cover in December, meaning we learned a ton of details about the game. So, there’s a lot to pack into this beefy round-up of everything you need to know before you start Aloy’s next journey. Let’s dive in.

The sequel boasts a whole host of new features, exciting locales, and a sprawling story, some of which are detailed in our round-up of everything we know about the game.

Lastly, a listener question sparks a conversation about which video game characters we would draft as the new Suicide Squad – and my controversial pick might surprise you!

Great gameplay and stellar graphics always impress, but the best moments often stick with us most. Sometimes that is a surprising plot twist; other times, it’s a hilarious character exchange or a jaw-dropping action segment. Regardless of their form, these experiences can turn a fun game into a memorable one.

Aloy and company are finally back after five long years in Horizon Forbidden West, and we're streaming the beginning of the game live on Twitch starting at 2:15 p.m. CT!
Click here to watch embedded media
Who will be hosting such an event? We got a good one for you today with Alex Stadnik on the sticks, Ben Reeves chiming in with his experience with the game and his usual brand of street comedy, and Kim "KStar" Wallace giving her impressions as we progress through the opening two hours. Ms. Wallace did the official Game Informer review, and in it, she says: 
"Horizon Forbidden West reaches a new high bar for Guerrilla Games. It does more than surpass its predecessor; it takes Horizon's fiction to captivating places and builds a rich world that rewards you for the effort you put into it. Mostly, it's an entertaining experience, complete with jaw-dropping moments and unforgettable fights."

For those unfamiliar with the Horizon series, the game's star Aloy, a hero born to save a mechanical world from the sins of the past. Our protagonist has delved deep into this world's history to learn of her connections to the woman who kept life going at a great cost thousands of years ago and how that connection makes her the only person on Earth who can prevent a new mechanical apocalypse. Forbidden West continues that tale with a cast of new and familiar faces, a vastly improved combat and movement system, and some of the best graphics we've seen on the PlayStation 5!
Can't get enough Horizon ahead of the game's official release? We've got you covered with the video version of Kim's excellent review, a whole cover hub featuring stories on developer Guerrilla Games' newest experience, and an in-depth conversation about the game on the latest episode of The GI Show!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anime streaming app Crunchyroll has launched on Switch today. 
That's noteworthy for two reasons. One, it adds another streaming service to Switch, a platform with minimal options for watching TV and movies. Switch owners still only have Hulu, YouTube, Funimation, and Pokémon TV to turn to. There’s also Twitch if you prefer watching streamers. Two, it comes after Sony’s billion-dollar acquisition of the service in December 2020, showing that the company has no intention to prevent Crunchyroll from further spreading its wings to other platforms. 
Crunchyroll on Switch, which is powered by Unreal Engine, is the first video app on the console to offer offline viewing. That means you won’t need an internet connection to catch up on Demon Slayer should you decide to fire up the app at the park or on a car ride. Crunchyroll is a subscription service boasting one of the largest anime libraries, even letting fans stream shows the same day they premiere in Japan. 
While a nice addition, the Switch still lacks streaming heavyweights like Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, and others which has been frustrating for owners who want to take advantage of its portability to watch their favorite shows anywhere. If you’re not into anime, that leaves Hulu as the only real option. Hopefully, that changes, but given that the Switch has gone five years without even Netflix, it's probably best not to get your hopes up.]]></summary>

It's not the cold. It's not even the lack of anything to do. It's that when your main threat is starvation and hypothermia, and your only real tool is stockpiling, it often feels like your fate is already sealed come October, and waiting around to see if you survived or not carries the same sense of slow inevitability that the average RTS or 4X game does past the opening act.
My first village in Timberborn gave me that feeling. Even though its dry season is the opposite of Winter, the ultimate effect was the same. I've played this before, I thought. This is the villagers vs winter game again.
I was a fool. A big, wrong fool.

We at the Electronic Wireless Show podcast like to think of it as Palentine's anyway, because we're all pals and you, our listeners, are all our pals too (including Henry "Vitamin H" Cavill). So today we're talking about our favourite romances in video games, but also our absolute best mates, too.
Sadly Matthew, one of our real life bestest pals, couldn't be here this week. Curiously, it's a much more well-behaved podcast than normal, suggesting that actually the chaotic influence was Matthew all along... Still, Nate updates us on his war gaming models, which are slowly becoming a diorama and/or dolls' house. I also tell him about the final third of a film about an aquarium where all the fish become zombies, called Aquarium Of The Dead. It is not a good film.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA will now release The Sims 4's upcoming My Wedding Stories expansion in Russia, reversing a decision supposedly made due to concerns that it would run afoul of an anti-homosexuality law. Many fans were unhappy with this. Now EA say oh, they've checked again, and it turns out they don't need to censor anything. So the expansion will come to Russia too, but EA are delaying the launch one week so they can get their ducks in a line and launch simultaneously worldwide.

The EC2 C6a instances are designed for compute-intensive workloads (hence the "C" series) and AWS is promoting it as offering up to 15% improvement in price-performance over prior-generation C5a instances and up to 10% lower cost than comparable x86-based EC2 instances. I've run some benchmarks of the new EC2 C6a instances looking at how they perform over the prior 2nd Gen EPYC C5a based instances, against the Intel Ice Lake competition over in the M6i stack, and also how the C6a competes with Amazon's own Graviton2-based C6g type.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s an old chestnut from gaming mythology - you surely know the one - about the movement in Mario’s 3D ventures being perfected by Shigeru Miyamoto at their very start with Super Mario 64. Core Design managed the same thing with the original Tomb Raider back in 1996, too. Nobody really talks about it now, while the Mario story endures. Possibly because Nintendo didn’t make umpteen identikit sequels over the following decade or splash Mario’s stretchy mug on the cover of The Face. 
Really though, the Italian plumber and English graverobber were equally confident that if all their moves were available right from the start with no unlocking needed then that was enough. Both games were – are still, after a quarter of a century – the Platonic ideal of their characters. And they had bloody good swimming sections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skateboarding sim Session has added a lot in the past two years, but also lost some of its ragdoll charm. Since last year's total physics overhaul, you no longer bail with every failed trick, instead teleporting off your board in a strange, stiff way that saves time but (for me at least) replaces one unrealistic motion with another, less funny one. I want to get that gripe out of the way, because otherwise it's still gunning to be the sim for darksliding anoraks. 
The next update will add two new areas, which I got to try out recently, and some new pro skater faces. If you can ignore the frequent wacky physics hiccups and the rigid, nonplussed reaction your character has when they should, by all rights, be landing flat on their face, you'll find a surprisingly chill skating game. It's less about hoarding points with as many tricks as possible and more about pushing languidly around a city as viewed through a seasoned kickflipper's fisheye goggles.

Eventually I decided on corn, a warm yellow to keep things light and breezy. To both my relief and, I think, the relief of the Carpet Man, it wasn't grey. The shade that, for whatever reason, most people like to walk on. One that tires Carpet Man and reminds me of Lost Ark, an MMO that's supremely popular for some reason. No matter how chic it may be right now, I can't see it being a permanent fixture in my life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A handful of popular Cities: Skylines mods have been banned from the Steam Workshop by developers Colossal Order. One, "Network Extensions 3", violates the Steam Subscriber Agreement by "discriminating against specific Steam users" blocking them from using it, Colossal Order say. Another mod, "Update From Github", aimed to circumvent the Steam Workshop entirely by allowing updates to mods to be installed directly form Github while "making changes to existing Workshop subscriptions without the user's knowledge."

Complicating matters somewhat is a sea of rumours about what else the mods contained, and a series of counter-allegations about Colossal Order from the creator of the mods.

This news came alongside tonight's 'Panel From Hell' livestream focused on Patch 7, where Larian revealed the Barbarian class and the Improvised Weapons system which lets you wield even enemies as weapons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur’s Gate’s most famous barbarian wasn’t actually a barbarian at all. Technically speaking, Minsc was a ranger - a man of the woods who just happened to spin into a rage during battle, hitting friend or foe for extra damage, while ignoring blows that would fell a tree. It was a classification that came with its benefits: since every ranger was entitled to an animal companion, Minsc had justification for his connection to Boo, the “miniature giant space hamster” that lived in his inventory. But the primary reason for the misnomer was a gap in the rules of Dungeons & Dragons.


“Second edition didn’t have the barbarian class,” remembers lead designer James Ohlen. “Baldur’s Gate 2 used third edition classes, but by then, it was too late.”


Larian Studios, the current custodians of the series, don’t have any such issues. Working with D&D’s fifth edition, which has full and flavoursome rules that allow players to embody barbarians, the developers have adapted the class for use in Baldur’s Gate III. It’s a typically meticulous transposition that holds true to the tabletop game’s definition of what makes a barbarian boil: “More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.”

So as an alternative to spending £100-odd for all a game's DLC, Paradox have started dabbling in letting players pay monthly fees to play them. The next game to start such a DLC subscription service is Hearts Of Iron IV, launching today. Like the others, it'll charge £4 per month. Or alternatively, you can still just buy DLC for keepsies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, I made an impassioned plea for more puzzley-jigsaw games, but I did not expect my call to be answered in such a comprehensive fashion so quickly. Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams, by That's Nice Games, is a jigsaw game that came to Steam last December. No, more than that. It is a doing-a-jigsaw game. A jigsaw sim.
See, most jigsaw games - and I idly toy with the idea of playing a bit of any new one I find on Steam, before realising that is a fool's errand - are just kind of 2D, put together this flat JPEG of a flower that I have cut into triangles. There's no tactile pleasure to be had. But Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams is a little one bed mezzanine flat in which you do puzzles - on the floor, on the kitchen table, on the rug - and each puzzle piece is a little 3D thing you can pick up and drop and turn around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple of weeks back, I interviewed the creator of Left 4 Dead and general PC gaming multiplayer grandee Mike Booth about his VR tabletop game Demeo. In virtual reality, Demeo seeks to recreate the feeling of playing a TRPG strategy game, huddled around a table with three pals and a load of cheesey crisps. Soon, though, you won't need a headset to play it, as Demeo is also getting a standalone PC version. I got invited for a little hands-on of the PC build, and thought that since I am a tabletop-game-playing person, it'd be interesting to bring Ed along with me. Ed likes multiplayer PC games more than me, but in the kind of kill-streak, headshot, battle-royale way. Thus, as a team, we are perfectly poised to assess how Demeo stacks up as a co-op PC game.
We played a single level in Demeo's first adventure module, The Black Sarcophagus, although when it launches in early access a complete game will stretch to three. Demeo will also have all the other adventures released for the VR version, including the most recent forest-set Roots Of Evil, but The Black Sarcophagus placed us in a creepy stone dungeon and/or crypt. The goal was to find the monster carrying the crypt key, remove the key by force, and then unlock door to the next level. Our team of four was completed by Tommy Palm, CEO and founder of Resolution games (and owner of a truly top-tier cardigan) and producer Gustav Stenmark (no cardigan visible sadly, but he seemed cool). Here's how we got on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Easily one of the standout PC reveals from last year's Game Awards, Dune: Spice Wars is an upcoming real-time 4X strategy game about everyone's favourite doomed sand planet. Based on Frank Herbert's acclaimed novel and made by the same folks behind Northgard and Wartales, Dune: Spice Wars will see players step into the boots of one of four factions when it launches in early access later this spring, and I've had a chance to see how one of them works in action. 
In a hands-off presentation, developers Shiro Games showed us how the (sadly Chalamet-less) Atreides family will be going about their fight to control Arrakis' most coveted substance - the all-important spice melange - although players will also be able to choose from the shady Harkonnen clan at launch, plus two more unannounced factions that will be revealed in the coming weeks. There's a lot to take in, but if you've been waiting for a Dune game to succeed the 1992 RTS epic that was Dune II: Battle For Arrakis, well, you better pull your head out of the sand and strap on your hydro-cycling stillsuit. The battle for this year's best strategy game is about to get spicy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Total War: Warhammer 3 is an extremely hard game to review in isolation. It’s utterly massive in itself, with eight hulking single player campaigns at launch, not to mention a greatly expanded range of multiplayer and PvE skirmish options. But that’s just the start of it. For indeed, just like beloved Warhammer villain Ebeneezer Scrooge, any attempt to form an opinion on this game has to contend not just with the present, but with the bedevilments of its past and future to boot.


While it is very much a game you can buy and enjoy on its lonesome, TWW3 is perhaps better considered as the last, grand instalment of a game whose release began nearly eight years ago with Total War: Warhammer. It’s a genuinely epic construction; a proper Pillars-Of-The Earth-level feat of game development. And here’s where the future sticks the boot in. Because while the last stones of this electric cathedral have been lowered into place, the phone line to God hasn’t been wired in yet.

You solve the daily puzzle on the pot during your morning wee, and have posted your boast to the family WhatsApp group before you even wipe (another three-solve? yawn!). Friendo, what you need is Quordle. This Wordle variant makes you guess four words on four grids at the same time. That'll get you thinking again.

The free-to-play action-RPG hit 1.32 million peak concurrent players on Saturday, narrowly pushing it past the all-time peaks of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Dota 2. Well, 1.32m were in-game, but they might not have been playing. Server problems continued after launch with long queues for some. Publishers Amazon say they're working on it, including planning to create a whole new extra European server region.

It's coming to PC on March 29th, and judging by the mix of magic powers and shadow slinking I've seen from its trailer, it could be the ideal chaser for those craving another Arkane-esque immersive sim in their lives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frankly I feel a bit odd writing a post that amounts to “14-year-old rendering tech works better than 20-year-old rendering tech”, but Lost Ark – 2022’s biggest surprise hit so far – has only recently come around to the benefits of DirectX 11. While it’s the default rendering option in the western version that launched last week, the original South Korean version went years with just DirectX 9 to its name, and the press build that I used for performance testing (and Ed is using for his review-in progress) remains locked to DX9. Despite the fact that, as I’ve confirmed from testing the release build as well, DX11 provides a tidy performance gain over its predecessor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My last Elden Ring hands-on was illuminating, to say the least. As I got turned to mulch by a mechanical chariot, split in two by an ulcerated lizard, and bullied by a beast man, I simply... gave up. I said to myself, "I'll come back to this later. Yeah", with that final "yeah" escaping from my lips like a wisp of steam from a kettle.
The game boiled me alive, but its open world accommodated these feverish outbursts far better than previous Souls games. There were vast swathes of map to help bring my temperature back down from simmer to sparkling. One thing troubled me, though, and that was the rate at which I'd zip between bosses in-between distractions. It felt like I lacked the focus needed to keep up with Elden Ring's open world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's tempting to think that a city builder should focus on covering more ground, simulating a wider range of those elements in a bid for authenticity, or comprehensiveness.
Power To The People takes the other approach. You're the decision maker of an energy company, tasked solely with providing electricity to towns you have no control over. Do a good job and you'll make enough money to scale up alongside the village/town/city. For such a simple premise it's surprisingly good at engaging the part of your brain that covers strategy and puzzles. Considering that power lines are normally an annoying hassle in games that simulate them at even a basic level, I'm also impressed by how entertaining it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whenever a game like Lost Ark comes out, it shows the public is still hungry for something that looks and sounds and plays even a tiny bit like Diablo. Lost Ark does provide what is the crudest part of the appeal of something like Diablo - i.e. a thousand chittering enemies flying at you at once as you vaporise them with minimal clicking - but I wouldn't say it's a lovingly crafted version of it. Like the difference between the Wicked Witch in Snow White and a Halloween costume in a plastic bag labelled Legally Distinct Evil Magic Stepmother. But there are also things I appreciate about Lost Ark in general, and its version of [flaps hands] whatever this is.
In the spirit of Lost Ark's slightly older (one might even say dated?) sensibilities, I'm going to break it down like I'm reviewing the game in a 90s game mag, separating the game into its constituent parts - just as one can remove the egg from a cake after baking it. Although I should make it clear I'm not doing our proper Lost Ark review. That honour falls to Ed, who is more plugged in to modern MMORPGs than I am. I'm just here to talk about how Lost Ark does and does not compare to Diablo - specifically Diablo II, because that's the best one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just for a second, as you hit the apex of a particularly audacious jump, the bottom end of Dying Light 2’s audio drops out. It’s as if bass were a grounded concept you’d momentarily left behind - an earthy comfort for mortals. Then the tumble begins, and you’d better have already picked out a nice, safe spot to land. This is the irresistible dichotomy of the parkour game, as first defined by Mirror’s Edge in 2008 - an invitation to soar, with the understanding that true freedom doesn’t come for free. Height is earned, momentum is managed, and mistakes are punished with a 30 foot plunge.
Perhaps you’ve seen footage of Dying Light 2’s rooftop running and wondered, “How much of that is me?” In a medium where climbing systems are typically automated rather than simulated, and first-person control tends to end at the waist, it’s natural to suspect that what you’re seeing is a fancy set of animations, triggered by pointing your character in a given direction and holding down the parkour key. I’m here to tell you that Dying Light 2 is not that game: it’s the real deal. It is, among many other things, Mirror’s Edge.

We discuss some of our favourite examples of the plote device in question to be found in video games, which of course leads to some interesting discussions about what even is a MacGuffin. Can a MacGuffin be intangible? No, probably not.
We discuss whether any MacGuffin is improved by replacing it with an egg (yes), why a lot of games have souls as MacGuffins, and what our own personal MacGuffins would be. Plus! Impressions of Henry "Vitamin H" Cavill, and sensational new character Sir Terence Plunder. Will Sir T become a podcast regular? Only time will tell. There is no Cavern Of Lies this week, but in a shocking turn of events it's because Nate forgot, not because I forgot. Hooray!

That's because I've now been able to return to the starting area of Limgrave, this time on PC and with unfettered access to all the nooks and crannies we'll be exploring in just a couple of weeks time - and I found it to be richer and more vast than, well, it had ever been. FromSoftware have tweaked some things and removed some barriers from last year's closed network test, so in a single six-hour excavation, I discovered just how ambitious this game really is. Limgrave is way bigger than I first thought. Here's what I found.
