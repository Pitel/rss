'Tolerance is Extinction—Part 3' brought the first season of Disney's X-Men '97 to a finale that was as emotional as it was epic. While our titular heroes send Bastion and his army of Prime Sentinels to the scrap heap, the rest of the world assumes that Charles Xavier and his students sacrificed themselves to save them.


Of course, this is a Marvel series, and the final moments of X-Men 97's finale reveal that the X-Men are alive. The episode also hints at where the show's already-confirmed second season may be heading. There's a lot to discuss, so let's break down the final episode of X-Men '97 and what its many revelations and cameos mean for the series' future.

It starred a diver named dremskiy, who joined a match only for the host to tell them they were about to get kicked. "[W]e playing friends opnly," the host explains. "[I] hv to kick you."

        <updated>2024-05-16T21:37:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The M16 was one of the worst weapons in MW2, and nothing changed in MW3 to make the assault rifle worth using either. However, a new aftermarket part finally vaults the M16 into meta conversations. 


Players unlock the JAK Patriot conversion kit by completing all Season 3 Week 7 challenges, transforming the M16 from a three-round burst into a fully automatic weapon. By sacrificing damage and suffering a small loss in accuracy, the M16 garners more attention with fully automatic capabilities. The time-to-kill potential of 299ms is above average for the class, and the M16 can kill enemies in five shots up to 40 meters, which is impressive. 


However, the TTK suffers a massive drop-off after that distance, so players shouldn't try to use this weapon in anything longer than a mid-range gunfight. With that being said, here is the best set of attachments to use. 


Best M16 JAK Patriot loadout in MW3

Muzzle: Komodo Heavy 


Underbarrel: FTAC SP-10 Angled Grip 


Optic: JAK Glassless Optic 


Rear Grip: Sakin ZX Grip 


Conversion Kit: JAK Patriot 



The M16 with the JAK Patriot equipped suffers from a hard recoil that is sharp to the left and straight up. So, our loadout focuses on improving horizontal recoil to mitigate that issue. The Komodo Heavy Barrel, FTAC SP-10 Angled Grip, and Sakin ZX Grip all improve a combination of horizontal and vertical recoil, gun kick, or firing aim stability.  


Even with this set of attachments, the M16's recoil will be noticeable. Thankfully, it's a predictable pattern, so players should have no issue pulling down on the right stick and mowing down enemies easily. Other ARs might still be better on paper, but it's refreshing to finally have an M16 worth using after two years of irrelevance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto VI's reveal last December sent fans into a tizzy, but its then-distant 2025 release window immediately tempered that excitement. While the launch seemed more in reach now that we’re nearly midway through 2024, it appears we’ll have to wait another full year before playing it.
Publisher Take-Two released its 2024 year-end financial report today (thanks, PC Gamer), in which it states that Rockstar is targeting a Fall 2025 release window for GTA VI. This timing is reiterated in a calendar of the publisher’s upcoming releases, posted below.
Regarding GTA VI, Take-Two states, “We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.” The game is slated to release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has yet to be mentioned. 
Grand Theft Auto VI takes players to a modern-day Vice City (the franchise's parody of Miami, FL) and stars two protagonists, a female inmate named Lucia and her still-unnamed criminal male partner. To say anticipation is high would be an understatement; the premiere trailer garnered over 100 million views in only 24 hours, breaking a YouTube record. 
As we continue the long wait for Grand Theft Auto VI’s launch, check out our video of Game Informer’s two resident Florida Men reacting to the debut trailer. You can also read about Take-Two's recent closure of developers Roll7 (Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World) and Intercept Games (Kerbal Space Program 2).]]></summary>

This cloak will stay with you for the entire duration of the World of Warcraft Remix: Mists of Pandaria event. As you're leveling, you'll come across Threads that grant you permanent stat bonuses. At any time you can mouse over your Timerunner's Advantage buff to see what your stat bonuses.


You can collect threads doing various activities around Pandaria. Looting from enemies, opening Cache of Infinite Treasures, opening treasure chests, flying through Bronze Orbs, completing dungeons, and more. Basically anything that gives a reward has a chance to give a thread. What kind of thread depends on your level. The stat that will be buffed is in the name of the thread you earn. For example, Thread of Stamina will give you a stamina buff, based on what rank it is.

Common Thread
+1 Stats


30-49
Uncommon Thread
+3 Stats


50-64
Rare Threads
+7 Stats


65-70
Epic Threads
+12 Stats






As you rank up your cloak, you'll get achievements to mark your progress. Each rank of Infinite Power you get grants a bonus to your other characters, making leveling even easier for them. The final rank is at 4200 threads, and it grants you a toy for each of the August Celestial cape effects.

You'll either have to meet or defeat a certain enemy, become better friends with your allies, or find yourself in dire need of something. Some Incantations come to Melinoë as if shared by some greater force. Regardless of how the spells appear, they're all incredibly useful in Melinoë's fight to free her family and defeat Chronos.

It was believed that Take-Two would announce a new trailer for GTA 6 during their May 2024 conference call. Unfortunately, no trailer was released, but we did get some insight into a more concrete release date. According to the report results, Grand T…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are two things that Lorelei and the Laser Eyes brings to the table that I think make it a puzzle game worth anyone's time. First, its stunning visuals are reminiscent of the most stylish games ever made, like Killer7. Second, its puzzles grip you and will have you working, inside and out of the game, to solve them. 


Lorelei and the Laser Eyes' story revolves around the Hotel Letztes Jahr. The protagonist arrives there after receiving an invitation, and that's all the information you're given. From this incredibly vague start, you must figure out why you're here by solving contextual puzzles that allow you to explore more and more of the hotel, while an overarching story eerily seeps out of the walls to fill in the gaps.

How to kill 20 enemies in 5 seconds easily in Warframe


To get 20 kills in 5 seconds, you have to use a setup that prioritizes AoE damage. It does not matter if your source of damage comes from weapons or Warframe abilities. If you can do both, even better.

As an Anemo hypercarry, Wanderer is hampered by his lack of access to amplifying or additive reactions. As a driver, he competes with Sucrose and Heizou, both of whom are 4-stars and easier to obtain.


In terms of raw strength, Wanderer is strong enough to clear the Spiral Abyss, as long as you have the right team to support him. If you just like his playstyle or character, then you’ll probably be satisfied enough with his performance. If you only care about big numbers, though, Wanderer is probably not for you.


The open world is where Wanderer shines the most. His damage is reliant on his Skill, not his Burst, so he doesn’t need to have a constant source of Energy. …]]></summary>

Most gear has a slot available, though the type of slot depends on the type of gear. When swapping out gems, don't forget to use the unique gem removal ability Extract Gem you have. If you just slot a gem ontop of another gem, it destroys the original. 


Now, you might think that this requires Jewelcrafting. However, there are no Primary and Secondary professions in WoW Remix. All characters will will have these abilities. All players also gain access to a swirling vortex that you can use to scrap unwanted gear. This turns the items into the Bronze currency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amid concerns around when Grand Theft Auto 6 could hit shelves, Rockstar Games reassured fans with an official release window. 


During a Take-Two Interactive investor earnings call discussing future releases, Rockstar Games confirmed that GTA 6 will launch in the fall of 2025.


In December 2023, Rockstar Gave fans a first look at the upcoming title in an announcement trailer with a 2025 release date. However, in March, Kotaku reported that the title could be delayed to 2026 as development was allegedly falling behind. Those concerns were exacerbated when Rockstar Games reportedly asked employees to return to the office for five days a week, signaling something might have gone wrong in the development process. 


Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who broke the story, acknowledged those concerns and claimed "employees are not thrilled" with Rockstar's decision.

Even in light of those hiccups, the recent earnings call should help extinguish any concerns about a potential delay. However, we still only have one trailer to go on for any concrete information about the title. So besides a setting and a first-look at the protagonists, we still have much to learn about GTA 6 before the reported Fall 2025 release date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost of Tsushima, specifically the Director's Cut, is out on PC today. It's a fantastic game that should be welcomed with open arms as it makes its way to a new platform, but we were specifically curious about how it performs on Steam Deck. The game is not Steam Deck verified primarily because certain features are not supported on Valve's handheld, or other comparable mobile PC game platforms. However, the offline content (the single-player campaign and the expansion) has been specifically adjusted to play well on Steam Deck. You can read port studio Nixxes Software explanation here. And spending a little time with the game shows that the single-player campaign does, in fact, play well on Steam Deck. It's not without its shortcomings – a high-end PC or a PlayStation 5 are still the best ways to play the game – but Steam Deck appears to be a great way to play the game if that's your only option or you want a portable version.
You can check out some gameplay with commentary from myself and Wesley LeBlanc below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The team at Statera Studio previously showed their love for classic 2D fighting games with Pocket Bravery. Now they're taking that expertise and throwing in some platform fighter inspiration for Shield Strike, a four-player brawler that's currently eyeing a 2025 launch. 


In a setup that will be familiar to anyone who has played a fighter like Super Smash Bros. or MultiVersus, Shield Strike puts players in two-dimensional arenas full of platforms and plenty of items to use and mayhem to cause. True to its title, the hook here has combatants using their shields as projectiles, and you can see a sample in Statera's reveal trailer below. 




Shield Strike currently has plans for eight playable characters, and up to four players can get in on the action in both versus and cooperative modes. There's also a story mode that unravels more of what's going on in this medieval fantasy world, complete with a bunch of enemies and five boss battles. 


With a match-start countdown timer that ends in "MURDER," Shield Strike aims to deliver the kind of fast-paced, frantic action fans of the sub-genre have come to expect. The shield mechanics certainly have my interest piqued, but what I really want to see are more of those obstacles and other means of disruption. I don't fancy myself a competitive platform fighter player by any means. I play Smash for the chaos. If Shield Strike can harness that level of borderline frustrating unpredictability in its versus battles, count me in. 


While we wait for a more concrete launch date, Shield Strike is currently in the works for PC and a Steam page is live for wishlisting.

Aside from hidden switches and lethal fire puzzles, there are secret panels and even a vault that needs cracking. It's a lot, but it is worth the hassle, as completing the Week 1 Vault Puzzle awards additional barrels for Outbreak Perfected and the blueprint for the Vimana Junker ship. Here's how to crack the code.


How to claim the Vimana Junker in Destiny 2 (Week 1)


Before you get started, I recommend doing this on Normal, as the extra time helps. You'll also need the Outbreak Perfected pulse rifle to complete the first part of the puzzle. Finally, don't worry about having to complete the run once you've obtained the rewards.

Godzilla will be stomping its way into the Blue Hole next week, on 23rd May, developer Mintrocket has announced. However, at the bottom of a detailed blog post over on PlayStation.Blog, there's a little asterisk mentioning that the "Godzilla Content Pack is a time-limited free DLC, only available from May 23 until November 23 ". It isn't quite clear whether it will only be available during that period or will be paid DLC after this period. Still, if you nab it next week, it'll be free! So it's time to dive in.

How to get Stygian Stone


You can obtain a Stygian Stone at the end of every instance of The Pit that you run after defeating the final boss. Unlike on the PTR, it's no longer a guaranteed drop at the end of The Pit. However, the higher Tier Level of The Pit that you do, the more likely that you will receive a Stygian Stone or two at the end of the dungeon. Here's how to get Stygian Stone:

Up until then, nearly everything you need for crafting will either already be in your inventory from regular killing and looting, or you’ll know how to get it. Not so with leather.


Once you outgrow Plated Boneguard Armour and begin getting recipes for the next set, Nightstalker, you’ll notice that you need 24 Leather and 16 Coarse Thread. You might already have plenty of thread rolling around the bottom of your bag, but probably very little leather. And you'll need a lot because it's also used to make weapons, bags, castle decorations, and even a key for some reason  — so here's how to get more Leather in V Rising.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rumors and leaks suggested that the KAR98k would be included in the Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone Season 4 update, but Raven Software may have finally confirmed it as part of a marketing campaign. 


The Warzone devs sent 98 care packages to content creators ahead of Season 4. On Twitter, JGOD showed that the box had a letter K, a bolt-into-action label, and a car with 98 on its door, essentially confirming that the KAR98K will be in the new update. Based on the Season 3 Battle Pass, Season 4 will likely start on Wednesday, May 29.


Image via Activision 


Activision usually releases a blog post for MW3 and Warzone with initial details about the next update one week before a new season starts, so players should expect more news soon. In saying that, the Kar98k is already a noteworthy addition worth paying attention to. Modern Warfare 3's iteration of Warzone improved one-shot sniping by removing the explosive ammunition requirement. Without needing to use the ammunition type that drastically decrease bullet velocity to get a one-shot kill, sniper rifles dominate the battle royale and are capable of taking out enemies from impressive ranges. 


During Warzone Pacific in 2021, the Kar98k was widely regarded as one of the best, if not the best, weapons to use on Caldera. If the bolt-action sniper rifle can one-shot kill enemies in Season 4, there's no doubt that the Kar98k will be a must-use weapon. Because even though the MORS is arguably the best sniper rifle in Warzone right now, the KAR98k will have better mobility and aim-down sight speeds. It will all come down to how far away the new weapon can kill enemies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phoenix Labs, the developer behind last year's Fae Farm and Dauntless, has laid off staff and canceled in-development games as part of a restructuring at the studio. Polygon's Nicole Carpenter is reporting on X (formerly Twitter) that more than 100 people at Phoenix Labs were laid off. 
Shortly after Carpenter reported that, Phoenix Labs released the following statement: 


Phoenix Labs released its latest game, Fae Farm, back in September, and Dauntless before that in 2019. 
These layoffs join a string of other disheartening 2024 layoffs and closures, which now total more than 10,000 in just the first five months of the year. 
Square Enix announced earlier this week it will begin layoffs as part of "structural reforms," starting this week. 
Earlier this month, Xbox closed four Bethesda st…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the release of XDefiant gradually approaching, many players are starting to gear up for its highly anticipated launch. But you may wonder: When do XDefiant preloads start? Here's everything you need to know. 


XDefiant preload and launch times


You can check out the preload and official launch times for XDefiant here:


Regions
Pre-Load Times
Launch Times




US and Canada
May 16 at 10 a.m. PT/12 p.m. CT/1 p.m. ET
May 21 at 10 a.m. PT/ 12 p.m. CT/1 p.m. ET


Europe
May 16 at 6 p.m. BST/7 p.m. CEST
May 21 at 6 p.m. BST/7 p.m. CEST


Oceania and Asia
May 17 at 3 a.m. AET
May 22 at 3 a.m. AET


South America
May 16 at 2 p.m. BRT
May 21 at 2 p.m. BRT






Each region includes all platforms, such as Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. It's also part of Ubisoft Connect, a free service hub for various games. For Steam users, check out our guide on whether or not it will be on this platform. 


Fortunately, XDefiant is a free-to-play game, so no need to break out your wallet. There may still be in-game purchases, though, with premium Battle Pass items.

If you're one of the players who already have a previous version of the game installed, it's crucial to check for an update. This simple step will ensure a smooth transition to XDefiant's official release. It will work like other preloads, where you can only play it on launch day. 


How many gigabytes is XDefiant?


Thanks to the specs announcement and preload reload release, we know that XDefiant requires the following storage space: 



PC: 35GB


PS5: 30.09GB


Xbox Series X|S: 29 GB



Compared to other first-person shooter file sizes, XDefiant's storage space is relatively small, which should come as a relief. This means there may not be a need to clear any space. Additionally, those who downloaded XDefiant beforehand should only need a little space for the new update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA Sports College Football finally has a release date, cover stars, and two different editions. The long-awaited return to college football hits PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on July 19.
Gracing the cover of the game’s Standard edition are Michigan Wolverines running back Donovan Edwards, Texas Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers, and Colorado Buffaloes wide receiver/defensive back Travis Hunter. Check out the Standard and Deluxe covers in the gallery below.

The cover reveal comes a day before the game's full debut tomorrow. So far, we know that College Football 25 features 134 FBS schools, and it's being developed by Madden developer EA Orlando. The game was first announced in 2021 following a years-long hiatus for college football games due to the 2014 player likeness compensation lawsuit.
Both editions are now available for pre-order. The Standard Edition costs $69.99 and consists of the base game, Alma Mater and Cover Athlete Ultimate Team packs, and Bring Glory Home Ultimate Team Uniform Item. 
The $99.99 Deluxe Edition includes three days of early access (July 16-18), 4600 College Football Points, Heisman Hopeful/Alma Mater/Cover Athlete Ultimate Teams packs, and the Bring Glory Home Ultimate Team Uniform Item.
Lastly, a $149.99 MVP Bundle includes the Deluxe editions of EA Sports College Football 25 and the upcoming Madden NFL 25.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-05-16T16:13:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision, the developer-publisher Microsoft and Xbox purchased for $69 billion last year, has formed a new studio called Elsewhere Entertainment, and it is developing a new "narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise." The studio is based in Warsaw, Poland, and, according to a report from IGN, it is not working on a Call of Duty-related project. 
This studio, which has been formed behind-the-scenes before today's public unveiling, arrives roughly one week after Xbox closed four Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall team Arkane Austin. While the company has yet to publicly address the closures directly, Xbox president Sarah Bond said in an interview that the closures were about keeping the business healthy in the long-term. It's why news of this new studio might be surprising, given one week ago, the parent company of Activision was closing studios to cut costs. 


"Built from the ground up, Elsewhere Entertainment is a premier and standalone studio dedicated to establishing an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas," a blog post reads. "The team's underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games. [The] new studio has full access to Activision's resources and tools as it continues to increase production and development. 
"Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry and around the world to help create a state-of-the-art and next generation gaming experience." 
Elsewhere is currently made up of developers with experience working on franchises like The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077, Destiny, Tom Clancy's The Division, and Far Cry.

        <updated>2024-05-16T15:31:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Manor Lords, the medieval strategy city-builder and one of 2024's surprise hits, has surpassed two million copies sold. The game has only been available in PC Early Access since April 26, meaning it achieved this milestone in only three weeks.
Publisher Hooded Horse announced the sales account for Steam, Epic, GOG, and the Microsoft Store (where Manor Lords is also playable through PC Game Pass). The game quickly caught fire, selling 1 million copies a day after launch. Since then, Manor Lords has enjoyed a consistently high concurrent player count, peaking at 173,000 on Steam in its first weekend.  


Manor Lords is being developed by Slavic Games and puts players in the shoes of a medieval lord tasked with building and growing a city. Players manage their city’s community, infrastructure, economy, and defense/expansion, the latter of which unfold as large-scale tactical battles. The intricate social and production systems combined with an ever-changing world (complete with seasonal and weather changes) result in an organic metropolis that players have taken to in a big way. 
Manor Lords joins Early Access hits this year, such as Palworld and Hades II. The game’s 1.0 launch is currently up in the air as the game continues to change and improve based on player feedback. It’s off to a great start, though, and we’re curious to see how it evolves throughout its EA period.]]></summary>

The latest Japanese charts from Famitsu (via Gematsu) are in and this week paints a pretty familiar picture.
Last week's champion, Stellar Blade, takes the trophy once again and stands as the representative of the only non-Switch title in the running. On the flip side, the likes of Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes and Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – Sweep the Board! have dropped out of the top ten, leaving Mario Kart 8 Deluxe the chance to speed back onto the podium and take second place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You will need an internet connection to install Assassin's Creed Shadows, but after that, the entire experience can be played offline, Ubisoft has announced. The company did so after word online spread that Shadows requires a mandatory online connection to play the game. 
Following the reveal of Shadows yesterday, which showcased the dual samurai and shinobi protagonists we'll be controlling in 16th-century feudal Japan, people noticed wording in preorder listings and elsewhere that seemingly pointed to the game requiring an always-online connection. This frustrated fans of the series, especially given Shadows, like its recent predecessors, is a single-player game. However, that's not the case and Ubisoft released a statement today to clear the air. 


"Hey everyone, we wanted to share some of the early information on the upcoming launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, following some questions we've noticed in the community," the statement reads. "Assassin's Creed Shadows will not require a mandatory connection at all times. An online connection will be needed to install the game, but you will be able to play the entire journey offline, and explore Japan without any online connection. 

"We are super excited to bring Assassin's Creed to Feudal Japan on November 15 when the game releases, and we cannot wait to show you more along the way." 

As you can see, it's clear Shadows is a game you can play offline, but only after connecting to the internet once to actually install the RPG. 
Assassin's Creed Shadows hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Amazon Luna, PC (via the Ubisoft Store and Epic Games Store), and Mac (with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store) on November 15.
For more, check out what we learned yesterday during the Shadows reveal, and then read Game Informer's ranking of the entire Assassin's Creed series.

Via Gematsu and PCGamer, Saito said, “I’ve been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now. I’ll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. (Laughs.) That’s about all I can say for now.” Thanks for the clarity, Saito.

Following up the sublime Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster was always going to be tough. Rather than tackle another well-known franchise, Nightdive Studios has wisely chosen to revisit one of the weirdest forgotten gems of the ‘90s with PO’ed: Definitive Edition. Utilising the same principles as Dark Forces, Nightdive’s latest project breathes fresh air into the Any Channel-developed FPS which debuted on 3DO, modernising it in all the right ways while maintaining a respectable level of authenticity.
We should stress right from the start, though: this is a weird game, and it won’t be for everybody. The Dark Forces Remaster was based on an already well-known title, and even if you hadn’t played the original, it was crammed full of recognisable imagery from the Star Wars franchise to help ease you into the old-school experience.

Ne-konference neznamená, že se organizátorům nechce připravovat program, ale naopak dává prostor všem pozvaným, aby si program sami složili z toho nejzajímavějšího, čím se v poslední době zabývají nebo co je oslovilo. Obsah, který vytváří všichni účastníci, se skládá z desetiminutových prezentací a delších workshopů s převážně vývojářskou tématikou od devops, přes datové struktury, nástroje, jazyky, zkušenosti s automatizací testů a různé zajímavosti ze světa IT.

Pokud chcete nasát atmosféru minulých ročníků či ohodnotit kvalitu přednášek, navštivte náš YouTube kanál. Nejoblíbenější z nich právě překonala 22 tisíc shlédnutí.

Co je potřeba udělat, abyste se mohli zúčastnit? Připravit si desetiminutovou prezentaci na libovolné téma, která má potenciál oslovit ostatní přítomné. Historicky proběhlo i několik velmi zajímavých nevývojářských témat, takže ani výletu do úplně jiného oboru není třeba se nikterak bránit.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The video game equivalent of Limp Bizkit.
Fans of unconventional narrative-driven games may be familiar with Hypnospace Outlaw, a cool project from a few years ago that aimed to simulate an alternate take on the social environment of the late '90s internet. Though Hypnospace Outlaw will be receiving a proper sequel with the upcoming Dreamsettler, Tendershoot decided to give waiting players a more unconventional spin-off release that takes things in a much different direction. Dubbed Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengeance of the Slayer, this classic-style boomer shooter launched on PC and Xbox in 2023 and sort of bears some narrative connections to Hypnospace Outlaw. It’s a decent game in its own right, and even though it didn’t manage to ‘wow’ us, we’d still suggest you give it a look.
The story of Slayers X is rather fascinating, as there are essentially two levels to it. On the first, you have the premise: this is the in-universe game that Zane Lofton from Hypnospace Outlaw referenced. He essentially designed this with the help of a friend, so the experience you’re ultimately getting with Slayers X is something an immature, horny teenager would make if he was given free rein to express himself. This leads to the second narrative level, the ‘in-game’ plot. You play the role of “Big Z”, an X-Slayer in-training who is forced into action when the monstrous Psyko Sindikate attacks his town, kills both his mom and mentor, and kidnaps one of his fellow X-Slayers. He thus sets out on a quest for revenge, blowing up a whole lot of baddies along the way as he fights to free his friend.

        <updated>2024-05-15T17:14:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has canceled The Division Heartland. First announced in 2021, the game was a free-to-play spin-off of The Division franchise developed by Red Storm Studio.
Ubisoft revealed the cancelation in an earnings report, stating,
“As part of Ubisoft’s efforts to streamline its operations and adapt to evolving market trends, there have been further reorganizations within the Global Publishing teams, both at the APAC region, that is not organized into three engagement hubs, and at the central level. Additionally, in line with the increased selectivity of its investments, Ubisoft has decided to stop development on The Division Heartland and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six.”


The Division Heartland had been quiet for some time after its reveal, including being delayed. It eventually resurfaced with closed beta tests, but scarce updates on its existence caused doubt and confusion among fans. The game was billed as a PvEvP survival action experience with players controlling a Division agent tasked with protecting a small town from enemy factions and chemical contamination. 
Despite the cancellation, we know it doesn't mean the end of the franchise. Ubisoft announced The Division 3 last September, with series creator Massive Entertainment back at the helm. That game currently has no release window. 
Heartland joins an expanding graveyard of canceled Ubisoft projects over the past few years. In January 2023, the publisher canceled its upcoming team-based arena battler Project Q and three other games in development. In 2022, the battle royale Ghost Recon Frontline, Splinter Cell VR, and two unannounced games were also axed. An unannounced sequel to Immortals Fenix Rising was also reportedly scrapped last July.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After teasing its reveal earlier this week, Ubisoft has officially unveiled Assassin's Creed Shadows with its first cinematic trailer, revealing dual protagonists in the process. As many speculated, Shadows puts players in control of Japan's first African samurai, Yasuke (a real historical figure), and a female shinobi character, Naoe. It will be released on November 15.
This dual protagonist approach isn't too surprising given it's Ubisoft Quebec developing the game – it did the same with Kassandra and Alexios in 2018's Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Jacob and Evie Frye in 2015's Assassin's Creed Syndicate – but it's exciting nonetheless. According to the game's PlayStation preorder page, players can, "Switch seamlessly between two unlikely allies as you discover their common destiny," conf…]]></summary>

Last month, I had a chance to play Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble, the first all-new entry in the Super Monkey Ball (SMB) franchise in more than a decade. While I went into the demo skeptical that the series, which experienced its best years in the early-to-mid 2000s, could feel like a modern experience in 2024, I emerged from the demo impressed by the gameplay improvements, single-player level design, and the game's approach to multiplayer (you can read my full preview here).

I promise, I approached Little Kitty, Big City with an open heart, because I do really like cats. But given my aversion to their babification by the internet, it may be surprising that my chief complaint about Little Kitty, Big City is that the hats in it are largely not cute enough.

Pascal's Joel appears to be in the barn where a very important and intense scene between he and Ellie takes place, while Ellie appears to be inside a wintery location, likely somewhere in the game's beginning where snow is abundant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nic reckons Homeworld 3, the long-awaited spacefaring RTS, is mostly pretty good. Qualified hoorays for that, as well as for the fact that it doesn’t make especially mad demands of your hardware: besides netting a Steam Deck Playable badge from Valve, its minimum PC specs only list the likes of the Intel Core i5-6600 and Nvidia’s GTX 1060. Easily doable, for most aspiring galactic admirals.
Once a battle gets underway, however, Homeworld 3’s performance can start tanking, turning an initially smooth engagement into a more stutter-prone light show. The good news? You can more than double your framerates with a relatively small handful of graphics setting changes, even if some these (including the DLSS and FSR 2 upscalers) can be a tad inconsistent in their own right.

The interests of the game's creators have not so much leaked into this fictional world as they have been generously pumped in with an industrial hose. Even the visual novel's loading screens take the form of those two-second intermission panels that flash up to signal an anime's commercial break, complete with random characters announcing the game's name ("Neurodiver!"). In moments like that, the passion is endearing. But in other places, it is overwhelming. Neurodiver is obsessed with media in a way that often distracted me from the bright-eyed cyberpunk story it wants to tell.

As he stepped off court for the last time, I found myself welling up. He doesn't know me - of course he doesn't - and I don't know him. But for ten years I'd watch him at every opportunity and see him grow into one of the all-time greats. For me, his retirement wasn't only devastating in the sense he was a great ambassador for the sport: a positive soul, a good speaker, a hard worker. No, it also spelled the end of us being able to witness something impossible to replicate, a 'game' of badminton uniquely his. And for a magical two years, he had the best game in the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi-Fi Rush is getting one final patch today to address some minor issues in the game. Plus, the Hi-Fi Rush X (formerly Twitter) account has reconfirmed a physical edition of the game is coming from Limited Run Games. 
This update from the Hi-Fi Rush X account comes roughly one week after Xbox shut down the game's developer, Tango Gameworks, alongside Redfall studio Arkane Austin, and two more Bethesda teams. While there won't be any more Hi-Fi Rush content coming from Tango Gameworks, hopefully today's patch puts the game in the best playable state possible so that future players can enjoy the 2023 hit. 
Thank you all for your continued support.
May 15, 2024
The closure of Tango Gameworks arrived roughly a year after the team delivered the extremely well-received Hi-Fi Rush, which by Xbox's own admitted metrics, was a big success. A few days after the closure of these studios, Xbox president Sarah Bond addressed the situation, stating that it's about keeping the business healthy in the long-term. 
For more, read Game Informer's Hi-Fi Rush review, and then read Game Informer's profile on the life and career of Hi-Fi Rush creator John Johanas. After that, check out this Game Informer feature about exploring Tokyo's Shibuya with Tango Gameworks.

The first is that it's a brighter, glitzier version of Toby Fox's Undertale that looks like it belongs on Gameboy Advance - a retro parody created in GameMaker whose turn-based combat houses many an inventive minigame, and whose writing doesn't so much break the fourth wall as moonwalk along the parapet, showering the player in poop, anime tropes and off-colour mental health advice.

Right now it's a live-service game with microtransactions, but soon it'll continue as a paid co-op RPG with no in-game monetisation. And that's alongside promised tweaks to how progression works, too. Huh. It's often you see paid games go free-to-play, but this is an unexpected switcheroo.

The first Mortal Kombat movie in this rebooted film series hit theaters on April 23, 2021, and Game Informer had a great time with it – read our 8 out of 10 review to find out why here. Here's hoping we enjoy the sequel just as much, if not more. 
Mortal Kombat director Simon McQuoid will return to direct Mortal Kombat 2, and it will be written by a new writer, Jeremy Slater (alongside McQuoid), who wrote Disney's Moon Knight series. Alongside returning cast and characters, The Boys Karl Urban will join the fight as Johnny Cage.

The Musk era has transformed what was already fondly known as a hellsite into something at once more obnoxious and sadder, whether you're talking about the web3 grifters or the resurgent debate-me cryptofascists or the recommendation algorithm's perceptibly greater enthusiasm for quote-tweet flamebait.
Still, there are lights in the darkness. Yesterday, Graham pointed us towards a thread started by The End Is Nigh developer Tyler Glaiel in which he challenged other developers to "take a short break, pick a number in your code or data files, multiply it by 1000, and post the results". Other developers have heeded the call. Here's a round-up of the results that doubles as a watery echo of Alice0's (RPS in peace) old Screenshot Saturday Monday features.

I’ll go with ‘caffeinated’ I think. Like the Adult Swim cartoons it reminded me of, it’s got a sense of the sardonic and a penchant for violence, but still comes from a place of having recently devoured several bowls of suspiciously colorful cereal. Anyways, forget all that. I mentioned an FPS in the title, so I must assume you’re here for the violence.

This one is mainly aimed at re-balancing an overly demanding new grudge system for the Dwarfs that punished players for stopping to enjoy a swift pint of Bugman’s instead of constantly being on the offensive, but also includes so many other fixes it’s veering into larger patch territory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Casting of Frank Stone, the upcoming narrative horror game set in the Dead By Daylight universe by Until Dawn developer Supermassive Games, has its first gameplay trailer. The game was first announced at the 2023 Game Awards. 
The story unfolds in 1980 in the town of Cedar Hills, a town scarred by the murderous killer Frank Stone. It stars four friends who set out to create a horror film at a derelict steel mill dubbed Murder Mill. Naturally, that goes as horribly as you’d imagine, and players must survive by making choices that decide the characters’ relationships and fates. Sudden quick-time events can also be the deciding factor between whether someone lives or dies. 


Similar to Supermassive’s previous titles like The Quarry and the Dark Pictures Anthology, The Casting of Frank Stone can go down multiple paths based on your choices. Players will also solve environmental puzzles and gather clues to learn more about Cedar Hills
The Casting of Frank Stone still has no release date, but it will launch later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

The latter doesn’t have a title yet, and is described as “a next-gen Life Sim that emphasizes player-driven narratives, allowing communities to share memorable moments that grow out of the creativity of players themselves.” According to former XCOM and Marvel’s Midnight Suns director Jake Solomon, it’s “focused on the drama of modern life, where our players will write meaningful stories just by playing, and then share those stories with the world.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tucked away in a corner of 1999's Yosuka, Japan-set open world sim Shenmue there's a convenience store, or "konbini", where you can buy stuff like carrot juice, take part in raffles, and fritter away the hours listening to the shop jingle - an absolute die-cast classic of the genre in that you'll probably be humming the tune before you realise that you've even heard it. Nagai Industries founder Dima Shen has been obsessed with that unassuming Tomato Convenience Store since he was a teenager, partly for the contrast it offers to the rest of the game. "Shenmue was a really depressing game, I would say - your father is killed, it's always raining," he tells me. "But there's one kind of super-healthy place in the whole game: a convenience store!"

        <updated>2024-05-14T15:29:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon has ordered a new Tomb Raider TV series to production, and it will be written and produced by Fleabag star and writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who also starred in last year's Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Like Amazon's Fallout series, this Tomb Raider show will premiere exclusively on Prime Video to more than 240 countries and territories around the world. 
This series order arrives as part of a larger deal between Amazon MGM Studios and Tomb Raider reboot developer Crystal Dynamics, which is currently working on a new Tomb Raider game in Unreal Engine 5. In December of 2022, we learned Amazon Games will publish that in-development Tomb Raider game, which Amazon describes as a "single-player, narrative-driven adventure that will add a new chapter to Lara Croft's story in the Tomb Raider series." 
"With great IP, the possibilities are endless," Amazon Games vice president Christoph Hartmann writes in a press release. "The richness and depth of the fiction allows the Tomb Raider series from Prime Video and the video game from Amazon Games to tell separate stories about Lara Croft's adventures. We're honored that Crystal Dynamics has entrusted Amazon with this iconic franchise, and we're looking forward to seeing where this collaboration takes us." 
This is the second upcoming TV adaptation to star the iconic treasure hunter. Netflix's animated series Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft, starring Haley Atwell, is set to premiere sometime this year. That particular show is set within the continuity of Crystal Dynamic's reboot trilogy, taking place after the events of Shadow of the Tomb Raider. 
If you're curious about Crystal Dynamics' recent Tomb Raider reboot, you can pick up Tomb Raider: Game of the Year Edition on PC via GOG for free if you're an Amazon Prime member throughout May.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My evolving relationship with Vampire Therapist continues apace - much how protagonist Sam's acumen as an unlicensed therapist for the unsettled undead develops at speed. He's a vampire doing therapy for other vampires, while also undergoing therapy, as a vampire, from another therapist (who is a vampire). Vampire Therapist! I've been able to get to grips with a playable preview - I'd say I got my teeth into it, but I'm not that much of a hack fraud - which means I got to see some of the things that creative director Cyrus Nemati told me about in our interview in action. I remain optimistic that, on it's release on June 18th, Vampire Therapist can walk the tricky line it's drawn for itself.  

It's balancing on a knife point of humour, the supernatural, and sincerity about mental health, the latter using real cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; the comments the first time I wrote about Vampire Therapist revealed a lot about our readership) concepts in consultation with licensed therapists. The preview only covered Sam's first meeting with his mentor, Andromachos, and the first client Sam treats himself - a doctor called Drayne, simultaneously self-loathing and self-aggrandising - but it gave a flavour of how the game plays. Rather than a sort of janky template on how to self-therapise, as I'd feared, when you're playing Vampire Therapist it operates more as a sort of language puzzle against different types of theatre kids.

This throwback first-person RPG is hazardous, and not only due to the dreamlike islands floating in the sky. My leg-snappin' plummet may be down to early access changes, causing the ground to be updated from right under my feet. Far from being a nuisance, meta-jank like this only endears me further to Dread Delusion. It is an RPG from the other side of some attic mirror, an Elder Scrolls from a parallel 2002. It has, somehow, slipped into our reality and is seeing its full release today. There are gods you can thank for this, but we dare not speak their names.

The classic tabletop RPG is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, and the most significant event of that celebration is undoubtedly the release of a revision for the game's core rules, including the Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual. Backwards-compatible with the entirety of the 5th edition of the game, the new books are nonetheless a big new step forward for the game, reflecting a decade of iteration and evolution as the game has exploded in popularity.
The books aren’t far off. Players and Dungeon Masters alike can watch for pre-orders starting on June 18; each book is set to be priced at $49.99. Each of the three new books comes in at a hefty 384 pages apiece.

        <id>122619</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/14/ps5-breaks-sales-record-but-still-falls-short-of-target-after-crossing-59-million"/>
        <updated>2024-05-14T14:21:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed in its latest financial earnings report it sold 20.8 million PlayStation 5 units in the fiscal year that ended on March 31. In doing so, Sony sold more than any fiscal year since the console's launch in November 2020. However, despite that achievement, Sony still fell short of its original PS5 sales target for this year, missing it by more than 4 million units. 
Originally targeting 25 million units for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, Sony sold 20.8 million, bringing the grand total up to 59 million, despite the 4 million units miss. As noted by VideoGamesChronicle, however, Sony revised that 25 million unit target in February to just 21 million; it still didn't hit that target, though, just narrowly missing the mark. 


At 59 million units, the PS5 is just behind the PlayStation 4's 60 million units at the same point in its life cycle. However, Tokyo-based video game analyst Serkan Toto told VGC that 20.8 million units sold is likely going to remain the peak for the PS5, and that this number would have been much lower if not for the release of Helldivers 2 in February, which is PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever after selling 12 million copies in 12 weeks. 
On the earnings call, Sony told investors to expect gaming sales to decrease in the fiscal year that just began (and ends March of next year) due to an expected decrease in console sales. There are also no major games from existing franchises releasing between now and then, according to the company. However, Sony says it still plans to release Concord, the new multiplayer online shooter IP from Firewalk Studios coming to PS5 and PC, this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jake Solomon, former long-time Firaxis designer and director who spearheaded Marvel’s Midnight Suns and was a lead designer on XCOM: Enemy Unknown, has announced he’s formed a new company following his departure from Firaxis last February. Midsummer Studios is a team consisting of veteran Firaxis and Maxis designers. 
Midsummer was founded by Solomon, who serves as CEO and creative director, game director Will Miller (also formerly of Firaxis), and COO/CFO Nelsie Birch, a newcomer to games with a 25-year career in financial and operations management. They’re joined by executive producer Grant Rodiek, an 18-year veteran of Maxis Studios and former producer/director on several entries of The Sims. In addition to them, the small team currently consists of six other designers.


The company’s debut game will be a next-gen life sim that, according to the press release, “emphasizes player-driven narratives, allowing communities to share memorable moments that grow out of the creativity of players themselves.” 
“The best stories in games are written by the players,” said Solomon in the press release. “At Midsummer we’re making a life sim focused on the drama of modern life, where our players will write meaningful stories just by playing, and then share those stories with the world.”
Midsummer has secured a $6 million investment with several partners and is focused on growing a sustainable studio that values the health and happiness of its employees.]]></summary>

I may leave little insights scattered throughout. A Paper Trail, if you will. A puzzle game named Paper Trail that has you solve discrete head-scratchers by folding the screen like a piece of paper in different ways to create new paths, I might even say, if I were trying to cram a bunch of information right at the top without breaking theme. Let’s talk about it.

        <updated>2024-05-14T13:05:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 is PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever, the company has announced in its latest financial earnings call. It achieved this title after crossing 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks, beating out the record previously held by God of War Ragnarök, which sold 11 million copies in 10 weeks, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. 
Developer Arrowhead Game Studios' live-service multiplayer shooter sequel hit PlayStation 5 on February 8, with a simultaneous PC launch that same day, which is new for PlayStation. Its usual PC strategy sees PlayStation games launching on PC years after the game's console release – Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut is only just now coming to PC this month, for example. It seems launching on PC day-and-date with PS5 was the right call, though, as Helldivers 2 is now a bonafide hit for PlayStation. 


Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Johan Pilestedt celebrated the news, noting there are more Helldivers 2 players than Swedes (the studio is based in Stockholm, Sweden) while thanking players for helping the team and PlayStation reach this achievement. 
As announced in the Sony earnings call, we have sold over 12M units!
@Helldivers2. A massive thank you to the community for your support,…
May 14, 2024
Notably, Arrowhead Game Studios is independent – PlayStation published Helldivers 2 as a PS5 console exclusive, in a way previously referred to as second-party. However, given acquisitions are happening more and more this generation, it wouldn't be surprising if PlayStation attempted to bring Arrowhead Game Studios under the first-party umbrella.

After that brief stint, PlayStation is tackling the CEO position with two figures, each with different focuses. 
Hulst has been appointed CEO of SIE's Studio Business Group while Nishino has been appointed CEO of SIE's Platform Business Group. Totoki, now through as interim CEO, will serve as a Chairman of SIE in addition to returning to his role as COO and CFO of Sony Group Corporation. Both Nishino and Hulst will report to Totoki.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elden Ring is already home to a lot of rotten creatures. Serpent snails that spit at you, ulcerated spirits with bark for skin, a big pair of hands. Now we know of another rotten creature who's going to join the roster when the Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC drops next month: a bloke who's head would make for an excellent lottery draw.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've played little of legendary survival sim The Long Dark, or The Short Dark, as I guess it has proven for me. I fell off the game after succumbing to my first wolf. But I've sampled enough to know that adding a "Misery Mode" to the game is sort of like upending a bucket of water over a drowning person. More misery in The Long Dark? Oh thank god, that's just what this notoriously easygoing wilderness adventure has been missing. And what's this, developers Hinterland are introducing a new predator, the Cougar, which will move into any area you're fond of and compete over territory. Finally, a bit of friction for what has previously been a stroll in the woods.


It's not all misery. In a first for The Long Dark, which has hitherto been a permadeath game that wipes your save between runs, the devs are working on an optional Cheat Death system. It's not as cheaty as it sounds, however. You can only return from the grave four times, and each time, you'll have to make unspecified trade-offs. The idea is to stop people backing up their saves and make failure more of an adventure or if you prefer, an agonisingly slow decline, rather than letting players avoid the consequences of their actions.

First, something might change about the way resource gathering tools are used (the pickaxe you use to mine silver during a run, for example). Second, and perhaps more significant, is an upcoming change to the way Melinoë's dash and sprint work. We don't know exactly what that change is but, according to Supergiant, it has something to do with your witchy batterer's "distinct style".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back Ubisoft revealed about a billion Assassin's Creed projects. The first of these to leap into the carefully placed haystack of release was Mirage, which I liked. Up next, it seems, is the artist formally known as Assassin's Creed: Codename Red. All we knew about red was that it would be set in feudal Japan, something fans have been clamouring for for literal years. Now we know that it's an AC game set in feudal Japan called Assassin's Creed Shadows, and it's getting an "official cinematic world premiere trailer" debut on YouTube tomorrow, at 5pm BST.
Also, because this sort of thing seems to always happen with Ubi, the placeholder text for said YouTube premiere might have accidentally leaked the release date for the game as November 15, 2024.

And seemingly by Mullet Mad Jack, the protagonist of a single-player roguelike FPS who would shove draft beers into the skull of a billionaire robot, then shoot him in the gonads. What I'm trying to say is, Mullet Mad Jack is fashionable and no-nonsense, which makes for a great hang if you'd like to burn some aggression once in a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atlus has announced that the original version of Shin Megami Tensei V will be delisted from the Nintendo eShop on June 13. That’s one day before the launch of its expanded definitive edition, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance.
On June 13, Shin Megami Tensei V’s Digital Standard and Digital Deluxe editions and all of its DLC will be removed from the eShop. However, owners of the physical and digital versions will still be able to play and redownload this content after it’s been delisted. SMT V first launched in November 2021, and Atlus declared it the best-selling game in the series in January 2022.
The original Shin Megami Tensei V Digital Standard, Digital Deluxe, and all associated DLC will be delisted from the Nintendo eShop on June 13.
May 13, 2024
Atlus has not provided a reason for this move, but given the timing, it’s likely to avoid confusion with the upcoming SMTV: Vengeance, which is the same game (including all DLC) but with quality-of-life improvements and an additional storyline that introduces new locations and demons. Think of it as the Persona 5 Royal of SMT V. Vengeance will also be multi-platform, whereas the original game was a Switch exclusive, and it will run for the same price as the original Standard version, $59.99.
Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance launches on June 14. You can read our extended preview of the game here, and you can also check out our review of the original SMT V here.]]></summary>

The Rogue Prince of Persia, the upcoming roguelike from Dead Cells developer Evil Empire, will double-jump into Early Access on May 27.

Evil Empire delayed The Rogue Prince of Persia's Early Access launch to give its team members, their mothers, and players around the world more time with Hades II. The team said at the time The Rogue Prince of Persia would still hit Early Access this month, and now we know it's May 27. 
The Rogue Prince of Persia's new release date is 27th May! If you didn't see our previous post, the TLDR is to give people time to play Hades 2, including us😄

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix, the developer-publisher behind this year's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, is set to lay off an unspecified number of employees across its U.S. and European offices, which are headquartered in California and the United Kingdom, respectively, this week. According to those in attendance, Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu delivered this news in a company-wide meeting, as first reported by VideoGamesChronicle. 
Layoffs such as these were suspected following Square Enix's latest financial earnings report, which includes a three-year company reboot plan with an "aggressive" multiplatform release strategy after a slide mentioned "structural reforms." You can see the slide below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last few weeks I’ve been watching quite a few YouTube videos (thanks, Evo Japan), and noticing that adverts during videos a) seem to pop up every 30 seconds or so and b) then last for an unskippable 30 to 60 seconds. My frustration with being bombarded by YouTube ads in videos for which I pay nothing to watch - meaning that I understand the necessity for ads of some kind to support creators and pay server bills - came to mind as I read about EA’s plans to explore inserting advertising into games, which I pay up to £70 a pop to play.

Among the publishers’ revamped approach to making money - following a recent drop in profits, per their latest financials - is a more “aggressive” approach to bringing their games to more platforms than specific consoles (in other words, PlayStation) as exclusives, with a particular focus on “win[ning] over PC users”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed Codename Red now has an official title: Assassin’s Creed Shadows. We’ll also get our first full-length look at the series' first Japanese entry this week. 
Ubisoft announced on X that the game’s cinematic world premiere trailer will air on May 15 at 9 a.m. P.T./12 p.m. ET. Ubisoft’s use of the word “cinematic” suggests that this trailer will not include gameplay. If that’s the case, Ubisoft could be saving a gameplay reveal for its Ubisoft Forward presentation less than a month later, on June 10.
Assassin's Creed Codename Red becomes Assassin's Creed Shadows.

Assassin’s Creed Shadows was first announced in 2022 and will be the first entry set in feudal Japan. At the time, Ubisoft described the game as being an open-world RPG and the ultimate "shinobi fantasy." It is being developed by Ubisoft Quebec, the team behind Assassin's Creed Odyssey. It has no release window, but the game is expected to launch later this year.]]></summary>

It was pre-covid, and Pressure Cooker Studios’ composer Daniel Caleb was flicking through reddit posts when a trailer cut through the glare. He’d never heard of Manor Lords before. It looked like a new IP, but already had a huge Reddit following. Caleb loved what he saw. At that point, Pressure Cooker mainly worked on film scores, but both Caleb and fellow composer Elben Schutte had always wanted to eventually move on to bringing their storytelling from cinema to games. Even more so than film, games were the passion. Manor Lords would be perfect for them.

I think this has gotten worse (if that's the word?) with the increasingly popularity of BookTok, the book-centric community on TikTok. It's really mobilised young people towards reading (which is good) but in some cases drives a consumption for consumption's sake approach, where one must have read new books to talk about, one must take no breaths between reading, and one must read an astonishing number of books in the smallest amount of time possible (which I think is bad).

To fill you in, Fire Emblem is known and sort of celebrated for being a rich ensemble fantasy story with character permadeath. Helldivers 2, meanwhile, is a game in which people are as expendable as bullets, and the storytelling is deliberately brittle because it consists largely of clownish propaganda. Put the two sets of inspirations together, and what do you get? You get a headline, that's what. Beyond that, we can only dream.

Something about ROBOBEAT’s roguelike shooting feels different though.

It's a grid-based, upwardly mobile roguelitey dungeon crawler set in a big tower, each floor a semi-randomised maze of monsters (which you can capture), traps and pick-ups, where player and creature actions happen simultaneously.
Effort Star's Enter The Chronosphere doesn't have grids or monster capturing, that I know of, but it taps into a comparable vein of diorama-sized frantic-yet-laidback challenge, with characters, foes and projectiles frozen in time till you give a command. There's a demo on Steam as part of the platform's Endless Replayability Fest, which I encourage you to try, whether you are one of the COOL KIDS who played Azure Dreams or not.

Some form a fractal baleen network of crosshatched layers disappearing backward into the vanishing point; others are shaped like lockpicks, raccoon heads and semi-detached houses. This week's new game releases are no less motley and misshapen, though thankfully not quite as heavily varnished with plaque: there's something in the shop for everyone, I think.

Kim Dotcom says the men are already free after providing "false confessions" for use against him. After eight years, the criminal case against him in the U.S. showed action recently, with secret orders handed down by the court. Dotcom predicts a new raid and revocation of his bail.

That's because its online features will require players to sign-in to a PSN account, and PSN accounts are not available in those countries. This is effectively the same issue that recently enraged Helldivers 2 players.

Indika is bizarre, surprising, and captivating. It made me question its reality almost as often as its titular protagonist, a young nun tormented by the Devil, doubts her faith. This odd adventure from its aptly named developer Odd Meter may lack some design polish, but the fascinating tale at its core instilled enough faith in me to see it through to the end. 
The game unfolds in early 19th-century Russia. Indika is treated as an outcast at her monastery, and, for some reason, she’s re…]]></summary>

Sure, other run-based indies like Balatro and Dead Cells, all-encompassing triple-A titles like Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and retro compilations like Sonic Origins and TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection, have shared that title, but I always know that when I need to pass time on a flight, no game does so as effectively as Vampire Survivors. Logically, I know that each run will last, at most, 30 minutes, but for some reason, it never feels that way. And because of that, I look down for what feels like 20 minutes, and when I look up, 2 hours have passed.

It’s also good sci-fi because its characters converse through reams of inscrutable but cool-sounding space science, and at no point does a grinning quipster tell a scientist: “Whoa there, professor. Why don’t you try saying that again... but in English!” Basically, if your wishlist for Homeworld 3 has tone and atmosphere at the top, rest easy. At no point did I get the sense that Blackbird ever took making the first proper Homeworld in eight years lightly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:10 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

It turns out that developers Evil Empire - they of very good roguelite platformer Dead Cells - saw the Hades 2 train steaming down the tracks, and decided to sensibly dodge-roll out of its way.

        <updated>2024-05-10T15:11:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Studios has cast Ralph Ineson as the planet-eating Galactus for The Fantastic Four. PlayStation 5 players might recognize that name as the voice of Cidolfus Telamon, aka Cid, in Final Fantasy XVI. This casting comes from The Hollywood Reporter, which reports that the production will begin shooting mid-summer in England. 
Ineson, whom you might also know from The VVitch, The Northman, and The Creator, joins a star-studded cast for the Marvel Cinematic Universe's first film about Marvel's First Family, which features Pedro Pascal (HBO's The Last of Us) as Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby (Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning) as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, Joseph Quinn (Stranger Things) as Johnny Storm/Human Torch, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Bear), as Ben Grimm/The Thing. Joining Ineson is a female Silver Surfer played by Julia Garner (Ozark).


Paul Walter Hauser (Cobra Kai) and John Malkovich (Being John Malkovich) will also appear in The Fantastic Four, although their roles are currently undisclosed. 
If you've played FFXVI, you already know Ineson has an incredible voice, certainly perfect for the role of a massive galactic entity that devours planets; we can't wait to see what he does as Galactus when The Fantastic Four hits theaters on July 25, 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Xbox closed four Bethesda studios, including Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks, the team behind last year's Hi-Fi Rush. While each of the four studios affected, which also included Mighty Doom developer Alpha Dog Games and Bethesda support studio Roundhouse Games, released a statement about the closures, Xbox remained silent. 
However, four days later, Bloomberg's Dina Bass interviewed Xbox president Sarah Bond and asked her about the Bethesda closures, to which Bond cited a desire to keep the Xbox business healthy in the long term, even through hard transition periods. 


Here's what Bond said: 
Bass then asked Bond specifically about the closure of Tango Gameworks after Hi-Fi Rush, which by Xbox's own admitted metrics, was a big success. Bond's answer here was less straightforward – you can read it below in full: 
While it's great that Bond addressed these closures at Xbox, it still lacks the clarity you'd expect from one of the biggest companies in the games industry. Neither Microsoft nor Xbox, including Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, has yet to address the layoffs and closures in an official capacity beyond this.
For more, read about how Redfall was reportedly set to receive a big offline play update this month before Xbox shut down Arkane Austin, and then read about how Xbox is reportedly considering bringing Senua's Saga: Hellblade II to PlayStation 5. After that, check out this story about how more job cuts at Xbox are reportedly on the way, and then read about how the company is debating putting Call of Duty on Xbox Game Pass alongside a price hike.

During the quest for a new flat - a quest I would slot somewhere between return to Ravenholm in Half-Life 2 and the Shalebridge Cradle in Thief: Deadly Shadows in terms of overall hopefulness and unpleasant surprises - I toyed briefly with the idea of living in a mobile home.
You can find all kinds of weirdo moving property on Gumtree - houseboats, caravans, yurts, large coats, coffins - but they all share the disadvantage of being cramped and more expensive than described and inadequate to the power and internet needs of a Maxed-Out Videogame Journalist. If I'd seen a house with chicken legs, though? It'd have been worth the sacrifice. Just think, whenever James Archer gives me grief about my performance in Lethal Company I could send my house to step on him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's once again just about time for a new Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion to hit store shelves. Continuing the Scarlet & Violet series is Twilight Masquerade, a set that focuses on the Teal Mask DLC of the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet video games. Because of that, players can expect locations, characters, and Pokémon from Kitakami, the folklore-rich area from the first part of the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero storyline.
As such, new Pokémon like Bloodmoon Ursaluna, Fezandipiti, Okidogi, Munkidori, and Sinistcha are all featured in Twilight Masquerade. However, the most common new Pokémon I encountered during my opening of several booster packs sent over by The Pokémon Company was Ogerpon; I pulled several different versions of the grass-type Legendary Pokémon from The Teal Mask. 
Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Twilight Masquerade adds 226 cards, including 14 new Pokémon ex cards, more than 30 Trainer cards, and dozens of special-illustration cards. I'll always love Gen I the most, so I was happy to add new cards featuring favorites like Alakazam, Zapdos, Ninetales, and Eevee, but my absolute favorites are the special illustration versions of Applin, Sunflora, and Infernape. I also adore the Hearthflame Mask Ogerpon ex card that I was lucky enough to grab.
You can check out my favorite cards I pulled from booster packs below.

 Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Twilight Masquerade is available on May 24. For more on the long-running Pokémon Trading Card Game, including other galleries from past expansions, head to our Pokémon TCG hub at the banner below!]]></summary>

I can tell it’s deeply powerful because MSI Afterburner’s fan control immediately went mental after I loaded up its free Steam combat demo. What do you mean ‘unoptimised’? That alarming sound is simply my computer shaking with awe at the fearless flippancy required to leave enemies fully untextured so they resemble Metal Gear Solid’s cyborg ninja. The promise of an indie fantasy RPG drew me in, but I must admit, I almost didn’t bother writing about this upon learning the demo is just a pre-Kickstarter combat slice. But something about it entrances me. What it lacks in textures, it makes up for in sheer moxy. You can’t optimise moxy! You can either make MSI shudder in terror or you can’t.

Microsoft’s only chance on this front, he says, is “to put all the world's biggest games on the service” – namely, Call of Duty, which still earns hundreds of millions annually in direct sales, or GTA 6, which, hahahaha.

So it looks like fans of the ancient Greek sadboi will have to flock to Summerfall's expansion when it comes out this summer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical, a creative and ambitious attempt to fuse musical theatre with interactive fiction, launched last August, but that's not the last time fans will get to experience that modern take on Greek myth. Announced today at LudoNarraCon, the game is getting DLC called Stray Gods: Orpheus, which follows the titular character through a new adventure. Check out the reveal trailer below.


Orpheus (played by Rent star Anthony Rapp) appeared in the base game, but only briefly, so this expansion will give players a better idea of his backstory and personality. The trailer also features Hermes (played by Erika Ishii), though their exact role in the DLC isn't clarified. The experience is roughly two hours long with six new interactive tracks and features some returning songwriters, including Austin Wintory, Simon Hall, and Montaigne, but also adds comedic musician Tom Cardy to the mix.
As for the plot, the following excerpt from a press release explains what to expect. "When the curtain has fallen and the show is over, who do you go home as?" it reads. "Choose to reject, embrace, or rewrite the stories the world expects of you. Is the mortal world ready for the return of Ancient Greece’s most infamous bard?"

Stray Gods: Orpheus hits PC on June 27, with a console release date "coming soon." For more Stray Gods, check out our feature on how it was made. For more Greek mythology, visit our Hades II coverage hub for this month's exclusive coverage.]]></summary>

See, these are the kinds of glacial changes of focus and ponderous shifts of strategy you often get at very large videogame publishers such as Microsoft. Trends are cyclical and corporations are sort of just these massive, sleepy hamsters, trundling around the wheel to rediscover practices and projects they once deemed bad for business. Hang on, let me go look up "yesterday" in the dictionary and fetch some sellotape - my brain appears to have exploded.

The game in question is cheery co-op shooter Helldivers 2, over which Aunty Sony recently upended a can of furious worms by abruptly insisting that Steam players have a PSN account for security reasons and so, blocking players in regions where PSN isn't available. Sony have subsequently walked back the requirement following a backlash of truly hellish proportions, though I understand that the game remains unavailable on Steam in certain regions. By comparison, Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt's remarks overnight that the developers might have been "removing the fun" with their gun balancing seem pretty innocuous.

So we wanted to talk about the game, why we're enjoying it, some of the new aspects over Hades the first, and just generally go 'Ooh, this game is fun, innit?'. Not a complex podcast this week.
James isn't here, so Nate makes up some hardware news that's very exciting and yet disturbing, while he does have a mythology-themed mini game in the tower of jocularity. Plus: the games we've been playing this week, including a cute survival horror and RimWorld, still. Also, Nate asks me to explain what the hap was heckening with Helldivers 2, and if Joel remains safe.

Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League was likely never going to perform well for Warner Bros.

I confess, I found this response annoying - partly because I was hoping Johanas would bring up some obscure indie composer I could then namecheck at parties, and partly, because I have spent years waiting for Tango to escape Mikami's shadow after essentially announcing themselves as a Mikami fan project back in 2010.

        <updated>2024-05-09T13:45:55.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More cuts at Xbox are reportedly on the way, with some staff at ZeniMax getting offered voluntary severance agreements this week. This news comes from a Bloomberg report that says employees across the Xbox organization have been told to expect more cuts. 
These potential layoffs would follow Xbox's decision to shutter four Bethesda studios earlier this week, including Hi-Fi Rush team Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin. As for the staff offered voluntary severance agreements, Bloomberg reports that producers, quality assurance testers, and other staff at ZeniMax are receiving them. 


The publication also reports the reason Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin were shut down this week is that they were in the process of pitching new projects and hiring additional staff for said projects, something suggested by ZeniMax head Jill Braff and Xbox president Matt Booty during a town hall held this week. Xbox and ZeniMax chose to shut these studios down – both in the beginning processes of creating new games – instead of closing a studio deeper in development on projects. 
Elsewhere in Bloomberg's report, which details an internal town hall held at Xbox following the studio closures this week, Booty reportedly described its studios as spread too thin, like "peanut butter on bread," and that leaders across the company felt understaffed. Xbox closed three studios and had ZeniMax Online Studios absorb Roundhouse Games to free up resources. Braff said during the meeting, "It's hard to support nine studios all across the world with a lean central team with an ever-growing plate of things to do. I think we were about to topple over." 
These studio closures follow the January layoffs of 1,900 employees at Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax, which add to the total of more than 10,000 laid off in the games industry just this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Senua's Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC later this month on May 21. However, its release arrives at a rocky period for Xbox, which just shuttered four Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush team Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin. As a result, Xbox players have wondered how safe Hellblade II developer Ninja Theory might be after its sequel's release, given Hi-Fi Rush was a "break out hit" for the company but wasn't enough to keep Tango open. 
Perhaps to help boost Hellblade II's sales, Xbox is reportedly considering bringing the game to PlayStation 5, according to The Verge. The publication's Tom Warren writes, "I understand Hellblade II is another game that Microsoft has been considering for the PS5. If that ever happens, at this point, it's not clear if even that would be considered a success." 


Hellblade II coming to PS5 wouldn't be out of left field, considering Xbox has brought previously exclusive games like Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Hi-Fi Rush to PS5 this year. However, with the launch of Hellblade II happening in just a few weeks, it seems if it does come to PS5, it will be post-launch, which lines up with Xbox's strategy in this realm thus far. 
Senua's Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21, 2024. 
For more about the game, check out the Senua's Saga: Hellblade II PC specs and system requirements, and then read about how Senua's Saga: Hellblade II will be locked to 30 FPS on Xbox Series X/S. After that, read about how the game will have a photo mode at launch.

As in ecologies at large, the most abundant and widespread are probably the bugs, beginning with the moth that flew into that Harvard Mark II in 1947 and ending with the teeming contents of the average free-to-play changelog. A little further up the food chain we find "worms", like the Creeper that once invaded the ARPANET, and "gophers", a directory/client system written in 1991 for the University of Minnesota. There are computer animals spawned by branding - foxes of fire and twittering birds and the anonymous beasts that haunt the margins of Google documents. There are computer animals that are implied by the verbs we use in computing - take "browser", derived from the old French word for nibbling at buds and sprouts, which suggests that all modern internet searches are innately herbivorous.

He was way more online when he was younger, and is the one who got me into the games of Lucasfilm, Troika and Blizzard, but these days he plays the games he likes a lot and does not read specialist websites that tell him why he shouldn't like them. He used to play loads of League Of Legends, but the game he was most into more recently was Hades. This is because he studied Classics.
I won't tell you how many years its been since he was at university, but for many years - and still sort of now, to be honest - "liking Apollo" was a key part of his personality. It's interesting, therefore, to text him about Hades 2. Partly because he wasn't even aware it was happening.

I understand this is a debate that has been ongoing internally for quite some time, with concerns from some that the revenue that Call of Duty typically generates for Activision Blizzard will be undermined by Game Pass."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to best describe strategy game Be the Ruler: Britannia when its alchemic reduction of traditionally full-on genres is what drew me to its free Steam prologue in the first place? A less demanding Manor Lords? A more casual Crusader Kings III? Total War with training wheels? It’s got shades of all these games, but thrown together with a wonderfully vibrant wood craft art style. It ends up as something I feel is going to be a lot more approachable for players who like the idea of massive medieval simulations but don’t care to spend time reading a Magna Carta-fat wiki to learn exactly what pop growth percentage is. I know what it is, and most days I wish I’d saved that brain space to e.g learn how to keep house plants alive instead.

But can you actually play "idle games" like this while getting your work day done? Aren't they distracting and obstructive? These are important questions. I plan to find the answers by playing Rusty's Retirement while simultaneously - and dutifully - completing days of work. Let's go!

The prospect of snipers certainly adds menace to the game's forensic sandboxing. The trouble is, the shooters aren't always as sharp as they could be.
