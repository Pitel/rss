        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New episodes will arrive every other week
Telltale Games is premiering the first episode of The Expanse: A Telltale Series this summer. The first installment will go live on July 27, with more episodes to follow in the weeks after.
The Expanse series will be episodic, with five episodes in total. After the first drops on July 27, each episode will follow two weeks after each other, putting the targeted end date in September.
There's a standard edition for $39.99, or a Deluxe Edition for $44.99 that will give 24-hour early access on PlayStation or Epic, and also future DLC. Yes, Telltale confirms DLC is on the way, though it doesn't clarify what shape that will take.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzG5WI5ak1g
All part of the churn
This new Expanse series arrives from the revived Telltale Games, under LCG Entertainment. While it's rolled out games like the Shadow Edition of the Batman Telltale series, The Expanse is one the studio has been building up to for a while, in collaboration with Life is Strange: True Colors developer Deck Nine.
Telltale also confirmed that The Wolf Among Us 2, its follow-up to the previous Fable adventure, is delayed into 2024. The shift is to avoid crunch, and move from Unreal 4 to 5, according to an IGN interview at the time.
This will be an interesting one to watch, to see what the new Telltale is putting out. Deck Nine's involvement certainly has me intrigued, as True Colors was a really solid entry in the Life is Strange series, and I'm a fan of The Expanse too. Opting for an episodic structure similar to what old Telltale popularized has me curious about its reception, though. At the very least, it will be weeks between episodes rather than months.
We'll see if the sci-fi drama's gradual rollout works. The Expanse: A Telltale Series premieres on July 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Epic.

Mommy’s Best Games has acquired the IPs of “legendary” arcade developer Occidental Design and is wringing them for every last drop of latent cash by releasing the long-lost Bumpy Grumpy on PC.
Occidental Design was the horrifically disfigured lovechild of Baer Sternmidden and William S. Fushnell, who were behind such controversial classics as Rip 'n' Tear, Xordian Knot, and Hellbombers. Bumpy Grumpy had a regional test back in 1983, but never saw the light of day beyond that. Occidental Design then faced bankruptcy multiple times before giving up in the face of horrible poverty in the early ‘90s.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After co-creator Ed Boon teased Mortal Kombat 12 news last week, we have confirmation that a formal reveal will happen tomorrow, May 18.
A new tweet from the official Mortal Kombat Twitter account reads, "Tomorrow is a new dawn" and contains a teaser styled after the previous video, featuring a clock hand that skips past 12 and strikes 1, followed by the text “It Is Time” with a start time of 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET.

Fans have speculated that the clock landing on "1" may signify the next game is a reboot of sorts. Although 2011’s MK 9 already did that, the wild ending of MK 11 (and its Aftermath expansion) certainly paved the runway for Netherrealm to essentially start fresh and do whatever it wants with the fiction going forward. As such, this 12th entry has the potential to be pretty nuts, even by MK standards. 
We learned a new Mortal Kombat was coming this year when Warner Bros. CEO told investors that Mortal Kombat 12 was launching this year. Whether this new game is actually called MK 12 or something else entirely is unclear, but we’re looking forward to waking up bright and early tomorrow morning to see what’s next for our favorite spine-ripping kombatants.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead By Daylight has a tantalizing new content update that involves…Nicolas Cage?
Developer Behaviour Interactive released a teaser for an announcement on July 5 regarding the massively talented actor's mysterious involvement. As for what Cage's role entails, an in-game version of the Renfield star only offers this nugget:
“There’s nothing more powerful than imagination. One can shape the fabric of reality, transforming everything you think you may know.”


Who knows what that means, but it looks like Cage is joining the game in some capacity. Is he a killer? Will he appear in one of his many, many film roles? Or is it scary enough to just have Nicolas Cage as himself running around trying to murder players? We’ll get our answers in July.
What do you want to see from Nicolas Cage in Dead by Daylight? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

You might remember Deneos' adorable Save Me Mr Tako! from a few years back. The definitive edition on Switch is now celebrating its two-year anniversary (how time flies) and the developer has today revealed that there is more to come from the Tako saga as it provided a first look at Tako no Himitsu: Ocean of Secrets.
This game will see you playing as a group of six heroes who set out on a journey to defeat the shadow monsters that have plagued the land. In the process, truths will be exposed, shining a light on some tough themes in the characters' lives up until this point. Deneos has cited a number of inspirations for this one including Eastward, CrossCode and Undertale, and has even gone as far as to say that the game is "like if Golden Sun met Illusion of Gaia" — no pressure then, eh?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Die. Mutate. Repeat.
Acclaimed roguelite Dead Cells is getting set to bring its compelling and amorphous adventure to your local coffee table, courtesy of a brand new board game currently in production at Le Scorpion Masque.
The Montreal-based studio, which has previously produced board games such as Decrypto, Zombie Kidz, and Stay Cool, launched a Kickstarter for Dead Cells, which will be the company's first licensed title. While the crowdfunding kicked off with a modest target of around $30,000 USD, the campaign has, at the writing of writing, surpassed a staggering $250,000, with 15 days still to go. As such, the game will now go into production. A release window is yet to be announced.
https://youtu.be/rfl-gb3M520
The Dead Cells board game will look to retain both the visual aesthetic, immersive atmosphere, and general gameplay of Motion Twin's 2018 release, as 1-4 players pick their way through ever-shifting dungeons in co-operative action, as they battle through High Peak Castle en route to a confrontation with the nefarious Hand of The King. One of four uniquely skilled Beheaded can be chosen, and the board will retain the Die/Repeat nature of its roguelike origins.
You can check out a breakdown of a pre-production copy in the video below, courtesy of the board game fans at Good Time Society.
https://youtu.be/qny-UMI4y1Q
Explore biomes, level up your character, defeat enemies, conquer challenges, and lose it all on the turn of a card. Level up your Beheaded, earn permanent upgrades, and work with your fellow team members to defeat what seems, at first glance, a near-insurmountable challenge. But strategy, synergy, and persistence can pay off in the end, or you'll simply die, and die, and die, and die trying.
You can check out a full breakdown of Dead Cells on the official Kickstarter.
Dead Cells is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and iOS/Android platforms.

The era that arguably made me the gamer I am today was the three-and-a-half-year span the Game Boy Advance ruled my life. I was 16 when it was released, and it was the first video game device I purchased with my own money. I didn’t have to wait for a birthday or holiday. The September after it first dropped, I took the bus over to the next town and dropped around $150 on the indigo purple version along with copies of The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Super Mario Advance. Five days later, I would return to the store to get a light for the screen because it was dark as hell.
That was a difficult year for me. Having a GBA got me through some very tough times. The toughest of which was my move from Washington to California. A new city. A new school.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That’s a lot of words
Strange Scaffold has announced another title in their stable of upcoming games, Teenage Demon Slayer Society. It’s currently only announced for PC and only has a release window of 2024.
Teenage Demon Slayer Society bills itself as “a bold new turn-based take on character action games, featuring style ranks, customizable movesets, and cool, endearing characters.” Strangely, my brain can make sense of that salad of descriptors, which is sad, because I get confused when paperwork asks for my address.
https://youtu.be/nmm2POiMNXQ
A trailer dropped alongside the announcement, showing off the game's style. I dig it. I like turn-based strategy that involves exactly one character. It’s not really all that much different than moving a bunch of characters around, but it makes me feel cool.
Real demons
Since Strange Scaffold is best known for An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs and Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator, Teenage Demon Slayer Society kind of blows my mind. Those two games employ more of a jank-pop aesthetic, whereas this one looks more like a stylish anime. It makes sense, though, since Japan is the only place where teenagers fight demons anymore. Actual sexy demons, I mean. Not like alcoholism or the imaginary kind that televangelists and Alex Jones shout at you about.
This is also quite the pace that Strange Scaffold has going on. It’s the development label of Xalavier Nelson Jr., whose work extends to a number of other great games beyond Strange Scaffold and into places like Hypnospace Outlaw. It feels like An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs was released yesterday, but because time has no meaning, it was actually 2021. Still, Teenage Demon Slayer Society joins Sunshine Shuffle and El Paso, Elsewhere in upcoming titles from the developer.
Teenage Demon Slayer Society is Currently only announced for PC. It is targeting a 2024 release.

With the news of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom reaching an incredible 10 million copies sold within its first three days of sale, key members of Nintendo itself are naturally keen to acknowledge the milestone.
Indeed, Nintendo of America's President, Doug Bowser, took to Twitter to thank fans for their unwavering support, but in doing so managed to make a rather amusing mistake in the process. Whether a result of autocorrect being a little too strict at the time or a genuine mistake from Mr. Bowser himself, his tweet mentioned 'Hyland' instead of 'Hyrule'. Check it out:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embark Studios has shifted the scope of its upcoming shooter, Arc Raiders. The game was first announced in 2021 as a co-op PvE-focused experience about working together to battle invading alien machines. Now, the game will have a PvP element thrown into the mix.
In an update, Embark reveals that since delaying Arc Raiders to focus on finishing its other upcoming title, The Finals, it’s added competitive play as well as an extraction element. The game still unfolds on a far future Earth ravaged by sentient machines, but now teams must compete with other human players in addition to the in-game enemies. Furthermore, the game adopts extraction-based objectives by tasking players to locate and retrieve resources scattered across the world for their squad. Here’s Embark's pitch for what Arc Raiders now entails:
Embark plans on launching a closed alpha test, giving players who sign up on their website the first opportunity to go hands-on with Arc Raiders. The game still has no release date, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

And as the press release points out (via BusinessWire), “with over 4 million sold in the Americas, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is also the fastest-selling Nintendo Switch game and the fastest-selling Nintendo game for any system in that territory.”
Fun fact, the original Legend of Zelda sold an estimated 6.5 million on NES. Meanwhile, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has sold around 30 million copies. So, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom still has some catching up to do, but it’s off to an incredible start.

Tears of the Kingdom is the perfect storm for sales. Its direct predecessor (ignoring the Link’s Awakening remake) was already well-received and sold like hotcakes. Any game in The Legend of Zelda series is already going to be hotly anticipated, and Tears of the Kingdom was well-received by critics. It was announced back in 2019, and since then has been like a cow being slowly lowered into a tank of piranhas. There’s no surprise that the piranhas are now gorging themselves.
Personally, I’m enjoying it. I’m among the many who loved Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom feels like an extension of that. A lot of puzzle-solving is based around building things, which is a feature that works just fine for me. I don’t spend a lot of time getting overly creative because I prefer to focus on the exploration, but I still enjoy it just fine. I guess I’m just joining the chorus here.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is available now on Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony is sharing what's in store for the PS5 and PS VR2
A new PlayStation Showcase has been scheduled, and it's airing fairly soon. Sony will host its PlayStation Showcase next week on May 24, with some news to share for both the PlayStation 5 and PS VR2.
The stream will go live at 1 p.m. PT / 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday, May 24. You can follow it via the PlayStation Twitch or YouTube channels.
PlayStation's show will run for "a bit over an hour," according to the PlayStation Blog shared today, focused on PlayStation 5 and PS VR2 games. It will have "several new creations" from PlayStation Studios, as well as third-party partners and indie creators.
https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1658834831483060226
What's ahead for PlayStation
While this won't be PlayStation's first stream of 2023, this showcase does have a different air about it. The confirmation of first-party PlayStation Studios news is likely enticing, given that Sony's State of Play streams in 2023 so far have focused more on third-party titles.
It's certainly an opportunity for something like Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which is expected to arrive this year, to resurface. Several other upcoming games from frequent PlayStation partners could be possible, too. I know I'd be interested in some more details on something like Death Stranding 2.
It also runs just a little bit ahead of June, where the summer of gaming news has slowly but surely congregated. Even without an E3 to bind them all together, streams from companies like Xbox and Ubisoft are still taking place, as well as Summer Game Fest and its kickoff stream.
PlayStation's getting a little ahead of that curve with a May 24 show. We'll see what Sony has in store for its first-party production at the PlayStation Showcase on May 24.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A PlayStation Showcase will air next week, ostensibly serving as the publisher’s big summer showcase.
It airs on Wednesday, May 24, at 1 p.m. Pacific/4 p.m. Eastern. A PlayStation Blog post states the event will run a little over an hour and will feature new titles for PS5 and PS VR2. In addition to showcasing first-party PlayStation Studios titles, the event will also highlight third-party and indie games. 
This means it's time to put on our speculation hats. It’s likely we’ll see Insomniac’s Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 at the show given it’s releasing this fall and we’ve yet to see gameplay of it. There’s also the slim chance that Wolverine could make an appearance. Naughty Dog could also provide an update on its The Last of Us multiplayer title. Personally, we’re hoping to see something about that mysterious adventure title from a recent PlayStation ad that has rumored ties to Uncharted. As for third-party, it would be nice to see more of the PS5-exclusive Silent Hill 2 remake. 
So what do you expect/hope to see at Sony’s big event? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

It was in the second official trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (the one that closed out the February 2023 Nintendo Direct) where we first got a snippet of Link driving around on what appeared to be a hand-made vehicle. We couldn't make sense of it. Are these cars dotted around Hyrule? Will someone make them for us? Is this just Zelda: Nuts and Bolts?
Some of these questions were answered in the 10-minute gameplay demonstration, in which Eiji Aonuma showcased a small amount of what the new Ultrahand ability would be capable of. We were amazed at the thought of being able to stick two logs together and whack a fan on the back. Maybe two or three. "It can't get more creative than this", we thought.

In addition to garnering an overwhelmingly positive critical reception, over 10 million copies of the hotly anticipated sequel have already been sold within its first three days of release.
That number makes Tears of the Kingdom the fastest-selling entry in franchise history. A press release states that 4 million of those sales have been in the Americas, which not only makes it the fastest-selling Switch game in this territory but the fastest-selling Nintendo game period. This achievement is even more impressive when you consider that Tears of the Kingdom is also the first $70 Nintendo first-party title, showing fans are willing to shell out the extra dough for a tentpole Switch release.

There have been rumours and subsequent teases for the next mainline entry to the Mortal Kombat franchise for some time now, but it looks like we might finally get some concrete information on the upcoming fighting game this week.
After an intriguing tease from the official Mortal Kombat Twitter account on May 10th, supposed details of the next game made their way onto the internet, suggesting the title will be called 'Mortal Kombat 1' and will be somewhat of a reboot for the franchise. Further details seemingly indicated that a version for the Nintendo Switch would launch alongside PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.

Sega has announced that it might be next in line to move the price-point of its major releases up to $70, following in the footsteps of all other games publishers who have decided making money isn't worth it if you aren't making all the money.
The considerations were noted during a Q&A conference held following the publishing of Sega's latest financial report. Sega Sammy CEO Haruki Satomi and CFO Koichi Fukazawa were asked if the studio planned to follow the lead of publishers such as Electronic Arts, Nintendo, Ubisoft, and Warner Bros. Interactive.
"In the global marketplace, AAA game titles for consoles have been sold at $59.99 for many years, but titles sold at $69.99 have appeared in the last year," noted the duo, in a translation of the meeting…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Overwatch 2 was first announced at Blizzcon 2019, Blizzard promised an ambitious "highly replayable" PvE component that somewhat justified the '2' at the end of the title. Last night, the Overwatch 2 development team announced that they've scrapped most of their ideas including the Hero Missions mode which had skill trees, levelling up, and other light RPG elements shown off in the trailer below. Instead, they'll be gradually releasing co-op story missions and integrating them into their ongoing seasons, similar to how PvE operated in the first Overwatch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's Ghost
Nintendo has announced that it will be delisting Bandai Namco's fun Paccle Royale, (no, it doesn't work, does it?), title Pac-Man 99 this fall. Currently available from the Nintendo eShop as a benefit to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, the game will be unable to download from October 8.
Players who own either paid edition of the game — Pac-Man 99 Deluxe Pack or Pac-Man 99 Mode Unlock — will still be able to access CPU Battle, Time Attack, and Blind Score Attack in an offline capacity. Additionally, all purchased themes and cosmetic items will still be available. All online services for the title are to be suspended, however, which is pretty frustrating given that this is the foundation of the Pac-Man 99 gimmick.
No reason was given for the decision because Nintendo gon' Nintendo, but the title hasn't seen quite the same level of success as its sibling, Tetris 99, which launched back in the fall of 2019. There could also be an expiring license issue, given the pill-popper's torrid legacy with red tape. Or, Nintendo could simply be doing it because why not? It be that way sometimes.
Pac-Man 99 is available now on Nintendo Switch, players wishing to enjoy the offline modes after delisting will need to pick up the Pac-Man 99 Deluxe Pack or Pac-Man 99 Mode Unlock.

If you're over the age of 30, chances are that you probably picked up a Panini sticker album at some point during your childhood. It might have been one of the many, many football albums released on an annual basis, or perhaps something like Star Wars or The Beano. This writer in particular remembers a time when he finally managed to pick up a sticker of Alan Shearer for the 1998 World Cup sticker album; what a rush!
For fans of Super Mario, you can currently pick up an awesome Panini sticker album based on our favourite plumber right now for less than £5 in the UK. Prices vary slightly depending on where exactly you decide to shop, but you're generally looking at around £4.95 for a Starter Pack, which includes the album itself alongside 31 stickers.

Stranger of Paradise was a very different lens into the world of Final Fantasy than we're accustomed to. Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo partnered with Square Enix to reimagine the story of the first Final Fantasy, creating a lovably irreverent protagonist with Jack Garland in the process.
It was, by all accounts, a solid vision of an action-driven, alternative take on Final Fantasy's origins. The team continued to build on it over time, with more downloadable content and jobs, adding some classic pieces of Final Fantasy mythos in the process.
With the recent release of the Steam version, we got a chance to catch up with director Daisuke Inoue and ask some burning lingering questions about Stranger of Paradise, now a little over a year since its launch. We've previously tal…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In California, Sizzle Season is more commonly known as "The State is on Fire" Season
I'm not sure what happened between me and Splatoon, but spare time to play the game seemed to evaporate for me once the series made the move to Nintendo Switch. I still adore everything about this series. I just have a tough time making space in my schedule for it. Hopefully, I can find a way to turn that around with the start of Sizzle Season. This morning, Nintendo dropped a fresh trailer for the game detailing everything players will experience in the new season, including a new gun modeled after the Super Scope.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6mLdx4sVKw
Something tells me that Super Scope will get a lot more play than the actual one. As you saw in the trailer, a fan-style paintbrush is also being added to Splatoon 3 with the Sizzle Season as well as the wonderfully named Barnacle & Dime stage, rendered as one incredibly opulent mall. Kudos to the translators who decided the best way to connect with the kids today is to name the stage after a line of stores that haven't been relevant for 30 years.
In addition to the new stage and weapons, the Sizzle Season will also introduce Jammin' Salmon Junction for Salmon Run, new clothes, new cards, and new challenges like Too Many Trizookas.
That sounds like a pretty solid season if you ask me. While I still need to play through the story of Splatoon 2, I should probably dedicate at least some of my time each week to the multiplayer of Splatoon 3. If only so I don't miss out on some sick-as-hell threads.
Sizzle Season starts in Splatoon 3 on June 1, 2023.

Blizzard is changing its plans for the long-awaited Overwatch 2 PvE mode. In a developer update today, the company confirms that it's scrapping its original plans for the mode, pivoting its PvE side into the seasonal content structure of the game.
Back in 2019, Blizzard Entertainment officially unveiled Overwatch 2, a follow-up to its 2016 hero shooter. Alongside updates to the PvP multiplayer side, there was a PvE mode shown off. Players would choose a hero, squad up, and tackle missions where they could level up talents and maintain some level of long-term progress.
This mode felt like a big reason for the "2" in Overwatch 2, but it eventually fell by the wayside. Overwatch 2 launched last year without its new PvE mode, and the q…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During a developer livestream today, Blizzard revealed its roadmap for the coming months. The roadmap, which was presented by game director Aaron Keller and executive producer Jared Neuss, details what is coming during Season 5, 6, 7, and beyond. In addition to PvP updates, the Overwatch 2 developers also gave us an idea of when to expect the long-awaited PvE experience that was announced alongside the game in 2019.
Season 5, which has the theme of "Mischief and Magic," is currently set to kick off on June 13. This fifth season of the live-service shooter brings events and modes, including a new limited-time event called Questwatch, as well as the return of the Summer Games event. The roadmap also promises a cinematic reveal, a 5v5 mini comp season, the Creator Workshop mode, and the return of the On Fire mechanic that was present in Overwatch.
Season 6, which is set for later this summer, is heralded by Blizzard as the single largest drop of new gameplay released at one time since Overwatch 2 launched in October of last year. Season 6 promises a new support hero, Flashpoint, Hero Mastery, a Firing Range, a player progression system, and the annual Overwatch anniversary event. Perhaps most importantly, Season 6 gives players the PvE content that was announced back in 2019, as Story Missions arrive as part of Season 6. Unfortunately, the Hero Missions PvE mode has been cut from the team's plans.
Finally, we learned what players can expect from Season 7 and beyond, which includes a new tank hero, reworks of longtime heroes Roadhog and Sombra, a new Control map, a new winter event, new Hero Mastery missions in multiplayer, cinematic debuts, the return of fan-favorite modes and Competitive Mastery heroes, a new limited-time collaboration event mode, and a new lore codex.
Overwatch 2 launched on October 4, 2022. While the initial response was positive (read our review here), the approach to supporting the game and the season pass structure has deterred many players from keeping up with the title.]]></summary>

Xbox appears to be sitting pretty in the UK, at least according to new data released by the chart-building analyst Gfk, which notes that the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S platforms have now surpassed two million sales within Blighty's borders.
As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, the two million milestone was achieved in 128 weeks from launch, which makes the Gen9 platform the eighth fastest-selling console in UK history. Surprisingly, (or perhaps not, depending on your perspective), Xbox hit this mark even faster than the Nintendo Switch, which took 140 weeks to shift two million units to British customers.
The cozy black box did not, however, beat the precedent set by Microsoft's own Xbox One, which sold the same amount of units in just 104 weeks. Of course, the Xbox One launch did not have to face the same obstacles presented to the Xbox Series X/S launch, including COVID-19 pandemic and component shortages. For the sake of interest, the console that reached two million UK sales in the quickest time is, of course, Nintendo Wii, which reached the target in a mere 57 weeks during 2006-2007.
The remainder of the Top Five is rounded out with PlayStation hardware.

French internet users made roughly 10 million visits to Uptobox last month and are unlikely to give up easily. Meanwhile, blundering efforts to block other content led to the entire Telegram platform being blocked in France last weekend. French visitors were diverted to a government website where code linked their visit to serious crime.

They're also hugely expensive, normally costing close to $1000, but a deep discount on their Z690 model over at Newegg brings it to $400. That's still pricey, but a reasonable pickup given the feature list for anyone designing a top-end gaming rig around Intel's 12th-gen or 13th-gen Core processors.

Did you come across a preview for the upcoming Resident Evil: Death Island that got you all hyped? Well, we have great news, then. It turns out Capcom has already made many other Resident Evil animated movies in the past...
...And most of them are so beyond bonkers that even fans of the games wouldn't believe it.
Biohazard 4D-Executer (2000)
The first attempt at a Resident Evil animated project is Biohazard 4D-Executer, a name only an exec completely drunk on that sweet '00s juice would pick. You can tell Capcom doesn't care much for it because you can find it on many Youtube channels in its entirety. The CGI 20-minute short feels more like an experiment than a full-blown attempt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Horror Almost Unreal (5)
Bloober Team has revealed the launch date for its long-in-development release, Layers of Fear — The highly technical psychological horror title will launch on PC and Gen9 platforms on June 15, with a time-limited demo available to play on PC from now until May 22.
Built in Unreal 5 for MAXIMUM TERROR, Layers of Fear is a remade compendium of both Layers of Fear (2016) and Layers of Fear 2 (2019), along with all previously released DLC and a brand new concluding chapter, titled The Writer. Developer Anshar Studios is hoping that the incredible technical acumen of Unreal 5 will allow for a truly immersive and unsettling experience, as players pick their way through a shifting environment — trapped, lost, and attacked by no less than the twisted mind of the self.
"We are thrilled to announce the release date for Layers of Fear and to bring this definitive horror experience to players," writes Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno. "With the power of Unreal Engine 5, we’ve been able to create a game that visually surpasses our previous works, delivering an unforgettable journey into the minds of tormented artists. We are excited for both new and returning players to jump in."

Bloober Team also released the PC requirements, which you can check out above.
The demo will give fans an opportunity to check that their rig is up to handling the high visual standards of this new edition, which utilizes 4K resolution, HDR, and Ray-Tracing, while also enhancing its lighting, reflection, and particle techniques with some of the most modern graphics tools available. Dedicated Layers of Fear fans will be able to enjoy new mechanics and twists on the original gameplay, while newcomers can experience the entire story of both titles and their DLC expansions seamlessly branched together.
It's too scary for me, is what I'm basically saying.
Layers of Fear launches June 15 on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they've been chewing over. Today, Jim dives into that opening...

Despite having been counting down the days until The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's release over the past four years or more, nothing could have prepared me for the game's opening. Confident, eerie, cinematic. It does everything that a Zelda opening should do, but in a way that no other game in the series has. Sure, there may be a certain amount of recency bias at play here, but this might just be the series' — if not Nintendo's — best opener of all time and I can't stop thinking about it.

If you have ever played a Pokémon game before (which we assume most of you will have done) then you will have come across a Master Ball. These are generally limited in number and have previously stayed firmly in our bags for the duration of our playtime for fear of "wasting" it, but hopefully, its implementation in Pokémon GO can start to alleviate some of these fears.

There is a fresh story trailer for the game (found above) which itself is a spin-off from Falcom's 'Trials' series. That's right, alongside the localisation of Trails to Azure back in March and the planned release of Trails into Reverie in July, this game will be the third in the series that we get in the course of this year — pretty good going if you ask us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That's 'delayed' to you and I
Skybound Games and developer Mega Cat Studios has announced that the colorful pro-wrestling RPG WrestleQuest will no longer meet its May release window and will now step into the ring sometime this summer.
In a shoot-worked promo posted to Twitter, Mega Cat Studios spoke of its excitement with the title so far, but notes that a recently secured "partnership" has forced the studio to push back the title's launch. This seems to suggest that the delay is a positive one, and will allow the studio to implement whatever benefits the new partnership has allowed for. Mega Cat notes that it expects to announce a new release before May is done and dusted.
https://twitter.com/megacatstudios/status/1658095888227770370?s=20
"While we are disappointed that we couldn’t share the entirety of WrestleQuest with you sooner like we hoped," concludes the studio, "we firmly believe this is the right choice with respect to our players and the sweat, sweat, and more sweat we have poured into building the best game we have ever made. We can’t wait to get your hands on it!"
WrestleQuest, as we have previously reported, combines the wild spectacle of golden age wrestling with the stat-based strategy of turn-based RPGs. Players will guide custom superstars through the territory system of the 1980s, aided or hindered by a roster of over 30 real-world wrestlers including “Macho Man” Randy Savage, Koko B. Ware, Jake “The Snake” Roberts, The Road Warriors, Sgt. Slaughter, and Andre the Giant. Jeff Jarrett is also in the mix, because he can't stay out of fucking anything.
WrestleQuest is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

Nintendo has today announced that a brand new season will be inking its way onto Splatoon 3 next month, as Sizzle Season 2023 kicks off on 1st June.
Much like the recent Fresh Season (and the opening Chill Season before that) there is a whole lot of new content that will be heading to the game with this update, including fresh new weapons, stages, game modes, gear and more. You can get a taste of all that is on its way in the above announcement trailer, or read on to get the summary of what to expect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been meaning to write about Veiled Experts for over a month now, since playing it religiously during the Final Beta Test. I've been putting it off mostly because I've been busy, but also because I'm trying to find a way of saying "actually it's really good" without people laughing and throwing garbage at me. It's very hard to describe Veiled Experts to someone in a way that doesn't prompt an instant dismissal. That was my reaction too. I saw it on Twitch, my mind said "third person Counter-Strike", and sent an automatic signal down to my lips to proclaim the words: "sounds awful".
Thank goodness for boredom. Later that day I was at a loose end and saw that Veiled Experts was free, so I downloaded it and tried it out. And here we are, a month and a bit later. The game is about to release into Early Access, and I'm desperately trying to get everyone I know to play it with me, because it's bloody phenomenal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After playing a bunch of the demos at LudoNarraCon earlier this month, the best one I played, with zero hesitation, was Cryptmaster. Its smart text-based puzzle design fused with stylish dungeon crawling had me completely spellbound, to the point where it's now become one of my most anticipated indie games for 2024. It’s honestly unlike anything I’ve played.
Developed by Paul Hart and Lee Williams, Cryptmaster is a dark fantasy dungeon crawler where you need to type (or speak) commands to help get your undead amnesiac party members out of a strange underground kingdom. Your band of forgetful adventurers aren't completely at the mercy of the dungeon, as a devilish-looking necromancer is there to give a helping hand. An ominous figure who acts as both guide and a quest giver, the horned necromancer helps you navigate the strange rules of this underground world where words and letters are a resource for survival.

On any given month when there's a massive first-party value offer for a service like Xbox Game Pass, you can bet on the rest of the month quaking in fear of the might of the publisher that holds all the power. But in the case of Redfall (particularly when it comes to public perception), this might have been a not-great month to flex.
The offerings for May 2023 (so far) are fairly slim, outside of the fantastic Chicory: A Colorful Tale, which won our overall Game of the Year award in 2021. Maybe Massive Chalice is worth a punt since you're not spending any extra money on it? Or maybe you're deathly curious about how FIFA is coming along this decade. There's a fair bit of hype regarding Cassette Beasts, which came out in April and has had a great reception so far.
Either way, this is what you're getting this month beyond Redfall. Peaks and valleys, folks!

Heading to Xbox Game Pass the week of May 15:
FIFA 23, May 16 (Console and PC)
Eastern Exorcist, May 18 (Console and PC)
Ghostlore, May 18 (Console)
Heading to Xbox Game Pass the week of May 122:
Planet of Lana, May 23 (Console and PC)
Cassette Beasts, May 25 (Console)
Massive Chalice, May 25 (Cloud and Console)

It's no secret that Tales of Symphonia Remastered launched in a, shall we say, less-than-favourable state. With the release retaining many of the annoyances from the original GameCube title (along with adding a few new ones to boot), it sadly wound up being a rather forgettable experience.
Thankfully, Bandai Namco is back with another update, introducing a number of much-needed fixes that should make for a more enjoyable experience for players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What can I say? I love games that have a bit of a sing-song. I've enjoyed the pop platforming of Sayonara Wild Hearts, the DIY DJ-ing in Fuser, the grungy game-meets-album Teenage Blob, and the recently released fist-pumping robot-thrashing Hi-Fi Rush just to name some from the top of my noggin'.
Music is a definitely big part of these games, but Stray Gods: A Roleplaying Musical has set itself on a different kind of musical path, in that it’s actually a musical. I'm talking like a full-on ballad-belter, curtain-caller, exit-stage-left-er musical. And get this: it’s also a modern retelling of the mythos behind the Greek Gods. It feels like my inner theatre kid has chugged ten Red Bulls and is waiting for her cue to burst out.

That means the game won’t receive frequent updates in the future. Sharkmob points to their limited player base, which made sustainable development difficult for the battle royale, although servers will remain online indefinitely, as long as there’s an “active player base and community.”

Ubisoft, undaunted, is continuing to mine its catalog of IPs for new NFT/blockchain ventures, announcing this morning that it intends to release a new line of pretendo pictures based upon its hugely successful time-hopping series Assassin's Creed. This new venture, at the very least, has something of a physical form.
The Assassin's Creed Smart Collectibles line consists of images of characters from the long-running stealth series, replicated as "Digital Souls". The variance in these images will be implemented via the costumes and equipment each Soul will be wearing and carrying. Once purchased, the NFT "owner" will then be able to request a 3D-printed cube of their Soul, featuring a replica of their character. These cubes can then be registered via …]]></summary>

Nintendo has really gone all out with The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. With the new Ultrahand and Fuse mechanics, the world is your oyster. Anything you can possibly think of, you can probably either build with Ultrahand or stick together with Fuse; the possibilities are seemingly limitless.
Indeed, one player has discovered a rather novel way to travel the land of Hyrule, and it's not even remotely difficult to achieve, either. As you'll no doubt already know from Breath of the Wild, you can use your shield as a kind of makeshift snowboard, allowing you to surf down slopes with ease.

Announced last night by developers and publishers 505 Games, the free-to-play Hawken Reborn will launch into early access tomorrow. This time, it's a PvE game, with story missions plus open patrol zones to explore and complete jobs. I was enamoured with the jetdashing scrappy mechs and greeble-covered apartment blocks of the first game but always wished it had a singleplayer or co-op campaign, so I'm certainly curious about this.

Annapurna's sci-fi kitty adventure Stray is seemingly headed to the Xbox platform, at least according to the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB), which has uploaded a listing for a new port the award-winning dystopian tale, currently available on PlayStation and PC platforms.
First spotted by Twitter user MACOS380, (and reported thereafter by VGC), the ESRB rating all but confirms that the interesting and unique release will be headed to Xbox One and Xbox Series X at some point in the near future, bringing the futuristic feline's adventures to a wider audience. Annapurna Interactive is yet to announce an Xbox port of Stray, but the revelation of the rating may mean that one is imminent.
https://twitter.com/MACOS380/status/1658387346520145924?s=20
Released in the summer of 2022, Stray, sees the player guide an inquisitive kitty through a miserable walled city, devastated by an A.I. run amok and abandoned by all human citizens. Utilizing deft movement, adaptation, and ingenuity, the moggy embarks upon a quest to reach the surface of the city, aided by a robot drone, B-12, and threatened by the city's security droids and a mysterious, sentient bacteria known as "Zurk". Stray was praised on release for its world-building, animation, and uniqueness, as well as its ability to tell a deep and complex tale through minimal dialogue.
Stray is available right meow on PlayStation and PC platforms.
An Xbox version of Stray has been rated by the ESRB [VGC]

One of the hottest items off the back of the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, was the game's special edition Pro Controller. These items sold out quicker than you could say "Ultrahand", and we can't say that we were all that surprised. Yes, the single white handle is a slightly rogue design choice, but it's difficult to argue with just how sweet that gold detailing looks.
Getting one of these bad boys has quickly become a pretty big deal, but there have been reports from some customers that the much sought-after controller is experiencing drift right out of the box.

When The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild launched back in 2017, it definitely seemed like a turning point for the franchise; we all felt it, right?
3D Zelda games have generally always felt quite similar to one another in terms of structure ever since Ocarina of Time. Titles like The Wind Waker and Skyward Sword bent and stretched the formula to a certain degree, but there was undoubtedly a sense of familiarity with each entry. Breath of the Wild felt different, largely thanks to its focus on a vast open-world environment, and if Eiji Aonuma is to be believed, it looks like this will be the format for the series going forwards.

Delicious, maybe, like eating a stick of salted butter. However, no animal on earth is capable of producing such an enigmatic sensory blob of flavors.
Meanwhile, my stomach just keeps churning away at whatever I drop in there. It’s such a little trooper.

One fair criticism we can throw at Metal Gear Solid 3 is that most of its bosses went from being characters to just obstacles, but one thing we just can't say is that those obstacles weren't fun to destroy.
MGS3 features some of the most inventive and fun boss battles in the history of gaming, and it's high time that we pay our respects to these deadly and dramatic foes.

There are some buck wild concepts in Square Enix’s game, including fourth wall breaks to manipulate characters' actions and literally muting someone by turning voices off in the options menu, to name just two of the wackier features (and a big plot twist is discussed in this article, so beware if you're planning on playing Paranormasight soon). 


At the outset, though, Paranormasight loks like it is your average visual novel, with the player working away to prevent curses from claiming the lives of Tokyo citizens. Writer and director Takaya Ishiyama explains this was actually the starting point for Paranormasight’s inception. “I first decided what the final goal of the game would be, and from there I began to plot out the broad elements I needed to include, such as the Seven Mysteries,” he explains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What colors are the other fingers?
Kohachi Studio has given us a teaser look at Black Finger Jet, a new run-and-gun title from former prominent Nazca developers. Nazca is the original developer behind Metal Slug, and a number of the attached names were directly involved in the development of some of the early titles in that series.
No real gameplay is shown in the trailer, as the game looks to be very early in development. There’s a page for it live on Steam, but even there, it just shows concept art and says that the game is still subject to change. However, both the teaser and the store page seem to heavily imply that Black Finger Jet will be lifting heavily from the team’s work on the Metal Slug series. It will include 8-directional aiming, and the eponymous Jet vehicle transforms into various configurations.

Among the staff, Akio is covering art, and Meeher is the producer. Sound design is once again in the hands of Hiya! This probably all sounds unhinged, but all of those pseudonyms helped make the original Metal Slug run the games they are. Hopefully, they can pull of similar magic with Black Finger Jet.
Hea-vy Machine Gun
If you’re unfamiliar with Metal Slug, I pity you. Starting in 1996 on the Neo Geo MVS arcade, they set the highwater mark for both pixel art and run-and-gun shooters. Nazca (and the staff listed above) worked on Metal Slug 1-3, before SNK went bust and development moved to another team. That team made a valiant effort to continue the series for three more titles, and they didn’t do a bad job. However, for my money, Metal Slug 1 and X are where it’s at. Others hold Metal Slug 3 in the highest regard. However you shake them; they are legendary.
Black Finger Jet is currently only announced for PC. There is no given release window, but since it seems like they’re still recruiting staff, we might be waiting a while.

The EU Commission's report notes that it does not consider the proposed purchase will damage the market for any particular publisher or platform, and while the commission did suggest that problems might arise regarding cloud gaming, or any potential PC operating systems that are not Microsoft's own Windows, Microsoft offered concessions that would allow all European Economic Area (EEA) customers a 10-year license to play "all current and future Activision Blizzar…]]></summary>

The newest, last week’s Patch 4, sounded particularly enthusiastic about tackling Jedi: Survivor’s technical troubles, so now would be a fine time to check in on the progress of this fixing-upping campaign.


A few droid decapitatin’ benchmark runs later, I can say that Patch 4 (and its predecessors) have made meaningful improvements to ray tracing performance, and that there's a lot less stuttering than there was at launch - even if this hasn’t been smoothed out entirely. General performance, however, remains deeply underwhelming, with powerful GPUs still unable to achieve a bulletproof 60fps even at 1080p.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's another delay but at least it's short
The upcoming horror game Amnesia The Bunker has bee delayed once again. In a social media video Friday, the game's creative lead Fredrik Olsson confirmed that the title will now release on June 6. It's just two weeks, but this comes only days before its initial release time on May 16. Olsson explained the reason why there's an Amnesia The Bunker delay.
Rare crashes plague Amnesia The Bunker
As Amnesia The Bunker has been going through the certification process, Olsson claimed on Twitter that they've found "multiple, rare crashes that are very difficult to identify, reproduce, and thereby also fix." Olsson notes that they could've had the team work during weekends to make the release date, but he said that is not something they choose to do at the studio.
"Everything's coming together so nicely," Olsson said to fans. "We have the gameplay, the art, the animations, the atmosphere, the narrative, everything is coming together, and we are really ready to ship this out to the world."
https://youtu.be/jvUV3Hh6b0g
Amnesia The Bunker's original release window was March 2023. The first delay pushed it to May 16, but with this announcement, the horror title will now creep into fans' homes on June 6. When it does arrive, players will be taken through a haunted bunker from World War 1. You're playing as a soldier that's been cut off from his battalion and has to face this creepy environment alone.
Olsson also confirmed that an Amnesia The Bunker demo will be released on Steam. No official demo release date is out, but the creative lead did say to keep an eye out for the timing.
Hopefully, this Amnesia The Bunker delay will be the last as it approaches its release on June 6. It will be released on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. This may give you enough time to finish the Resident Evil 4 remake (or replay it on another difficulty).

        <updated>2023-05-15T15:27:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a huge game that is particularly skilled at providing you with distractions. I crossed the 90-hour mark recently, and my in-game percentage tracker still shows less than 50% completion. Sometimes, however, you may run into a situation where you're not sure where you want to go. When that happens, I suggest talking to Patricia.
Patricia is not a human character in Tears of the Kingdom. She's a sand seal, and Riju's personal sand seal at that. After cleaning up the main quest in Gerudo, you will find her in the southern corner of Gerudo town.
Patricia loves to eat and will share bits of ambiguous wisdom, translated by her handler Padda, when you give Patricia food. Her favorite food, however, is Splash Fruit.
If you give her some splash fruit, her caretaker will let you know that she has spoken a string of strange numbers.
Those numbers are, of course, coordinates, which you can find on the map or on the bottom of the minimap as you are exploring.
In the example I took screenshots of for this guide, it sent me to a person out in the middle of nowhere who happened to have a sidequest for me. I've done this a few times with Patricia, and she has always pointed me toward something I have not yet discovered.
Running out of things to do in Tears of the Kingdom is something that many players (myself included) won't run into for many hours, but it's nice to know there is an in-game database of distractions built into the game when you run out of activities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ranked Play is coming to Fortnite, and it's coming soon. According to a blog post from last Saturday, the team behind Fortnite will implement the new mode in the 24.40 update, introducing eight main ranks players can progress through. If Epic keeps to their usual schedule, the mode is expected to come this week, but a date has yet to be formally announced.
Once Ranked Play is added to the game, players will be able to toggle it on or off from the main menu. Other than the fact that it's generally more competitive, there aren't any major gameplay differences between Ranked and unranked play, though that's subject to change. In fact, most details about Ranked Play are not concrete, as Epic says this mode is going to be the start of Ranked Season Zero, so they can "make any adjustments to issues and concerns that arise, while also working on additional features and overall improvements for when Ranked starts following the normal Battle Royale Season schedule."
Ranked Play will be available for both Battle Royale and its popular alternative, Zero Build. You'll have separate ranks for each mode. However, since Ranked Play is still in development, only certain party sizes will be available. In Battle Royale, you can play Solos, Duos, and Party (this excludes trios), and in Zero Build, you can only play duos. Ranked Play's Season Zero is set to end when the main season ends (early June), so hopefully, more party options will open up by then.
Ranked Play will also replace Fortnite's existing Arena mode. Other than the Console Champions Cup, the rest of the tournaments this season won't have any Ranked requirements. Eligibility for future tournaments will now rely on your rank and "other factors" Epic has yet to specify.
Will you be playing Ranked Mode once it drops? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of first-person shooters and old-timey cartoons should keep an eye on Mouse. The recently announced game slaps the classic animation of yesteryear over a retro shooter template to create an experience that's old-school in more ways than one. 
Mouse comes from Polish indie developer Fumi Games and is billed as a noir story-driven shooter about murder and deception set in a corrupt city. Players control a private detective wielding vintage firearms like a Tommy Gun, revolver, and Carcano rifle to blast the rather adorable rodent enemies.
The game’s Steam page describes Mouse as a play-your-way type of experience, emphasized by a power-up system in which players can collect special abilities and weapon upgrades that cater to a chosen playstyle. The trailer shows the game is very much a work-in-progress, but it’s already an eye-catcher. 


Mouse is rendered in the classic rubber hose animation style that defined early 20th-century animation, which has found new life in video games such as Cuphead and Bendy and the Ink Machine. The game has no release window but will come to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Mostly, we used to store a lot more personal information when you created an account, like email addresses, passwords, etc. As we now use GitHub to handle all that, we can slim down our privacy policy, as we store very little personal information. For the cookie policy, for years now we only use cookies for the authenticated part of our websites and nothing else. OpenTTD’s privacy policy has always been: we want to know as little personal information about you as possible. And although these changes were rolled out years ago, the policies did not reflect that yet. They do now! In short: we removed statements from the policy about information we track, as we haven’t done that for years now. So, what about this automated opt-in survey you are talking about?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Samsung's 870 Qvo SSD is one of the best options for high-capacity solid state storage, with a simple 2.5-inch form factor that doesn't take up a valuable M.2 or PCIe slot and a fast-enough SATA connection. While performance is good, at up to 550MB/s for reads and a little less for writes, the real benefit here is having up to 8TB of silent, reliable and low latency storage. 
You can currently pick up this RPS-recommended gaming SSD in its ultimate 8TB form for less than £415 from two places in the UK: Tech Next Day, where you can use code TND-10 to get it for £414, and Amazon, where you can get the drive for £412. I've included both options in case you have a preference, and in the event the drive goes out of stock at this reduced price by the time you come to click the links below! 
Tech Next Day - Get the Samsung 870 Qvo 8TB for £414 w/ code TND-10 (RRP £452)


Amazon - Get the Samsung 870 Qvo 8TB for £412 (RRP £452)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's RX 6950 XT has been enjoying a surprising revival as of late, as precipitous price drops have positioned it as a cheaper competitor to Nvidia's new RTX 4070 GPU that offers better performance in rasterised titles - by a significant ~20% margin, too. 


Today, the RX 6950 XT has dropped below the £600 mark for the first time we're aware of, with a chunky triple-fan ASRock model costing just £598 at Overclockers in the UK. That's significantly cheaper than the £999 that these cards originally debuted at, bringing it into contention with newer-gen cards.

You can really imagine Link reaching into a grocery store freezer to grab his favorite obscure ice cream flavor hidden behind all the unsold cartons of strawberry. But what if the new Amiibo was a more accurate reflection of players' time with the game?
Sometimes you are on the side of a mountain and you accidentally shoot a bomb arrow in the wall two feet from your face, fall to your death, and then snap a screenshot right after the moment where the UI disappears, but before the Game Over screen appears. I think the flames licking Link's dead body would look great in translucent red plastic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mech Punk is taking the piss, and I like it. Deliberately opaque games are one thing. Artsy games making a point (that seldom grab me, I shouldn't admit) are another. But Mech Punk is something else altogether, and an incredibly rare game that actually earns the "punk" in its title.
Does that mean it's good? Well, umm. Yes, it's good at what I think it sets out to do. Being an irreverent mess is a valid artistic approach, but still means your game is exactly that. It's not a good game in the traditional sense, though. Do I recommend you buy it? If you can spare £20 to pat an artist on the back, maybe. What kind of artist? Put it this way: on release, its developer changed all their Steam page credits to "Alan Smithee". I don’t think they’re disowning it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tunic developer Andrew Shouldice has made no secret about his love of The Legend Of Zelda over the years. He's not only spoken at length about how playing the original pair of Zelda games on the NES provided ample inspiration for his crafty hack and slasher, but you can also see it right there in the game itself, from your fox hero's bright green outfit to the beautifully illustrated in-game manual you piece together to unravel the world's mysteries. 
But speaking with Shouldice at GDC this year, I wanted to talk to him another other potential source of inspiration. Before he struck out on his own to make Tunic, Shouldice cut his teeth making hidden object games, ranging from globe-trotting mystery adventures to Atlantean-themed detective stories. On paper, this earlier work would appear to provide the perfect proving ground for Tunic, as we all know by now that it holds plenty of secrets of its own. For Shouldice, though, it was more of a reaction against his earlier work that fuelled his approach to Tunic, as he gradually came to realise his hidden object games "weren't tapping into this very specific type of mystery and discovery and player agency and true exploration that I was interested in," he says.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Xbox Series Wireless Controller is one of the best gamepads available for PCs, and the new eco-friendly Remix special edition has dropped to £60 on Amazon compared to a debut price of £75. 
The Remix edition comes in a nifty green colour scheme, is made from recycled materials and is bundled with a free Microsoft  Play & Charge kit, allowing you to replace the battery with a rechargeable Li-Ion alternative - significantly better for the environment than throwing away non-rechargeable batteries, as long as your home's energy comes from somewhat green sources.

The long-awaited sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is finally here, with reviews confirming that it was well worth the hype (you can read our full review here). The entry innovates and expands upon the formula established by Breath of the Wild in myriad ways, giving players the most open-ended Zelda game yet. 
With the launch finally here, we sat down with series producer Eiji Aonuma and director Hidemaro Fujibayashi to talk about the daunting task of following Breath of the Wild, as well as the new game's successes and challenges.

With The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom carrying forward and expanding much of what made Breath of the Wild so special more than six years ago, I decided to scan through the entire Legend of Zelda collection of Amiibo figures across multiple days to see what each figure yields.
It's worth noting that these figures' rewards all come with RNG mechanics, meaning that many of the good drops will require you to scan the figures multiple days before getting the reward you're really after. You'll definitely see that in the results below, as I had to scan some Amiibo figures several times b…]]></summary>

But why spend money on a new game when you have perfectly good versions of the same experience broken up across multiple completely different games right now? That’s right, you can enjoy all of Tears of the Kingdom’s signature mechanics – Ultrahand, Fuse, Ascend, and Recall – without dropping $70 bucks (or its future sale price of $68.75). All you have to do is dig up a few games, kick your imagination into overdrive, and ignore everyone talking about how great Zelda is to enjoy an approximation of the Link’s latest adventure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Tribeca Film Festival has announced its official selection of video games nominated for the Tribeca Games Award. 
This is only the third year that games have been recognized at the annual film festival. The event highlights upcoming titles, which have generally been smaller budget/indie works, that have “potential for excellence in art and storytelling through design, artistic mastery, and highly immersive worlds.” The previous Tribeca Games Award winners are Norco in 2021 and Thirsty Suitors in 2022. 
Here is the 2023 selection, which will be spotlighted with new trailers and developer interviews on the big night:
Chants of Sennaar
Despelote
The Expanse: A Telltale Series
Goodbye Volcano High
A Highland Song
Nightscape
Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical
Additionally, the festival will screen a new documentary called Hideo Kojima - Connecting Worlds. The film delves into the mind and creative process of the man behind Metal Gear and Death Stranding and features appearances from Guillermo del Toro, Norman Reedus, Grimes, Chvrches, and others. 
The Tribeca Film Festival runs from June 7-18, but the Games showcase airs on June 9. The Tribeca Game Awards is just one of the many video game showcases airing in June, and you can keep up with all of them by visiting our handy event schedule.]]></summary>

It's why I love the model of Imperialism, where everywhere is one turn, no shuffling away. It's also why I'm a little surprised how engrossing Foxhole is as a strategy game. As most players (including Brendy) will tell you, it's a game all about shuffling, ie. logistics. But after finally making time for it, I've realised that most of them, even some of the "logi" focused players, don't know what that actually means.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is battling impossible expectations. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild represented a radical and successful reinvention of The Legend of Zelda – a series considered by many to be the apex of game design. Despite its numerous changes to Zelda’s formula, Breath of the Wild was a massive success and its legacy only grows stronger with time.
To give Breath of the Wild a direct sequel (a rarity in Zelda canon) is a dangerous prospect. The resulting game lacks the admittedly difficult-to-recreate, undeniable impact and newness …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Discovery casually name-dropped Mortal Kombat 12 earlier in the year, when an earnings call revealed the fighter was “set to release this year, with ambitious launch projections.” The relaxed announcement wasn’t followed by any flashy marketing (outside of a few funny Ed Boon tweets) until now. Developer Netherrealm have been dropping small teasers that potentially point toward a series reboot, or a timeline cleanse, or a return to the series' past. Hey, the next instalment might not even be named MK12. Watch last night’s very brief teaser below:

I’ve had a blast beating up supernatural weirdos with a group of misfit college teens. Together with its soundtrack of absolute bangers that combines dramatic church choir chorus with pulsing synth wave beats (please put the OST on Spotify, Ysbryd), and a slick art style that makes me dribble like a brain-hungry zombie every time I see it, I’m thinking that Demonschool might very well be on its way to being be one of my favourite games of 2023 when it releases sometime this year. What can I say? I love punching freaky demons in the face.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We know Mortal Kombat 12 is apparently coming sometime this year, and Ed Boon is stoking the fires of excitement by seemingly teasing an impending announcement.
In a Warner Bros. Discovery earnings call in February, CEO David Zaslav told investors that Mortal Kombat 12 was planned for release this year. Initially, Boon didn’t confirm or deny the news, but today he tweeted out a short video of a clock hand dramatically ticking towards 12 that then, interestingly, skips over it to strike 1. Boon's tweet asks, “Does anyone know what time it is?”
Does anyone know what time it is? #MortalKombatpic.twitter.com/pXY2wlidde
May 10, 2023
It might be the 12th mainline fighting game, but the teaser could be hinting at a reboot of sorts. Regardless, it appears an announcement could be imminent, which seems especially likely following the big delay of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Summer Game Fest is less than a month away, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see the hotly anticipated sequel pop up there.
Mortal Kombat 11 was released in 2019, with its Aftermath expansion arriving the following year. Developer Netherrealm also released Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile RPG, last fall. Although Netherrealm has released an Injustice game in between Mortal Kombat releases since 2013, it appears to be bucking that trend by jumping straight to the 12th entry.

Her return triggers a flood of childhood memories, which players relieve in flashbacks as a child version of Mimi. Gameplay involves exploring the cottage, taking pictures, and collecting keepsakes while witnessing the bond between Mimi and her grandmother and learning how these nostalgic experiences connect to the present. Check out the game's new trailer below, as the game looks even prettier in motion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Forge Of The Chaos Dwarfs expansion is hot out of the oven, but Creative Assembly have already detailed what’s next for Total War: Warhammer 3. A fresh roadmap shares what’s coming in the next twelve months, which includes three paid expansions: Shadows Of Change (Summer 2023), Thrones Of Decay (Winter 2023), and To Be Revealed (which I’m hoping is the official title, coming Spring 2024). Each expansion will be accompanied by a free update that brings Legendary Heroes for everyone, as well as interim patches in between content drops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Plague Tale: Requiem is a gorgeous game, but if you’d rather experience Amicia and Hugo de Rune’s dark journey at a higher framerate, a new update adds a few tweaks, including a performance mode for consoles.
The patch goes live today and introduces different improvements depending on the platform. Requiem on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S gets a performance mode that lets players run the game at 60 FPS in exchange for a lower resolution. 
Meanwhile, the PC version is getting enhanced graphics options that allow players to further optimize presentational performance. Lastly, all versions of the game, including the Switch cloud port, will receive bug fixes via this patch.
We enjoyed A Plague Tale: Requiem, with editor Wesley LeBlanc scoring the game an 8 out of 10 in his review, which you can read here. Will you be trying out these new graphics options? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

The last we heard, Silksong was due out in the first half of 2023 but last night, Team Cherry delayed the game without offering up a new window. 
Hey gang, just a quick update about Silksong.
May 10, 2023
As you can see, it's clear Silksong won't be released in the first half of 2023 as originally planned, but there's no word or indication of what the game's new release date is. 
Team Cherry put out its first game, Hollow Knight, in 2017 and it was extremely well received. While the game received several free DLCs, the studio was also working on a larger expansion of paid DLC starring Hornet from the game. In 2019, the team announced this DLC had expanded massively in scope, to the point it'd now be a full sequel game called Hollow Knight: Silksong. Since then, fans of the first Hollow Knight have wondered when they'd be able to play Silksong.
While waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Hollow Knight review and then read about why Silksong is one of our most anticipated upcoming games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Private Division has announced a new publishing partnership with Pokémon developer Game Freak. It will publish a new action-adventure game from Game Freak meant to be a new IP for the developer. 
Codenamed "Project Bloom," Game Freak and Private Division state in a press release the new IP is expected to launch during Private Division parent company Take-Two's Fiscal Year 2026. Alongside this news, Game Freak has released the first piece of concept art for Project Bloom. You can check it out below: 

"We're thrilled to have the opportunity to create new IP that is bold and tonally different from our prior work," Game Freak director Kota Furushima writes in the release. "From the beginning, Private Division was the publisher we wanted to work with on our new game. Their track record and global expertise gives us all the confidence to create a sweeping new action-adventure game that we can't wait to share more about in the future." 
Take-Two Interactive chief strategy officer and Private Division head Micahel Worosz says you'd be hard-pressed to find a studio with more iconic hits over the past 30 years than Game Freak, addding, "We're ready to help Game Freak unleash their potential and we're honored to be the first Western publisher to work alongside this exceptionally talented and proven team to bring a bold new IP to market." 
Game Freak was founded in 1989 and is best known for developing the majority of mainline Pokémon entries across various Nintendo consoles. Its most recent Pokémon release was last year's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It has, however, released non-Pokémon games throughout its history, including this year's Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! on iOS and macOS devices. 
Private Division was founded in 2017 as a third publishing label within Take-Two Interactive. Notable titles published by Private Division include Hades, The Outer Worlds, Kerbal Space Program 2, Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World, and more.

The series, which consists of 2017's Horizon Zero Dawn and its Frozen Wilds expansion, 2022's Horizon Forbidden West and this year's Burning Shores expansion for it, and the recently released PSVR2 exclusive title, Horizon Call of the Mountain, has quickly become one of PlayStation's best selling. In a new PlayStation Blog post detailing Guerrilla's history, PlayStation reveals the Horizon franchise has surpassed 32.7 million units sold worldwide. 


It also reveals that Horizon Forbidden West has sold more than 8.4 million units as well. 
"Millions more around the world have discovered Horizon thanks to PlayStation's subscription services and initiatives, including PlayStation Plus and Play at Home," Guerrilla studio director and art and animation director Jan-Bart van Beek writes in the blog post. "All told, it's a milestone we never imagined possible twenty years ago when we first started making games.
"The reception has been staggering, and we're grateful to the community for the continued love and support for the franchise."
The blog post ends with van Beek teasing that the studio "cant wait for you to find out where [Aloy] will go next." 
For more about the series, read Game Informer's Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West reviews. Then read what we thought of Horizon Call of the Mountain and the recent Burning Shores expansion.

(Oh, wait a minute.) Although, the spacefaring adventure has at least one tool that would be handy in everyday situations: the translator. One Redditor has thankfully recreated a functional version of the translator and this clip shows the delightfully faithful tool.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a harrowing few years in our real world, and I often feel like I'm just trying to keep my own little flame of hope safe from the howling winds of indifference and despair. So Darkest Dungeon 2, a party-based dark fantasy roguelite centered on the idea of doing just that, ended up being a bit too familiar and also a bit therapeutic. Having well over a hundred hours in the first game, I was also pleasantly surprised by some of the ways this carriage-bound journey into existential dread changes up the formula… and not so much by a couple of others.
Just like its predecessor, Darkest Dungeon 2 leads with vibes and attitude. Every bit of art and atmosphere is subtly (or not-so-subtly) menacing, worn down, and melancholic, with Wayne June's unmistakeable narration laying out the compelling story of a quest for answers that went too far. The background on how the world got this way is doled out in tiny morsels of tragic exposition after the conclusion of each run, so I always had new details to look forward to whether I won or lost. It's very clear that reality is, as they would say in the Bay Area, "hella broken," and that it's somehow your fault as the nameless financier of these soul-rending expeditions into the darkness. But the nature of your crimes takes a long time to reveal itself.

These mixed Doom with old-school dungeon-crawler design, letting you shoot monsters at a considerably slower pace. Over a decade after their initial releases, developer GEC.inc unofficially ported Doom RPG onto PCs and now the team is back with a port for the sequel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has announced a new action-platforming game called Mr. Run and Jump, which promises to be a speedrunner's delight. With lush neon graphics and reflex-based platforming stages, the game promises fast-paced and frenetic action for fans of the high-speed, tight-controlling entries of the genre.
As Mr. Run and Jump, you explore the Realms of Color on a quest to defeat Void and find the hero's missing dog, Leap. The title was originally created as a homebrew title for Atari 2600 in 2021, but a modernized version is now being released by developers Graphite Lab and Heavy Horse Games through official means. If this sounds up your alley, you can check out the announcement trailer below.


Mr. Run and Jump offers dozens of unique levels across six different worlds, as well as several enemies with distinct attack patterns and personalities. According to Atari, the title will offer more than 30 hours of gameplay when you take into account time trials, collectibles, and achievements.
Mr. Run and Jump arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Atari VCS later this year. For more on one of Atari's most recent successes, check out our review of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration.]]></summary>

The plundered database also included encrypted and salted passwords and partial credit card numbers, according to the statement. Western Digital are contacting affected users directly, and have temporarily shut down their store.

Redfall is my biggest disappointment of 2023. As a massive fan of developer Arkane Studios’ previous work, from Dishonored through Deathloop, my expectations were high for the company’s new release. However, this vampire-hunting first-person shooter is messy, plagued with technical flaws and head-scratching design decisions counterintuitive to the game itself. The result is an often-bland experience, made frustrating by occasional glimpses of potential, and it’s sucked the life out of me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s funny how some aspects of game design are so ubiquitous that we stop questioning them, or even noticing them. After decades spent playing video games, I know that if I look behind the waterfall, there’s likely to be some sort of shiny goodie to collect. If I head left rather than right at the start of a level, I’m bound to find a juicy secret. There are conventions. Traditions. I can’t remember a time when games didn’t have giant lifts - and yet, I’m not entirely sure why they’re there. I’m not talking about the regular kind of lifts that you pile into, usually at the end of a level, to transition from one part of the game to another; those ones have historically been used to hide lengthy loading times, like the interminably long lifts of Mass Effect. 


What I mean is the lifts that are essentially tennis-court-sized moving platforms, usually with little more than a flimsy guard rail around the edge to stop elevator enjoyers from plunging down the shaft. Even more specifically, I’m talking about the diagonally moving elevators that trundle slowly into the depths, often to some nefarious laboratory. There’s a good example in the Resident Evil 2 remake, where you fight the final boss on an inclined elevator as it slowly, ever so slowly, descends towards the train that will grant your escape. So where did these giant elevators come from? And why do developers keep putting them in their games? I set out to answer both questions, and went somewhere unexpected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of waiting, fans will finally get their first look at Payday 3's gamplay, according to a new teaser trailer.
This teaser is the latest following a similarly brief trailer released in January. Today’s video succinctly states that the first look at gameplay will arrive this summer. Odds are it will debut during Summer Game Fest or another adjacent event, but we’ll have to await confirmation to know for sure.


Payday 3 has been in the works for a long time, having been officially announced in 2017. It hasn’t had the smoothest development cycle due to developer Starbreeze Studio flirting with closure at one point, among other factors. So far, we know that the co-op heist shooter is coming this year for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. It stars the original gang from the previous games and unfolds in New York.

Darkest Dungeon II is cruel. A simple miscalculation or bad luck can ruin your two-to-three-hour expedition before the chapter’s final boss. There are no checkpoints; if your party dies, it’s time to start fresh from the very beginning. Only some unlocked upgrades stay with you. When you have to make tough choices all the time while keeping in mind various systems, this can (and will) be frustrating and nerve-racking. At the same time, Darkest Dungeon II is the most cathartic and rewarding experience since the original in 2016.
Much like its predecessor, you create a party of four distinct heroe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month Rachel made us aware of a life sim called Grave Seasons, a kind of mash up of perennial favourite Stardew Valley and, er, the half-season serial killer arc of a police procedural TV show. Naturally this turned my head, like Tarantino walking past a ladies shoe store, and I emailed the developers Perfect Garbage to find out a bit more. They describe the game as "fun, campy and spooky" and hint at yet more secrets to be revealed. Appropriate for a game where, every time you start a new run, one of the townsfolk starts killing everyone else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hacking software and hardware, to achieve functionality that was never intended, can be fun and rewarding. When motivation is directly linked to restrictions perceived as unnecessary or unfair, that can lead to moral justification. That's understandable in some cases, but when a company like Nintendo counters by targeting a tool like Lockpick, that's not surprising; it's inevitable.

I'm telling you now, instead. Helpfully there's already a launch trailer and Red Hook have shared some details of their post-release plans.

It now has an expansion. The Spider Of Lanka offers three more murders to solve and acts as a prequel to the main game.

Our review deemed it a success for its ability to make untapping and cycling graspable for newcomers and for its adoption of HearthStone-style attack animations. 

Previously it's only been available as a download from its own website, but now Wizards say it'll come to Steam on May 23rd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Replay returns, and we're checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts! Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

It was a wide-ranging interview, looking at what Solomon plans to do next now that he's left Firaxis, and how he feels about his 20+ year career there. You can read the condensed version of that interview here, but as a treat for RPS supporters, I thought you might like to read our chat in full. There's still a lot I couldn't quite squeeze into separate news stories here, and I think (and hope) you'll find it interesting to read as a whole. So here it is. All 8760-odd words of it. Enjoy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beleaguered vampire huntin' FPS Redfall has at least one seal of approval, even if our reviewer Ed was left cold. Shortly before release, Valve bestowed it with Verified status for the Steam Deck, a coveted green tick that represents more or less complete compatibility and suitability for the portable PC. 
I wouldn’t normally curl an eyebrow at this sort of thing – having more great Steam Deck games is good for PC gaming – but given how all-over-the-shop Redfall’s performance is on desktop PCs, could it really settle in on the less powerful Deck? A few ambulatory vamp slaying jaunts later, I can conclude that it... maaaaaybe can. Sort of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redfall, an open world FPS by the folks over at Arkane, plays like a game that was pulled in so many directions over its development that it exploded into various bits, which were then patchworked together into a live service game that already feels like it's been abandoned. Flashes of Arkane's brilliance make an appearance, but they are a rare find amidst a bland, incoherent world that clearly points to deeper issues in a game that's been drained of its magic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don’t Nod, makers of Life is Strange and Tell Me Why, has announced that its next title, Harmony: The Fall of Reverie, is coming this June and will get a playable demo this month. 
Steam and Switch players can pick up the game on June 8, whereas PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S owners have to wait until June 22. Harmony: The Fall of Reverie is a choice-driven adventure starring Polly, a woman who returns home to find her missing mother. It's here Polly discovers she has clairvoyant abilities connecting her to a strange dimension called Reverie. While visiting this world, Polly becomes Harmony and encounters six powerful god-like beings called Aspirations, which serve as the hearts of humanity such as Glory, Power, Chaos, Bliss, and Truth. 


Polly must restore the balance between Reverie and our world and decide which Aspiration ultimately inspires humanity by making decisions represented by a system called the Augural. This web presents a multitude of scenes players will jump between that reveal possible futures that, in turn, unlock additional story branches. Polly does this by collecting crystals given to her with each choice and character bond she makes, which are used to unlock nodes on the Augural that alter the course of the story. 
Harmony: The Fall of Reverie sports a vibrantly illustrated art direction and a soundtrack by award-winning composer Lena Raine. You can try it out early thanks to a limited-time Steam demo launching today that will be available until May 21.

“There’s nothing that’s more difficult for me than disappointing the Xbox community,” says Spencer when asked about his reaction to the game's poor reception. “...just to kind of watch the community lose confidence, be disappointed, I’m disappointed, I’m upset with myself…”
Spencer continues by touching on the criticism of Redfall launching at 30 frames per second and how it goes against Microsoft’s original claim of first-party Xbox Series X/S titles always running at 60 FPS. “That was kind of our punch in the chin, rightfully, a couple of weeks ago,” he says …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redfall is not a good game. I don’t think you need me to pour salt on that wound if you’ve spent significant time with it. But its failure is a disappointing situation for several reasons. Developer Arkane is one of my favorite studios, so it sucks to see it fumble the ball. My admiration for the team made me genuinely excited for Redfall, which I still think is a cool premise on paper, making it a tough pill to swallow in practice. But the most upsetting element is seeing a studio fall short after trying something new and getting criticized for even attempting it.  
There are many valid reasons to drive a stake through Redfall’s heart, but the most worrying sentiment I’ve seen is Arkane should have never made it and given us Dishonored 3 or Prey 2 instead. That’s an understandable wish; I…]]></summary>

The game is set in an alien world teeming with strange creatures and dangerous robots, which Lana and Mui overcome by working together to solve platforming puzzles or sneaking unseen in stealth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has announced that a standalone version of Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered will hit PlayStation 5 later this month. 
Previously, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered was only available by purchasing the Ultimate Edition of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Later this month, anyone will be able to play Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered. Players will be able to purchase it standalone or, if you own Marvel's Spider-Man on PlayStation 4 (or its Digital Deluxe Edition or Game of the Year Edition), then you can pay $10 to upgrade to Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered on PS5. 
This remaster is perhaps most famous for introducing a redesigned face for Peter Parker, but it also includes The City That Never Sleeps expansion starring Black Cat as well as some exclusive Spidey suits, such as those from Spider-Man: No Way Home. 
Owners of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales can still obtain Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered by upgrading to the Ultimate Edition through the main menu of the PS5 version of the game. If you're looking to buy the remastered game standalone, it will cost you $49.99. 
PlayStation says this standalone version and upgrade path is coming later this month, but it doesn't say exactly when.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Billy and Jimmy Lee are making a comeback in Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons. This new co-op brawler is coming this summer and will revitalize the dormant series in a new tag-team-focused adventure.
Set in New York City after it’s been destroyed by nuclear war, Billy and Jimmy must take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. They won’t be doing it alone, though. The game features 13 playable characters, including Marian, the brothers’ old love interest, who now packs a pistol to blast threats from afar, and newcomer Uncle Matin, a tank-like fighter with a riot shield. 


According to a press release, Double Dragon Gaiden boasts “seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive and offensive moves.” Solo players can swap characters on the fly to switch between their individual skills, such as the offense-focused Jimmy and more defensive Billy. The game supports two-player local co-op at launch (online co-op is coming in a post-launch update). 
Double Dragon Gaiden tasks players with toppling four gang leaders and features a unique dynamic mission select system. Missions can be tackled in any order, and this selection affects their length, difficulty, and the number of enemies that appear. Earning cash unlocks powerful special movies that instantly knock out enemies, and you can also obtain crowd control moves that can wipe out multiple foes. Other gameplay options include an adjustable difficulty, permadeath and infinite modes, and unlockable bonuses. 
Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons is being developed by Secret Base and published by Modus Games. It's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Firaxis Games has revealed the release date for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of its 2022 strategy card game, Marvel's Midnight Suns, alongside news that the planned Switch version has now been canceled. 
Midnight Suns hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 2, 2022, with plans for the PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions to launch at a later date. Today, Firaxis announced that the PS4 and Xbox One versions will launch next week on May 11, which is the same day the game's fourth and final DLC – Blood Storm, which introduces Storm as a playable hero – releases. 
As for why the Switch version has been canceled, Firaxis doesn't provide anything more than, "Note that a Nintendo Switch version of Marvel's Midnight Suns is no longer planned." This follows news from earlier this year that the game's director (and the director of Firaxis' modern XCOM games), Jake Solomon, is departing from the studio. 
PS4 and Xbox One players that purchase the Legendary Edition of Midnight Suns or the game's Season Pass will get the new Blood Storm DLC as well as all previously released DLC, which alongside Storm adds Deadpool, Morbius, and Venom to the game.
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Marvel's Midnight Suns review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Citizen Sleeper was one of our favorite experiences of 2022, and as it approaches its first anniversary on May 5, the team behind it reveals it's begun work on its next project.
Gareth Damian Martin, the solo developer behind Jump Over the Age, is again joining forces with indie publisher Fellow Traveler, character artist Guillaume Singelin, and composer Amos Roddy on a new game. There’s no information about what this next title entails, but the team promises to reveal more in the “near future.” The coming days serve as a celebration for Citizen Sleeper, with the game receiving a 33 percent discount on PC and Switch starting May 4. 
Citizen Sleeper is a sci-fi choice-driven adventure where players guide a robot possessing a human consciousness through life on a space station, fighting for survival while also helping the lives of its inhabitants. In our review, we scored the game a 9 out of 10, with editor Wesley LeBlanc writing that "Its hopeful and inspiring message is backed by a branching, heartfelt narrative, and a great gameplay loop, making it tough to put down. Add in its enriching visual style and my favorite musical score of 2022 so far, and Citizen Sleeper is a game I'll be thinking about for years to come." Citizen Sleeper also earned a spot on our Top 10 Games of 2022. 
Citizen Sleeper is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Electronic Arts acquired developer Metalhead Studio a year after the launch of Super Mega Baseball 3, meaning that the developer had the benefit of creating this fourth entry with the added resources of its new parent company.
The result appears evident. For the first time in series history, more than 200 legends of the sport (including cover star David Ortiz) are included in the roster alongside the fan-favorite cast of players from the earlier games in the series. You can take the new roster and enjoy the various modes in a variety of ways, including a league of baseball …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We got our first sneak peek at the upcoming Gran Turismo movie back in January, and now the film's first full-length trailer provides a better look at PlayStation's latest cinematic adaptation. 
Unlike other many video game movies, Gran Turismo is actually based on real events. The film tells the true story of Jann Mardenborough, a British professional race car driver who began his career by winning GT Academy, a European televised contest that pitted the best Gran Turismo players against each other for a chance to earn an actual racing career with Nissan. The film follows the teenage Mardenborough's ascension from, as the poster below puts it, gamer to racer and all the trials that come with it. 















	



  
    

  
      
            


      
  













Mardenorough is portrayed by Archie Madekwe and the film also stars David Harbour, Orlando Bloom, and Djimon Hounsou. Neil Blomkamp sits in the director’s chair. 
Gran Turismo premieres exclusively in theaters on August 11.]]></summary>
