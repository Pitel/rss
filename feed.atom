If you love the classic first-person shooter icon Duke Nukem and also happen to be a fan of the Karate Kid revival Cobra Kai, you might want to read on...
According to an exclusive from The Hollywood Reporter, Legendary Entertainment (Dune, Godzilla) has acquired the Duke Nukem rights from Gearbox - signing on Cobra Kai creators Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, and Hayden Schlossberg as producers. Legendary will also produce - with Marla Studios' (a studio focused on video game adaptations) Jean Julien Baronet (Assassin's Creed) involved.

He earned millions of dollars and traveled the world, but also spent time in prison. Despite being wanted by the FBI for his alleged involvement with Nintendo hacking group Team Xecuter, Louarn doesn't view himself as a criminal, but as a rebel instead.

A bit like DOOM, id Software's first-person shooter Quake has been ported officially (and unofficially) to just about every platform under the sun that's capable of running 3D natively. Did you know though there was also a version in development for Nintendo's 32-bit handheld the Game Boy Advance?
In 2002, Randy Linden - a veteran programmer known for the "impossible" SNES port of DOOM and the creator of the BLEEM emulator - was working on a Quake prototype for GBA. The video game archivists at Forest of Illusion have now been supplied with a working ROM of Linden's prototype:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Game Fest is in full swing, and we're covering the best games the showcase has to offer, including Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course. Join Game Informer as we chat with Maja Moldenhauer, studio director at Studio MDHR, about the exciting DLC, the new bosses players will be facing, and what the developers are planning on for the future.


Alex Stadnik is here to ask the burning questions fans might have. The two start things off by discussing what the team brought to Summer Game Fest and chat about the ins and outs of the Mortimer Freeze boss fight. They then discuss what players can expect from the five major fights found in The Delicious Last Course and how the stages change the experience from the main game.
They then move to Ms. Chalice, the new character that isn't a carbon copy of the title's namesake or Mugman. One of the main additions of the DLC streamlines the experience with a new moveset and abilities but is far from an easy mode. Players will have to sacrifice some of the buffs they were used to in the main game in order to use her as she's activated as a charm.
The two also discuss how Studio MDHR developed the game through COVID, how the soundtrack is yet again a highlight, and whether or not players can expect new secrets when they boot up the DLC on June 30. Finally, Stadnik and Maja round out the interview and briefly discuss what's next for the studio.
If you enjoyed this look at Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course, be sure to check out our recent preview impressions, our talk about the DLC on this week's GI Show, and our fresh episode of New Gameplay Today showing off the Mortimer Freeze boss fight! Thanks, as always, for watching!]]></summary>

Capcom's reveal of Street Fighter 6 at the conclusion of this year's Pro Tour set the table for the next entry in perhaps the most beloved fighting franchise of all time. Following meager offerings at launch, Street Fighter V, which launched in 2016, rebounded to give fans a ton of features, fighters, and content by the end of its lifecycle. Street Fighter 6 hopes to avoid those initial stumbles by including various modes of play from the get go, but my hands-on time during Summer Game Fest 2022's Play Days in Los Angeles, California was all about seeing how matches play out.

There, members of the media and content creators from around the globe have congregated for two days of interviews, live demos, and hands-on play sessions. 
While the Play Days aren't nearly on the scale of something like E3, which would typically happen during this time of year annually, the Game Informer crew has seen plenty of amazing games over the course of our time there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Grammys are singing their praises
Even to those who don't regularly play video games, their music is iconic, and in many cases instantly recognizable. There are a ton of different factors that can make a game stand out as one of the greats, and a great soundtrack alone is enough to make a title stick in our heads for years to come. The Grammys are the most prestigious awards in music, and now they're finally giving video game music the credit that it's due.
The Recording Academy actually added five new categories that will be honored at the awards ceremony next year, including "Songwriter of the Year," "Best Spoken Word Poetry Album," "Alternative Music Performance," "Americana Music Performance," and of course, "Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Interactive Media."
[caption id="attachment_329238" align="alignnone" width="1280"] [Image Source: Nintendo Life][/caption]While this will be the first time that video game music will be honored in its own category, this is not the first time that score from a game has won a Grammy.
Most recently, The 8-Bit Band took home "Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Capella" for their cover of Kirby Super Star's "Meta Knight's Revenge" earlier this year. Civilization IV composer Christopher Tin won the "Best Instrumental Arrangement with a Vocalist" award for the track "Baba Yetu" in 2010. Journey composer Austin Wintory was nominated for the "Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media" award, but unfortunately didn't take home the win.
Hopefully now that games have an entire category of their own, the incredible work that game composers do will be recognized on a larger scale. Game composers have a whole new set of challenges to face when writing for interactive media, which, in my eyes at least, is really what makes it stand out from other types of scores.
Video games will always have awards for music within the industry, but taking home a Grammy award just hits different, I imagine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[They're really doing it
Video game adaptations continue to be all the rage, and now Duke Nukem gets to join in. The movie rights to Duke Nukem have been acquired by Legendary Entertainment.
The Hollywood Reporter reports that Legendary has quite an interesting crew on board to produce the Duke Nukem project, too. Cobra Kai creators Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, and Hayden Schlossberg are reportedly on board.
Alongside Legendary Entertainment, Marla Studios will also be on to produce. Marla Studios was founded by Assassin's Creed (the movie) producer Jean-Julien Baronnet and specializes in video game adaptations. THR reports the search for a writer is underway, and there's no director attached just yet either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZahQltQK5xQ
There was a Duke Nukem film project in the works not too long ago, over at Paramount. The project even had wrestling superstar John Cena attached to it, but the film reportedly stalled out.
The Duke is back?
By all accounts, this is some wild news. Duke Nukem may have been a heavy-hitter of the arena shooter era, but the series has stalled out. The infamously catastrophic Duke Nukem Forever seemed like it had forever shut the lid on new Duke Nukem games.
But not all video game heroes of the '90s have faded into obscurity. Lara Croft had her revival in both video game and movie form, and Serious Sam has kept trucking along. 2016's Doom was a brilliant revitalization, but it also made Doomguy a household name again.
Does Duke Nukem still have that appeal? Either way, Legendary Entertainment is picking the right team. The Cobra Kai is pretty dang good, and I'd imagine those showrunners could do something interesting with Duke. To be honest, after re-visiting the old Cena news, I'm now picturing a Peacemaker-style take on Duke Nukem and thinking it could somehow work.

It's almost time for beat-em-up sequel River City Saga: Three Kingdoms on the Nintendo Switch! Unless you're in Japan, that is, because the game is already out over there. But for us in the West, the Nintendo Switch release date is July 21st, 2022 — and it's looking rather lovely.
The game is based on the Three Kingdoms of 3rd century China, and appears to be split between three playable factions. You might recognise the Three Kingdoms from games like Dynasty Warriors, or even the recently-announced Reigns: Three Kingdoms.

To this day, I don't think I ever ended up finishing Maneater, but I'd still recommend it to anyone wanting a silly arcadey action diversion with RPG progression to keep you going. It's been out for two years, and if you never got around to it, today's your day to grab Maneater for free from the Epic Games Store. The PC copy is up for grabs until June 16.
The game lets you conquer your oceanic fears — instead of a helpless human, you play the power-hungry shark who's out for (well-justified!) revenge. Of course, you'll start off as a weakling in the shallows before bulking up enough to face your fisherman rival as the apex predator. The game has a satirical story for those who need some rising stakes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Play it on iOS or Android with a Netflix account
They did it! They finally got me to play a Netflix-backed video game. That's the allure of something new from Ojiro Fumoto, the creator of Downwell. The designer's last game was about strategically plummeting, and this new one, Poinpy, is about going up, up, up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDA33JqHIjE
If this is your first time, here's how it works: you can download Poinpy as a standalone app on Android or iOS, but to play it, you'll need a Netflix subscription (or someone's login). After launching the game, it'll ask you to sign into Netflix — and even choose your individual profile if you're sharing your sub — before playing. In other words, it's a self-contained experience and you don't even need the main Netflix app on your mobile device.
As the trailer shows, the idea is to flick your character upwards with a bit of a time crunch to keep the pressure on. You'll try to avoid accidentally colliding with foes while collecting certain combinations of fruit and climbing ever higher until your run comes crashing down and you go again. Much like Downwell, this quick-on-your-feet game is about being in the right place at the right time to keep your momentum flowing seamlessly without snags.
It's super vibrant, and while they look pretty different aesthetically speaking, Poinpy and Downwell feel like they belong on the same family tree. It's tricky! I'm not great at it.
Fumoto partnered with Netflix Games and Devolver Digital, and maybe if we're lucky we'll see Poinpy eventually land on other platforms. For now, though, this really feels like a game that was designed for touch controls. I'm sure it could work elsewhere just fine — and that'd be cool — but if you've got a Netflix account handy, give it a shot.
Heh, "Poinpy." Cute lil name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arc System Works takes us on a subterranean journey
Some games getting shown off this June are still a ways off, but a few do arrive with a surprisingly soon release date. Today, Arc System Works unveiled one of those with Ground Divers, an intriguing puzzle action game that's hitting Switch on June 30.
This new game was shown during today's IGN Expo, highlighting a bunch of different upcoming projects. Ground Divers is a bit more in the classic arcade vein, but with some cool modern updates.
The game sees you piloting a little mining robot named Tsuruhashi, as you plunge the depths for valuable rare minerals. As you plunge deeper, both rocks and enemies will stand in your way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J19CpadX-Zk
What appeals to me about Ground Divers is how it's adding some new ideas to the standard dig-action game. The Pit Relay system looks like you can set up little bases as you dive deeper, and even get little robot pals to help you out.
Dive to the mantle
It's kind of a weird genre to describe, but digging-based puzzle action games are usually a good time. From classics like Dig Dug and Mr. Driller to the excellent SteamWorld Dig series, it's consistently engaging to dive deeper and deeper in search of surprises.
It seems like Ground Divers is taking its own approach to the concept by adding some cool ideas like the relays and cheering on Tsuruhashi. Plus, the whole trailer has a charm to it. I dig (ha) the Saturday morning anime vibes here.
Ground Divers lands on Nintendo Switch on June 30, 2022.

Nacon is joining the long list of publishers dropping dates for its own summer live stream presentation. Nacon Connect 2022, which is scheduled to take place on July 7, will feature a slew of reveals, updates, and trailers pertaining to the company's catalog of upcoming games, accessories, and development projects.
"This year, NACON Connect is reinventing itself in its format and will feature even more content for gamers," said the company in a press release. "Two pre-show and post-show sessions will be added and hosted by renowned influencers. The conference will be the occasion to announce several major projects, reveal new trailers and exclusive gameplay, and introduce new accessories that will delight all gamers."
While Nacon is expected to reveal the show's itinerary at a later date, we can snugly assume that we'll be seeing updates on the cyber revolution RPG Steelrising, Daedalic's action-adventure title The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, and Teyon's previously teased RoboCop: Rogue City. Nacon promises new trailers, exclusive gameplay footage, and the debut of several new accessories from the company's hardware division.
Nacon Connect 2022 will go live on July 7 at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET / 18:00 BST and can be watched on the official Nacon YouTube and Twitch channels. I may not be a "renowned influencer", but I'll also do my best to bring you any pertinent news from the stream right here on Destructoid.

Immediately after the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 special edition went on sale, the entire Nintendo storefront crashed. Folks were greeted with some combination of a 404 page or a "queue," that took an indeterminate amount of time to load and didn't have a progress bar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a sweet symphony
Netflix has confirmed a new Castlevania animated series is on the way, and it's centered around a new Belmont. Castlevania: Nocturne is officially in production for Netflix, featuring Richter Belmont.
The new trailer from Netflix's Geeked Week stream doesn't show too much, other than a good look at Richter himself. Still, he's here, in full Belmont garb and whip in tow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONqNEPTPyqU
Richter is a descendant of Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belnades, so that should make for an interesting continuation of the show. And longtime Castlevania fans are probably already very excited about Nocturne tackling Richter, considering his source material. Video game Richter means both Rondo of Blood and Symphony of the Night could be fodder for adaptation.
The series will be led by showrunner Kevin Kolde and creator/writer Clive Bradley, and produced by Project 51 Productions with production services from Powerhouse Animation.
Rondo round the world
Considering the Castlevania Netflix series has traditionally been a looser adaptation of the source material, I wouldn't expect Castlevania: Nocturne to be a full-on retelling of Rondo of Blood or Symphony of the Night. That said, Richter alone provides a lot of fodder for potential story beats between those two games. Plus, having Richter here means we could see the return of Alucard. Who doesn't want that?
We got a tease of this last year, but it's excellent to see the Castlevania adaptations are carrying on. While the streaming service has had some standouts in the adaptation department, Castelvania remains one of my favorites. The storming-the-castle finale of Season 2 is forever seared in my brain. I'm more than ready for some adventures with Richter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has released a teaser trailer for new episodes of The Cuphead Show coming to the subscription service soon. 
This news comes from Day 5 of Netflix's 2022 Geeked Week, which also highlighted various Netflix games and TV shows based on existing video game properties. Netflix originally announced The Cuphead Show way back in 2019, and it finally hit Netflix earlier this year. Shortly after – three weeks later, to be exact – Netflix revealed that it was renewing The Cuphead Show for a second season. Today's teaser doesn't seem to be about that second season but rather additional episodes of Season One. Check it out for yourself below: 


Here's what Netflix has to say about these new episodes: 
While waiting for these new episodes, check out this brand new gameplay from the upcoming Cuphead DLC, The Delicious Last Course and then read our preview thoughts on it afterward.

Not only can you "pet the dog" in this post-apocalyptic open-world JRPG from Kadokawa Games, he's actually an active part of the squad! Some might even say Pochi is the MVP. Together, you'll face ferocious oddball threats like dinosaur battleships, massive sand sharks, and missile-armed rhinos. This isn't your average JRPG tank adventure, that's for sure.

2004's sequel to the original Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance — which saw a remastered release on Switch and other platforms back in May 2021 — is getting the same treatment; Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance 2 is pencilled in for a "Summer 2022" release on Switch and other platforms.
Developer Black Isle Studios teased earlier this year that it was coming "sooner than you think". For Nintendo-exclusive gamers who never had an Xbox or PS2, this will be the first opportunity to play the action-RPG sequel as it skipped Nintendo platforms originally — a disappointment to GameCube owners who enjoyed the original Dark Alliance.

Netflix's Sonic Prime is coming sometime in the future, and after learning a bit about its voice cast a few weeks back and Shadow being revealed during the Sonic anniversary stream the other day, we thought we'd seen the last of the animated show for now. The streaming titan had other plans, of course, with the debut of a brand new clip, which confirmed one of my favorite friends of the speedy hedgehog.

In the embedded tweet above, you can watch the 30-second trailer where none other than Big the Cat from Sonic Adventure and his best friend Froggy are introduced. Sonic spins the iconic (yes, I said iconic) duo as he dashes through the Mobius environment...and then they go their separate ways so Sonic can save some of their friends. It was yet another all-too-quick look at the series that's starting to shape up more in my eyes as the supporting cast is revealed. When will we see Charmy Bee and the rest of the Chaotix? Where will Nack the Weasel make his appearance? My hope is they'll show up eventually.
Sonic Prime is still in the "coming soon" camp of releases at Netflix but will be exclusively available on that platform when it releases.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix's Castlevania series concluded after four successful seasons, but it isn't the last we'll see of Dracula. Today, during the Netflix Geeked livestream, we got our first look at a successor series called Castlevania: Nocturne. Set hundreds of years after the original series, Richter Belmont takes up the whip and will continue the fight of his ancestors. Richter is the protagonist of the 1993 video game, Castlevania Rondo of Blood (also known as Dracula X). He is also of the same bloodline as the Sypha and Trevor from Netflix's first series.
Nocturne is executive produced by Kevin Kolde, with Sam Deats in the director's chair with assistant director Adam Deats. In the show, Richter will be searching for vampires in 1792 in the midst of the French Revolution. He won't be alone in his journey: Maria Renard is also along for this dark ride.
Are you a fan of Netflix's Castlevania work? If so, what do you hope to see from this sequel series and a Belmont rising?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming to the Epic Games Store on PC
Did you know there's an Epic Games Store showcase going on right now? Me neither! More Lord of the Rings-licensed games are on the way beyond that vague EA mobile project and the Gollum title; as The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria was just announced today.
The trailer opens up at the Doors of Durin, before showcasing a group of dwarves (players) quite literally heading back into Moria. Social elements (group drinking), survival moments (evading orcs that are still skulking about the halls), crafting, and building seem to be in play. Development is handled by Free Range Games, who has worked as an external developer on several titles, and handled primary development for Spelldrifter.
Here's a quick description that sums up the vibe:
"To survive the treacherous mines of Moria players must conserve resources, hunt and gather for food and manage their sleep, temperature and noise levels. Utilize dynamic light systems for safety and to blaze a path further into the darkness. Battle unspeakable evils and survive hordes of monstrous Orcs in visceral combat, while uncovering the secret of the Shadow that looms within the mountain."

Eight-player co-op is on the table, which is likely one of the bigger selling points of Return to Moria for the studio. A spring 2023 window for the Epic Games Store is teased. The copyright is with Middle-earth Enterprises (not the Tolkien Estate), so like other similar projects, they'll be limited in what they can cover from The Legendarium (as is customary for the vast majority of Tolkien-related media). But given that the core book series pretty much gives them free rein on Moria, they should be good there.

In the turn-based strategy title, you explore dreams and memories, and it was referred to by Geoff Keighley on Netflix's Geeked Week stream as "a mix between Into the Breach, Hades, Inception, and dodgeball." That's not your everyday video game description.
The art style will look memorable to anyone who has played the developer's previous games and its debut trailer feels very atmospheric, which you can watch above.  The main character discusses their vivid dreams and memories and people she's been struggling to return to, alluding to words left unsaid that stand in her way. Sounds like it's also going to be a poignant ride. 
The game will be available exclusively for Netflix members, with no ads, extra fees, or in-app purchases.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Dragon Age is coming to Netflix
Today, Netflix and BioWare announced a new collaboration to bring Dragon Age to the streaming platform. Dragon Age: Absolution is a new series set in the world of Thedas, arriving this December on Netflix.
Shown off during today's Netflix Geeked stream, Dragon Age: Absolution is a six-episode series. It'll follow a set of new characters from the world of Dragon Age. That includes elves, Qunari, mages, knights, and some other surprises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1PSiPSs_k
Dragon Age: Absolution is set in Tevinter, which has some interesting implications. Plus, with the next Dragon Age game also heading Tevinter, the Netflix series could potentially set up storylines. Or it might just be a good entry point for newcomers. Either way, Tevinter is definitely an interesting place to go; it's a region full of magic, mystery, and intrigue.
The Dread Wolf nears
As for the Dragon Age series in the gaming realm, BioWare recently announced the title for its next entry. Dragon Age: Dreadwolf will be the next mainline game, with the player heading to Tevinter and dealing with a lingering threat in Solas.
The latest Dragon Age has been in development for a while, and BioWare has confirmed it won't launch in 2022. Basically, it's going to be a while before we get a new virtual adventure in Thedas. In the meantime, this streaming series will be something for fans to dig into and pick apart, at the least.
Dragon Age: Absolution is another step of Netflix diving deeper into the world of video game adaptations, too. A new Cyberpunk anime was already announced, and its live-action Resident Evil adaptation arrives soon. Today's stream also had news about Netflix's Tekken series, The Cuphead Show, and the next book of Dota: Dragon's Blood. And now, the streaming service will break into the fantasy world of Thedas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Snowman has captivated players with handcrafted indie gems, such as The Alto Series, Where Cards Fall, and Skate City. Today, on Netflix's Geeked Week stream, it revealed a new game called Lucky Luna for iOS and Android, which will appear later this summer on Netflix's streaming service. The game is free for all Netflix subscribers. 
Lucky Luna features entirely pixel art and is a vertically scrolling, platformer dungeon crawler. The big catch? You have no jump button to get around. Players swipe left and right to guide Luna through trap-filled dungeons with hidden secrets and alternate paths.
Every level presents a different environment and new mechanics that allow players to explore in a new way. In the story mode, your main goal is to collect as many pearls as possible to advance to the next stage.  You'll also find new clues and light story elements to learn more about Luna's past and discover her purpose.
Lucky Luna will also support an endless mode with procedurally generated runs for every environment. This is where you can make a name for yourself on the leaderboards. Your score is based on your speed, collected peals, and the number of floors you've descended. Gather enough treasure from your runs and you unlock additional endless dungeons to keep the run going. 
Lucky Luna debuts later this summer.]]></summary>

Last year, a open world RPG zoo simulator called Super Zoo Story went a little bit viral for being accused of copying Stardew Valley a little too much in their art style. After Stardew creator ConcernedApe took to his Discord to address the issue, the developers posted an apology to their Twitter, saying that they would "redesign any and all assets" that were too close for comfort.
And it seems like they've been doing that, as a year later, they've returned with a new trailer, showing off some of those redesigns, as you can see in the trailer above and the tweet below.

The trailer aired during today's IGN Expo livestream and it features quite a unique spin on The Walking Dead franchise that we haven't seen before. It looks like a game – its art style is reminiscent of Telltale's series but a little less comic book-ey – but it doesn't appear to actually be a game. Instead, it's a multiplayer interactive event that will somehow task players (viewers?) with determining the events that happen, such as the outcome of the characters shown in the trailer. 
Check out the trailer for yourself below: 


Here's more about it from Skybound Games: 
"From Skybound Games comes The Walking Dead: Last Mile which is part game, part interactive live experience as it relies on the audience to determine its outcome. It's a massively interactive live event that is a Facebook Gaming and Facebook Watch exclusive series." 
Last Mile begins exclusively on Facebook Gaming and Facebook Watch on July 11.]]></summary>

We here at Nintendo Life are always hungry because, while not many are aware, writing about Nintendo everyday works up a massive appetite. So it’s only natural that when the new Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer revealed another food-themed Pokémon, we couldn’t help but wonder how it would taste.

All The New Pokémon In Pokémon Scarlet & Violet

Scarlet and Violet aren’t the only games with edible Pokémon in them, however. Of the approximately 37 billion Pokémon now discovered, we uncovered 11 food-themed Pokémon and their evolutionary lines – excluding fish, most plants, and Pokémon that otherwise have no food motif (hey, we love us some jamón but we're not throwing Lechonk in here just yet) – and ranked them by how much we’d want to eat them. No, we haven’t had lunch yet. Why do you ask?

The Fallout 76 Dread Island storyline has been extended, as part 2 of the new radio play drama is out: you can listen to it now!
The meta narrative follows the brother and sister team of Anna and Emilio, alongside of their very Lost in Space-esque robot companion H-4RT, as they explore and survive Dread Island.  Bethesda is saying that the "final two chapters" will arrive next week. In a really cool turn, you can listen to these radio plays in-game via your Pip-Boy (on the Pirate Radio station).
In other Fallout 76 news, Season 9 and the Test Your Metal update is set to arrive on June 14, which will inject a ton of new content into the game beyond the typical season pass refresh. The team reminds folks that extra public events will be available (Ruse Eagle Arena, Moonshine Jamboree, and Eviction notice), as well as quality of life upgrades like spotting downed enemies with a more obvious yellow highlight.
This weekend is also hosting a "Gold Rush" event: "Throughout this weekend, you can visit the Gold Press Machines at The Crater and Foundation to exchange your Treasury Notes for up to double the usual daily amount of Gold Bullion."

This week, we finally saw the Summer Game Fest kick off with a packed - albeit slightly overlong - opening showcase. The show was full of surprises, though we do think it's a shame that some of the announcements were leaked beforehand (poor Naughty Dog).
In terms of the Switch, there wasn't a great deal to get excited about, with most games earmarked for the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. That doesn't mean there was nothing, though - the highlights include a fresh look at TMNT: Shredder's Revenge, the official announcement of Flashback 2, and a new look at Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course DLC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Studio Iggymob and publisher Prime Matter have released a new trailer for Gungrave G.O.R.E. and it features plenty of gore, as the name would imply. It also reveals that the game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC sometime this fall. 
That’s exciting news for fans of games with lots of bullets, blood, and more because it’s right around the corner. Gungrave G.O.R.E. was first announced back in 2021 with a flashy (and again, very gory) gameplay trailer. If you’re excited, be sure to watch today’s new trailer: 


Gungrave G.O.R.E. is about the anti-hero Grave doing what he does best: mowing down undead targets using his twin pistols and weaponized coffin. Back in 2021, Prime Matter revealed that former Platinum Games and Tango Gameworks designer Ikumi Nakamura was lending her artistic talents to the game as a character designer. You can tell, too, because these characters look great!
Gungrave G.O.R.E. is slated for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC and it will be released sometime this fall.

During yesterday's Summer Game Fest stream, Street Fighter fans received confirmation that America's Hero, Flaptop Fanatic, and all-round Family Man Col. Guile would be returning to the ring for the series' latest installment, Street Fighter 6. The trailer gave us one of our first real in-depth looks at the sequel's combat, while demonstrating the power of the RE engine in its ability to afford the military hero his first-ever set of eyebrows.
Indeed, for the first time in the mainline timeline since his franchise debut, Guile is rocking a sweet pair of eye caterpillars, proving that it was well worth me buying that PS5 console after all. In addition, he has also grown out a sweet goatee, which seems to be Capcom's go-to method of saying "This Character is Older". Much like hi…]]></summary>

Four years ago, The Elder Scrolls VI was announced, with little more than a title and a bit of concept art. It's not a huge surprise that there's an Elder Scrolls sequel in the works at Bethesda — Skyrim is one of the most ubiquitous games out there, and it's even rumoured to be coming to Switch for a second time — but we have heard very little about it since its reveal in 2018.
Apparently, Bethesda's space game Starfield is the in-house priority, so executive producer Todd Howard has warned fans that they should be "very patient", especially since Starfield is looking to nab a 2023 release. But just days ahead of the Xbox/Bethesda showcase, Todd Howard said that Starfield is getting the "finishing touches", so it's not wholly unlikely that we'll get a glimpse of ESVI.

This news comes after months of controversy at Activision Blizzard surrounding its handling of Raven layoffs and the subsequent union efforts within the Call of Duty support studio. Here’s what Kotick wrote in the press release, in full: 
In December of last year, Activision Blizzard laid off several members of Raven’s quality assurance team. Shoftly after, dozens of Raven employees went on strike. Activision Blizzard did eventually break its silence on this strike, but it did not formally recognize it. Following that, 34 QA testers agreed to form a union.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since Diablo Immortal launched amid a storm of controversy last week, people have been trying to work out how much it really costs to play this theoretically free game. I'll be honest that maths has never been my strongest suit, but figuring out how games work under-the-hood is one of my favourite things to do. So I've spent most of this week chasing answers, and I've come up with a ballpark estimate of what it would cost to max out your character. The answer is: £46,000, or $51,000, to fully equip your character with the best gear as quickly as possible using premium currencies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Star, Dream Land 3, and Dream Course
Nintendo just added three new Kirby SP games to the Switch Online service: building upon the existing original versions that already existed on Switch. As a reminder, "SP" versions are modified editions of Switch Online NES or SNES games that essentially have a "cheat/unlock" save out of the box. That's really it.
Breaking this down, here's what the Switch Online Kirby SP games do:
Kirby Super Star SP: You get Revenge of Meta Knight mode access immediately
Kirby's Dream Land 3 SP: An easier difficulty/extras are available
Kirby's Dream Course SP: Extras unlocked, including more multiplayer stages (this is probably the most useful of the three)
SP versions started off as a cute little flight of fancy bonus, but at this point people are asking for an option to hide them entirely from the interface: which has become more unwieldy and bloated as more games have been added. Initially "SP" seemed like something special, like maybe an official ROM hack or a different edition of a classic game: but they turned out to just be, by and large, save-doctored retreads.
Another issue is that Nintendo potentially sees these as "updates," which slows down future games from becoming part of the service sooner. It's tough to tell what the actual cadence of games is for the Switch Online service by any metric, as "slow" generally sums it up: from the launch of the NES service all the way to the current era of Nintendo 64 and Genesis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One time in the office (so, a hundred years ago) a hypothetical was posed: if you were given the chance to go to the moon, with a guarantee that nothing would go wrong, would you take it? "No," I said. "No way. Not a chance. I wouldn't like it." People were shocked at my refusal. "But nothing will go wrong!" they exclaimed. This misses the universal truth that even - and indeed, especially - when it is guaranteed nothing will go wrong, something will always go wrong in space.
Honestly, who can say that they've played a video game set on a space station and not encountered at least one deserted corridor plunged into darkness, but with one spotlight tipped over onto its side to cast ominous shadows? Raise your hands. Terror in space has never gone out of fashion, really, but the source of the terror does seem to go in cycles. In the 2010s a lot of the danger came from an AI gone a bit sinister and funny. As we saw at last night's Summer Game Fest, though, the monsters are back, baby.

One of Sony's heavy-hitters this year may still be on target. A new report indicates God of War Ragnarok is on track for a November launch, with a release date reveal expected later this month.
Bloomberg reports via three sources familiar with the project that God of War Ragnarok is planned for November. This comes after an earlier report that the new God of War had slipped to 2023.
Jason Schreier of Bloomberg cast doubt on the 2023 news yesterday. His new report seems to affirm that Ragnarok will arrive this year. No dates are set in stone with development, but the report indicates that as of this week, it's still on track for November. Bloomberg's report does note that Ragnarok has slipped internally. Earlier this year, it was reportedly set to arrive in September, but was recently bumped to November.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE-4GvjKcfs
This is some reassuring news for fans who might have been concerned after God of War Ragnarok was absent from both the Sony State of Play and yesterday's Summer Game Fest. The follow-up to 2018's God of War has been a hotly anticipated game since it was first teased.
Fimbulwinter in November
While some ratings board movement indicated Ragnarok may still be set for this year, today's report adds some more certainty. As of this writing, Sony has not officially announced a date for God of War Ragnarok, outside a 2022 window.
It's been a leaky couple of days for Sony, as The Last of Us Remake news slipped out ahead of schedule yesterday. The rekindling of the original Last of Us was set to be the closer for Summer Game Fest.
The June State of Play held last week focused mainly on third-party titles, so it's no surprise people are curious about what Sony's first-party lineup looks like right now. Hopefully as the summer of games news rolls on, we'll get a firmer idea of what's in store for PlayStation.

Typically, Nintendo has been updating the My Nintendo physical reward storefront (paid for by way of platinum points currency) with every first-party release. Switch Sports got a towel, and now Mario Strikers: Battle League has a drawstring bag.
The bag is 600 platinum points, clocks in at 15"x18", and is double-sided (the front showcases the main logo, while the back has more roster members suited up in various poses). You can find the listing for it here.
Nintendo also has another little bonus: Mario Strikers party favors. By redeeming 30 platinum here, you can print seven pages of stuff yourself, including "eight invitations, four cupcake holders, six pennant flags, and six party toppers."
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lost in the Wild West.
Metal Max Xeno: Reborn has finally reached us in the West. The RPG series has never been a huge hit outside of Japan, and this latest entry changed up the formula by making it a more open-world adventure.
Developer Kadokawa Games has been working on a direct sequel called Metal Max: Wild West, first announced in 2019 (as Metal Max Xeno Reborn 2). The game was due to release on Nintendo Switch in Japan this year. However, the developer has been quiet on the game since May 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[June 16 at 6PM ET
So remember when Geoff Keighly said that he thinks publishers have learned that they should probably have "30 minutes plus" conferences, or less micro-conferences in general? Well Square Enix has a 10 minute Final Fantasy VII stream planned for June 16 at 6PM ET.
For reference, here's the quote:
“There were a lot of shows last year where everyone was disappointed when they weren’t really press conferences, right? Like Take-Two, Capcom, Square Enix and things like that…I think [they] have learned that if you’re going to do a press conference, you kind of need to have 30 minutes-plus of stuff, and sometimes they only have one or two great games to show, which may not be enough to do a full event around. So I think that’s going to be a bit of a shift. I have a pretty good sense of what’s coming in the next month, and I think people will be hyped about games in general.”

Welp!
The stream kicks off below at 6PM ET on June 16, with the following caveat from Tetsuya Nomura: "At only around 10 minutes long, it will be short and sweet, but we have packed in lots of information, so I hope everyone can look forward to the unveiling." Add it to the pile! Less obvious candidates include a tease for Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 or some new media project; more obvious candidates are mobile developments for VII-related projects.
If Square Enix doesn't show anything related to Part 2  in this Final Fantasy VII stream, they're just setting themselves up for disappointment. Can you imagine the reaction if it was just a stream for First Soldier and Ever Crisis?

Editor's note: This review, originally published on Saturday 14th May 2022, was based on the imported Japanese version of the game. However, you can find updated comments relating specifically to the English language release at the bottom of the page.

Metal Max fans in the West are not what you’d call spoiled for choice, especially in regards to English-language releases. It would be more accurate to say that series fans are “Metal Max-starved.” In the span of the series’ 31-year existence, only two games have been released in English —2006’s Metal Saga (thusly named due to trademark issues at the time) and 2018’s Metal Max Xeno. For English-speaking fans, it’s Metal Max Xeno that’s relevant here, as Metal Max Xeno: Reborn is, as the title suggests, a reimagining of that game.

Trust Devolver Digital to give us a very unique showcase. The publisher hosted its annual Digital Showcase yesterday, which gave us a few fun announcements — including James Turner's adorable-looking new game.
But what people remember from Devolver Digital is its ridiculous tongue-in-cheek presentations which do everything from having a jab at the games industry to creating amusing anecdotes. This year's presentation was called 'Devolver Digital Marketing Countdown to Marketing' and was hosted by mecha Suda51 (of No More Heroes fame). And yeah, it's not the real one.

Approximately 60 million Pokémon games were shipped in the last financial year, according to the latest data found via the official Pokémon Company website.
As discovered by Serebii (thanks, VGC), The Pokémon Company has now sold over 440 million units of Pokémon related software. Previously, the website gave figures up to end of March 2021, quoting over 380 million units sold. The implication here, of course, is that at least 60 million units were sold over the course of FY2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix has announced a broadcast happening next week for Final Fantasy VII’s 25th-anniversary celebration. 
More specifically, the “celebration broadcast” will air on June 16 at 3 p.m. PT/6 p.m. ET on the official Square Enix YouTube and Twitch channels. As for what to expect, the answer is simple: Final Fantasy VII. This could be a stream specifically about the original release, which hit store shelves 25 years ago. But, as any Final Fantasy fan knows (and if you’re like me, hopes), we might hear about Final Fantasy VII Remake, or rather, its sequel. 
Join us next week for around 10 minutes to celebrate 25 years of @FinalFantasy VII: https://t.co/y074ldZMhg
#FFVII25th. Please be excited. pic.twitter.com/DskOd2CxQj
June 10, 2022
Here’s what Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura says about the stream: 
Perhaps I’m reading too much into this but let’s put some pieces together: Nomura directed Final Fantasy VII Remake. This is a stream celebrating Final Fantasy VII. Players want to hear about the sequel to Final Fantasy VII Remake. Nomura specifically says “unveiling.” What could Nomura unveil? I’m betting the sequel to Final Fantasy VII Remake. Of course, the company could just reveal some new Final Fantasy VII merch or even more about the upcoming Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis, a mobile take on the beloved game, so it’s best to keep your expectations in check. Only time will tell for now, though. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer’s Final Fantasy VII Remake review, and then check out this story about Nomura promising “even more new FFVII projects” in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who's Bad?
The mysterious legacy of the Sonic 3 soundtrack has reared its head once again, as Sega has revealed that upcoming retro compilation Sonic Origins will not feature the original score from the 1994 release. Instead, Sonic 3 & Knuckles will feature an "adapted" soundtrack, faithfully recreated by composer Jun Senoue.
Sonic fans had been awaiting news on the Sonic Origins soundtrack situation, well aware that Sonic 3 score is mired in misty red tape due to the alleged input of one Michael Jackson, who supposedly composed some of the game's tracks despite not actually being credited in-game. Since its release, both members of Michael Jackson's team and Sega executives have delivered mixed messages as to whether "The King of Pop" did indeed work on the best-selling Sega Mega Drive title, with no real confirmation either way.
https://twitter.com/TailsChannel/status/1535011473218494487?s=20&t=PZcbCmTmIdkgAhJn58Zwnw
In a special Sonic Origins live stream held yesterday, social media manager Katie Chrzanowski clarified that the Sonic Origins edition of Sonic 3 & Knuckles will feature a recomposed version of the original score, with Senoue even utilizing original Sega Mega Drive technology and his original collection of Digital Audio Tape (DAT) to truly capture that classic 16-bit feel.
While the fact that Sonic 3 is not being 100% replicated in its entirety will be a disappointment to the fanbase, Senoue is one of the best in the biz, with no doubt that the tweaked score will be equally as compelling as the one that Jackson did... I mean did not... write.
Sonic Origins launches June 23 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to Shit City (literally that's the name of the city)
After a busy day of Summer Game Festing, I'm pretty much spent, but leave it to Devolver Digital (and Suda) to supercharge my brain for a bit with another chaotic showcase. On one extreme, we saw the adorable 2D-meets-3D storybook adventure The Plucky Squire — and on the other, there was Anger Foot, a face-kicking action game for sickos.
The first gameplay glimpse from developer Free Lives (Broforce, GORN, Terra Nil) looks unhinged. I'm talking "Academy Award winner Russell Crowe in Unhinged" unhinged.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R1XJv-pylk
It's one of the most no-bullshit, take-it-or-leave-it showings I've seen in a while, and I also appreciate the synopsis, which reinforces this game's unrelenting mood.
"Unleash the world's deadliest feet on a colorful cast of anthropomorphic enemies," as Devolver Digital and Free Lives put it. "Clearing out slums, sewers, and skyscrapers as you grab new weapons, unlock new sneakers, and upgrade your powers in absurd and wonderful ways. Kick and shoot your way to the exit as you leave behind a smoldering trail of shattered doors, broken bones, and crumpled energy drinks."
I can already tell Anger Foot will be the kind of game where there's an ideal "wow, that went smooth!" way to play, and getting the flow down just right will surely take practice. In the meantime, I'm sure it'll be funny to fumble your way through these setups, too. If you've ever wondered how Hotline Miami would (or could) translate its frantic room-clearing carnage to 3D, well, this is probably the closest we're getting for now.
General mood aside, you don't need to take the reveal trailer's word for it — there's a demo right now on Steam. Anger Foot is planning a 2023 release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a whole vibe
Sometimes, you just have to skate. And sometimes, you make a deal with the devil and you really, really do just have to skate. Skate Story is a game about the latter, coming sometime in 2023.
Shown off during today's Devolver Digital summer showcase, Skate Story is about a deal with the devil. You, as a demon made of glass and pain, have to skate to the moon and swallow it to earn your freedom. Simple enough, right?
Seeing it in motion, though, is something else. It's reminding me of Thumper, but with chiller music and sick kickflips. I've probably watched the trailer below at least a half-dozen times already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6j0zKSXAFE
The camera angle is absolutely wonderful too. Its shown in a way that reminds me of old skate videos. As you course through the underworld, you'll also get new decks, wheels, and trucks, as well as a host of tricks to really add some style to your cruising.
Skating through it all
Skateboarding games are always interesting to me, but even over the last couple years, skating has been reimagined in some fascinating ways. The Ramp put a minimalist spin on just the raw action. And OlliOlli World takes a level-based approach with a story and goals that really added a lot to the experience.
That's what excites me about Skate Story in this trailer. It's a whole different vibe, and one I'm really gelling with the more I see it. Developer Sam Eng has posted some great technical looks at the tricks in play, and they are just a joy to watch.
https://twitter.com/skatestorygame/status/1486147388255395840
Suffice to say, I'm looking forward to nailing some sick tricks in the surreal dream world of Skate Story when it arrives in 2023. It's up on Steam now, if you'd like to add it to your wishlist.

This summer, it's finally time to start the cutest lil' cult you ever did see. Cult of the Lamb will launch on August 11 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.
The news was part of today's Devolver Digital summer showcase. In between skits about Mecha-Suda51 and the convergence of all video games, Massive Monster's adorable roguelike-meets-management game finally locked in a release date. We also got a new animated trailer here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI6D2iYCTcU
A demo for Cult of the Lamb is live on Steam today too, ahead of its August launch date. That way you can try out taking over the woods before you buy all the way in.
Building up a new following
Cult of the Lamb follows a little lamb, who narrowly avoids being destroyed only to become beholden to a dark spirit. Paying back your debt means assisting this spirit in taking over the woodlands and destroying the other prophets.
Along the way, you can recruit a following of other happy creatures to do your bidding. That means harvesting crops, building new structures, and gradually constructing a quaint home base you can visit between escapades.

It's a cool town-building twist on the usual action-roguelike formula. I got to demo a build at PAX East earlier this year, and was really own over both by its style and its compelling management.
As the summer showcases start to ramp up, it's nice to see a cool project get locked in for a release date, and so soon at that. Looks like I'll be building up my own following in just a few months.
Cult of the Lamb arrives on August 11 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.

I'm always on the lookout for creative new titles that are doing things in games that we haven't seen quite yet, and The Plucky Squire looks to be exactly that. We got a glimpse at the game during today's Devolver Digital Showcase, and the trailer showcased adorable 2D gameplay that took place in a storybook, before shifting to 3D gameplay, and back to 2D again. The gameplay itself looks like a combination of side-scrolling and hack-and-slash gameplay, with some puzzles and fighting game sections?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGwAtbQIC_8
I honestly love the fact that I can't pin down exactly what this experience will be like, because that likely means it will keep us on our toes the whole way through. It's colorful, it's playful, and looks like a breath of fresh air in this year's sea of dark, violent sci-fi shooters. The Plucky Squire is in development by All Possible Futures, and of course will be published by Devolver Digital. No release date yet, but the game is available to wishlist on Steam right now, and it will be coming out on PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Nintendo Switch sometime in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during Devolver Digital's Summer Game Fest live stream, a new trailer for Skate Story was revealed. And honestly, you just need to see it. It looks so cool. Check it out: 


For the uninitiated, Skate Story has been floating around for a while. Since 2020, developer Sam Eng has been slowly revealing the game on their own personal Twitter and the official Skate Story account. For the most part, these have been small gameplay videos. But today's trailer finally gives us a peek at the game's story – or at least its general premise. That being, per the trailer, "You are a demon made of glass and pain and yet you must skate." What more could you need? More than that, we got extended looks at gameplay, including the unique art style. The camera angle and shake also look about as close to a real skate video as any video game's gotten thus far.
I don't mean to gush over a game I haven't played yet, but I can't wait to get my hands on Skate Story. Luckily, it's expected to come out on PC next year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I rarely feel as conflicted about a game as I do about Honkai: Star Rail. It's a turn-based RPG and I like those; but it's a JRPG and I dislike those. It's got a spacefaring train in it, which I always think is cute; but also it's got anime waifus in it and those make me cringe. Its new trailer, which you'll find below, is dynamic and exciting and well-edited; but... it's got cringy anime waifus in it.

Watch it and make up your own mind.

Today marks the Summer Game Fest kick-off, and both the Live showcase and ensuing Day of the Devs have come to a close. In the latter, there were a bunch of really rad games, from both well-known developers and exciting newcomers.
While the Summer Game Fest Live showcase tends to focus on bigger games, the Day of the Devs: Summer Game Fest Edition showcase centered on smaller projects and teams. It's a tradition that Double Fine has organized for a decade at this point, and it's always nice to see what neat projects make their way into the showcase.
This year had some absolute winners, too. Bear and Breakfast continues to look like a chill, fun management sim and it's arriving very soon. So is Escape Academy, a school life-meets-puzzle room adventure. …]]></summary>

Slotting in snugly right after Geoff regaled us with the Summer Game Fest stream, this year’s Day Of The Devs showcase marked the tenth anniversary. Tim Schafer and friends revealed more about some stonking looking indies from places as far apart as the Netherlands, Japan and Argentina. It was lovely to see some solo devs featured too, such as Madison Karrh with Birth, a point-and-click puzzler about loneliness, and Billy Basso’s beautiful pixel-art Metroidvania Animal Well.

        <updated>2022-06-09T20:09:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Summer Game Fest presentation brought several small but important details coming to The Last of Us universe, including some details about what is now a standalone multiplayer title set within the post-apocalyptic setting.
Originally, a multiplayer component was planned for inclusion in the release of The Last of Us Part 2. But before that game released, Naughty Dog opted to cut that portion of the game and instead focus on the campaign. At the time, it was also clear that the multiplayer experience was likely still in the works, and was expanding in scope. Today’s reveal makes clear that expansion has broadened out to be its own full game.
The game has been in the works for roughly two years as of now. It includes a new cast of characters, though many of the tools those characters are using seem to be similar to those we saw in the campaign of The Last of Us Part 2; the characters wield rifles and Molotov cocktails even as chaos unfolds on the overgrown streets below them.
Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann was open in admitting that they would not be sharing extensive details on the project at this time, but did share a piece of concept art that showed survivors overlooking what appears to be the city of San Francisco.
We still have something of a wait before we’ll be able to play the game, as Druckmann implied we’d be seeing more of the project sometime next year in 2023.
Earlier today, a leak helped confirm that The Last of Us Remake is on the way, and today's Summer Game Fest also confirmed that progress is continuing with The Last of Us TV show, starring Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal, as well as news that the game's vocal stars, Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker, would be taking on some meaningful roles in the TV project.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann took the stage at Summer Game Fest to reveal new details about HBO’s upcoming The Last of Us TV series.
First, he revealed a new still from the show, posted above, that reveals the first face shot of Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey in the roles of Joel and Ellie, respectively. Prior to this, we’d only seen the characters from behind. The image comes from an episode directed by Druckmann himself, who describes the show as “the most authentic video game adaptation yet”. 
Druckmann then brought Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who voice Joel and Ellie in the games, to reveal that the actors appear in the show in undisclosed roles. 
The Last of Us is set to premiere on HBO Max sometime in 2023. The show is being helmed by Druckmann and Craig Mazin of Chernobyl fame.]]></summary>

Now, Demagog seem to be expanding their Wasteland-verse with a third entry: Highwater. It's not clear how this one relates to the others just yet, but it does feature a rather lovely yellow lifeboat in a flooded cityscape. Check out the reveal trailer below.

Well, it's here! The initial "big push" Summer Game Fest stream just ended. Here's a big old Summer Game Fest 2022 recap: emphasis on old.
Vibe check? I was heavily reminded of the low-key artifice of the PC Gaming Show throughout, where it was hard to tell what was actually a reveal and what had been shown weeks or months ago. There were lots of ads and a few "exclusives/world firsts" that were basically modified existing trailers. The Rock stopped by through a Zoom call to plug his energy drink (twice) and showed off a trailer for his new movie, Black Adam. The "one more thing" final announcement was a The Last of Us remake, which wouldn't have hit that hard for a lot of people (myself included) even if it wasn't leaked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few weeks ago we got a 13-minute look at Gotham Knights, Warner Bros. Montreal's Arkham Knight follow-up that is scheduled to release on October 25. This lengthy look showed off traversal, combat, and a brief taste of what we could expect from the upgrade system. At today's Summer Game Fest, a new trailer debuted, giving us a deeper look at Nightwing's gameplay.
With Batman supposedly dead, Nightwing, Robin, Batgirl, and Red Hood have banded together to keep Gotham's streets safe. Nightwing was long an understudy of Batman and also trained as a trapeze artist as a child.  In the new footage, we see both of these influences in his fighting style. He's brutal at close range, can create distance with his acrobatic flexibility, and has gadgets galore at his disposal.
In most of the gameplay, he's in his traditional black and blue garb, but we also get a brief look at him in a different ninja-like suit, which you'll be able to craft by gathering specific components.
Gotham Knights is slated to release on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and also PC. I hope it lives up the Arkham series' legacy, but also hope the inclusion of cooperative play gives it a new identity that is every bit as enthralling.]]></summary>

After Blair Witch and The Medium, Bloober Team is returning to the world of Layers of Fear with a "psychedelic" horror game, Layers of Fears, that's being developed in Unreal Engine 5 alongside Anshar Studios. A trailer debuted at Summer Game Fest 2022 with familiar characters and scenes from the wider series, albeit looking better than ever.
https://youtu.be/AwEXJ3T1EJM
It really feels like history is repeating itself, both in terms of the tortured artist storyline and the gameplay of Layers of Fear 1 and 2 (and Inheritance, the game with the painter's daughter, which is easily forgotten about and will likely end up feeling the freshest here). We've seen tons of remasters and even full-on remakes in recent years, but this is blurring the lines in a way that I wasn't expecting after Bloober Team's recent teases.
"Layers of Fears will be the complete, definitive, and at the same time unpredictable way to discover the stories of artists enslaved by their obsessions," according to Bloober Team. "Prepare for an exquisite horror experience thanks to the expanded plot lines that will cast a new light on the overarching narrative." You can see some screenshots on Steam.

The developers say they're "focused on tense exploration and immersive storytelling," though that's going to be a hard sell for some people based on the series so far.
I personally have had my fun with Layers of Fear (and to a lesser extent its direct sequel), so I'm curious if Layers of Fears will end up feeling fresh enough, conceptually, to justify itself. The visual fidelity is clearly a step up from the original games, but that can only take me so far. In general, this spooky (?) series has a lot of fans — and a lot of haters.
Layers of Fears is heading to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC through Steam and the Epic Games Store.

Warner Bros. Games has released a new trailer for its upcoming DC Comics title Gotham Knights. Currently in development for PC and new-gen consoles, the hard-hitting vigilante adventure will launch this fall, following a recent delay.
During Summer Game Fest, we go to see a new trailer focusing entirely on the acrobatic, highly-skilled martial artist, Nightwing. A former protege of The Batman himself, Dick Grayson would eventually break off from his role in The Dynamic Duo, striking out for himself as a peacekeeper in the mean streets of Gotham City. His incredible ninjitsu abilities and baton-based hand-to-hand skills fast-flatten any perp foolhardy enough to stand in his way.
Nightwing will be joined by Batgirl, Red Hood, and Robin in the new multiplayer title.
Gotham Knights launches October 25 on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

However, it will attach to Saints Row because the character you create now can be used as your own in Saints Row when it launches August 23. In it, you can do quite a lot too. You can adjust your body type and size, add tattoos and other cosmetics, and so much more. It even appears you can play as your boss nude, or at least close to it.

He first revealed the title during The Game Awards 2021. But today, he and developer Inflexion Games showed off the studio’s first title with a brand new trailer.
“For this reveal,” explains senior system designer Alexei Pepers in a blog post, “we wanted to pack the trailer with new footage and details for our community to dig into: More giants! Expanded base building! Calculating Automatons! But one new feature we felt needed a little more of a deep dive was the Realm Cards.” These cards give players the power to help craft the game’s procedural world and alter the experience. Check out everything in the video below. 


The team further explains the card-based concept for the game on their website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At long last Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge got the two things fans have been begging for: Casey Jones as a playable character and a release date that is just around the corner. 
The retro-inspired beat 'em up launches on June 16. Casey has also been labeled as an unlockable character, meaning he won’t be available to use from the get-go. In another pleasant surprise, the game now has up to six-player online co-op instead of only four. Enemies also scale in size based on the number of players; expect to face a ton of Foot Clan with a six-person squad. Multiplayer also supports crossplay, so you can kick shell with friends across multiple platforms. 


You can play TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. The game is also launching on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-06-09T19:36:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After an announcement in April, today’s Summer Game Fest presentation gave us a more in-depth look at American Arcadia, the new game from Out of the Blue Games, the makers of Call of the Sea.
Players control Trevor Hills, a resident of a strange city call Arcadia, a seemingly futuristic utopia (rooted in 1970s design sensibility) in which everything looks clean and progressive. However, the city’s pristine appearance is an illusion, as the entire thing is a reality TV show for people to watch from the outside, in which one’s popularity can tank and put your actual life at risk.
Trevor is on the run from the constant surveillance, leading to what looks like a number of frantic chase scenes. In some, he’s being watched by floating drones that are tracking and recording his movements. In another sequence, we see Trevor desperately trying to stay ahead of police or security that are trying to take him in. And in yet another gameplay moment, he makes a death-defying leap from a high platform dive into a pool far below.
As the trailer wraps up, the story pans out to someone apparently outside of Arcadia, looking at the domed city from its exterior, vowing to help get him out of there. In actuality, this brief sequence is representative of the other main pillar of gameplay, in which you control a 3D first-person experience that includes hacking and puzzles. 
American Arcadia clearly draws more than just a little bit of inspiration from the classic film, The Truman Show. But the added 1970s aesthetic and focus on man-on-the-run action gives it a unique vibe. And satirizing or commenting on the questionable values of reality TV certainly feels like a timely subject.
Published by Raw Fury, American Arcadia is heading to console and PCs at a yet-to-be announced future date. Check out the full trailer below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though the manga is entering its final saga next month (with years of stories to go, though), there's plenty of One Piece content to consume in the near future. At Summer Game Fest, One Piece Odyssey, ILCA's upcoming JRPG featuring the Straw Hat Crew, had a debut trailer introducing the cast and showing off some of the environments players can expect to explore. 
The trailer, which you can watch above, gives each confirmed Straw Hat a spotlight as their ship, the Thousand Sunny, rockets into the sky. They're up there because of a strange cloud that forms above the seas while a Knock Up Stream kicks the ship into the air before one of Franky's Coup De Burst propels them even closer to danger. Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Sanji, Chopper, Franky, Robin, Brook, and Franky are all here, although new-ish-comer Jinbei is unfortunately nowhere to be seen. 
As for in-game footage, we see some exploration of the world, and you can control more of the cast than just Monkey D. Luffy, so if you're a big Zorro, Sanji, or Chopper fan, you'll get to take direct control of them at some point. 
One Piece Odyssey doesn't have a release date yet, but it is coming this year, according to the new trailer. It'll be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC whenever it does arrive.]]></summary>

Players assume the role of the Hunter, an original customizable hero who serves as the key to taking down their parent and the game's villain: Lilith, mother of all demons.

Midnight Suns is a strategic turn-based RPG featuring an interesting card-based twist, and we recently visited Firaxis Games in Baltimore, MD, to play more of it. We came away with significant takeaways, including this exciting gameplay featuring Spider-Man and Fallen Venom – a horned, demonic-looking version of the already scary antagonist. Join Alex Van Aken, Alex Stadnik, and Marcus Stewart for another look at Midnight Suns in this episode of New Gameplay Today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metal: Hellsigner made an appearance today during Summer Game Fest and a demo is available now. While the trailer didn't really show anything new, it still looks neat! You should check it out, if only because it's a fun concept.
The big draw is its rhythm-based gameplay. While rhythm games are a dime a dozen, Hellsinger sets itself apart by being a first-person shooter, where, as you may have guessed, action has to be performed on the beat. Shooting, dodging, reloading, and so on need to be performed in time with the game's soundtrack for maximum points. 


Speaking of the soundtrack, Hellsinger features System of a Down's Serj Tankian, Trivium's Matt Heafy, Lamb of God's Randy Blythe, and more. Check out our in-depth interview with Tankian to hear more about his contributions to the game. 
A demo for Metal: Hellsigner is available now on PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Game Fest turned strategic for a new trailer featuring Sega and Amplitude Studios' Humankind. Not only does it have a new update for the PC version and some recent DLC, but a console version of the 4X game is also coming on November 4. The footage above shows a short clip of the console version in action, but I'm sure we'll see more of how Humankind is transitioning to controllers in the months ahead.
A new PC DLC available now is titled "Cultures Of Latin America," which, I'm sure you've guessed, adds new cultures, narrative events, and more based on Latin America. It costs $8.99 to add a Latin heritage to your Humankind civilizations. Here's a handy bullet-pointed list of features for this new content drop: 
6 New Cultures: Caralans, Nazca, Taíno, Inca, Argentinians, and Cubans
6 New Wonders: Pyramid of the Sun – Teotihuacan, Maracana Stadium, Salar de Uyuni, Salto Angel, Lençóis Maranhenses, and the Atacama Desert.
9 Independent Peoples
15 Narrative Events
30+ New in-game themed music tracks composed by Arnaud Roy
But that's not all. Amplitude is releasing a "major update" for the PC version of Humankind today, which also implements a reworked surrender system, rebalances war support modifiers, gives infrastructure yield previews, and adds unique wonder effects. There's even more in the update, so if you're a Humankind fan, you have plenty to check out in the game starting today.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chance has always been an integral part of Firaxis’ turn-based tactics games. Just ask the many thousands of players who missed a shot with a 90% success chance in one of their XCOM reboots. Marvel’s Midnight Suns, however, could be the Civilization studio’s biggest gamble yet. Not only is it their first game to mix substantial RPG elements into its tactical combat, but there’s nary a hit percentage in sight. In the four hours I spent playing the opening of Midnight Suns last week, I saw precisely one scenario that had any kind of per cent number attached to it – and that was booting a goon (100%) or Venom, one of the newly confirmed villains of the game (0%), off a rooftop. All your other attacks, represented here as a deck of cards, are guaranteed hits.
It’s a strategic evolution I’ll talk about in a second, but this switch-up in approach isn’t the only part of Midnight Suns story that’s been subject to the whims of (mis)fortune. No sooner had Firaxis announced the game it was delayed in the snap of Thanos' fingers (from March to the second half of 2022, now confirmed as October 7th at tonight’s Summer Game Fest). But speaking to creative director Jake Solomon, the extra polishing time they set aside gave them an unexpected benefit. And it’s all down to a fish witch called Wanda.

Marvel’s Midnight Suns swings to stores on October 7, and a new cinematic trailer pulled the curtain back on Spider-Man (voiced by Yuri Lowenthal) and Scarlet Witch. These fan-favorite heroes join the likes of Ghost Rider, Captain America, and Magik to battle Lilith, Mother of all Demons. Not to be outdone by our do-gooders, the trailer also revealed Lilith's line-up of corrupted antagonists: Venom, Sabertooth, Hulk, and interestingly, Scarlet Witch again. 


Firaxis also laid out four different versions of the game, each offering its own batch of goodies. They are:
Standard Edition ($59.99): PS4, Xbox One, and PC base game.  
Enhanced Edition ($69.99): PS5 and Xbox Series X/S version that includes five premium skins.
Digital+ Edition ($79.99): Available on all platforms and includes 11 premium skins. 
Legendary Edition ($99.99): Available on all platforms and includes 23 premium cosmetic skins plus a post-launch season pass. 
Marvel’s Midnight Suns will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Firaxis plans to launch a Switch version at a later date. We recently spent a few hours playing the game, and you can read our impressions here or watch us take on Fallen Venom in this episode of New Gameplay Today. Be sure to also catch up on our behind-the-scenes making of the game by visiting our cover story hub.]]></summary>

This sizable expansion introduces a new character named Ms. Chalice and the never-before-seen Inkwell Island to explore. You are tasked to help Chef Saltbaker locate the Legendary Chalice.

At today's Summer Game Fest, Studio MDHR debuted new footage from The Delicious Last Course that shows an ice world and the challenges it delivers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s all sunshine and rainbows at the beach until a goat set on destruction decides to ruin everything. That’s exactly what happened in the new Goat Simulator 3 trailer. 
Oddly enough, if you’ve kept up with video game news and trailers for years, the Goat Simulator 3 reveal trailer might have seemed highly familiar initially. That’s because it was riffing off of the Dead Island 2 trailer released many years ago. In that trailer, a man attempts to go for a beachside jog with headphones blasting music into his ears, and throughout the run, he’s oblivious to the zombie carnage around him. That’s exactly what happens in this Goat Simulator 3 trailer, except the big carnage-causing reveal isn’t zombies – it’s goats. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


Another odd thing about the Goat Simulator 3 trailer is that the last Goat Simulator game was the first one. This means the team is completely skipping over Goat Simulator 2, it seems, which is as chaotic as the series itself. 
Goat Simulator 3 is coming to PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC, this fall. 
While waiting for Goat Simulator 3, read Game Informer’s Goat Simulator review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Blizzard alumni are bringing their RTS chops to a new game from Frost Giant Studios with Stormgate. The debut trailer, which you can watch above, debuted at Summer Game Fest this afternoon.
Tim Morten, production director and CEO of Frost Giant Studios, joined Summer Game Fest host Geoff Keigley on stage to reveal a little about the new Strategy title. He describes the titular Stormgates as portals that open during solar storms that unleash the Infernal Host onto a future Earth. The trailer showed a taste of both the demonic-looking Infernal Host faction, along with the second announced race, the Human Resistance, which is represented in the footage by the archeologist, and possibly the cool-looking mech. More factions will be revealed in the future, but those were the only two Morten would confirm during today's reveal.
Morten says Stormgate is built for approachability and is set to be free to play but won't have any pay to win transactions or NFTs. Its also going to be designed for more social interaction. Stormgate's campaign can be played cooperatively. It'll also have 3-player "open-ended co-op" and support for 3v3 PvP battles, along with 1v1 for those who want a more personal galactic struggle.
Stormgate will be entering beta in 2023, and interested players can sign up on the game's website for the chance to participate in the test.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Game Fest has brought plenty of substantial looks at upcoming titles. The Astronauts' Witchfire is no exception. The upcoming first-person shooter is set against gothic backdrops, with fantastical creatures standing in your way. First announced back in 2017, the game has been in development for some time now, so it's great to see it in action and inching closer to a full release. 
The trailer, which you can watch above, showed off the gunplay, the ability to freeze enemies, ways to use the environment to distract them, bow-and-arrow attacks, and a stable of other cool magical powers. Set in an alternate reality, Witchfire centers on a deadly war raging between witches and the church. 
The biggest announcement is that the game is entering Early Access soon. Right now, it is currently only announced for PC and is set to appear on the Epic Games store. So if you're looking for a dark fantasy shooter, keep your eyes open for more details to play the game earlier.]]></summary>

The video featured Soap and Ghost infiltrating the rig off the Gulf of Mexico during a ferocious storm. Their mission begins quietly as the pair, alongside new teammates such as Mexican Special Forces Operator Alejandro, stealthily picks off targets as they work towards their objective. As you may expect, things don’t go as planned. The battle escalates along with the weather as the action moves to the deck of a ship that gets tossed and turned by the violent waves. Showing off the game’s physics system, cargo crates constantly slide across the deck, providing ever-changing cover points for both the player and the enemy.  


Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II launches on October 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Volition's upcoming reboot of Saints Row is all about coming up in the crime business in your own way, and that includes the looks and styles displayed on your version of The Boss. In anticipation of Saints Row's release, you'll be able to customize your Boss in an extensive character creator called Boss Factory and bring your creation into the final game when it launches on August 23. We got our hands on the Boss Factory early and had some fun concocting our ideal crimelord.


In this edition of New Gameplay Today, your hosts, Alex Stadnik, Jill Grodt, and John Carson, put the Boss Factory through its paces, creating something truly monstrous in the process. We hope you like demonic eyes and the slickest, oiliest skin that only a dip in a vat of olive oil could produce. Everything from skull shaping to gradient hair coloring, limb prosthetics, makeup, and scars are on the table; it's really an impressive toolset for players to mess with. Because there's so much to customize, this is an extended NGT, so sit back and enjoy the mayhem you can unleash before even stepping into the dangerous streets of Santo Ileso.
For more on the full breadth of customizations available in Saints Row, including vehicles and weapons, check out our preview on the topic. We also saw a newer build of the game in recent weeks, showing the game's promising additions since it was delayed in February. Of course, if you haven't read it already, Issue #340 of Game Informer features Saints Row on the cover, where we dig into an extensive hands-on preview of the title.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Callisto Protocol releases on December 2 and is currently on Game Informer's newest cover. At today's Summer Game Fest, a new "red band" trailer debuted, alongside two gameplay sequences that show off the sci-fi horror game's pacing, combat, and ridiculous amounts of gore. 
Protagonist Jacob Lee dishes out plenty of punishment with sci-fi weapons and a familiar looking boot stomp. The trailer above is Glen Schofield's cut, showing just how violent and bloody the game can get. The footage below shows clips from two sequences. One with Lee in prison garb and another with him armored up and ready for war.


The Callisto Protocol is coming to PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC on December 2. It's the beginning of a new series, but for fans of Dead Space, probably looks like a sequel you've been waiting almost a decade to play.
What do you think of The Callisto Protocol? And how do you think EA's Dead Space remake will stake up against it? Let us know in the comments section below!]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-06-09T18:22:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week’s Sony State of Play gave us a first look at gameplay for the highly anticipated Street Fighter 6. Today’s Summer Game Fest presentation opened with a second glimpse at the game, this time to add another fighter to the roster. Guile has entered the fight.
The news should surprise precisely no one, as Guile has been a fixture of the popular fighting game franchise for decades. However, it’s always fun to see the ways that Capcom is updating their most familiar warriors for a new outing, and the new trailer gave us a look at the well-coifed martial artist.
Guile has always had ties to American culture and military elements, and that backdrop continues in the next installment. We see Guile fighting against a background environment very reminiscent of his early appearances, with a jet in the background, and the towering structure of what looks to be an aircraft carrier in the distance. Sailors and dock workers appear to gather and cheer on the fight.
Like in the first-look trailer we saw last week, Guile’s moves feature some of the same flashy painterly effects that we first saw with characters like Ryu and Chun-Li. Those bright and colorful effects are a fun contrast to the new more realistic styling of characters provided through the use of the RE engine, the same engine used to craft games like Devil May Cry 6, Monster Hunter Rise, and Resident Evil Village.
Street Fighter 6 was confirmed earlier this week to be the farthest along in the series timeline, set after the events of Street Fighter 3. As such, this new look at Guile reflects a slightly older look for the character, but don’t worry; he still takes time before his trailer concludes to whip out a comb and fix his perfectly maintained hair.
Street Fighter 6 is aiming for launch on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and Steam sometime in 2023. Check out the full new trailer below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Game Fest Live has had no shortage of space-themed experiences with The Callisto Protocol, Aliens: Dark Descent, Fort Solis, and more. However, host Geoff Keighly surprised viewers with one stellar game long-since thought lost to the development void: Routine. 
From Lunar Software and Raw Fury, the first-person horror all about exploring an abandoned moon base, took the stage with an unsettling new trailer. With desolate lunarscapes, dilapidated empty hallways, and a grainy, filmic vibe, the game’s latest look was set to ratchet up the tension. Its nightmarish death-dealing robot makes it stand out from the rest of the showcase’s intergalactic titles, but the short clip gives little detail on what to expect or if the game’s direction has changed significantly since we last saw it. However, we do know that composer Mick Gordon, known for his work on the Wolfenstein and Doom series, is creating its musical score. 


However, the team behind the game has already posted a message to players on their website about Routine’s long disappearance. Saying:
Routine is coming to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC, though the date has not been officially revealed.]]></summary>

Roger Clark, most well known for playing Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption II, Troy Baker, famous for his portrayal of Joel in The Last of Us series, and Julia Brown, a TV actress known for The Alienist, all have roles in Fort Solis. 
The brief trailer serves mostly as a mood piece, showing the game's protagonist, Wyatt Taylor (Baker), dealing with some kind of threat in the titular Fort Solis. You can see the trailer in full below:

I'd be recommending it for sure even if I hadn't found that out, because it's a terrific little game that's far more engaging than it looks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prison Architect and Darwinia developers Introversion Software have taken to Twitter to announce they’re working on a new spaceship management game, The Last Starship. It’s a procedurally-generated romp through various mission types such as asteroid mining, battling space pirates and rescuing ships in distress, all spread throughout the galaxy. Introversion have quite a bit more to say on what they call their “broken, unfinished and bug filled prototype“ in their announcement video, which you can watch below.

The arena survival shoot 'em up today launched into early access yesterday, and it's a good'un. I already enjoyed the demo, and now it's bigger, fancier, and full of even more ridiculous combos. Today I had a run so overpowered I was afraid to even shoot, and fled explosions I hadn't even intended to cause until I finally exploded myself. That's the good stuff. And it's only £2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inside ActivisionBlizzard there are two wolves. Possibly dire wolves, or some other species of fantastical monster with surplus vowels in the name. Dreade Froste Beaste Wolfe. Anyway, one of them is made of decent people, developers who are fighting for better working conditions and making the best games they can under the circumstances. The other is Blizzard the organisation, a management structure seemingly incapable of making anything other than the worst decision possible in any given situation. So really, it's actually more like one wolf, and one flapping headless chicken (the chicken having also received a lot of allegations of harrassment and discrimination, and a lawsuit from the state of California). 
Diablo Immortal, which is currently on open beta for PC and out properly for mobile (both for free), was largely made by the wolf, and it's all right to play! However, I don't know why the chicken wanted to put it on PC in its current monetised form, apart from the fact it's a bad decision and we've already established those are the only kind of decisions the chicken can make.

It's being developed by Stunlock Studios, the folks behind arena-brawler Battlerite that lifts the fights from MOBAs like Dota 2 or League Of Legends and cuts away all the tedious build-up. So quite the departure then? Yes and no. V Rising strikes out as its own thing, but Stunlock's back catalogue definitely bleeds into its combat and exploration and easygoing attitude.

The Logitech G915 Lightspeed TKL is an ultra-slim, low profile mechanical keyboard that feels like the best laptop keyboard you've ever used. Lightspeed means Logitech's reliable 2.4GHz wireless, while 'TKL' stands for tenkeyless, a compact design that ditches the numpad for superior ergonomics and longer battery life. 
Altogether, it's a beautifully-designed mechanical keyboard, with a high price point being the only strike against it - and despite that, the full-size G915 has been our 'best wireless keyboard' recommendation for three years running. Today though, the G915 Lightspeed TKL is down to £109 after a £90 discount, making it an excellent time to upgrade your setup with a swanky new keyboard.

This headset distinguishes itself with a comfortable design, good neutral sound and a choice of leatherette or velour ear pads - with the latter being a godsend for spectacle-wearers like myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Owning Halo Infinite is like having a subscription to a magazine where each issue has part of a model stuck to the front. The first issue brought the game's multiplayer modes, the second issue brought its singleplayer campaign, the third issue finally fixed its Big Team Battle mode, and the fourth issue - by which time you've possibly lost interest - will bring online co-op for its campaign.

If you're one of those still reading this metaphorical magazine, you can get beta access to the co-op mode this July if you sign up to Halo Insider.

Disc Room is one of those games, and it's a good one. First released in 2020, it hit Game Pass this week, inviting more folks to dodge through a giant alien spaceship filled with buzzsaws. I certainly recommend having a go and discovering what your insides look like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I look outside my window, I often see our two cats scrabbling up our back wall as they hop over the fence to visit the neighbour's garden. Up and down they go, covering distances seemingly impossible for their tiny, wiry frames, yet without coming to any harm whatsoever. It's an instinct the team at BlueTwelve Studio know all too well, having modelled their unnamed cat protagonist in their debut adventure game Stray after a couple of their own feline companions - and colleagues, it turns out.
"About 80% of the team are cat owners, or are being owned by a cat depending on how you see it," says producer Swann Martin-Raget. "We actually have two cats that are joining us almost everyday at the office and are working with us. The main character is based on one of the director's cats called Murtaugh. He's not an exact copy, but he's the main reference. We also have Oscar, who is a Sphynx, a furless cat, so he's a very good reference for animation because we can clearly see all the movements. We also have a lot of strays that we've adopted, but yeah, we definitely are huge cat lovers and these animals are fascinating to us."

This is only available in your first play through in the deluxe version of the game, which I wasn't aware I was reviewing. The feature unlocks in the standard version after you've completed a full play through.
I'm going to do my absolute best to tell you about The Quarry with no spoilers, but it will be hard because a lot of what marks it out as better and cleverer and funner than comparable horrorventure romps is all tangled up in the plot. It's an interactive story you control with split-second decisions and quick time events; it is mostly plot. Broadly, it is the story of a group of camp counselors, one night in a quarry-based summer camp, and how baffling organisational choice can lead to ruin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Going into my chat with Steve Piggott and Rasmus Löfström of Torn Banner Studios, I thought I had a reasonable grasp of the developer’s trajectory up to that point. After finding success in 2012 with their breakout hit Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, Torn Banner had gone on to compose the difficult second album Mirage: Arcane Warfare – an Arabian Nights-inspired take on Chivalry’s multiplayer melee combat. Mirage had not been as well-received as Chivalry, yet despite this stumbling block, the studio had found its feet again with Chivalry 2, a souped-up sequel to their earlier work with more nuanced combat, bigger maps, and support for 64-player battles.
It turns out that, while broadly correct, I wildly underestimated Torn Banner’s reversal of fortunes. In the five years between the launch of Mirage and Chivalry 2’s impending Steam release, Torn Banner has gone from a studio on the brink to being more successful than its leadership ever imagined.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canada's Federal Court has handed down a 'dynamic' blocking order to prevent live NHL games from being viewed via pirate IPTV streams. The first of its kind in Canada, the flexible injunction was obtained by companies including Rogers, Bell, The Sports Network, and Groupe TVA. Unusually, it will be independently audited to assess over-blocking and any user circumvention via VPNs.

Newegg dropped their price on the EVGA Supernova 1000 G6 PSU to $140, and Amazon followed suit soon after. That's $50 below the usual price of $190, and a historic low for this model.
If you've got a high-end system - or you're planning to pick up a power-hungry next-gen graphics card when they launch later this year - then this is an awesome upgrade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There have been more auspicious PC game launches than that of Diablo Immortal. Originally revealed to a booing crowd as a mobile-only, MMO-styled take on the APRG series, its later-announced Windows release has revealed the full extent of a F2P monetisation system that ties immensely powerful Legendary Gem upgrades to costly loot boxes. Not a great look, especially coming from a company facing multiple lawsuits, staff walkouts and sexual harassment allegations.


Strictly speaking, the PC version of Diablo Immortal is in open beta, with only the mobile version launching as the finished article. The good news is that this leaves more room for the technical issues and oversights I’ve encountered to be fixed; the bad news is that they exist in the first place, and range from absent PC settings staples to repeating performance hiccups.

With its Studio Ghibli-esque styling, imaginative character designs and amazing music made by the legend that is Joe Hisaishi, its world is a true joy to immerse yourself in. It’s why I’m ultimately so disappointed by Cross Worlds. Netmarble has taken this pure, effervescent fantasy dream land and pushed it off the monkeybars into a steaming pile of gacha mechanics and crypto currencies.
To be fair, it’s not all bad. Some of it is great even, but I’ve jumped between loving and hating so many different bits over my last week with the PC beta that ultimately I’m just sad. There’s a wonderful glimpse of something amazing that just never materialises as the mirk of mobile-based gameplay is just too thick to get through.

Today though, Amazon UK has discounted the board to just 80 of your British pounds, a 60% reduction that brings it below some of the best value gaming keyboards. That's an awesome price for a full-size UK layout with this kind of tech on board.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks. Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve written one of these Letters From The Editor. Things have been… manic, to say the least. Manic in the traditional ‘busy’ sense (hello Elden Ring, PAX, V Rising and now notE3 planning), but also in the ‘man, there are so many cool things I want to talk to you about but aren’t quite ready to announce yet’ sense. I’ve been on the cusp of writing about these things every single month since, err, March, but then something falls through, the weeks go by, and we’re back to square one again. So I’m sorry about that, I really am. 
What I’m writing to you about today still isn’t one of those exciting things, unfortunately, but it is nonetheless very important. When we relaunched our RPS Supporter Programme last year, we did so on June 17th, which means its one-year anniversary is just around the corner. It also means that those of you who signed up for our yearly supporter tier will be coming to the end of your subscription soon, and I wanted to explain a little bit about the renewal process as it’s… err, a bit convoluted. Sorry again about that.

I'm now attuned to their look, their pacing, their good and bad points. So, it came as no surprise when I found myself testing out the closed alpha of yet another of their ilk: Ripout, an upcoming sci-fi horror FPS that's very Doom 3.
What's nice is that vidbud Liam joined me! Both because he's a fan of the FPS genre and to be present with a jar in hand, lest I crumbled into dust. Thankfully this didn't happen and we had a pretty swell time, I'd say. It's early days for the game but there's potential there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry's Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xalavier Nelson Jr has a bit of a love hate relationship with screens right now. As development on his studio’s gutsy market game Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator was wrapping up at the end of last year, he tells me he remembers “just being really angry at the concept of the borders of the screen”. He was, by his own admission, in “a vague fugue state” at the time, having spent months immersed in Space Warlord’s black and green trading interfaces. But the feeling of having his game “chained to these walls” at the edge of his monitor proved to be a surprisingly powerful one - so much so that it spurred Nelson Jr and his team at Strange Scaffold to create an entirely new kind of game in the months leading up to Warlord’s release: Witch Strandings.

That's right. Taking cues from Hideo Kojima’s hiking postal sim Death Stranding, Witch Strandings is a game that not only asks what Sam Bridges’ cross-country cargo routes might look like if they were made with a fraction of Kojima’s development budget, but also how games can create experiences that are “larger than my screen,” says Nelson Jr. And the answer, it turns out, lies in your PC’s humble mouse.

By their powers combined we manage to create an absolutely nightmarish dystopian society where people live forever but cannot put more than four of the same thing in a line. It's bleak. Games should stay in games.

If any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we'll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. 
Please note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we've been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!
