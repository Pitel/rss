        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With The Sims franchise moving away from linear game releases and into the future, it’s not unusual to think that EA has simply abandoned the previous titles in the series. But, to everyone’s surprise, fans could rejoice that a new update was released for The Sims 3, the game’s first patch in ten years.


The patch, version number 1.69.47.024017, was released on January 13, 2025, with no prior warning. It was released to fix the Alder Lake bug, where Windows players with newer Alder Lake processors wouldn’t be able to run the game at all through the EA app. The patch now allows players to enjoy the game on their newer PCs.

2024 was a big year for Nintendo's emulator takedowns, with the likes of Yuzu and Ryujinx both biting the dust after facing the company's wrath. Now, at a recent lecture hosted by Japan’s Association of Copyright for Computer Software, Nintendo lawyer Koji Nishiura has explained the technicalities of when an emulator is considered illegal and why the Big N has so many in the crosshairs.
As reported by Denfaminicogamer, Nishiura — the deputy general manager of Nintendo's IP division and patent attorney — explained that there's a difference in legality between the emulator itself and its uses: "While you can’t immediately claim that an emulator is illegal in itself, it can become illegal depending on how it’s used" (translated by Automaton).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Slice to kill.
The problem with the term ‘Metroidvania’ is that it’s a far broader genre classification than some give it credit for. Depending on where they fall on the spectrum between the exploration-heavy Metroid series and the combat-centric Castlevania series, it’s possible for two games to both be considered Metroidvanias while playing, looking, and sounding nothing alike. Neither extreme is more valid than the other. What’s important is understanding which portions of the genre a given title is committed to, and whether it’s successful.
It’s not enough to simply call Blade Chimera a great Metroidvania and leave it at that. What Team Ladybug (Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth, Drainus) has cooked up here is a game that is impressively clear-eyed in identifying its priorities — which just so happen to mirror many of the tenets of Konami’s legendary vampire hunting series — and executing on them to incredible effect. It doesn’t do everything one might expect a Metroidvania to do, but its particular bright spots are blinding to behold.

The other developer, Arachne, recently left game development after recovering from a mishandled surgical procedure last year. According to Dizzie, her departure doesn't have anything to do with the aforesaid violent crime, which pre-dates their relationship.

I wonder how long it'll take them to probe beyond the obvious Marvel headliners and start seriously abrading the bottom of the Connected Universe barrel. Nagneto, for example. Or how about J.

Although you would think Nintendo's focus would be completely on the Switch "successor" right now, it seems the company's customer support line has found time to issue a notice about unauthorised services for older hardware.
In a brief message on social media, the Japanese branch has apparently confirmed the existence of services that replace functions like "online play" for the Wii U. It's now advising anyone using these services to refrain from doing so, as they may pose a security risk. Here's the rough translation in full:

The cooking station becomes accessible once you've unlocked the farmhouse. To cook in Dreaming Isles, you'll need to embark on a journey of exploration to find recipe books. The Tuna Steak recipe seems to unlock automatically, but you must repair your boat for better meals. For instance, I found the Swordfish Steak book near Freestad's dining hall and another for the Cooked Meat dish in Frey…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Set some time aside in April, because GungHo has announced that the Lunar Remastered Collection will arrive on April 18, 2025 for PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.


I feel like we keep getting Lunar re-releases, but I looked it up and the last one was actually in 2010 for the PSP. Or 2012 if you count mobile. Still, it’s seen a lot of second chances for a game that original released on Sega CD back in 1992.




Lunar Remastered Collection combines Lunar: The Silver Star and Lunar 2: Eternal Blue, or rather, the PS1 version of those. And while it’s titled “remastered” it largely has the same graphics as those releases with some added effects. It’s still 2D and pixelated, which is fine (or even preferred) by me, but doesn’t feel like it earns the title. Unless you count that gross depth-of-field effect they put on the top and bottom of the screen. I guess the cutscenes seem to be remastered, so it counts. Whatever, I'm not the remaster police.


It looks like you can turn off the gross depth-of-field effects, or, at the very least, play it in classic mode. This might also mean you lose the widescreen mode, but maybe you can tweak things. Either way, you’ll have the same classic games in a new package, so that’s worth a lot.


There will also be a physical version available for $54.99 USD. They will notably feature “reversible covers showcasing two new key arts for LUNAR: Silver Star Story Complete and Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete, both illustrated exclusively for the Lunar Remastered Collection by Toshiyuki Kubooka.”


Lunar Remastered Collection launches on April 18, 2025, for PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

So, what items are useful to pick up as a low-level character in Fallout 76?


Items to repair your gear in Fallout 76


Of utmost importance will be those items that you can scrap for components to repair your weapons and armor. Up until level 15, you’ll first use Wood, Leather, or Raider Armor and eventually Metal. For the most part, your weapons will likely be a pipe pistol/rifle, regular pistol/rifle, a melee weapon, and maybe a laser pistol/rifle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first event of 2025 is coming to Warframe, starting with the Lunar New Year. It isn’t as major as the anniversary of the game, but there are still many things to look forward to.


That being said, here’s everything you need to know about the event.


Warframe Lunar New Year event start date


The Lunar New Year event in Warframe will begin on January 15, 2025. Bundles, floofs, skins, and other cosmetics will appear in the shop.


This event should run until February 15, so there will be plenty of time to get the alerts done and maybe amass enough Platinum to snag some of the limited-time cosmetics.


Image via Digital Extremes


What skins are coming to the event?


Right now, it seems that only Mirage will be getting a new themed skin for the event. Frames from previous years who got skins include Saryn, Chroma, and Grendel, which they may return in.


We’ll also see the following items and skins in the three bundles:



Charming Snake Floof


Hespar Lunaeus Skin (melee weapon skin)


Cordmade Sugatra (melee attachment skin)


Lunar Renewal Snake Flourish


Lunar Renewal Snake Sigil


Lunar New Year Renewal Theme


Mirage Nuwa Floof


Boltor Lunaeus Skin


Moondance Kavat Armor


Heaven Stones Ephemera



These will all be sold in three separate bundles, but are likely to be sold individually as well. All bundles coming with these items will also give you some form of in-game currency, mods, or materials. 


Are there any free items?


For people who want something to grind for, there isn’t much to look forward to other than getting the new Yisi Glyph for your profile icon or the Lunar Renewal Snake Emblem, which will be available via alerts.


You’ll have more than enough time to at least get some items out of this event, but get on it if you don’t want to miss out!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a blog post on its official website, Blizzard today announced the next season of Diablo 4 will be the Season of Witchcraft. Set to release on January 21 at 1 p.m. EST, the Season of Witchcraft will add new enemies, Witchcraft powers, rewards Occult Gems, and more.




The primary seasonal feature of the Season of Witchcraft is, well, Witchcraft Powers. These seasonal-specific powers grant players new abilities and augment and empower existing skills. As players interact and progress through the story of the Coven, a group of Witches trying to serve the powerful Tree of Whispers, they will unlock new Witchcraft powers to use.


Season 7 also adds some pretty welcome quality-of-life updates to the core game that will affect both the seasonal realm and the Eternal Realm, including The Armory which allows players to save and swap builds on the fly, an update to class quests and greater affixes, and a welcome back booster for returning players.


The Season of Witchcraft also adds eight new Unique Items, as well as eight new Legendary Items for players to make builds around. Those who have the Vessel of Hatred expansion will also get access to three new runes, and 15 existing runes have been updated.


As with previous seasons, Season 7 will add new seasonal rewards including a Raven Pet that players can unlock via progression through the Seasonal Journey and Battle Pass.


Overall, this reminds me a lot of the Season of Blood which added seasonal-only Vampiric Powers, though until I see it in action it's hard to tell. I hope Blizzard eventually starts making seasons around meaningful mechanics that get added to the core game rather than one-off seasonal exclusive sources of player power that are removed when the next season releases.


Diablo 4 Season 7, the Season of Witchcraft, goes live on all platforms next week on January 21, 2025.

Developer Rebel Wolves, comprised of former Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 members, has unveiled its open-world vampire RPG, The Blood of the Dawnwalker, with a full trailer and a promise of more this summer.


The trailer introduces you to the game's world and makes no qualms about how hard it's embracing the dark fantasy genre. It's 14th-century Europe. Coen, the game's protagonist, is seen fleeing a burning town with his plague-ridden younger sister. 


Their attempt to run is halted at a dilapidated church, where soldiers surround them. But before things get worse, the duo is saved by Brencis and his vampire horde, who clearly have no respect for authority. Brencis heals Coen's sister but presumably doesn't…]]></summary>

However, his enthusiasm for Microsoft’s first foray into the console market has left me with a lasting affection towards the massive brick of hardware.


With just short of 1000 games, it had a larger library than Nintendo’s GameCube, but a much smaller one than the PS2. It sold an estimated 24 million, which gave it a small lead over the Gamecube’s estimated 22 million. Most importantly, it solidified Microsoft as a big player in the console market that endures to this day.

        <updated>2025-01-14T18:43:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its inception, the Roblox community has been a driving force behind the push for an increased friend limit. By October 2024, the community's efforts had sparked rumors of a boost, and the change was set to come to fruition by early 2025.


Now, the long-awaited moment has arrived for a new update, and we're here to show you how many friends you can have in Roblox.


What is the friend limit on Roblox?


The new Roblox update lets you have up to 1,000 friends in your network, unlike its previous 200 limit. The friend system has evolved over the years, starting with the early days of unlimited friends and the Best Friend feature. Roblox developers then simplified it by limiting the system, seemingingly to improve its mechanics.


Curiously enough, there have been no announcements regarding the 1,000 friend change, whether it be on the Developer Forum or its Twitter/X account. Even though there hasn't been an official confirmation, I've checked several accounts, like the popular user Roblox_RTC, and see they've hit the 1,000 mark.

Given the recent end-of-the-year roadmap from the Developer Forum, we could get more concrete information with an early 2025 round-up. While we wait for official announcements, you can already experience the new friend limit for yourself and go on adventures with the title's many games. And who knows? There might be even more increases in the future. If you're one of those who need more than 1,000 friends, kudos to you; I don't even think I know that many people.


The year 2025 promises many other exciting new elements for Roblox, including improvements to avatar settings and additional creator/user tools. The Jan. 6-10 weekly recap also mentions more preventions for account farming that's been used to exploit Roblox features. Further fixes to the platform will continue to be released for a more balanced and smoother experience, making Roblox bigger than it already is.

To kick things off, the main menu update has already been released as a free base game update. You'll see a completely new design that gives a little more oomph to it, making your current save file the star of the show. I wasn't a big fan of how it looked before, in light of how it basically put all the premium add-ons right in your face. But now, the menu has some personality by spotlighting your Sims rather than things like expansion packs.

Demons are still invading the world, but we're closer to resolving this crisis.


Before beginning, you may not see the Splinters of Possibility story in your Quests menu. Although this makes tracking your quests much more difficult, it is only a visual bug, letting you finish each objective as long as you watch your progress in the top left corner of your screen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warm up your tapping toes, Foreign Gnomes has announced that the sequel to Chris Nordgren and Jordi Roca’s 2021 musical RPG, Everhood will be releasing soon on PC and Switch. Everhood 2 is set to launch on March 4, 2025.


Everhood was one of the first games I reviewed as a full-ish staff member at Destructoid. I didn’t love it! While a lot of what I cited as a problem in my review was technical related, the truth is that there was a story thematic later in the game that I found to be, um, problematic. But it’s buried so deep in there that I would have had to spoil quite a lot to have really gone into it in depth.




However, I did mention other problems like weak characters and the fact that it tries to pull the subversive fake ending nonsense way too many times. I don’t think about Everhood very often these days, and I’ve lost quite a few specifics in my memory, but I still remember the general issues I have with it.


On the other hand, I don’t think it was a bad game. It showed promise, and I think that could be delivered on in a sequel. Storytelling is a skill that can be built, after all, and the gameplay was pretty rad. A lot of it was like Guitar Hero, but instead of strumming the notes, you avoid them. Twists would constantly get thrown in along the way, and it could get pretty intense.


The details on the narrative are a bit hard to follow. It seems that you’ll be playing an avatar of yourself, and you’re “on a quest to slay the mysterious Mind Dragon before the world decays.” All right. It promises over 100 songs and will last 8-10 hours. That’s, like, 2 ½ minutes per song. I have a calculator here. Except there’s likely walking and talking to people in between, so that’s not going to be accurate. Or even useful. You’re welcome.


Everhood will release on PC and Switch on March 4, 2025.

If rumour speak true, it's being made in Unreal Engine 5, and will feature changes to core systems like blocking, stamina, and sneaking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Coming off Turbo Overkill has been great," Trigger Happy's Sam Prebble tells me over call. "That game's development... I mean, it worked out. But it was very messy because it was my first game and I didn't know what the hell I was doing. So I found myself, when it came to pumping content out, I was like: oh, shit. This code base is fucking awful. Like, I can't put stuff together easily. I'm running into bugs everywhere. But now shit just works!"
You might know Sam Prebble as Trigger Happy Interactive, the solo developer behind frenetic FPS Turbo Overkill. Before that he went by a different name, attached to a very different project. Total Chaos, first released in 2018 under the moniker Wadaholic, is a total conversion mod for Doom 2. With its focus on a thick survival horror atmosphere of tension and disempowerment, it's about as far removed from Turbo Overkill's manic, Doom Eternal-inspired action as a game can get. As Prebble puts it, the only thing the two projects have in common is the first person perspective. Even so, he found himself returning to Total Chaos after wrapping development on Turbo Overkill, resulting in the standalone remake.

That’s because the game, P-47 II MD, never got released as intended, instead being canceled and never reaching the Genesis/Mega Drive.


That’s not to say it hasn’t reached anywhere. P-47 II MD is based on P-47: The Phantom Fighter (or sometimes P47 Thunderbolt), a 1988 arcade game. It received ports on the PC-Engine and home computers, but they were never received well. I can’t tell you how the Genesis version compares because, well, I haven’t played it. It’s not exactly readily available.

According to the company, it will reveal brand-new information about some of the most anticipated upcoming games of the year, but it seems it also has a special surprise prepared for its viewers...


We know that the Xbox Developer_Direct will feature three video games, DOOM: The Dark Ages, South of Midnight, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. But, according to Windows Central, there's also going to be a fourth mysterious game, and it's "a new entry in a legendary Japanese IP which has decades of history, and should make a lot of fans happy." This changes everything because, while the Developer_Direct already sounded quite exciting, this has the chance to attract an even broader audience.

However, much like Metroid Prime Remastered before it, Nintendo has opted to omit the original Retro Studios development team from the credits of the new release. Instead, it simply states 'Based on the work of the original development staff'.

It’s not unfair to say that the gaming landscape was somewhat different when Donkey Kong Country Returns first fell into our laps in 2010; 2D platformers were a rare breed, and ol’ DK himself hadn’t arguably had a mainline entry in his series since 2004’s Jungle Beat. Back then, the title said it all: not only was Donkey Kong back, but Donkey Kong Country had indeed returned. That’s not quite the world we’re living in 15 years later.
Having said that, just like the original, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD explains everything you need to know about it in the title: it’s Donkey Kong Country Returns in HD, and unfortunately, it’s not much more than that. This is that same great game from the Wii era tarted up a bit here and there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was difficult to be a Nintendo fan during the Wii years. The initial hype around its motion controls died pretty quickly when it became clear its real-world application was extremely limited. Worse, Nintendo seemed to be looking to gain favor with a broader audience and it seemed that its output suffered.


What sucked most was that it felt like motion control was being shoehorned into everything. Mostly because they were. I think 2010’s Donkey Kong Country Returns is exemplary of this. Retro Studios did an admirable job continuing Rare’s legacy, but the absolutely baffling decision was made to incorporate controller shaking. In particular, you had to shake the controller to get DK to roll. Rolls were necessary as a form of attack, but more importantly, rolling was used to extend jumps.…]]></summary>

Developed by Wave Game, Magicraft sees you play as a kid who's isekai'd into another dimension (or at least, I think he is, because I chose the option to "skip the story" when I selected new game and only later deduced the situation) and tasked to mince all the demons within it. It's typical fantasy fare with an interesting twist: you can combine any number of spells within your inventory, which made me feel very clever, even if I had no idea what I was doing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like it or not, horror gaming is often built on jump scares. Deriding a good cheap scare ignores the endorphin rush that draws so many players to the genre, in the same way that the "elevated horror" trend forfeits some of the soul of schlocky slasher flicks and ghost movies. Don’t get me wrong, Silent Hill and Alan Wake deserve their flowers - but even those games would wither on the screen if Pyramid Head didn’t bust through a wall from time to time.
One unsung jump scare game in particular pioneered horror in the internet age, blazing everywhere from nascent social media to major television networks. In fact, if you had an internet connection circa 2005, there’s a good chance you played it. Alas, it was too ahead of its time, too successful at leveraging virality before viral horror was sought after. Next time you see a streamer throw their headphones across the room in fright, beware: the spirit of Scary Maze Game is right behind you.

Sure, 2025 might be home to some pretty big gaming anniversaries, but you want to know the biggest of them all? This week marks 10 years since the wonderful Mr Alex Olney published his first video on the Nintendo Life YouTube channel. That's right, it has been a decade of "Heeeeello there lovely peeeople".
To mark the occasion, Alex has released a big old thank-you video on the channel, shouting out a whole bunch of people who have helped him over the past 10 years, and sharing a sizzle reel of some of the decade's biggest moments. If you needed a reminder of what Mr Olney looked like sans beard, this is your chance.

Unsurprisingly, in retrospect, the trailer also has big The Witcher vibes. The stringy orchestral music? The dramatic monologues? The horrible things happening to armoured grunts? This thing’s really playing the Polish fantasy hits.

Tennis fans hitting YouTube to see live matches from the Australian Open could be forgiven for thinking they've accidentally clicked on a channel recreating the tournament in Wii Sports, but no. It turns out the event's official channel has taken a novel approach to getting around broadcast rights issues.
As noted by Kotaku, the official Australian Open TV YouTube channel is broadcasting live games from the tournament with a twist. Lacking the live broadcast rights for matches, a workaround which involves capturing the player and ball movements live on the court and rendering animated versions in real-time is giving a Mii-esque spin to the Grand Slam event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The "spance" of Annihilate The Spance is apparently “an ancient, roiling storm of matter and energy” that harbours both “extreme and inexplicable phenomena” and “unfathomable riches”. I’m happy to discover this explanation, because at first I thought that “spance” was just a litigation-avoiding, supermarket rebrand of “space”. I was bracing to send the good news to developers Skyglow Softworks that, so far, nobody has managed to copyright “space”, though I’m sure somebody’s tried. Maybe, um, God? 


It’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game Obliterate Everything by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL. Anyway, here’s a trailer.

Nobody expected Nippon Ichi Software to announce a sequel to the 2004 PS2 strategy RPG 'Phantom Brave', but over 20 years later, the company did just that. Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero sets sail on Switch on 30th January, and for those who want to see what it's all about before release, NIS America has announced that a free demo will be available from 17th January (that's this Friday).
In its reveal tweet, the company noted that all save data from the demo carries over to the full version, so you can give the trial your all and not worry about having to do it all again. Ahh, bliss.

It's a lot of fun for people who enjoy ye olde PS1 aesthetics and foggy throwback horror. The 2024 showcase was supposed to happen in time for Halloween, the night when the spirits of old platformer mascots rise from their graves to gift polygons to small children. But it was postponed due to technical problems. Only now has the 2-hour showcase of game trailers emerged, culminating in a new Haunted PS1 demo disc packed with upcoming games. "The curse," say the organisers, "is lifted."

Not that anyone should need the lingering threat of getting served a McLungButter to be polite to service workers, but it seems good to have the option. Possibly spurred on by reality-challenged goblins hounding Final Fantasy 7 Remake Aerith actor Brianna White, Square Enix have shared a new policy outlining how they plan to respond to harassment from customers toward their staff and partners. It's obviously a vastly more proper and legally sound approach than the aforementioned sandwich tampering, but I support it nonetheless.

It's a great premise, honestly. The slate wiped clean, what if you got to be mates with everyone from all sides in this grand ensemble tale of warring states? A battle might take eight minutes. The three consecutive bonding cutscenes before the next might take ten. Origins is just as much about fighting thousands at a time as it is about eating lunch with Zhang Fei or discussing the meaning of heroism with Zhou Yu. There's a parallel story about your character and his role in a magical order of destiny godlings I didn't find the least bit interesting, but the rest is thrilling because Romance is already thrilling. The parts that Origins bogs down with its wordier take on already wordy source material are enlivened again by anime vibrance, hijinks, and melodrama.

Velká studnice je to, co se dělo na hackerské konferenci CCC (Chaos Communication Conference) mezi svátky - mluvilo se tam o tom, jak se dá shodit rozvodná síť po rádiu, jak hacknout nový procesor Raspberry RP2350 a o tom jak pokračuje hackování vlaků v Polsku.


I na svět hardware jsou Strahováci připraveni. Na internetu se objevil postup, jak "snadno" vyrábět doma plošné spoje s pomocí výkonného vláknového laseru. Také se v diskuzi našel skvělý spis o tom, jak poznat falešné teploměry DS18B20 a co to vlastně znamená.


A nebojte, i na bizár může dojít. Věděli jste, že největší sériově vyráběná CRT televize váží přibližně 200 kilogramů a na světě se už ví jenom o jedné existující? A že Windows interně zkoušejí konvertovat znaky z UTF-16 do ASCII podle jejich grafické podobnosti, což vede k velkému množství elegantních exploitů?


Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 14. ledna od 20:00 (pozor, změna) minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

It's about pumping the gas pedal and wrenching the steering wheel just so, such that you lurch forward and over the obstacles, rather than tumbling backwards. It's MudRunner without the mud, with a knockabout simplicity presumably as a result of its apparently one-man development team. It launched last October but I hadn't heard of it until today, when a new map was added, and now I want to play it.

I played it for three hours today and, among the many build challenges and adventures, a small story formed around a baby pig. We named him Porky, we caged him as our pet, and in an unfortunate accident, we watched as he fell to his death from the sky island that was our home. RPS in peace, Porky.

How many befriended pigs like Porky have there been across the last several hundred hours of play? I'm not sure - dozens, hundreds - but soon such pigs might have a new form. After 15 years, Mojang are adding new types of pig to Minecraft.

The very secret goal of the column is for the guests to name every book ever written. It's a task every single one has failed miserably at with two notable exceptions. One was Dan Griliopoulos, who listed 400 books in a document before he got bored and gave up - a heroic, if ultimately futile effort. The other was Warren Spector back in November, who not only gave me the longest and most detailed reply I'd had before or since, but also followed up several times to add more books to the list.

It then cut to Majima and his crew making celebratory noises on deck. This follows last year's Infinite Wealth catching some backlash for the decision to lock the mode behind a £15/€15/$15 edition upgrade.

You'll need to link to a PlayStation Network account to play The Last Of Us Part II on PC, say Sony. The requirement was reported by Video Games Chronicle, and sure enough, the Steam page for the "Remastered" version of the third-person fungus fighter includes a footnote in the game description that confirms it in plain language - "Account for PlayStation Network required". For a lot of people this is a minor nuisance, for others it more likely means that the game won't be on sale in your country at all. Sony's reasons for enforcing the requirement remain obscure.

According to site's Indian operators, it is not possible to comply with High Court orders because a major DoodStream investor comes from Russia.

It turns out you can turn off a lot of the gore and nudity. You can also swaddle yourself in some nice, sturdy, PG-13 body armor. But you're seemingly stuck with a certain base percentage of bulging, softcore gratuitousness in both the character portrait on bottom left, and in the mildly boobulent background art of the world. I'm not sure I can put up with all that, which is a shame, because Beyond Citadel is otherwise a promising, eerie FPS that mixes ideas from 90s shooters in pretty appealing ways.

Dreams On A Pillow is a stealth adventure that tells the story of a young mother during the Nakba - the 1948 ethnic cleansing, displacement, and cultural suppression of Palestinian Arabs by Israel. As its funding campaign puts it, it’s a game about "a land full of people being made into a people without land."

Currently on show at CES 2025, it’s a prototype desktop build that uses clever geometry and an unconventional motherboard I/O layout to hide practically every single wire in the joint, for a clean design that's housed for your viewing pleasure within a four-sided glass chamber. It’s the closest PCs have come to the simple Victorian pleasures of a nice terrarium, and honestly, good on it.
The problem is that if Project Zero X’s components ever actually go on sale, there becomes a non-zero percent chance that I will come into possession of that see-through case. And there is a one hundred percent chance I will ruin it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a quiet month for video game releases, as January tends to be, but there’s at least one approaching asteroid in the shape of Space Engineers 2. Announced over the winter, it’s a spruced-up reimagining of your scientifically determined 22nd favourite space game - the hectic Second Coming of a simulation we’ve devoted 14 whole-ass features to since 2013, including a seven-part diary series featuring many a starfaring Vengabus or Wild Wild Westerly giant robot spider.
It really is high time we gave the new game some attention, then. The very first alpha launches into Steam early access on January 27th. Here’s what’s in store.

It's an idle clicker, obviously, which starts with a single button in the centre of a browser screen. The more "stimulation" you accrue through clicking, the more options become available. It escalates. And escalates. And escalates. I found that my feelings of delight grew roughly in proportion to the toll taken on my computer's processor. After 30 minutes, I was huffing and hooting like a drunken horse to a soundtrack of disintegrating laptop fans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year’s annual CPU tug-of-war was cleanly won by AMD, its obscenely fast Ryzen 7 9800X3D almost singlehandedly leaving Intel and their Core Ultra chips in a heap of mud and P.E.-spec rope. Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.
No pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.

The list in question is part of a strategy of counteracting what the US sees as the close relationship between China's armed forces and various civilian technology suppliers and research projects.
At the time of publication yesterday, a Tencent spokesperson had commented that the listing was based on a "misunderstanding". In a statement sent to RPS overnight and also published online, Tencent's chairman Ma Huateng and executive board have now said that they're prepared to get legal if the misunderstanding isn't resolved.

Their wholly owned subsidiaries including League Of Legends developers Riot Games, Path Of Exile developers Grinding Gear Games, and UK outfit Sumo Group. They own shares in everything from Epic Games through Ubisoft to Silent Hill 2 rebooters Bloober Team. Are you a game developer? Odds are that at least one percent of your body belongs to Tencent. Maybe one of your toes.
And now it turns out that Tencent are some kind of military operator, as well. Or at least, that's what the US Department of Defence would have us believe: they've just somewhat randomly added the firm to an infamous list of Chinese military companies, together with lithium-ion battery maker CATL. This potentially makes it difficult for Tencent to do business in the States, but Tencent say that it's all based on a "misunderstanding".

One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.
Now it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs. Behold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s not being spelt out overtly, but there is a whiff of Intel’s new Battlemage GPUs being pitched as what the Alchemist generation should have been. Those eventually grew into their PCIe shoes, but only after months of dial-shifting driver updates – whereas the flagship B580 promises Nvidia-besting games performance from the off. Even at such a stage in the current graphics generation (the GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 could be revealed literally tonight, at CES 2025), there is something enticing about that proposition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last time I wrote about Sonic fangame, I innocently and absent-mindedly described it as "SNES-style". This led to a social media dog-pile of an intensity typically reserved for major international banks accidentally tweeting rule34, a howl of derision that washed over me again and again while I rolled around on the floor beneath my desk, caterwauling at Graham to please please delete the whole internet, I want to start all over again. 
Let's see if we fare better this time round: Sonic Galactic is an absurdly accomplished Sonic fangame from Starteam that, broadly, imagines how the Mega Drive and Genesis platformers might have looked and felt had they been made for the Sega Saturn. There's a new demo, if you fancy trying it for yourself. Please find it here on Itch.io. Perhaps if I'd put the download link higher up the page in the other article, people would have got distracted and refrained from dunking on me so awfully.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An upcoming life sim which claims to be a competitor to Grand Theft Auto VI is continuing to amass followers and wishlists on Steam, despite the game being unmasked as a vehicle for a dodgy cryptocurrency. Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules. But it's still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original Fallout designer Tim Cain, also known for co-directing The Outer Worlds at Obsidian, has published a video responding to a player's question about why violence is the "default" path in so many big budget RPGs. That's specifically RPGs with "AAA" budgets, whatever AAA means these days. Cain is, of course, well aware that there are many RPGs from smaller teams that "evolve past the paradigm of violence being the default way in which the player interacts with the world", and that there are plenty of puzzle games, adventure games and the like in which there is no violence at all.

It is, like Dark Souls, a game about equipment and stamina management, but it finds most success as a soulslike in the sensation that you are alone somewhere bad, not able to do very much except hit horrible things in the space between them trying to hit you. It also offers notable moments of lonely, loud footsteps rebounding off cold stone tiles in the seconds after felling some giant man-bastard - one of the subgenre’s greatest un-joys.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last June, Valve’s trading card game Artifact Classic peaked at 78 players. November was a little rosier for the abandoned multiplayer game, with a monthly peak of 1,028. Then, on New Year’s Day, that number jumped to 11,900 players on Steam - its second highest concurrent besides launch. Soon after, they vanished. Who were these mysterious shufflers, flocking to the deserted, echoing halls of Valve’s disastrous flop like your mate who uses the word ‘liminal’ too much to a dead shopping center? Forbes, who first reported on the phenomena, don’t know. No one knows. Somebody might actually know but writing ‘no one knows’ makes it more dramatic. Let’s dig in.

The peals of celebration travel outward through our atmosphere, exiting the realm of Earthly sound and resonating with interstellar plasma and detritus to form a delicate ripple of comet flakes and stray photons, expanding far beyond our solar system. Where the ripple encounters larger masses, such as planets, suns and... other things, it rebounds, riding the weft of stardust back down to Earth. As it returns home, the signal is modified. Tinkered with. It acquires unsettling harmonics and a guttural undertow. By the time it re-enters our atmosphere, it has condensed to three words, which descend and shrink and spiral into your ear like an octopus entering a crevice: FEED THE MAW.

S úctou a upřímnou pokorou jsem přistoupil k aranžmá národní slovenské hymny "Nad Tatrou sa blýská" již v roce 2016. Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté "hradní" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…]]></summary>

Developers NetEase had recently doled out bans of up to 100 years to players they suspected of cheating, but in their eagerness, failed to distinguish between legitimate compatibility layers – the software that non-Windows operating systems, like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS, use to run native Windows games – and actual hacks. Per IGN, NetEase have now apologised to the affected players, and lifted the bans.

As a concept, at least, SpaceCraft seems both flavourless and oddly inclined to overplay its own familiarity. I mean, look at that title. Consider its chilly blend of functionality and punmanship. Look at that capital "C", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft. This you may do eternally, for there are thousands of planets in store.

This is the latest move to identify the operators of major manga pirate portals through U.S. federal courts. If the operators of Spoilerplus and Mangaraw are identified, they could potentially be sued in Japan.

Other notable events will see two players storming through The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild while sharing a single joypad, and an amorous attempt to clear "all romances" in Fallout: New Vegas within 30 minutes - wait, there are romance options in New Vegas?

I’m busy replaying The Suffering 2 for the sixth time to see a new 15 second cutscene that recognises which combination of morally aligned beginnings and endings I’ve picked. It reads your save from the first game and everything!". Say ‘memory card’ to a youthful, broccoli-maned Fortnite enjoyer nowadays. Go on, I dare you. You’ll be in a home before you know it.
Still, having new toys at regular intervals is one real upshot of our new live-service barrage of ephemeral novelty, perpetually flung at my dizzy eyeballs like gleaming carnival daggers at exhausted spinning wheels. Especially if they’re for the exquisite strategy of Mechabellum. Season 2 released yesterday alongside patch 1.2, bringing with it a new unit and specialist, some reworks, and lots of cosmetic bits I pretend not to care about but then get excited when I unlock a new one.

The concept for Judas is that you're trapped in a computer-run society housed aboard a colony ship, the Mayflower. The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. "Bioshock Infinite in space", we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.
In Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.

Clicked a camera button. Placed an object upon a table. They had touched things, and beyond this, they had felt them. They knew that the player could never truly be Indiana Jones, but they could be allowed to make a pretend man who sounded at least 83% like Indiana Jones do things with his hands that very much resemble the sort of things Indiana Jones might do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brendan Greene, the modder-turned-millionaire who designed battle royale game PUBG: Battlegrounds, wants to make his studio's next game a "metaverse", although he says he's wary of using the term. The project is called "Artemis" (at least for now) and you won't be seeing it any time soon. That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. 
Greene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led "multiverse of worlds" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox. He is nonetheless "full of confidence".

The latest trailer is a series of sweeping yet intimate, colourful urban cross-sections, showing dozens of NPCs selling fish, shaking hands on balconies, shouldering barrels, dancing with fans, honing their feng shui, and various other pursuits that allegedly form part of full NPC life simulations. It's like scrutinising a Hitman level from above, except that all of these people have evolving relationships and sleeping patterns and they might hunt you down if you murder any of their relatives. Me, I just want to play Where's Wally.

The TV companies are now taking legal action against UK ISPs; they're unlikely to put up a fight, they may not even turn up in court.

The newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel "Seith" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven't updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as "Ghost Of A Tail" is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unlike a lot of the team I'd imagine, my opinion is this: I thought the year was quite middling for games. Or at least, it was middling for my own personal taste, which is quite unsavoury at the best of times. Most of my best picks made it into the calendar proper, but a couple didn't. One I hadn't even played properly until after the vote, and the other? The other is a flawed pick, but one that I couldn't stop thinking about.
Anyway, hope you all have a restful Xmas folks and a cracking new year. I hope Santa bought you some nice warm socks or a chocolate orange so dense, you could tee it off at your local golf club.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm quite proud of the delights that we packed behind each door of the Advent Calendar this year, to be honest. All my major choices are in there, plus a few more that I haven't played but I'd watched other people play, and had a swell time doing so. Still, there are always a handful that don't quite make the cut, but still deserve a heaped Christmas plateful of praise at year's end. So here's my selection box, my bonus games of the year for 2024. It's an unusually diverse triad this time.

Point being, I can present to you my almost-made-it picks without malice nor bitterness, unlike my loser colleagues who didn’t get as many in the main list. Nyeh nyeh.

As long as I get to be immersed in an adventure. I think that's the big theme of my selection box: being grounded within my player character. I want to feel what it's like to hike through canyons with too much sellable loot in my backpack. I want to park my soul in the head of a scared Scotsman way out of his depth, hundreds of miles from shore. The closer I can comfortably fit in my character's shoes, the more I seem to buy into the world they inhabit. Even if that world is constantly glowing a magnificent crimson.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. 


So! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town. And he’s brought a gift with him. Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.
