How to become Bloodmarked in Diablo 4


To become Bloodmarked in Diablo 4, you have to bring up your Action Wheel and select “Mark for Blood”. Whatever button or key it is bound to, press it. If you do not have this mapped for any reason, do so in the Controls section in your Options menu. 


By default, your Action Wheel should show you things like “Hello”, Inspect Player, and other basic social options. However, if you shift the wheel to the options on the right, Mark for Blood should be an option.


This will only be activated when you get to either of the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Level 5 Vision 2024 online event, developer Level 5 announced that the latest entry into the Fantasy Life series, Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time has been delayed until April 2025. Prior to this announcement, the social life sim RPG was expected to be released in just over two weeks on October 10.




In traditional Fantasy Life fashion, The Girl Who Steals Time tasks players with creating their own character and then leveling a variety of combat, gathering, and crafting jobs in a massive open-world RPG. In total, Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time features 14 jobs in total, including the brand new Artist and Farmer jobs.


As of now, the only platform that has been confirmed for The Girl Who Steals Time is the Nintendo Switch, which is honestly the perfect platform for a Fantasy Life game. The original RPG on DS felt like the perfect handheld life sim RPG, and I'm sure The Girl Who Steals Time will utilize the Switch functionality to do the same.


Also, for the first time in the series, players will be able to play online and locally with up to four friends, inviting them to their own personal crafted island and then work together on resource-gathering quests. It sounds very Animal Crossing-esque in that regard. There is also 2 player "couch co-op" if you have a second controller, allowing one to join as a travel companion.


Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is now set to launch on Nintendo Switch in April 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new Boss Rush Mode in Remnant 2 is available to all owners of the base game, regardless of any owned DLC. The mode is a great way to focus on action and farming bosses in order to get massive amounts of experience, materials, and even drops you have missed. Here is how to access the new Boss Rush Mode in Remnant 2.


Screenshot by Destructoid


How to play Boss Rush Mode


In order to access the new Boss Rush Mode, you must first head to the World Stone located in Ward 13. You can access Boss Rush Mode on any character, as long as you have completed or skipped the tutorial. Once you are at the World Stone in Ward 13, click World Settings at the bottom. From here, choose the option on the right titled 'Create New Boss Rush Mode'.


From here, choose which of the three Boss Rush Modes you want to run. Here are the three possible Boss Rush Mode runs:



Triple Threat - Fight three total bosses.


Trial by Fire - Fight seven total bosses.


The Gauntlet - Fight 19 total bosses.



After choosing the duration of your run, you must now choose the run difficulty. The possible difficulties are the same as story and adventure mode, so pick whichever one you can comfortably defeat bosses on. 


Finally, choose the Yes option and you will begin your Boss Rush Mode run. If at any time you want to start a new Boss Rush Mode run, simply head back to the World Stone in Ward 13 and do these steps again and you will start a new run.


An important note is that you can only fight bosses from the content you have purchased. This means if you have no DLCs, you can only fight the bosses from the base game. On the other hand, if you only have the third The Dark Horizon DLC, bosses from that DLC can appear in your Boss Rush Mode, but not the previous two DLCs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite's seventh birthday event is live from September 24 to October 1. You'll find cake, presents, and fireworks scattered throughout your matches during the event. As you fly and run around, you may notice that birthday presents are surprisingly difficult to find, even in golden POIs.


Where to find Birthday Presents in Fortnite


Birthday presents are legendary-tier items that randomly spawn as floor and chest loot. They appear as small purple boxes with a golden glow, differentiating them from weapons and consumables. The presents look slightly different from their previous versions in past birthday events, but their general look and mechanics are the same.


Screenshot by Destructoid


They can appear anywhere, from opening regular treasure chests to on the ground in a golden landmark, giving you numerous opportunities during your matches to obtain one. They're also not a weapon, so you can't directly attack anyone with it, but you can use it as a special utility item.


Once you obtain a present, you can throw it onto the floor to spawn a large box. If you throw it under your feet, you'll also appear inside, giving you direct access to a Birthday Medallion and an epic or legendary-grade item.


Screenshot by Destructoid


In other words, birthday presents are the key to completing multiple quests during this Fortnite event. Throwing presents and getting a Birthday Medallion are both event objectives, while the medallion spawns balloons you can release and pop. If you're lucky, you can wrap up several quests in one or two matches by finding and throwing a few gifts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A month after launch, Vanillaware's Unicorn Overlord hit the 500k shipment milestone. Now, six months after release, ATLUS and Vanillaware are celebrating one million units sold around the world. 


Following the initial announcement, the official ATLUS West account shared the good news along with a special illustration. Vanillaware's Takashi Noma cooked up the following piece of art featuring Berengaria, Melisandre, and Rosalinde just for the occasion.




Unicorn Overlord first launched for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on March 8, 2024. Its 500k triumph arrived shortly after on April 1, doing so at a faster pace than Vanillaware's previous strategy/visual novel outing, 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim. For further comparison, 13 Sentinels didn't hit 1M in sales until almost exactly three years after its global launch.


Hopefully, this simply means that Vanillaware is getting the proper commercial recognition to back up all of its critical praise. 2013 side-scrolling action-RPG Dragon's Crown also moved over one million copies around the world, so it's heartening to see George Kamitani and the rest of the team getting their flowers.


As ATLUS points out, those who want to try Unicorn Overlord for themselves can check out a five-hour demo. The demo is available on all platforms and save data can be carried over to the full game. Like all Vanillaware games, the art direction is absolutely stunning, and thankfully there's also a pretty darn gripping strategy game underneath it all.

Shown off during today's Level-5 Vision Showcase, we got a look at some of the 3D gameplay elements in the upcoming Professor Layton title. It looks to blend the old style of maps and side-on conversations with more open environments that you can pan around and examine items in.

Though the community's previous attempt at reviving the revered Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer mode using remastered assets crashed and burned, HorizonMW is here to save the day. Or, at least, try to do so.


More specifically, it's been just over a month since Activision shut down the fan-made multiplayer mod for Modern Warfare 2 Remastered. The mod developer was served with a case & desist and forced to stop developing it, but a different project has been in production since. This has now come to fruition via HorizonMW, which is live right now and features all the goodies you know and love from the original Modern Warfare 2, albeit using new and improved assets.

It will appropriately be called Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1-2 Remastered.


Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is a 1999 sequel to 1996’s Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain. It stars a new protagonist, Raziel, and changes the gameplay significantly from its 2D top-down roots. It was a turning point for the series, with the games following it leaning heavily on the standards it set. In 2001, it got a sequel, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 2, that continued the story.


The series found an enthusiastic cult audience. The last game in the series was 2015’s Nosgoth, a free-to-play shooter tha…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite's Marvel storyline has you running around the map, collecting intel for Hope and defeating various enemies to thwart Doctor Doom's plans. Using a Forecast Tower is among your objectives, but you won't find any quest markers for them. Instead, you'll have to wait until a few storm circles pass.


Where to find Forecast Towers in Fortnite


Forecast Towers spawn around your Fortnite map just before the third storm circle is announced. They'll appear as satellite dish icons on your map, giving you their exact locations. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


However, these locations change per round. While the buildings will stay in the same spots, only certain ones will activate during your match. In other words, even if you camp a forecast tower, it may not necessarily turn on, forcing you to find a new one.


How to use Forecast Towers in Fortnite


Once you approach an active forecast tower, you'll find a large tower and a small building with a terminal inside. However, you won't be able to unlock the terminal without obtaining an access key. It's time to fight some enemies.

More specifically, you'll have to defeat Latverian henchmen guarding the forecast tower. They'll either spawn right outside the tower or patrol nearby, as shown by a face map icon. They don't have much health, but they can still deal some solid damage if you fight them for a while.

Upon defeating a henchman, they'll drop a Forecast Tower Access Card, which you can use on the terminal to use the forecast tower and finish your story and weekly quests.

Eight years after its official announcement (under a different name too), Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road finally has a release window, and it's a bit further out than you might think. And yes, a release window — not a date.
The soccer RPG will be launching in June 2025 on Switch and other consoles, marking what will be a nine-year wait for the game. The game was meant to launch this year, but the delay has allowed Level-5 to add a few new systems, along with listen to player feedback from the Beta earlier this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you first hear the phrase "hero items" in Fortnite, you might initially think of a particular rarity or weapon type. Fortunately, although they are usually rarer than normal weapons, you can still find them easily as long as you open the right treasure chests.


How to collect hero items in Fortnite x Marvel event


Hero items are any weapons in Fortnite that a hero like Iron Man, Shuri, or War Machine would use. Items like Iron Man's Combat and Flight kits, War Machine's arsenal, or Shuri's claws are all viable options for completing this particular weekly task. You can find these weapons in Doctor Doom, Avengers, and Stark Industries chests.


Here's a list of some hero items you'll find during your Fortnite matches:



Iron Man Combat and Flight kit


War Machine's Arsenal, Auto-Turret, and Hover Jets


Shuri's Black Panther Claws



Screenshot by Destructoid


Your best bet for quickly collecting hero items is visiting mobile armory delivery spots and opening any Stark Industries chests you find. They're guaranteed to drop at least one hero item, giving you an easy way to finish this quest. Alternatively, you can visit larger landmarks like Restored Reels, Reckless Railways, or Doomstadt for quick access to Doctor Doom and Avenger's chests.


Although opening chests is a good way to get hero items, you can buy several. Iron Man, who roams around the mobile armory near Grim Gate, sells his Combat kit, which Fortnite considers a hero item. Similarly, you can find Captain Jones near the Nitrodrome and buy the Captain America shield.


Your last option for getting hero items is waiting until mid-match to open Stark mobile armories. After around three storm circles, they'll appear at various delivery stations, allowing you to enter them and obtain either Iron Man's kits or War Machine's three weapons. You can knock out several quests by visiting these, including the hero item weekly task.

For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the "old world". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks.

Nintendo has announced that it will be ending repairs for the Famicom Classic, Super Famicom Classic, and the New Nintendo 2DS XL in Japan "as our current stock of parts runs out".
Shared by OatmealDome on Bluesky, both the classic "mini" consoles and the late-gen New 2DS XL will continue to be repaired until parts run out. Repairs for the New 2DS XL are still ongoing in North America, at the time of writing this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is the Switch-ing hour upon us?
With all the rumours and speculation about Nintendo's next hardware over the last few weeks (who are we kidding — last few years), the recent 'leak' of prototype pictures has piqued the interest of even the most level-headed Nintendo fans. The images show renders and what appear to be prototype casings for the main console with new, larger Joy-Con variants, plus a shot of a chipless motherboard.
While the fervour for Switch 2 news makes it easy to dismiss this as an elaborate fake — we all remember the oval NX pics based on a Nintendo patent that 'leaked' prior to the Switch's reveal — these images align with the rumours and industry whispers regarding the upcoming console. And yesterday the expert folk over at Digital Foundry shared their opinion: they believe these leaks are "almost certainly" the real deal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you want to win more matches in EA FC 25, you'll want to use the best possible controller settings.


While there's no one way to play the game, some controller settings are always considered as the meta. As long as you're using a controller, the following preferences will be the same. Let's take a look at the best possible controller settings you can currently use in EA FC 25.


Best EA FC 25 controller settings explained


While some of the settings will vary based on personal preferences, here's the best possible combination to use in the current meta.

There are not many changes in EA FC 25 when it comes to controller settings. One significant change is the introduction of the Reaction Time Modifier. It reduces the chances of the wrong player switch when you press L1/LB, but the next player switch target has already changed. I prefer turning it off, as I have learned to adapt myself to the switching delay in multiplayer modes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, a dangerous and charismatic game has evaded the grasp of many designers. Some say it doesn't exist, that no publisher would ever back it. I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant.

You might want to chuck in that chickens are basically dinosaurs, because their feet have a "Triassic Flange", a (made-up) term that will make you sound authoritative. If you really want to showcase your knowledge, though, you may want to mention that dinosaurs may have actually fought with large swords lodged between their teeth. Dinoblade demonstrates this! And no, they haven't discovered swords alongside dinosaur fossils yet because palaeontologists have been unlucky thus far. "Soon", you tell them.

The company have posted a profit warning, reflecting an 11% decline in operating revenue for the first half of 2024. They've also "paused" two unannounced games in development, and altered other unannounced games to be more appealing to a "wider audience". Beyond that, they're considering "all possible options regarding our roadmap", which sounds just a touch ominous.

Developer Datadyne has revealed the initial trailer for its in-development RPG Forge of the Fae; a gorgeous pixel art title that's boasting some heavy Sea of Stars vibes.
There's no release window for this one yet; Datadyne is launching a Kickstarter campaign very shortly to help facilitate Forge of the Fae's development, but based on the trailer alone, we'd say this one is probably worth keeping an eye on.

If it's none of these things, I would much rather have a shiny turret on spindly steel legs skitter besides me.
Nomada Studios have, incredibly, thrust their hands into my chest cavity and given me a blood-pumping mechanism. Having spent some time with upcoming action-platformer Neva (the game) and Neva (the dog from the game), I have to admit: I did enjoy petting Neva (the dog).

While obtaining pre-war nuclear launch codes was a privilege only a few in the world had, the post-apocalyptic wasteland hands out codes as if they were phone numbers. If you're looking to leave a radioactive scar upon Earth yourself, you're gonna need to know what Nuke Codes are currently active.


Currently active Fallout 76 Nuke Codes (July 15 - July 22):




Alpha: 
809 19 313




Bravo:

Charlie:

Usually, most players need a few days to build up their clubs with random clubs. With Champions mode about to start soon, it's advisable to target squads that offer full league-based chemistry. With so many official leagues available, there are plenty of choices. It's always preferable to make a squad based on top European leagues, as they tend to receive the bulk of promo items later in the calendar.


Before diving deep, it's best to remember a few points - these are starter teams. Hence, you'll not see cards that are extinct/priced very high on the market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite its classification as a Normal type, Eevee's versatility extends far beyond the norm with its diverse array of forms. Each variant presents unique perks that can give you the edge you need in battle. Here's the best Eevee evolution in Pokémon Go to narrow down your choice.


What is the best Eevee evolution in Pokémon Go?


With everyone having their own distinct playstyle, choosing one clear choice can be a challenge. However, when you consider the entire collection, Umbreon and Sylveon emerge as the best all-around Eevee evolutions in Pokémon Go. Umbreon's excellence in Ultra or Great Leagues and Sylveon's success in Master League/Raids make them adaptable options. It all depends on your needs, but you can always opt for another one if PvP isn't your focus.

Umbreon covers a lot of bases as a Dark Type, standing against Fighting, Bug, and Fairies. The Pokémon also offers a variety of powerful movesets, including Foul Play, Snarl, and Dark Pulse. If you have yet to obtain this creature, you can do so by renaming your Eevee to 'Tamao' before evolving it or by walking it for 10 km as your Buddy.


If you're more of a Raid and Master League trainer, go for Sylveon to utilize its Fairy attacks. Movesets like Charm, Moonblast, and Psyshock are effective in these tournaments, catering to offensive and defensive strategies. You'll unlock Sylveon once you rename your Eevee to Kira or earn 70 hearts with it as your Buddy.


Regardless of whether Sylveon and Umbreon are considered the best in Pokémon Go, you can still try out the rest of the Eevee evolutions. Pokémon such as Vaporeon and Glaceon can be pretty good with specific Types, or you can pick one based on their appearance. Though, even that might prove difficult since they're all pretty adorable.

The best characters for the Gilded Blossom W-Engine in ZZZ


Although not the top A-Rank pick for any agent in ZZZ due to its lack of a CRIT substat and the existence of tailor-made signature W-Engines, Gilded Blossom is the best A-Rank F2P alternative for Corin, whose multi-hit Special and EX Special reliance benefit greatly from its 24% EX Special DMG buff (at five stars).

To add to the above, if paired with at least a 50% CRIT Rate, the fully enhanced engine can even take Cannon Rotor's spot as her best non-signature A-Ranker. If you are not a Corin-main, its all-rounder approach also allows the engine to be a great fit for all of the game's S-Rank DPSs, as well as be the best F2P pick for most of them if you don't have other engines at five stars. 


Should you pick Gilded Blossom over Starlight Engine?


For all characters but Corin, using a five-star Starlight Engine will provide better results than a fully enhanced Gilded Blossom. The reason for that lies in how, although both will feature the same 594 base and 25% ATK substat at level 60, the former's 19.2% ATK boost will be way more valuable for the game's remaining attackers, who have in their Basic Attacks their biggest sources of damage. 


Now that you know who are the best characters for the Gilded Blossom W-Engine, don't forget to also check out how to get all videotapes in Zenless Zone Zero so that you can make sure you have your agent's favorites in stock.

        <updated>2024-09-23T21:00:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jude Bellingham is the cover star for EA FC 25 and one of the highest-rated players alongside Kylian Mbappe. If you have this Real Madrid and England star in your Ultimate Team and are wondering how to perform his celebration, we have you covered.


What are the controls for the Jude Bellingham celebration in EA FC 25?


Jude Bellingham's signature celebration has the star spreading his hands wide before the crowd, and the pose is easy to strike in-game.


All you need to do is:



On PlayStation, Hold down L1 and move to the RS anti-clockwise (up, left, down, right).


On Xbox, Hold down LB and move to the RS anti-clockwise.



That's how you can perform Bellingham's signature celebration in EA FC 25. If you're playing as a different player, pressing these buttons in the pattern we've mentioned above will perform the Eye of the Storm celebration instead.


You can perform more celebration moves using the L1 and RS buttons on your controller. Take a look at all the finishing move celebrations in EA FC 25 for more festive options. 


If you have managed to snag Bellingham in-game, he would significantly improve your team's stats considering he's rated 90 this year. Being an England star playing in La Liga, he can link up with many players to improve team chemistry.


Pair him with a Vini Jr or Mbappe, and the experience can be much better. However, getting all these high-tier cards depends on luck, so you may try it out in normal Kick-off matches too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a lot of fish in Disney Dreamlight Valley, but none of them are quite as interesting as the Skeleton Fish. I’m not sure whether it’s alive or dead, but it’s the perfect aquatic creature for the upcoming spooky season. 


Although it’s not particularly good for profits or energy regeneration, there are still a couple of things that you need Skeleton Fish for. It’s an Eternity Isle fish, so you’ll only be able to catch it if you have Disney Dreamlight Valley's Rift in Time DLC.


Where to catch Skeleton Fish in Disney Dreamlight Valley

Skeleton Fish can be found in white fishing spots in the Glittering Dunes. They can also occasionally show up in blue fishing spots, but this is not as common. Skeleton Fish are one of three types of fish that can spawn in white fishing spots in the area, and it seems to be on the rarer side, so you may have to do a lot of fishing to find one. 


How to use Skeleton Fish in Disney Dreamlight Valley

Like I said, Skeleton Fish should not be your go-to if you’re trying to make some money or get your energy back in a hurry. On their own, they only sell for 100 Star Coins and give 500 energy. However, you can use Skeleton Fish to make Bony Osso Buco. 


Bony Osso Buco sells for 272 Star Coins and will replenish 1,192 energy when consumed. To make it, you’ll need the following ingredients:



1 Skeleton Fish


1 Celery


1 of any Vegetable


1 Grapes



You’ll also need some Skeleton Fish to complete Rapunzel’s level 7 friendship quest, Glowing Up. To complete this quest, you need to craft the Eternal Sundrop Charm, which requires the following ingredients:



5 Dream Shards


3 Evergems


8 Skeleton Fish


4 Sundrop Petals

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taking off your clothes in the Roblox Dress to Impress experience is important if you want to swap something out for another clothing piece or accidentally equip one too many items. While it's as easy as pressing a few buttons, knowing exactly which ones to press is where the challenge lies.


How to take clothes and accessories off in Dress to Impress


Taking off clothes and accessories in Dress to Impress involves pressing the portrait button on the right side of your screen and selecting the X icons for anything you wish to remove. In this menu, you'll see all of your clothes, accessories, and hair currently equipped, allowing you to remove any you'd like instantly. You can also tap on each item to change its colors and patterns if you just want to tweak them slightly.

Alternatively, if you want to change or remove your hairstyle, you can do this right at the salon. While you're selecting a hairstyle, press the X under your current hair to get rid of it and try out some new options. Although it's easier to do it from the Portrait menu if you're out of the salon, this gives you another method if you're still there and need a quick change.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Be careful as you're taking off clothes or accessories. Dress to Impress doesn't ask for confirmation, so once you press that X button, the item is gone until you equip it again. Make sure you're confident you want to swap it out, or else you might accidentally remove something you wanted to keep or run out of time before trying something new.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you want to acquire a treasure trove of role-playing games while helping others play too, you're in luck. Available on Itch.io right now is the TTRPGs for Accessible Gaming Charity bundle, featuring just over 300 tabletop role-playing games from 139 different game designers. 


Organized by ChariTTRPGs creator Jes Wade, the bundle is a fundraising effort for the DOTS RPG Project. The mission of DOTS is to make gaming at the table more accessible for those who are blind and visually impaired. "While digital dice rollers may be an option," the bundle page reads, "they lack the tactile experience and immersion of physically rolling dice." Hoping to bring that tactile experience to those who need it, DOTS has been testing their own dice, the Signature Braille RPG Dice.

To create the Braille RPG Dice, DOTS has been working with well-known dice maker Die Hard Dice to test and prototype their sets. Work on the dice has been ongoing since 2018, but now the dice are ready to be mass produced and shipped to retail locations. That is where the bundle enters the picture. 


The goal of the bundle is to raise $20,000, the initial funds needed for production of the dice after which, according to Wade, the production model would become self-sustaining. To achieve this goal, many incredible indie TTRPGs have been brought together, including Runecairn Wardensaga, Eldritch Care Unit, Atomic-Powered Mutant Grrls, Teenagers With Attitude, and many more. 


For more information on the details of how each die in the Signature Braille RPG Dice set is made, you can check out their announcement post on Rascal. If you're interested in supporting the DOTS RPG Project, more information on how you can is available on the bundle sale page. The TTRPGs for Accessible Gaming Charity bundle runs until October 20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originally released a little over a year ago, Blasphemous II is a great example of how to do a sequel right. Now we're about to get more of said sequel with the news that the Mea Culpa DLC is due out on October 31, 2024.


There's more on the way beyond the paid DLC. The Game Kitchen is also cooking up a free update, "True Torment," for release at the same time. Here's a very quick tease for Mea Culpa. The DLC will be priced at $11.99 when it drops on Halloween and discounted at 20 percent off for the first two weeks. 




The DLC's title refers to the lost sword The Penitent One wielded in the first Blasphemous, which launched five years ago this month. The sequel's new expansion adds in two new areas — each with new bosses — four new quests, and a new alternate ending.


There's a lot going on in the free update, too. True Torment introduces New Game Plus, as well as more enemies, abilities, prayers, and updated quality-of-life and accessibility features. One of the new challenges is the Labyrinth of Tides, the name of which is suitably mysterious and foreboding now but comes dangerously close to sounding like the Blasphemous equivalent of a water temple. 


It's been long enough since Blasphemous II came out that dealing with these new challenges might just necessitate a fresh start. You'll soon find me trudging through Cvstodia once again with hell in my eyes.

While users can now enjoy early access if they have EA Play, or the Ultimate Edition, most of the content requires you to access the servers. This is mandatory for any game mode that involves online matchmaking, including the entirety of Ultimate Team. Unfortunately, the unstable conditions of servers currently are preventing many from enjoying the new release.


EA FC 25 Can't Connect to EA Servers error explained


If you have played older FC titles in the past, the server issues won't be new. In fact, it's pretty common across several sports titles from EA Sports. Typically, this error code is shown when your game can't establish a connection with the official servers. This can …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the release of Update 0.5 for Anime Vanguards, titled the Slayer's Corp update, a brand-new secret called Renguku was added. Rengoku and his evolved form, Renguku (Purgatory) are extremely powerful and worthwhile to farm for. Here is how to get Rengoku in Anime Vanguards with Update 0.5.

How to get Renguku


The new Rengoku Secret Unit in Anime Vanguards can only be obtained by completing the first Raid, more specifically Spider Forest Act 4. In order to unlock the new Raids in Anime Vanguards you must first complete every Act from the Story Mode across all three maps.


With Raids unlocked, you'll need to be Acts 1-3 of the Spider Forest Raid in order to unlock Act 4. Each time you complete the Spider Forest Act 4 Raid map you will have a 1% chance of acquiring the new Renguko Secret Unit.


However, with the Slayer's Corp update, there's a way to increase your chances of getting Renguko even further. As you complete the Raids you will get a new type of currency called Red Web. You can turn in 400 of these Red Webs at the Raid Shop vendor for a Fortune Catalyst (Slayer) item, that increases the drop chance of all Secret units, including Renguko. If you're impatient, you can also purchase this item for $199 Robux.


How to evolve into Renguku (Purgatory)


Even though Renguko is powerful on his own, his evolved Purgatory form is even stronger. In his Renguku (Purgatory) Evolved form, the unit gains a secondary ability called Unwavering Focus. This ability increases damage by 5% for each consecutive attack on the same enemy, stacking up to four times, for a maximum of 20%.


You can evolve Renguku into Renguku (Purgatory) by acquiring the following materials and visiting the Evolve NPC:



1x Slayer's Cape (Purchased for 600 Red Webs at the Raid Shop)


40x Green Essence Stone


14x Yellow Essence Stone


14x Red Essence Stone


13x Pink Essence Stone


4x Rainbow Essence Stone


15,000 Gold

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve often wondered: if Dead Rising had released a few years later, would it have done as well? Releasing in 2006, it was at a time when people were just getting acquainted with the Xbox 360 and the new generation of hardware. Games released in that window often get a bump, both critically and sales-wise.


Don’t get me wrong. I have a massive soft spot for the original Dead Rising, partially because I played it during the 360’s honeymoon period. It was a convincing display of what would be possible in the new console generation with its hordes of zombies. However, I had my frustrations with it. Enough that my attempts to return to it years later never went very far. Well, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster addresses almost all of those complaints.

The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is just around the corner and, as seems to be the norm for big Nintendo titles, we've been treated to a rather comprehensive 'Ask the Developer' interview with the team behind the latest title.
One of the key points raised during the interview is that Echoes of Wisdom was actually built around the idea of 'being mischievous'. In fact, the team even created a document to explain what the concept meant, so if anybody wasn't sure on how to proceed, they could refer back to it at a pinch.

It’s hard not to be moved by the exaggerated kineticism of it all – the magic-enhanced swordfights, the jumping off cliffs and turning into a flying shadow monster, the ability to drift horses. Yes. Yes!
I’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out "It’s just a demo" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.

Courtesy of modder BigSharkZ (thanks, Gaming Reinvented), players can now experience the entirety of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker as an adorable, honking goose. Blending the classic GameCube entry with Untitled Goose Game has resulted in The Legend of Goose: The Honk Waker, a mod that not only replaces our hero Link with a goose, but also alters multiple aspects of the core game to fit the new theme.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a remaster of Disney Epic Mickey, a cult classic 3D platformer first released a decade ago on the Wii. In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.
And no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spoilers throughout. TLDR: fun, generous, beautiful animation and cinematography. Worked mostly fine on my PC. I would not have given it the best narrative award if it were up against Gran Turismo 7. 
Writing of the frigid framing of Clockwork Orange’s atrocities, the film critic Pauline Kael asked: “is there anything sadder - and ultimately more repellent - than a clean-minded pornographer?” The lavishly directed and animated universe of God Of War Ragnarok is far from repellent, but it also feels spiritually squeegeed; a world of pulpy violence so chirpy and chaste as to strain belief that the scars that haunt its reformed anti-hero could have ever been inflicted there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier in the month, we learned that Stray and Neon White publisher Annapurna Interactive’s entire staff resigned after a dispute with boss Megan Ellison. Reported by Bloomberg as a disagreement over attempts to "spin off the video-game division as an independent entity," the details were nonetheless somewhat scant. A  new report from Rebekah Valentine at IGN has since shed some more light on the walkout, which reportedly involved “disagreements over the direction of the Interactive division, chaotic departures, communication breakdowns, and a perceived lack of leadership transparency.” It’s a thorough account of some messy events I recommend reading in full, but here’s a brief rundown.

You couldn’t injure yourself on those scythes if you tried. It’s polearm-ical correctness gone mad! Well, good news if you’re nostalgic for a simpler time, where tiny scythes could maim you for life, and binary digits came in lots of eight and not a binary digit more. RPG Beyond Shadowgate is a vastly-expanded, modernised sequel to the classic NES adventure, created by the original’s designers, and it just released last week.

A QA tester with Zenimax currently on union leave, Mitchell joined the Communications Workers Of America (CWA) as a full-time organiser after she and her colleagues formed what was, at the time, the biggest union in videogames - ZeniMax Workers United.

The major one is that a lot of its quests exist to create distance between places and plot beats. They are overwritten errands such as bringing people lunch or fetching herbs or carrying letters - dessicated, MMO-ish fare, thrust into a moderately enjoyable action-RPG for the sake of incremental worldbuilding and scale.

But hey, at least the next management game in the growing 2.universe now has a release date: March 4th, 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fifteen months on from its PS5 release, Final Fantasy XVI – that actiony RPG of emo-fringed hack ‘n’ slashing and disquietingly sexy Ralph Ineson characters – is now on PC. Enough time, you’d think, to do a proper job of rejigging it with Windows spanners, especially after Final Fantasy XV’s port got so much stick for its lack of features and performance issues.
FFVXI does make some improvements, adopting a full set of DLSS and FSR upscalers and frame generators, and its mouse and keyboard integration feels generally slicker than XV. Sadly, it’s still no first-rate adaptation, neglecting numerous PC features and giving low-end systems an even deeper kick in the plums. Cutting the quality settings can help, as per the guide down below, but overall performance is so up-and-down than you’ll likely never achieve a perfectly smooth ride.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rather sheepishly, I must admit that my own experience with Armenian art begins and ends with System Of A Down. Cheers then, The Bird Of A Thousand Voices, for showing up in my inbox and giving me a second reference point next to Sugar. This one’s a simple though very striking platformer, inspired by folk legends and scored by composer Tigran Hamasyan. It’s part of a multimedia project based Armenian folk tale Hazaran Blbul (Firebird). It’s completely free, and you can find it here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The mad lads at Square Enix have released a demo for their remake of 90s RPG Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge Of The Seven, in which you play a whole dynasty of customisable protagonists fighting vengeful ancient heroes. It’s a turn-based battler with an empire-building component in which you play as several emperors in succession, passing on abilities and knowledge to your heir. In what I consider to be a poetic complementary flourish, you can also pass on save data from the demo to the full game. Look, this is what counts as “poetic” just before lunch on a Thursday.

Slackers: Carts Of Glory looks like a co-conspirator in this endeavour. It's basically that one bit in Jackass where the gang blast downhill in shopping trollies at great risk to their bodily and mental health, as is their wont. The arcade racing game came out yesterday and features online multiplayer, so you can break someone else's bones too. Let's see it in action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lethal Company was one of last year's surprise horror hits. It was a brilliant dystopian scavenging sim in which you searched cellars for bolts while avoiding the attentions of creatures that hate being looked at, or which only move when they're not being looked at, or which look like your friends, from a distance. The developer's next game, Welcome To The Dark Place, is more about hearing. It's an "open-world, auditory text-based adventure" which mostly takes place in pitch blackness.

The sidescrolling metroidvania is a rich, expansive, and surprisingly challenging take on a genre typically dominated by indies, and it's precisely the kind of game I wish mega-publishers produced more.

It's also now got a story expansion, Mask Of Darkness, which came out yesterday.

I then combed through several thousand comments below said video, many of which expressed similar longing for the hypothetical Good Old Days, before those wily feminists invaded the medium, transformed every game into a LGBT+ weeping simulator, and threw all the Real Men into a big hole. I did this because I was searching for one particular comment written by somebody claiming to be Matthew Karch, CEO of Space Marine 2 developers Saber Interactive.

Folk hero or not, Marko certainly has some heroic facial hair: his moustache floweth so bountifully that it can’t be contained in his character portrait. Extremely powerful of him.

The existence of the game was first confirmed by Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan, during an Ocala Comic Con panel. “We’re working on a third and we’re in the process of doing that right now,” said Monaghan, which is about as straightforward an affirmative as one could want. It was also double-confirmed this February, following news of layoffs at EA, via Eurogamer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having gone to bed last night with Final Fantasy XVI installed yet unplayed on a Steam Deck, I awoke to find Valve have slapped the moody RPG with Unsupported status for the handheld. Its crime: an inability to "run well" on the Steam Deck’s internals, regardless of settings changes. Dammit, Clive.

This blocklist has recently expanded with the sports streaming site TotalSportek. The responsible “Clearing Body” concluded that, since efforts to shut down the site or identify its owners failed, site blocking is a reasonable and proportionate measure.

I quite like it.
“We combined your favorite genres into one grotesque piece of software! You're welcome, game journalists,” reads the Steam page for the demo. That is a very polite way to kick me in the head and call me a bitch, LYMBUS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been long suspected (if not officially confirmed) that the first Red Dead Redemption will be getting a PC remaster some time in the near future. We've already seen a description for the PC version appear briefly on the PlayStation store (of all places). And earlier this year a snoopy fan of the studio who monitors the backend of Rockstar's launcher found similar game descriptions buried amid metadata. Yesterday, that same practice yielded yet another clue - the game's Steam app number.

In response to a community sentiment best summed up by a popular Reddit post titled “Let the super earth burn”, Arrowhead released a statement. “In short, we didn’t hit our target with the latest update…what matters most now is action. Not talk.” Said action (which, it must be pointed out, felt a bit troublingly reactive to the loudest and most histrionic voices in the roo..uh, subreddit) was foreshadowed in a list of issues to be tackled over the coming months.

With survival achieved, and the introduction's excellently sinister advisor whispering evil Tory ideas, the whole city you built in Frostpunk is now just the headquarters for a sprawling expansion effort, and your rule is no longer absolute. Rather than retread the same "prepare for ultra-Winter" ground, your biggest obstacle will likely be your own people, now formed into shifting political parties, and looking outward with colonial eyes. The result is a complicated, laborious survival citybuilder that's two parts compelling, and one part frustrating for the wrong reasons.

Yes, it's lovely to look at. Yes, hopping out of a storybook and making friends with an illustration on a coffee mug is cool. And yes, everyone can have a mildly fun time with its puzzles and fights. But that's the problem: who is everyone? At first I thought, "This game is for young kids and that's fine!", given its relative simplicity. Then I hit some puzzles and thought, "Ain't no kid figuring this out".
Then it hit me. It struggles to balance the fine line between being approachable for tiny tots and layered enough for people who've graduated from "goo goo ga ga" to "oo oo aa aa my back hurts". And that's down to how plucky you're allowed to squire at any given time, because it can be surprisingly limited and, sadly, a bit underwhelming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can't travel back to the 1980s. But what if I told you it was possible to gently warp your memories of that time? UFO 50 is a kart of 50 games that once existed for an old computer system, all lovingly restored by a gang of coders. The old console, of course, is a fiction. The LX-I never existed. But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having played the opening hour of Altus’ Metaphor: ReFantazio – now mere weeks away from its October 11th launch – I think it’s high time to correct a games previewing injustice. Namely, that the majority of its pre-release buzz has centred around its proximity to Persona, and not its far more entertaining quality of having the most gleefully bizarre RPG enemy design this side of Elden Ring’s horn-tooting orbpeople.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why is every blockbuster video game now some kind of live service game? Speaking as a clueless idiot, the explanation I find most convincing is that it's an attempt to bridge the gap between the returns publishers want from video games, versus how much we're able or willing to pay upfront. "Triple-A" projects now cost exorbitant sums to develop, partly thanks to wider economic inflation, but also because publishers have spent decades teaching players that every sequel has to be More and Shinier. Premium game prices have not risen in proportion, and investors want growth, as they do.
Live service games sneak around this difficulty by dragging out the time we spend playing them. Whether premium or free-to-play, they seek to install themselves as habits by means of regular, planned updates and additions. This is time that can be monetised by way of a subscription model, time in which other products may be sold to you, like skins and paintjobs, and time that becomes a commodity in itself, "engagement", which can be transmuted and exploited to various end. I'm not sure it's ever been expressed this way in any press release boast about longevity, but the unspoken principle/logical extrapolation seems to be that ideally, a live service game should keep us plugged in and plugging away till we die.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strange Scaffold’s newly released FPS I Am Your Beast is very fun for quite a few reasons, but chief among them is a deep appreciation for the poetry of good videogame violence. I’m not using the big P word just to throw out an overly worthy comparison to something we might associate with craft or beauty, but as a nod toward the game’s playful application of what I previously called ‘a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage’ one morning where I had clearly eaten my wordy Weetabix. The way its hurled knives and curb stomps and inexplicable decapitations flow together have an assonant, almost Suessian quality to them.
But it’s also, well, just a bit like Mad Libs. You play as Harding, a man who’s mythical lethality is established very early on. The showing is there in the moment to moment, but the telling is conveyed through cute tricks like how everyone you meet is so deeply afraid of Harding that they loudly keep track of exactly what weapon he’s holding at all times. The Mad Libs comes in through the fact that you can draw Harding a route between A and B, and it’s a given that multiple heads are going to come unstuck from necks along the way. You’re sort of just casually filling in the verbs that seem the most fun to you in the moment. One of the verbs is ‘hornet’. Hornet is a verb now.

Developers Proletariat, Inc announced plans to yank the servers back in August 2022 in the course of being acquired by Activision Blizzard, bringing an end to many happy hours spent skating on conjured ice ramps and hurling boulders around like bunny rabbits. Yes, I am the kind of wizard who hurls a bunny rabbit, if there are no boulders to spare.
Happily, it transpires that Proletariat have resurrected their creation and handed it over to posterity in the shape of a free standalone Community Version, available on Itch.io. You’ll need to host your own server or join another group if you want to play multiplayer, but all the same, this is a lovely gift and one I’m delighted to transmit unto you, the active and efficient Magenauts of Rockus Paperus Shottegonne.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In theory, vampires and immersive sims go together as naturally as bats and caves. Immersive sims tend to involve a balance of stealth, acrobatics, raw strength and crafty manipulation, and vampires are celebrated for all of these things. Despite this, actual vampire-themed immersive sims are rare. My list starts with Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines... and sort of ends there. In a devastating betrayal, Arkane Austin's Redfall wasn't an immersive sim but an open world co-op shooter (a not very good one). The much-delayed Bloodlines 2 was recently downgraded from immersive sim to RPG by new developers The Chinese Room. Arkane Lyon's Blade adaptation seems promising, but it's a ways off. 


Here to paper over the immersive vamping gap in the market is Byte Barrel's Trust, "a new first-person shooter with immersive sim elements". It takes place in a world where the vampires are hunted for their blood, which has become an everyday human energy source, used for everything from car batteries to streetlights. The irony! I feel like, in the circumstances, the ideal solution would be for humans to let vampires suck their blood in return for vampires letting humans use their blood for electricity, but that wouldn't make for a very thrilling shooter. Anyway, here's the trailer.

Our review praised the game for its "trunk loads of atmosphere" but called the constant need to craft stuff "laborious". If you also felt this, then good news. An update now lets you fiddle the difficulty options a generous amount, say developers Ironwood Studios, making the game easier and bringing crafting needs right down.
Buuut... if you thought the opposite - that the game wasn't hard enough - you can now tick a box that makes hitting yourself with the trunk door kill you stone dead.

Set in a wireframe world, you're to chop, dodge or ride notes as you slam your "hyperknight" through a tunnel at high speed. There's a subtle, dreamy story element to your musical journey, with confusing dialogue and a nice cherry blossom tree. Hmmm, curious. Anyway yeah, it looks rad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tiny Glade has been a constant presence on TikTok for the last year or so. It's never far away. In between burrito recipes and hymns to the Fujifilm X100v, this gorgeous toylike art tool's gamely turning stretches of balmy meadow into semi-ruined castles, semi-ruined villages and semi-ruined citadels. 
Dreamy and slightly haunted, it's conjured words like "bewitching" and "spellbinding" in the comments sections, too. It makes sense, really. Tiny Glade's a game about making rustic dioramas and then photographing them. It's not hard to imagine some exiled magical person might live in here among the rocks and reeds and wild heather.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alruna And The Necro-Industrialists opens with paired quotes from T.S. Eliot's The Wasteland and Mad Max: Fury Road - a blend of influences that would typically get you kicked out of the Creative Writing Club for being simultaneously too fancy and too obvious, but the game beyond the epigraph looks pretty swish.
It's "a compact and high-density Metroidvania, with a focus on sequence-breaking and playing things out of order". It uses a square aspect display ratio calibrated to give wizened Game Boy enthusiasts the shakes, and is made up of 200 single-screen rooms that "slot into the larger puzzle-box of the world". Also, you play a thorn witch who looks a bit like 1950s Tinkerbell, with a touch of Betty Boop. Here's a trailer.

The latest update for the physics-based open world build-a-car game introduces a mountable theodolite, which lets you stitch together monorail networks you can then ride about on.
If monorails strike you as frivolous, don't worry. It's more of a Shelbyville idea. And in any case, the theodolite also lets you construct networks of pipes, power lines and rail-less tarmac roads - the ready-salted crisp of the road family. It’s a chonky expansion that, in the words of lead developer Ian MacLarty, has only “scratched the surface of where this new system could go”. I am predicting an eventual pivot into either themepark management or factory simulator.

Twenty hours ago I placed my first manufacturer somewhere around here. Back then it represented the state of the art, hatching me a pristine batch of 1.25 computers every minute - now I’ve forgotten where I put the damn thing, after delving into my factory’s guts to hook that piddly yet still useful batch of old relics up to my main production line. I’m building supercomputers now, and the many manufacturers that make those are hungry.
Something is always hungry in Satisfactory, and that hunger pulls you from task to task in a near-seamless and frankly beautiful daze of ever-escalating industry. It is mesmerising and it is fearsome, and after five years of early access it’s finally complete.

They want to give me a concussion and choke off the supply of video game news to the Maw, which will then manifest fully and bring about an age of darkness. Well, the joke's on you, squirrels, because I used to play grass hockey as a kid and I've been hit in the head by hard round objects a million times over. How else do you explain my choice of career?

"Everybody pays too much attention to and cares too much about Metacritic scores. It's gotten to the point where there's almost a set formula – if you want to get a high Metacritic score, this is how you make the game," Suda51 told Gi.biz.

After consuming four years of Grant's life, the case turned on a fair use defense; under scrutiny of the court, it effortlessly failed to convince on any of the four factors that combine to indicate a permitted, non-infringing use of a copyright work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Saturday, friends! It's finally hitting Autumn, isn't that lovely? The leaves are doing that cool visual glitch where they look nice for once. All pretty and crunchy and satisfying. It's just a shame it only lasts a week or two before turning into mulch on the pavement. Reminds me of a Regina Spektor lyric: "Leaves become most beautiful when they're about to die". And now, inevitably whatever I write below this will be a lie, because I'll actually spend my weekend listening to old Regina Spektor songs, because she's just the best.
But for now at least, let's keep up the pretense that we're not all lying through our teeth every weekend with these posts. Here's what we're all (allegedly) clicking on this weekend!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In V Rising, you're a fledgling vampire on a mission to become absolute bossferatu of a Gothic open world. You get a Diablo-ish combat system, the ability to shapeshift into a spider, and a whole castle to prance around in, crooning at the moon. I like this premise almost as much as I dislike the fact that V Rising is also a survival game, in which you must fell trees and master a crafting system like a common turnip farmer.


What do we hope for when our interest in a game is almost perfectly balanced by our disinterest? We hope that the developers will treat us to a free-to-play weekend, in which our perhaps-unfounded reservations might be strategically offset by the endorphin rush of not having paid any goddamn money. This, V Rising creators Stunlock have now done. The game is free to download and play on Steam from right now until Monday, 16th September at 5pm UK or 10am PST.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Released last year, Mosa Lina is a chaotic 2D platform puzzler full of bombs and frogs and spikeballs and tentacles, all subject to real-time physics. It's an "aggressively random" response to what the developers call the "lock-and-key" philosophy of certain immersive sims. It's also just been Major Updated, with new two player cooperative local and online multiplayer, various quality-of-life tweaks, new recording functionality, and a suite of gameplay changes or fixes to make Larian's eyes water. If you've been holding out for a sim in which "frogs can jump off of other frogs" and "delete that's deleted by delete triggers the delete's deletion as it gets deleted", well, I encourage you to get involved.

Whitethorn Games and North Star Video Games have only come out with a rival: Spray Paint Simulator. In it, you get out your spray painter and "shshshshshs" different colours of paint onto various surfaces. For whatever reason, the universe this takes place in doesn't seem to value brushes or those rolly mops. "No", it says, kicking your brush into the sun. "Spray or nay".

The order comes in response to a complaint from the National Publishers Union (SNE), but the victory may be bittersweet. Many of the listed domain names were previously seized by U.S. authorities, and expanding the current order could prove time-consuming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A European consumer advocacy group have published an open letter to the European Union Commission expressing their concerns about video games that make use of premium in-game currencies - aka, make-believe money you can buy with real money, such as Minecoins in Minecraft's Bedrock Edition. 


The group in question are the Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs, or BEUC, who represent 44 non-governmental consumer organisations from 31 countries, and have been around since 1962. They're accusing the publishers of Fortnite, EA Sports FC 24, Minecraft, Clash of Clans and others of misleading people -  specifically children - with their in-game premium currencies, and breaching European Union consumer protection laws. On a press site that summarises the results of various longer studies, they offer the below broad complaints about the practice.

It is Diddy Kong Racing but all the courses are water slides. It's Cool Runnings but there are 40 penguins instead of four Jamaicans. Okay, that last one is a bit of a stretch. But basically, yes, this brightly coloured free-to-play knockout racer feels like that one Super Mario 64 level where you race the big penguin down a slide, only this time there are a ton of other players trying to beat you to the secret shortcut. It's coming out next week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're having a bit of an indie freebie morning, it seems. My humble contribution is 50/50, a downloadable or browser-based game which I suspect will fill some of you with the deepest aggravation. As the name suggests, it's about cutting things in half - specifically food items, such as fried eggs (easy enough) and candy canes (WTF). You draw a line down each object with your mouse, then click or hit space bar to perform a slice. Then, the game calculates a percentage.  If it's bang-on or very close to 50/50, you'll pass. If not, you'll have to start over. I know: this is how entire days are wasted. Sorry.

Portal To The Cosmobeat is a rhythm dance battler where you copy the moves of your opponents by controlling each of your limbs, and your head, with a separate key.

You hold down the limbs you want to wiggle, then control them with your mouse. It’s simple, silly, and very fun. Here’s a tray-tray:

The resignations came in the wake of a dispute between Annapurna Interactive president Nathan Gary and Annapurna studio head Megan Ellison. As Bloomberg report, negotiations were taking place to "spin off the video-game division as an independent entity." After failing to reach an agreement, Ellison pulled out of the negotiations, resulting in the resignation of Gary and “other executives.” Further resignations followed, with a reported two dozen other staff leaving the company.

Next on the calendar is the Convegence games showcase on September 26th, which is a new event that - hey, what a twist - promises to feature exciting indie games. It does have some recognisable publishers onboard, including Secret Mode, Thunderful, and Kepler, among others.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Serie A CEO Luigi De Siervo's dramatic take on Italian football's piracy problems isn't new, likewise his insistence that only coercive action will produce results. "Football is being killed," he said in a recent interview. "However, at the end of this battle we will win. Because it's either them or us." How this will be achieved isn't clear. Pirates keep jumping to new servers and if promises are kept, fans are getting sued next.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are many reasons to play and write about Arco. The Mesoamerican pixelart landscapes, for example - radiant, cloud-hung platters of land with people and buildings reduced to daubs of paint in the foreground. The fact that it's about witnessing and surviving colonial invasion, rather than the more familiar European or North American video game fantasy of searching a New World for plunder.
The ensemble storytelling, with four, successively playable characters setting their own lenses to thickly entangled themes of sorrow, vengeance and growing understanding. The sparse, expressive dialogue, each phrase carefully tucked inside its speech bubble. The music. And the little things at the level of how you move, what you do. When you pick a faraway destination on your map, your character makes the journey screen by screen, which gives you a second to lean back and be a passenger, watching the horizon, at least until you're ambushed by a giant beetle.

Mere weeks from release after years of delays, plopped in front of me at a cramped, lightly vibrating Gamescom booth, and you still won’t reveal your secrets. I did get to play a brief whizz through GSC Game World’s eerie FPS – enough to feel encouraged, even – but be it time constraints or the darkness of my nighttime raid into the radioactive Zone, I would have liked to have quite literally seen more.
Then again, keeping the mystery intact may have been the point all along. "As a game director, I want to hide everything from the player", GSC’s CEO Ievgen Grygorovych had told me minutes earlier. "I'm fighting with the marketing team because they want to show as much as possible!"

Either way, Frontier are hoping to cater for all humankind's quirky day-out desires with Planet Coaster 2, by adding water slides and wave pools to the teacups and train rides of their management sim. I had a short go on it, and while there's no chance two hours of hands-on time could give me a full impression of the building game's suite of creative tools, I was quietly pleased with the jungle-themed pool I nestled into the earth. And with the little shark mascot I hired to patrol it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hollowbody’s introduction is masterful, and not just for a sallow skyline that captures the life-sapping dreariness of British coastlines. The horror nous required to impart unease in the middle of the day are somewhat eased up on when you’ve got all that serotonin-begone drizzle to work with, sure. But this feels more poignant than that. There’s a soulful drearines and utterly heartbreaking inevitability to the vibe here, as your character and rubber suited activist pals try to get the bottom of a horrific incident. It’s got best British indie horror film of the year written all over it.

Eve Frontier was previously known as Project Awakening and is set in a faraway sector of the Eve universe. The developer calls it "a sandbox which focuses on self-reliance, skill-based tactical gameplay and third-party development". Huh? Third party development? Oh, I see. It has a bunch of blockchain cryptocurrency horseshit attached to it. Great.

According to a leaked memo, Microsoft are laying off around 650 people "to organize our business for long term success". This is the same Microsoft that parted with around 1900 employees in January, and the same Microsoft that washed their hands of around 10,000 staff in January 2023, all in the name of shoring up the business for future prosperity. That "long term success" is certainly taking its sweet time. Or at least, it is if you're one of the poor saps in the trenches of, in this case, "corporate and supporting functions".

Z toho, co se děje na plátně, nevyplývá nic víc než "Podívejte, co se honí v mé šílené hlavě, zajímá vás to?" Mě osobně ne. (Ilča 20 %)]]></summary>
