No, the next Pokémon live-action project will be a drama about a woman trying to find adventure in her life through playing Pokémon, rather than it being set in the Pokémon universe.

With all of Hell laid out before me, and so many ways to seize it for myself, I had to make the most of every turn and those precious two actions I could take. But that's the appeal of Solium Infernum, a remake of a classic strategy game from Armello creators League of Geeks; it offers a plethora of options but limits their frequency, making each turn a hellish clash of subterfuge, cunning, and two-faced lies.


In the annals of PC cult-classics, Solium Infernum is as much hidden as it is a gem. This strategy game from Victor J. Davis and Cryptic Comet certainly inspired some love when it first hit the scene in 2009. It picked up steam as a darling among bloggers at the time, even inspiring a parti…]]></summary>

Woah there, Dr Grant - what the hell are you talking about?

        <updated>2023-10-05T13:26:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fact that Starfield has been nominated for several awards at the Golden Joystick Awards suggests it's a game that's doing quite well for itself. Of course, it has its faults as any game does, which is why Cyberpunk 2077's quest director has leaped to its defense.


In a recent post on Twitter, CD Projekt Red's own Patrick K. Mills responded to Starfield criticism, in which they insisted they liked the game.




The long and the short of it is, user Synth Potato gave a fairly lengthy assessment of the Bethesda RPG, specifically when it came to the studio's Creation Engine. Comparing it to Cyberpunk 2077, the post argues that Starfield is "outdated,", particularly in light of cutscenes and animations. This has been an ongoing feud of sorts for a few weeks on the Twitter-verse, but now we have an actual response from a CD Projekt Red developer.


It all comes down to design, Mills says


In response to this, Mills argues that Starfield's cinematics and animation are "not down to engine so much as it is tools and design." While they admit they're not "an engine guy," they do go on to say that Bethesda's scenes are "staged in a more refined way."


The post chain goes into further detail, with Mills saying that the developer is "just doing something different with [its] time and that's cool." The thread closes by adding that "not every game can do every thing," and as such, not all features can be as refined as people would like.


It's up to you to decide whether you agree with this or not. For now, Cyberpunk 2077's quest director at least wants to throw some love Starfield's way.

Alongside the constant updates for Pokemon Go, Pokemon Unite, Pokemon Masters EX, and the recent Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Teal Mask DLC, we're also getting another entry in the Detective Pikachu Returns series on the Switch eShop this week (October 6 to be exact). Given that the first one ended on a cliffhanger, I'm glad the time has finally come for the sequel to potentially shine.


Beyond the Poke-verse, we have Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition, Wargroove 2, Front Mission 2: Remake, and a ton of other stuff that you can check out below coming out on Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill and Halloween go together like James Sunderland and existential guilt. With Konami's iconic horror series returning, many will be wondering when we'll get to experience this new era. As it turns out, perhaps to the surprise of no one, Silent Hill: Ascension may be heading to our screens for the spooky season.


That's according to a listing on Google Play, which says the interactive mini-series will be premiering on October 31. So, Halloween exactly, it seems.




It should be made clear that, as of writing, the producers and developers of Ascension have not actually confirmed whether this is the date the experience will launch. However, Google Play also doesn't say that this is a placeholder date, so this could be the real deal.


Like Bandersnatch, but not


For those who aren't aware, Silent Hill: Ascension is an interactive live-action series in which viewers decide on the outcome. It's being developed by J. J. Abram's Bad Robots Production company, along with Dead by Daylight studio Behavior Interactive and Genvid Entertainment.


The listing on describes it as a thrilling new "streaming service" that "follows multiple main characters from locations around the world tormented by new and terrifying SILENT HILL monsters."


We were treated to a pretty creepy trailer a few months back. Ascension is essentially a spin-off and, from what we understand so far, could deviate slightly from what we know and love about Silent Hill. However, we'll know more as and when the interactive experience airs.


We're also still waiting to hear more about Bloober Team's remake of Silent Hill 2. There will be many who are looking forward to this modern take on one of the most influential horror games of all time. Equally, there will be those who are skeptical about whether it can do the original justice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has announced that the next in line for Sneakybox’s series of remakes is Berzerk: Recharged. The press release says that it will be released “later this year,” which is a pretty small window of time by development standards.


Designed by Alan McNeil, Berzerk was first released in 1980 in arcades, followed by ports on the Atari 2600, 5200, and Vectrex consoles. It was first published by Stern, but Atari proudly bought back the property during a round of acquisitions this year. 


Something like this was inevitable, as Atari CEO Wade Rosen sounds like a fan. I don’t blame him. I’m not big on that primordial era of video games, but Berzerk is something special. It’s a multidirectional shooter where you navigate mazes and blast robots. You also frequently find yourself accosted by a bizarre smiling face called “Evil Otto” who is indestructible. He’s here to make sure that you keep spending quarters.




Beyond updated graphics and a soundtrack by frequent collaborator Megan McDuffee (River City Girls), Berzerk: Recharged will also upgrade the gameplay with twin-stick controls. You’re put through 20 “hand-crafted” mazes to compete for leaderboard supremacy. There’s also a two-player coop, which is standard for the series.


While Berzerk: Recharged doesn’t have a solid release date, it’s targeting PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Atari VCS. In the meantime, you can satisfy your Evil Otto cravings with Berzerk Enhanced Edition for the actual Atari 2600, which releases on November 17, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Atari announced that it acquired Berzerk, its sequel Frenzy, and 10 more classic arcade properties. Now, as part of Atari's Recharged lineup, it has revealed Berzerk: Recharged, and its coming to consoles and PC later this year. 
The original Berzerk is an arcade game released in 1980. In it, players controlled a top-down avatar while shooting through hordes of armed robots in an electrified maze. The big bad was Evil Otto, who bounced around the maze as a giant smiley face, hunting players down. Atari says Otto is back in Berzerk: Recharged, "bringing with him updated graphics, deft twin-stick controls, and a new soundtrack by the acclaimed Megan McDuffee."

It did so today with a short teaser trailer showing Lego-fied versions of fan-favorite Animal Crossing characters like Isabelle and Tom Nook. However, the teaser doesn't reveal exactly what to expect in terms of Lego sets or when we might see this collaboration hit store shelves.
The tweet accompanying the teaser says, "Welcome to...LEGO Animal Crossing!" The video itself shows Isabelle and Tom Nook looking up at the Lego Animal Crossing sky before pulling out to show even more Animal Crossing characters. All of them are watching a gift rise into the sky by way of a balloon, in classic Animal Crossing fashion; somebody get them a slingshot or two.

This Animal Crossing collaboration with Lego isn't the first time Nintendo and Lego have worked together on Lego sets. The two have been steadily releasing different Super Mario sets for a few years now, with four Donkey Kong Lego sets releasing back in August. Even outside of Nintendo, Lego is no stranger to taking video game characters and turning them into Legos. It's been doing that with Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets for a while now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games revealed that it was bringing Red Dead Redemption and its Undead Nightmare DLC to PlayStation 4 and Switch back in August. It did so, and while the game looked great on both consoles, it was only playable at 30 FPS. PlayStation 5 owners were left wondering if Rockstar wasn't tapping into the power of the current-gen console to bring 60 FPS to the 13-year old game. You could already play Red Dead Redemption in 60 FPS on Xbox Series X/S. 
Now, weeks later, Rockstar has updated the PS4 port of Red Dead Redemption and the included Undead Nightmare DLC to include 60 FPS support on PS5 via backward compatibility. It did so randomly, with a quick tweet announcing the news. 
Red Dead Redemption, including Undead Nightmare, now supports up to 60 FPS on PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility. pic.twitter.com/XMLIe6gYo4
October 4, 2023
Elsewhere in the same update, Rockstar added an option to enable subtitles upon first booting the game. The update also includes general bug fixes and improvements, although Rockstar didn't list which. 
If you bought Red Dead Redemption on PS4 recently to play on PS5, or were looking for a reason to do so, this new update that adds a 60 FPS option might be the reason you were looking for. Now, Rockstar please bring 60 FPS to Red Dead Redemption II on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

2023 has swarmed us with quality games. So many that there aren’t enough hours in the day to play them all — and now, Cocoon has crept onto our screens to buzzing acclaim. Fortunately, if you’re busy as a bee, and can’t dedicate time to a marathon game, this is a nice quick one. Jeppe Carlsen, lead gameplay designer of Inside and Limbo, has teamed up with Geometric and Annapurna to unleash this wonderous puzzler. Those who love a good mind-boggler buggler will enjoy curling up in their cocoons for a few hours with it.
You play as a bug-like creature traversing an alien land, completing puzzles to progress. Sometimes you get a drone-type companion who helps break down fences, though it also gets eaten by certain monsters. Then there are the orbs – Cocoon’s point of difference. Each contains a world you can carry around with you, both forming part of puzzles and containing puzzles within. One orb’s land is filled with prismatic crystals, another contains puddles and reeds, another is a gooey membranous underworld.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NES and Game Boy titles included.
A retro collection containing the original NES title A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia and its Game Boy sequel, The Rescue of Princess Blobette, is launching on the Nintendo Switch eShop on October 17th, 2023.
While maintaining the essence of the original games, the new collection will introduce modern quality-of-life enhancements, including filters to change the display's appearance, a music player, and save states (very much like Nintendo's own Switch Online collection, then, bar the music player). Each game will also contain the US and Japanese releases.

We've known for a while that the game would use Denuvo, together with the VMProtect software, but what's baking the noodles of many players is that the Denuvo functionality has been snuck in after the Assassin's Creed: Mirage review embargo, denying critics the chance to assess its impact on the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft revealed Assassin's Creed Mirage during a special celebratory event for the franchise's 15th anniversary. After several trailers, gameplay videos, and even a Game Informer cover (check out our hub here for exclusive behind-the-scenes content and more), the game is finally out for everyone. 
If you've kept up with Mirage, you know it's a bit of a return to the series' roots. After completing the game, it's safe to say that's definitely the case, with Mirage falling somewhere between where this franchise began and the modern RPGs of late. It feels modern but ditches the RPG mechanics and nature of the open-world games and instead embraces series tradition: a singular city to explore, a focus on stealth and parkour, one-hit assassinations, and more.

When Season 2, Season of Blood launches on October 17th, players will be able to download and play the ARPG through Steam. Earlier this year another Blizzard title, Overwatch 2, also came to Steam.


According to Fletcher, cross-play and cross-progression will work immediately on day one. Players on Steam and Battle.net will be able to party up and play together seamlessly on the same server. Despite being on the Steam platform, it looks like players will still require a Battle.net account to activate and play. This isn't too surprising since most modern-day Blizzard titles are built around the Battle.net network.

The previous Detective Pikachu game, released over five years ago on 3DS, traded in traditional Pokémon elements for mysteries more familiar to the Phoenix Wright/Professor Layton crowd. Gone were the trainers, Poké Balls, and battles in exchange for evidence-gathering, deduction, and a Pikachu that can speak far more than its own name. A year later, the movie adaptation became the second highest-grossing video game film at the time. While the game left a central loose thread dangling, the movie, which is disconnected from the game series, tied everything up in a neat bow.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Versus Evil has announced that Jukai Studio’s horror game Stray Souls will release on October 25, 2023. It is coming to PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One platforms.


Stray Souls takes place in the town of Aspen Falls, where protagonist Daniel has inherited his Grandmother’s house. He renovates the interior and quickly sells it on the booming real estate market to afford his education.


No, I’m joking. The town is full of monsters. Of course it is.




The plot centers around Daniel discovering he’s part of a ritual that was set in motion at his birth. Stray Souls is based on Japanese survival horror games and carries a bit more than a whiff of Resident Evil and Silent Hill. However, it promises “mind-bending puzzles” and a choice-driven narrative. It’s by a small team, but it carries with it the fancy gloss of the Unreal 5 Engine. Plus, it sports the legendary Akira Yamaoka as a guest composer.


I don’t know. The trailers show a lot of what seems familiar. The store blurb also states that its combat features “soulslike precision.” It kind of feels like its selling itself based on the merits of other games, rather than what it brings itself. Nonetheless, I like checking out horror from smaller developers, so it might be worth a look.


Stray Souls is coming to PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One on October 25, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spike Chunsoft announced that Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island will not only be coming to the West, but also that it’s set for release on February 27, 2024. The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island — what a mouthful — will be the 6th game in the mainline Shiren the Wanderer series. The last new entry we saw in this series was The Tower of Fortune and the Dice of Fate, which came out back in 2016.




The announcement trailer gives insight into what this iteration of Shiren the Wanderer entails. Supposedly, a vast treasure lies in wait in the dungeon of Serpentcoil Island, and who else deserves to claim it than Shiren and Koppa? It’s adopting a chibi-fied, cartoonish aesthetic, which lines up perfectly with the “back to basics” concept the trailer mentions.


As with many other roguelikes, this is a game where you will die (a lot). And, if and when you do die, you also lose everything you have gathered during that run. So strategy and careful movement becomes incredibly important for your survival. Especially with procedurally generated, turn-based dungeons that reset every run. I can see several scenarios playing out in my head that would make me panic beyond imagination.

For those unfamiliar with Shiren the Wanderer, it's the main pioneer of the Mystery Dungeon franchise. Western gamers likely know this better for its spinoffs like the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon and Chocobo Mystery Dungeon series'. So, if you’ve experienced either of those, you'll have a good idea of what to expect here. But if not, you can take the leap of faith when Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island launches exclusively for the Nintendo Switch on February 27, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember Gigantic? Gearbox Publishing certainly does. And it looks like the company is hoping fans of the doomed hero shooter do as well. The company sent emails to some former Gigantic players, inviting them to come together once more for a "limited time throwback event." 


It seems to have taken some folks by surprise. The humble Gigantic subreddit hummed back to life after players began sharing their invitations. The rise of excitement is somewhat heartwarming to see. It was only two months ago former players were asking: "Does anyone else miss Gigantic?" Well, for a short time, Gigantic will rise from the ashes once more.


"Play Gigantic once more on October 5 at 21:00 CEST - October 7 at 06:00 CEST," reads the email invite, "and re-live the good old days of playing this beloved strategic hero shooter!"




Is the throwback event setting the stage for a Gigantic comeback?


Gigantic will be playable for a select chosen few starting tomorrow, according to the email. The event will last for only two days, and there are limitations. Beyond being "invite only" to those who received the email, the throwback event can't be streamed or recorded — according to an invitee. And this could be the reason: The game may not be the same as fans remember.


According to some invitees, the game is going to come with a suite of updates. The email they received mentioned "Revamped Content" such as a Fortune Card System, a Progression System, loadouts, customization options for weapon skins, and more. The new version apparently includes a Rush Mode, a "fast-paced and action packed" mode for a "simplified" experience.


Does this mean Gearbox is testing the waters for a Gigantic return? Now might be a good time considering its most dangerous rival, Overwatch 2, has been having some struggles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Fortnite's goal to become "multi-game ecosystem" and a creative platform, Fortnite will soon require age rating for all first and third-party content. To make this happen, Epic has formed a partnership with the International Age Rating Coalition, or IARC. If you fashion yourself a creator on Fortnite, this new regulation takes effect starting on November 14.


“When you are ready to publish your island to Fortnite, you will fill out the IARC content rating questionnaire before you submit your island to be published and reviewed by Epic moderators,” the Fortnite Team wrote in a blog post. 


“When the questionnaire is complete, you will receive an age-based IARC rating for the content of your island along with region-specific ratings from IARC-participating rating authorities. These ratings will automatically be applied and prominently displayed prior to access.”


It appears that the IARC will consult regional ratings boards such as the ESRB for North America, PEGI for Europe, ACB for Australia, USK for Germany, and others based on where the player is based. This solution seems to be one designed to protect both creators and audiences — especially younger audiences — to create and consume Fortnite experiences tailor-made for their comfortability level. 


While this regulation doesn’t go into full-effect until November 14, the abovementioned IARC questionnaire goes live on October 16. It's to ensure creators have enough time to rate their experiences before the cutoff deadline of — you guessed it — November 14. According to the blog post, any experience left unrated will be delisted on that date, so make sure to abide by the new rule. We’d hate to see the islands you spent so much time and hard work on go dark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forthright Entertainment has announced that Soma Games’ The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology is prepped to re-release consoles on December 1, 2023. It’s coming to PS5, Xbox X|S, and PC.


I kind of had to do some digging on this one since the press release omits certain things, like the fact that this is a compilation of three previously released games. The first episode of The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout dropped back in 2018, with the other two following in 2021. Only the first act landed on Xbox One and PS4, with the others arriving on PC. This point is moot, however, because they’ve been delisted from all platforms. Going forward, this is going to be the only way to experience them.


I missed them the first time, which is funny because on my wishlist of games I want to see is a decent game based on Brian Jacques’ Redwall book series. In my youth, I was an avid fan of the series and read through a good chunk of them. If you’re unfamiliar, they’re essential fantasy novels, but instead of Elves and Orcs, it’s mice and rats. They’re joyful and well-written books, even if they tend to be pretty formulaic.




So far, it looks… okay. I don't think the games were exactly well-received the first time around, so hopefully, Soma Games did something with the feedback they received. I don’t think the trailer is doing it any favors. Usually, trailers are really heavily edited to show only the most polished slices of gameplay, and this one looks pretty raw. It’s a linear, action-adventure narrative told in three parts. I find it funny that it says, “An adventure for all the family,” directly after showing what looks like conflagrated rats. The books weren’t exactly flowery all the time, so it’s hard to have Redwall without the war.


Gosh, good times.


The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology is coming to PS5, Xbox X|S, and PC on December 1, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The jump hasn't been smooth.
The Dragon Quest series is no stranger to spin-off titles, but few are as confusing as Infinity Strash: Dragon Quest The Adventure of Dai. This action RPG is based on an anime adaptation of a manga based on the world of Dragon Quest, but it is never clear who the game is designed to appeal to. The few things it does well are buried under an avalanche of unengaging cutscenes that go on too long and simply don’t do the story they’re telling justice.
That isn’t to say that there aren’t some glimmers of hope hidden in this game’s runtime. The combat, for example, is competently designed if unimaginative in its implementation; characters have a basic attack, plus a selection of powers that they can unleash to deal more damage or to heal their allies. It is a system that has been used countless times before because it works well, letting you feel powerful as you wade through waves of enemies on the battlefield.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A port for Rockstar's famous Red Dead Redemption moseyed onto the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 (but compatible on PS5) in early August. Sadly, the celebratory hoedown came to an abrupt halt when players learned the game would go for $49.99 and run at 30 FPS. And while that don't beat all, Rockstar has at least fixed half the issue. The port of Red Dead Redemption got an update that silently added support for 60 FPS, so long as you're saddled up with the PS5. I will slow my Western puns for now.


Rockstar released update 1.03 on October 3 and made nary a fuss about the framerate change. The Red Dead Redemption port now has a framerate toggle within its Display menu, allowing PS5 owners to run it at the accepted standard of 60 FPS. Here is the full patch notes for 1.03 via Rockstar Games:



Added an option to enable 60 FPS when played on PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility


Added an option to enable subtitles upon first booting the game


General bug fixes and improvements





Redemption partially arrives for PS5 owners


Fans weren't thrilled with the news of the port to say the very least. While its performance on the aging Switch is arguable, it should be easily capable of running at a higher framerate on Sony's more powerful machines. The game got a 4K patch and a framerate boost when it went backward compatible on the Xbox One X system in 2018, after all. Fans also weren't enthused by its hefty price tag, despite Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick calling it "commercially accurate." 


Red Dead Redemption is available for download on the Switch and PlayStation 4 for $49.99. It comes with the base game along with the Undead Nightmares DLC.

They're sort of The Lord of the Rings, but with talking woodlands animals, and their appeal for me consisted of three things 1) comedy British accents, 2) big fights, and 3) big feasts. I couldn't get enough, to the point that I tried to have one of my unborn siblings named after a badger warcry from the novel Salamandastron.
Fast-forward to 2023, and Oregon-based Soma Games are about to release a Redwall videogame, titled The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology. Will it measure up to my childhood fantasies about acorn pancakes slathered with gorseflower honey, or forest logboat armadas of squabbling guerilla shrews? Probably not, but what can? Here's a new trailer from publisher Forthright Entertainment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The multiplayer beta for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is almost upon us, and depending on what platform you’re playing on, you may be among the first (or the last) to gain access to the latest iteration of competitive firefighting.


It was previously announced that PlayStation players would get first dibs on this beta if they pre-ordered Modern Warfare 3, so that goes without repeating. We also got confirmation the beta would eventually make its way to PC and Xbox. Now we have the exact dates and times the multiplayer beta for Modern Warfare 3 will be available.


Minutes to midnight


If you pre-ordered Modern Warfare 3 on PS4 or PS5, as stated above, you’ll be among the first invited to jump into the multiplayer beta. It should be unlocked for you from October 6 (Friday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST until October 8 (Sunday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST. 


For those PlayStation fans who didn’t pre-order Modern Warfare 3, you’re up next — you can play the beta from October 8 (Sunday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST until October 10 (Tuesday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST. 


OK — now it’s time for everyone else (kind of). If you pre-ordered the game on PC or Xbox, it’s your turn to take a spin from October 12 (Thursday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST until October 14 (Saturday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST. It’s important to note that PlayStation players can also partake during this time.


And lastly, we have a period where the beta will truly be accessible to anyone and everyone, regardless of if you pre-ordered Modern Warfare 3 or not. If this sounds like you, give the multiplayer beta a shot from October 14 (Saturday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST until October 16 (Monday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST. 


We hope that helps you to make the most of this — admittedly short-lived — beta. For more on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, check back with Destructoid in the lead-up to its launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Kumi Souls Games announced its gothic Soulslike metroidvania, The Last Faith, years ago, and last summer, we got a new trailer that indulged in the game's pixelated violence. We knew the game was coming late this year, but now it's official: The Last Faith hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 15. 
Kumi Souls Games announced this release date with a new gameplay trailer that you can watch below: 


If you don't want to wait until November 15 to jump into The Last Faith, you can check it out early with a new extended demo that's available right now on Steam. Kumi Souls Games says that in it, you can get a taste of Mythringal's brutal environment. 
"Often brutal, but always empowering, The Last Faith thrives on merciless and precise combat, with a huge range of custom executions to perform," a press release reads. "Players will unearth a formidable variety of melee weapons, arcane spells, and long-range firearms, allowing them to carve a path in their own style.
"Explore rich, gothic environments in order to piece together the fractured history of Mythringal, and survive intense encounters against swathes of blood-thirsty enemies who will stop at nothing to put an end to Eryk."
The Last Faith hits PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 15.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five former Ubisoft executives have been arrested following an investigation into sexual assault and harassment at the company. As French publication Libération reports, three of the arrests were made yesterday, and two were made today. 


It is not known yet whether the arrested individuals have been charged, and if so for what. However, it is reported that the arrests come following an investigation of complaints by the Solidaires Informatique union and two victims. According to one of the plaintiff's lawyers, Maude Beckers, the case encompasses more than individual behavior and also concerns "systemic sexual violence."


Thus far, only two arrested individuals have been named. The first is former Ubisoft chief creative officer Serge Hascoët, and the other is former editorial vice president Tommy François. Both individuals left Ubisoft in 2020.


Over the years, reports emerged painting a pattern of sexual harassment at Ubisoft. When these allegations began making headlines, Ubisoft claimed it would launch an investigation and take the appropriate disciplinary actions. Since then, many higher-ups have stepped down or been terminated from the company, including those former execs and others. The allegations were enough to also trigger a legal investigation.


In a statement to GamesIndustry.biz, Ubisoft said: ""Ubisoft has no knowledge of what has been shared and therefore can't comment."

I'm not sure The Fabulous Fear Machine - devised by Fictiorama Studios in partnership with AMC and Shudder - is quite that horrifying, but it's certainly chewing on my nerve endings in an engrossing way. 


It's a top-down management sim, which might not sound very scary, but just look at those colours - irradiated and unwholesome shades of purple and yellow, spreading over chunky, HyperCard continents emblazoned with pulp comic fonts. The visuals wear away at you like the stink of hydrochloric acid. And then there's that red-eyed, turbaned figure, gazing at you in top left. This is the face of the Fabulous Fear Machine. Its offer: to enable your character's world-toppling ambitions. Its price: that your story will become part of its story. The game is out today, and I've got some thoughts ahead of a possible review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fallout: London – the upcoming mod for Fallout 4 – is one of the most ambitious fan-made projects we've seen in some time. Now, as development continues, the team has shared a new update video, which outlines what else is coming.


The progress video on YouTube opens with voice actress Letitia "LetitiaTHELemon" Lemon saying that it's getting harder to conceal spoilers as "things start working towards wrapping up." We also get a glimpse of a ruined version of Bromley, a large town within Greater London.




There's some other sneak peeks as well, including some dangerous apex predators that stalk the streets, as well as a gang that's been inspired by Peaky Blinders.


Are they suggesting London isn't safe?


The mythical creatures that prey on wanders are called Dryads (I think I'm spelling that correctly) and have a slight appearance of the Spriggan from The Elder Scrolls games. 


As for the Vagabonds, this is a new gang that's been added into the Fallout mod that rules Bromley, with a look about them that's been lifted from the hit TV show starring Cillian Murphy. They inhabit the Swan and Mitre, a dilapidated pub that's been modelled after the real one.


All these teases for Fallout: London have been whetting the appetite of fans who've been keen to play the mod in its final form. However, there's still no confirmed release date as of yet, but it sounds like we're getting close to one. We know it's aiming to launch in 2023, so we could see it arriving within the next couple of months. But that's only speculation at this stage.


You can read more about what this Fallout 4 project is actually about on the website. The team is always looking for volunteers to help with the project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Us fans of classic first-person shooters were delighted when the Quake 2 remaster launched recently. A little bit of nostalgia with a dollop of newness to give the iconic game a fresh coat of paint. Now, we're in for another treat with a mod that makes id Software's 1997 release more violent and harrowing.


As spotted by DSO Gaming, modder SGtMarkIV recently released a "quick gameplay test" of something they're calling "Brutal Quake 2." As the name suggests, this is a mod that ups the violence in Q2, but also tweaks the game in general by adding new ideas.




The footage shows the current work-in-progress. We see that it has the look of Quake 2, only with...well...more brutality. Interestingly enough, we also get to see a map not in the original release or remaster. This one puts the player and other marines in a battlefield, fighting Stroggs as chaos ensues and explosions litter a kind of no man's land. Imagine if Johns Romero and Carmack did a Medal of Honor game back in 1997.


Also, it's not made in the Quake engine


One thing to note about this footage is that it doesn't quite look like a modified version of Q2. Sure, the opening map bears a resemblance to the Outer Base level, but it looks different somehow.


This is because SGtMarkIV is having to make it in GZDoom, the modern toolkit/engine that's used to mod the original Doom games. They say that GZDoom can read the models from Quake 2's files, which means this mod can run in the Doom engine, but with Quake assets.


We don't know the release date for Brutal Quake 2 yet, but given that it's coming from the mind that brought us Brutal Doom, expect carnage a-plenty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To paraphrase George Orwell: "If you want a picture of the future, imagine a community of gamers modifying Skyrim... forever." Bethesda's epic RPG has been modded to death, but none hit quite the same as this one that allows NPCs to break wind.


Nexus Mods user JobiWanUK (thanks, PC Gamer—no really... thank you) brings flatulence to the fantasy world of Tamriel. Not only does this mod give a new voice to the denizens of Skyrim (or at least their asses), it also implements realistic reactions for that added dose of fart-y immersion.




We're also treated to a full eight and half minute video showcasing what happens when an NPC lets one rip in Skyrim. We get everything from laughter to disgust to angry requests that one leave the vicinity. One guard even offers their fart to the player as a kind of windy gift.


It's a lot more in-depth than you might think


It's not just adult NPCs and guards, either. Children can also let loose their own pint-sized butt guffaws. As can dogs, horses, and even goats.


The mod description and video say that there are different farts for different occasions. For example, there are ones for when someone is sat down or when they're asleep. There are even silent farts, for god's sake!


You can also customize how often you get to experience NPCs cutting the cheese. It might be you want to be amused every hour or you don't mind if it's just once a day. You can even disable the sleep farts or the ones emitted by animals.


For all its faults and bugs, Skyrim definitely continues to be a breath of fresh air thanks to the modding community. Actually, perhaps "breath of fresh air" is not an appropriate term to use in this context.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I technically never stopped playing retro games. When I had my Gamecube, I was still playing games on my SNES. However, around that time, I also bought an NES. The games I got with it – games like Total Recall and Kid Icarus – had me convinced that I just hated games on the NES. It wasn’t until I was introduced to a couple of games on this list, that retro gaming truly opened up to me.


I do believe that games age, but mostly on a technical level. Poor framerates and blurry graphics can make it difficult to return to an early 3D game. Their design, on the other hand, is rarely completely superseded. Video game development really just goes through trends. Right now, there’s a particular style of game that is favored by gamers, but this was different 10 years ago, which was different 10 yea…]]></summary>

It's been over seven years since we got our first helping of the wise-cracking, coffee-addicted Detective Pikachu on 3DS and, in the time since, the gruff private investigator has gone on to star in his very own big-screen adaptation voiced by the one and only Ryan Reynolds. Well, excuse us, Mr Hollywood!
The first Detective Pikachu introduced us to a consistently amusing take on the classic Pikachu character alongside his likeable human pal Tim Goodman, wherein the pair used their investigative skills to unravel a mystery surrounding a drug which was causing Pokémon to fly into violent rages. There was also an overarching plot — one that forms the basis of the hit movie — which saw the sleuths attempting to find Tim's missing dad, Harry Goodman.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What exactly is The Alters? It's a question I've been itching to get answers to ever since Frostpunk and This War Of Mine developers 11 bit Studios first announced their strange new game at notE3 last year. Until now, all we've had to go on is a cryptic CG announcement trailer that showed a gaggle of identical clone-looking men in bright pink medical gowns, all of whom seemingly live inside a giant wheel full of shipping containers. It didn't really tell us anything about what the game actually is, or how it plays, and we've heard precious little about it since. 
Happily, I've now seen about an hour of The Alters in action at this year's Gamescom, and first impressions are very promising. This is indeed a game about sort-of clones living in a big wheely shipping container, but these containers are actually modules you'll be building in XCOM/Fallout Shelter-style chunks to advance the capabilities of your big wheel base as you work to escape the broiling heatdeath that's slowly enveloping the planet. You'll also be venturing out onto the planet's surface to gather resources, all while managing your crew of clo- sorry, alternate selves - as you assign their daily work tasks, and then there's the fact that, well, you're all chuffing different versions of the same person and the literal embodiment of what your life might have been like if you'd done X instead of Y, or Y instead of Z. It's a fascinating blend of ideas, and if 11 bit can stick the landing, I reckon it could end up being something really quite special. Here's everything I learned.

        <updated>2023-10-04T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11 Bit Studios, the developer behind This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta, unveiled The Alters last year. It called it a sci-fi adventure where one man is trying to survive, and hopefully get home, after a space mission goes wrong. To do so, he must rely on both himself and various copies of himself. 
Today, 11 Bit Studios released a new trailer of The Alters that gives us our first look at its gameplay, which highlights that it's a third-person, base-building survival game. The team says the story is "driven by life-defining choices and exploring the diverse paths one could take" after Jan crash-lands on an inhospitable planet turning toward a massive sun. 
Check it out for yourself in The Alters gameplay trailer below: 


"In this desperate race against time, Jan must harness local Rapidium crystals to create his many versions: the 'Alters'," a press release reads. "Set within an ever-moving mobile base, both teamwork and building a wide range of expertise are indispensable for survival. By selecting diverging paths for other Jans during the alteration process, they acquire distinct skill sets. They become invaluable, not only for maintaining the base, but also for tasks like cooking, crafting tools for surface exploration, and gathering essential resources." 
11 Bit Studios says the Alters are more than mere resources, though, as they are sentient beings with their own emotions, problems, goals, and sometimes, existential doubts about their purpose. 
"Despite their differences, their collective goal is to escape, echoing Jan's determination to survive: I'll just do it all by myselves," the press release reads.

The Alters is due out on current-gen consoles and PC sometime in 2024. 
For more, watch The Alters' reveal trailer here, and then read Game Informer's reviews of 11 Bit Studios' other games: This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a tradition that as hardware ages, companies will stop supporting it with new releases, and eventually online services shut down. It has been a slow death for the 3DS and the Wii U which had their eShops shut down this year. The next step in phasing out these devices will come in April 2024 when Nintendo shuts down online services for software on the platforms. 


In short, this means that online play and anything else that requires the internet will no longer be available for the 3DS and Wii U. Nintendo has clarified that a more specific date for the shutdown will be revealed later.

What happens after online services are shut down for 3DS and Wii U? 


Let's start with what won't be getting axed. The shutdown of online services on the 3DS and Wii U won't stop you from playing single-player offline games. You won't lose your library either because "it will still be possible to download update data and redownload purchased software and downloadable content from Nintendo eShop."




StreetPass will still be fully functional, as that relies on local communication, though you will lose SpotPass. You'll also be losing the following:  



online co-operative play


internet rankings


data distribution



Pokemon players can breathe a sigh of relief, as Pokemon Bank will still have access to online services, though "that may also end at some point in the future." 


The shutdown of online services is unfortunate but unavoidable too. It does seem that Nintendo is freeing up resources as it looks to its future which, if reports are to be believed, may feature a Switch successor as soon as next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So it turns out Starfield is pretty popular, yeah? Although it's received some pretty good scores, it's by no means perfect. However, whatever criticism people have, it hasn't stopped Bethesda's new release from being nominated for several awards.


Over on GamesRadar, voting for the Golden Joystick Award 2023 has begun. Here, you'll get a chance to decide which games of this year (and before) were your favorite. Categories include Best Storytelling, Studio of the Year, Best Indie Game, Still Playing Award, and more.




Of course, being one of the most hyped games of this generation, Starfield has a number of recognitions. For this year's GJA, the sci-fi RPG has been nominated for Best Audio, Best Visual Design, and Xbox Game of the Year.


Note: not 'Game of the Year' overall


Nobody will be surprised that Starfield is being recognized in the industry. However, it's interesting to note that it isn't under the PC Game of the Year category. This could be because it's an Xbox exclusive, but it did release on PC as well.


As for it being the best Xbox game, it's going up against the likes of the Bethesda-published Hi-Fi Rush, the remake of Dead Space, and Obsidian's text-heavy medieval release Pentiment (which I voted for because I'm pretentious like that).


Starfield itself has been received pretty favorably, with it currently showing a pretty solid Metacritic score of 86 and 84 on PC and Xbox, respectively. However, as time marches on, people are beginning to see the cracks, so maybe it won't have the legacy Skyrim retains to this day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After 11 years, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been, somewhat unceremoniously, shut down in favour of the newer, shinier Counter-Strike: 2. Whether you like it or not, Valve wants you playing CS2. For those who don't take their CS all too seriously, CS2 won't seem like much of a change from CS:GO, besides some grenade changes, more detailed maps, and a disappointing lack of fan favourite game modes. And for those who train their aim on the reg and line up their smoke grenades, CS2 might look the part but lacks the precision of CS:GO's movement and gunplay.
Still, CS2 captures what makes Counter-Strike tick and even if the foundation seems a little sparse and a touch shaky right now, I'm confident Valve have an FPS that'll supersede CS:GO in time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Nintendo ended eShop functionality for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, marking the beginning of the end for these devices. Now, Nintendo has announced that online play and other device functionality that requires online communication is coming to an end, too. 
More specifically, Nintendo says online services for these devices will end in April 2024. 
As of early April 2024, online play and other functionality that uses online communication will end service for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software. Thank you very much for your continued support of our products.

"In early April 2024, online play and other functionality that uses online communication will end for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software," Nintendo's announcement reads. "This also includes cooperative play, internet rankings, and data distribution."
Nintendo says it will announce a specific end date and time at a later date and that it reserves the right to discontinue these online services earlier if "an event occurs that would make it difficult to continue online services" for the 3DS and Wii U. It also notes this includes software exclusive to the New Nintendo 3DS. 
The company then answers a number of questions in an FAQ section of the announcement. It notes that Pokemon Bank will still be usable following April 2024 and that "for the foreseeable future, it will still be possible to download update data and redownload purchased software and downloadable content from Nintendo eShop." 
The fan-favorite 3DS feature, StreetPass, will fortunately still work as it uses local communication between devices, but SpotPass, which uses online communication instead, will no longer be available after April 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm close to being whatever the Assassin's Creed equivalent of a Pokémon genwunner is. It's not like I'm snobby about the newer, more action-oriented Creeds; I welcomed the shift brought in by Assassin's Creed Origins, which shook the series up a bit, and I loved Cassandra kicking her way around Ancient Greece. Valhalla, although it had a relative dearth of things to parkour around, was a fun open-world RPG. Which I suppose is the point.
Assassin's Creed hasn't been a game about a group of assassins following a creed and striking from the shadows for a long time. Here I would say that Basim, protagonist of Assassin's Creed Mirage kicks down the door and kills everyone in the room, except this new entry in the series is smaller, more focused, and once again concerned largely with stealth, and is all the better for it. So it's more appropriate to say Basim snuck in through an open window and is choking everyone out one by one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Assassin's Creed franchise has been on quite a roller coaster since the original was released over 15 years ago. At first, each successive title seemed to enhance the core mechanics of the stealthy gameplay you'd expect from a game with the word "assassin" in the title. But then Assassin's Creed Origins changed up the formula a bit. Assassin's Creed became an open-world game, with more similarities to Far Cry than the original Assassin's Creed games. The next two entries in the franchise, Odyssey and Valhalla, built upon that formula. With Valhalla, it felt like the combat had finally reached its peak, but something was lost along the way. It no longer felt like Assassin's Creed. In fact, Valhalla often discouraged you from taking the stealth route.

For years, the Assassin’s Creed franchise has expanded the scope of its entries, offering ever longer adventures across increasingly vast open worlds. For players who first tried the series through those entries, Assassin’s Creed Mirage may be a shock. Set mainly within the single city of ninth-century Baghdad and playable to completion in under 20 hours, Mirage harkens back to the earliest entries starring Altaïr and Ezio. For more longtime fans, many elemen…]]></summary>

There's a lot to sift through there, which we'll get into next week, but we also found time towards the finish for some off-the-cuff chinwaggery about dream 4X or strategy game projects. What would the Oxide team make, if they didn't have to worry about budget, audience expectations or any of the other commercial factors that guide the creation of videogames? The answers may surprise you. They might also make you hungry.

First announced in the Japanese version of the September 2023 Nintendo Direct, Spike Chunsoft has confirmed that Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island is coming to the West, with a physical release set for 27th February 2024.
The trailer above touches on the history of this roguelike Mystery Dungeon side series, which began in 1995 with Mystery Dungeon 2. Shiren the Warrior. As you'd expect, it appears that STWTMDOSI (yep, everyone's going to be calling it that) will deliver the series' traditional dungeon-crawling while introducing some new quality-of-life features such as "two types of live search displays that can be used for different purposes or the ability to track your own steps on the mini-map."

It can be rare for a newer franchise to challenge a well-established genre leader for the throne, but that’s precisely what the Forza Motorsport series has done since its first entry in 2005. Since then, the sim-racing genre has featured dueling front-runners, with Gran Turismo and Forza Motorsport taking turns in the lead. The latest entry, simply titled Forza Motorsport, takes a back-to-basics approach to keep pace with its chief rival.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Manga and light novel powerhouse Kodansha, through its Creators Lab, has launched a couple of new indie titles, IGNISTONE, by MONO ENTERTAINMENT and In His Time, developed by Tearyhand Studio. 




IGNISTONE looks to be a cute, colorful roguelike that takes inspiration for its overall aesthetic from games like Paper Mario and Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling. The game tasks players with finding the titular IGNISTONE by reaching the 100th floor basement of an enigmatic dungeon. Based on the trailer, the game isn’t afraid to have fun with itself and be goofy; there’s a full on dance break at the end. 


If you’ve played other roguelikes, such as Moonlighter, the loop is pretty simple: as you make progress in the dungeon, you’ll periodically be given a choice to either return to the surfac…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the latest in a string of whirlwind layoffs in the games-and-games-adjacent industry, it appears there has been another round of layoffs at Twitch, according to Today Off Stream’s Zach Bussey via Twitter. 




“It appears there is another round of layoffs at Twitch today,” wrote Bussey. In a reply to this tweet, he clarifies this round is “significantly smaller than the first,” referring to an earlier round of layoffs this past March that affected 9,000 Amazon employees, over 400 of which were roles at Twitch, according to a report by GamesIndustry.biz. It’s an inopportune time for not only those affected, but also for Twitch, which will be hosting its semi-annual TwitchCon at the end of the month.


According to GamesIndustry.biz, an unnamed source said these layoffs were mostly affecting “the customer experience organization,” and were a result of the company shifting towards an outsourcing business model to fulfill these roles.


"Given the uncertain economy in which we reside, and the uncertainty that exists in the near future, we have chosen to be more streamlined in our costs and headcount," said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, in response to the first round of layoffs in March. Jassy took over as CEO from Jeff Bezos in 2021.


These layoffs come as the next in a long line of industry shakeups, with layoffs at Epic Games, studios associated with Embracer Group such as Beamdog, Crystal Dynamics, and Gearbox Publishing, Team17, Naughty Dog, and Bioware, to name just a few.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Mario Bros. Wonder is set to debut on the Switch on October 20, and it's looking incredibly colorful and sleek. But if you're looking for something a little…older, this fan-made commercial should do the trick.


Straight from the mind of the YouTube channel Luiz do Comercial, this video is a blast from the past. Aimed at recreating the somber yet powerful aesthetic of 1988, the clip reimagines the modern Super Mario Wonder as a classic NES game. In case you're wondering, yes, they do the "Now You're Playing with Power" slogan at the end.


In a fascinating turn, the creator notes that the inspiration came from an unlikely place: a retro remake concept of Mario Wonder by Nimaginendo Games. It also draws upon elements of Mario 2, including the in-game visuals. As Luiz notes: "This was a very audacious project, because in addition to the 3D and 2D, I had to do all the pixel art for the supposed NES game!"




These bits of nostalgia really work on me


Given that I was around for the height of the NES' success in America, these types of fan-made projects speak to me in a big way. This one, in particular, is really spot on, from the hazy '80s/'90s viewing experience to the booming horror-like voiceover effect.


It brings me back to a time when we were constantly advertised to by a faceless void-like entity; before the attitude-ridden '90s came along and changed things considerably. By then, people were on-screen screaming in our faces. Game marketing is a fascinating microcosm of weirdness!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Patch 3 for Baldur's Gate 3 brought many good changes with it. From the expected bug fixes to methods for altering the protagonist's appearance, there's plenty to like. 


One less popular addition was giving the Sphynx His Majesty a regretful coat of fur. Until the patch, this rude and pompous cat had an illustrious mane of nothing, adding to his charm, and thankfully the latest hotfix restores this. 


Among the first changes noted on the hotfix's page was Larian Studio's wise decision to shave His Majesty. If anything, this hotfix primarily reverses controversial changes made in Patch 3 that fans haven't taken to. 


A cat who is not His Majesty also saw changes. Another Sphynx named Steelclaw had her eye color adjusted to not be His Majesty's clone.


Another reversal made was with how inventory management occurred. Patch 3 introduced a shared inventory system where party members shared items they deemed important with the player upon dismissal. It proved to be a bit of a headache for players, so Larian reverted the change.


Not every change made is a reversal back to the Patch 2 settings. Alongside those are the general bug fixes that help generally improve the game's stability. 


Among these are fixing several multiplayer-related crashes, namely when listening to dialogue after a roll and when reassigning characters in splitscreen. Other bugs fixed include preventing invalid saves from being created and Twitch drops not being claimable on PS5. 


If there is anything to take away from this hotfix, it's that Larian Studios knows when to back down from a disliked change. His Majesty is as majestic as he is thanks to his lack of fur, and taking that away means taking his character away. May he remain forever rude and furless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was a computer science student, I developed a messaging app called HYPE with a few of my (more-talented) peers. It worked really well, and we even used it to talk during lectures, but of course we never released it out into the world and after leaving uni it was abandoned. Years later, I saw the brand called HYTE and my immediate reaction was "They stole our idea!"
Of course, my reading comprehension is poor, and HYTE - the iBuyPower PC case company - is unrelated to my unreleased, unannounced Linux-based chat app. 
And so it falls to me to tell you that if you don't have a knee-jerk reaction to four-letter words that look like acronyms but aren't, and you like small PC cases, you might be interested in this US deal for the HYTE Revolt 3. 
This critically-acclaimed Mini ITX PC case is down to $112 at Newegg or Ebay, a cut below its regular price of $200 and MSRP of $250. $112 is a bloody brilliant price for this case, especially as it comes with a pre-fitted 700W 80+ Gold SFX power supply.

Today you can pick up the massive 4TB size of this high-end PCIe 4.0 SSD for just £170.97, a nice discount from the next-best price (Amazon, £187) and a sizeable departure from its original UK RRP (£199) by using code TECHDEAL10 at the checkout.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If a new patch adds in a bug, no matter how small, the Pokemon community will find it. This one is a tad bigger than a mere annoyance though, as Pokemon Scarlet & Violet version 2.0.1 (which arrived for the Teal Mask DLC) apparently added in a hardware crash.


So here's how it happens:



Get to the final battle of the game


Have Miraidon or Koraidon (the box cover legendaries) in your Pokedex


Select Pokemon party slots 4-6





As you can see in the above video from Twitter user Mattyoukhana_, the bug triggers as soon as you highlight the fourth or sixth party slot. You can move around slots 1-3 all you want, and even swing around the top to the bottom-most entry of your chosen box Pokemon. But once you hit the slot above it, boom, crash.


As the community points out in the ensuing discussion, you can sidestep the bug by not hovering over the aforementioned slots, or by just not having a full party. For those of you who steamroll battles with just one 'Mon, you probably won't even notice it.


Folks are flabbergasted as to how this can happen, as this was evidently added to the base campaign, and didn't happen in the new DLC zone. But it wouldn't be a Pokemon game without some puzzling bugs. Ideally, this bug will be spread far and wide, and Game Freak will be able to patch it out at some point. I refrained from typing "swiftly patch out," because this is Game Freak we're talking about. We're still months on from the launch of the game, and a lot of performance issues are still lingering.

When I played Super Mario Bros. Wonder in August, I came away extremely impressed by the creativity at play with the series' return to the 2D side of the coin. I enjoyed my time so much that I was upset when I had to relinquish the controller at the end of my demo session. Thankfully, as part of our cover story for our latest issue, I was able to get a lot more time with Super Mario Bros. Wonder. While a lot of that time was spent further exploring the levels I had already played, I was also the first to experience three courses that appeared as part of the Super Mario Bros. Wonder-focused Nintendo Direct in late August.

Activision have put up a trailer for nu-Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3's multiplayer, ahead of a full live reveal at the Call of Duty: Next event on 5th October. I caught the news on a social feed somewhere, went hunting for the Youtube version and, much to my distress, managed to dig up the multiplayer premiere for the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, released in 2011 - almost 12 years ago. 


Rather than just posting the correct video and going off to cry about my advancing seniority, I'm brazenly posting both so you can trace the evolution (or not) of this shootiest of first-person shooter franchises. It's bizarre to think of any game series being this venerable, and changing so much while remaining the same.

Catch a poetry reading? Have a blood pressure test? Contemplate your empty existence? Eat a kebab? All this and more awaits you with Neyasnoe, the new first-person explorer from the creators of It's Winter. While It's Winter had you so bored and lonely you might cook egg on toast only to flush it down the toilet, here you're surrounded by life, and I'm not sure that's much more comfort.

In the 11 years since the last 2D game launched, we've received multiple re-releases, two Super Mario Maker titles, two mainline 3D titles, and even a mobile auto-runner. After nearly two decades of the New Super Mario Bros. series dominating the 2D side of the iconic franchise, Super Mario Bros. Wonder represents a new era for the Mushroom Kingdom crew. To celebrate the impending release of this new 2D adventure on Switch, Super Mario Bros. Wonder graces the cover of our latest issue of Game Informer.

In his RPS review, Ed Thorn described it as "an action-RPG that wraps what could've been a wonderfully realised Gotham universe in a tired, slapdash mix of meaningless numbers and loot." I reviewed it myself as a freelancer and can't disagree with his verdict. Game ain't great. But I find myself itching to download and revisit this muddled open world contender all the same.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a fan of the modern Bethesda RPG, having spent nearly 100 hours with Fallout 4 - which, for me, is a lot more time than I'm usually willing to give up. My fondest memories lie with Oblivion, because I think it captured exploration beautifully. I liked emerging from a big cave as a big nobody and striking out along a cobbled path, excited to go for a summer's walk. Skyrim abandoned Oblivion's warmth for your average fantasyland, but kept the great outdoors.
If I don't have an objective in Starfield, I sort of freeze over and don't really know where to turn. And even if I do, I perform a deep sigh and open up my menus and curl myself into a pinball, ready to get pinged around the innards of whatever can lies beyond the airlock in front of me. So far, Starfield's adventuring forces me indoors and it's a shame.

Laying the rails that connect all of your production chains is, as the UK government will no doubt be quick to tell you, an often-complex affair.

The Batman: Arkham Trilogy, as the Switch collection is called, was due out this month on October 13 but has now been delayed to December. 
More specifically, Batman: Arkham Trilogy hits Swtich on December 1. As for why, the team says more time is needed on its development. 
"More time is needed to bring players the best possible experience on Nintendo Switch," Rocksteady's statement on Twitter reads. "We apologize to fans who are excited to play this version of the trilogy. Thank you for your patience."

The layoffs reportedly began last week, according to two of Kotaku's sources and various departments, from art to production, were hit. The majority of those laid off were in Naughty Dog's quality assurance testing department. 
The 25 contract developers laid off were part of a downsizing at the studio, but Kotaku reports that full-time staff do not appear to be affected. The publication's sources say severance is not being offered to those laid off and those affected (as well as those still working at Naughty Dog) are "being pressured to keep the news quiet."

For the uninitiated, The Forest Cathedral is inspired by events surrounding real-life scientist Rachel Carson's investigation into Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, otherwise known as the harmful DDT pesticide. Publisher Whitethorn Games says this game is "a dramatic reimagining of Carson's environmental science book, Silent Spring." 
You can get a look at it in The Forest Cathedral PS5 release date trailer below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, in The Forest Cathedral, players take on the role of Rachel in her new field research biologist position on a mysterious island. What begins as simply completing weekly work tasks becomes something more horrific when Rachel learns about what DDT is doing to the area. Whitethorn says players "will slowly uncover the horrific effects of the pesticide using advanced environment technology to complete puzzles that weave together 3D exploration with 2D platforming." 

As far as gameplay goes, players switch between Rachel Carson in a 3D world and the "Little Man" inside the 2D world of Rachel's scanning tools. It's in this 2D world where players will solve puzzles and complete platforming challenges.
The Forest Cathedral is available right now on Xbox Series X/S and PC via Steam. It hits PS5 on Halloween.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man is almost here. Set to hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20, PlayStation and developer Insomniac Games have continued to ramp up excitement surrounding the sequel with trailers, gameplay, and more. And last night, PlayStation released a new extended 60-second TV spot that gives us a more cinematic look at these heroes' latest adventure. 
The trailer is CGI and it's gorgeous. We see Peter Parker and Miles Morales come to grips with the challenges before them, both in the suit and out of it; all to the backdrop of a massive fight in broad daylight against Venom. If this trailer is any indication, Venom is quite the formidable foe for these two. 
Check it out for yourself in the Marvel's Spider-Man 2 trailer below: 


As you can see, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 continues to look great, and fortunately, we don't have to wait long to get our hands on it because it hits PS5 on October 20. 
In the meantime, read about how Marvel's Spider-Man 2 features more than 65 suits and then read our thoughts on the game after going hands-on with it. Check out Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 New Gameplay Today after that.

The new patch reverts companion behaviour to their pre-Patch 3 behaviour, for a less frustrating RPG experience. In even more momentous tidings, it re-shaves that cat everybody loves.

Designed by Volker Wertich, one of the original creators of The Settlers, the new village 'em up puts you in charge of medieval tribes scattered around an almost eerily scenic island chain. 


It's all about the little touches: check out those azure windmill blades, flickering in the breeze! And how about the little animations of people hefting barrels of water? Man, it makes me want to jump in there and start stamping on everything, wailing and babbling like a mad god. But let's not do that. Let's play the demo instead. It gives you three maps, and lands ahead of the game's early access launch on 13th December.

There are also fixes for a shader compilation bug that may, nonetheless, still exist for AMD GPUs when playing this latest iteration of the developer's free-to-play team and objective-based shooter. Many of the larger issues returning players have, such as the absence of Mac support, are yet to be addressed.

Kando: After the development for Pikmin 3 ended, we started development for Pikmin 4 as a small team.

A, of course, stands for Attacking by means of things like energy rifles, electro-batons and shotguns. B is for Back-stabbing, referring to the stealthy player who may stack objects so as to clamber into vents, and whack guards deftly in the noggin to escape detection.
And C is for Conversing, referring to the act of wooing civilians - who thus far seem miraculously unbothered by your menacing hooded appearance and sepulchral accent - so as to procure door codes and the location of keycards. You can see all these approaches in the game's new trailer, below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week ended with a dire flood of layoffs in the games industry, including Sega, Ubisoft, Blizzard, and Epic games. Unfortunately, this week seems to be following the trend – Team17, developer of the Worms series, and publisher of games like Blasphemous, Dredge, and more, has announced layoffs as well, according to Eurogamer.
The job losses, which are due to a "company restructure," will eliminate about 50 positions from the company, and the majority of those positions will be in the publisher's QA department. Eurogamer also reports the news was delivered to employees during an emergency town hall meeting this morning.
In addition to members of the QA team, Team17 CEO Michael Pattison will also be stepping down, according to a statement received by VG247. This stands in sharp contrast to many other recent layoffs, where executives had been exempt from cost-cutting measures. You can read the full statement below.
For more on the recent wave of layoffs, read about how Sega canceled several upcoming games and how Epic laid off over 800 people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the frozen hellscape of Frostpunk, you eked out your existence in hours and days, clinging to your heat- and life-giving generator at the centre of your fledgling city like there was literally no tomorrow. In 11 bit Studio's forthcoming sequel, Frostpunk 2, the apocalypse is yesterday's news. Now you're dealing with "what happens when you survive the un-survivable," as the game's co-director and design director Jakub Stokalski neatly puts it when I sit down for a hands off presentation at this year's Gamescom. And to do this, Frostpunk 2 is going big, measuring its time not in days, but weeks, months and even years.
"If we want to show the evolution of societies and different utopias/dystopias, we need breathing room," says Stokalski. "And this breathing room really is in the scale, both in the physical sense but also in the sense of time. It's difficult to show meaningful social change in the space of a month, so the time ticks now in weeks and months, and in a long playthrough you'll get up into years, so you can see the consequences of your choices."

It's a game that's been on my radar since earlier this year: both because I love most anything related to pirates and because, well, Bilkins' Folly looks great. Between its visuals, throwback gameplay, nautical tunes, and modern reimaginings of old-school adventure gameplay, it caught my attention. And now it's finally out!
I spoke to developer Webbysoft, who is mostly just one person based in Australia, about Bilkins' Folly ahead of the game's release over email. We discussed the game's inspiration, the challenges of the adventure genre, the game's gibberish language, how the idea of it came from a missing wedding ring, and much more.

We quite enjoyed it, and you can find out why in Game Informer's Payday 3 review. Despite our enjoyment, many players encountered severe matchmaking issues that made it tough to play the game given its always-online nature.

Now there's a new mini-campaign expansion on the way. The Elder Veil adds a spear, a grappling hook, and a new mini-campaign.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Boomer shooter" is a recent video game genre term used to describe contemporary games that exist as throwbacks to the Doom-inspired era of first-person shooters where speed and firepower are everything. Phantom Fury is not the first game to explore this playground, and it likely won't be the last, but playing the demo left a good first impression. The visuals are cool, the shooting feels good, and protagonist Shelly “Bombshell” Harrison is not afraid to throw out a good one-liner when the mood strikes her.
Phantom Fury is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC sometime this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Mortal Kombat 1 on the horizon, we're revisiting the entry that set the series on its current trajectory: 2011's Mortal Kombat (aka MK 9). Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. 
After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. 
Part 1 - Surpr-iced! 
Part 2 - Bringing The Smoke
Part 3 - Staff Meeting
Part 4 - My Life As A Lin Kuei Robot

On YouTube, the game frequently resurfaces via longplays, speedruns, and retrospective essays that garner respectable amounts of views year after year. A few months ago, the game's lead designer told GamesRadar that he would support an official remake, mentioning that Hit & Run continues to be The Simpsons' most popular video game adaptation on Metacritic.
Yet Hit & Run's sustained relevance is, on its surface, a bit of an enigma. You'd be hard-pressed to find the game included in any critical canons or best-of lists, and there's hardly been a shortage of T-rated open-world games since its release. But for many, the game isn't just a source of nostalgia today; it was an introduction to a wholly new form of in-game self-expression. I looked into the still-growing community keeping it alive today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FSR 3, AMD’s framerate-roiding answer to DLSS 3 frame generation, is ready to roll in its first supporting games. Great! Except these are currently limited to tedious magic shooters Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum, which is less great. 
Regardless, this could be a major moment for basically any modern graphics card that isn’t an Nvidia RTX 40 series model. FSR 3’s Fluid Motion Frames system works in a broadly similar manner to DLSS 3, piecing together whole new frames outside of the usual GPU rendering pipeline and slipping them onto your screen between the 'real' frames. The result (in theory – I’ll be trying FSR 3 out in depth next week) is higher FPS with no extra strain on your PC, and unlike Nvidia’s frame generation, it doesn’t need any specialist hardware to work.  Therefore older cards, as well as recent AMD GPUs like the RX 7700 XT and RX 7800 XT, could get a new lease of life in games that support it.

While publisher Epic Games attributed the decision to economic factors - citing previous “pricing alignment” in countries including the UK over the summer - the move will follow hundreds of job losses at the company, partially as the result of lower than expected revenue for their immensely popular battle royale shooter.

Now that's what I call a plunging frame-rate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the Nintendo Direct the other week, a single game stood head and shoulders above the rest for me. It wasn't Super Mario Wonder (though that does look pretty all right for a 2D Mario game), and it wasn't F-Zero 99 (which I sort of instantly dismissed as a cheap cash-in on that most excellent of neglected Nintendo racing games but have since been told is also quite good). Rather, it was the news that the insta-sit-up-and-pay-attention pairing of Atlus and Vanillaware were making a new fantasy tactics RPG called - wait for it - Unicorn Overlord, and woah nelly, it looks absolutely incredible. Vanillaware games have always been a feast for the eyes - see Muramasa: The Demon Blade on Wii and more recently 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim on PS4 and Switch - and the thought of marrying those lovely visuals with what appears to be a pixel art mash-up of Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem? Yes please and thank you. 
I was all ready to gush about it in a news post and whack it straight into our release date calendar when I first saw it. But then my heart sank. The press release for it came through, and despite it launching on literally every other console including the Nintendo Switch, PC was not among them. My heart. It was broken.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh god, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm trying to fix it. Oh, hello everybody! Welcome to the fourth chapter of the great Starfield no-planets run, in which my character, rancid astro-buccaneer Mary Read, tries to play the entirety of Bethesda's so-big-it's-small RPG in space. When last we caught up with this galloping galactic nuisance, Mary was beginning to lose momentum. She had grown weary of happy-slapping freighter after freighter, though there's one particular wandering geologist she'd like to settle the score with. She had even lost her enthusiasm for boarding actions - the spice in every pirate's cup of grog - having mastered the art of standing at the bottom of a ladder. 


I've spent the past few days trying to cook up a proper endgame objective for Mary - some mad caper befitting a legendary space pirate and her rowdy crew of turncoats and tearaways, who absolutely aren't a bunch of corpses Mary has arranged into sitting postures and decorated with buckets. And in my desperation, I have turned to the forbidden magic of Starfield console commands - a hundred or more deceptively homely lines of text which, when typed into Starfield's in-game console (hit the tilde or @ key), can be used to perform impossible feats, like unlocking all the game's powers or becoming immortal. My initial hope was to solidify the game's weirdly intangible asteroids somehow, and build outposts on them. It's been a couple hours since then, and well, everything has gone awonk. I'm not even playing Starfield anymore. Instead, I am playing a very special, inadvertent Starfield mod of my own devising. Working title: "Totally Fucked".

I've reviewed a half-dozen of their speakers over the years, and each one has been impressive. 
I'm currently recommending Edifier's R2000DB and S3000PRO speakers over at Eurogamer, but today an even more affordable model is on sale at Amazon US: the R1700BTs. These 2.0 bookshelf speakers normally go for $199, but today you can apply a $40 coupon on the product page to bring these speakers down to... $159, if my maths are correct. That's a solid deal for speakers that come with a litany of positive critic and user reviews.

Except, of course, that the vast majority of those reviews are for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, a game that is no longer playable. If you filter the reviews to just yesterday and today, you'll find that there have been 3450 of them, just 59% of which are positive, which would give Counter-Strike 2 a rating of "Mixed".

Epic had acquired SuperAwesome in 2020. 250 people will be leaving Epic as a result of these divestitures.

It's a most joyous day, then (as much as it can be on a day like today), to hear that solo developer Grapefrukt will soon be back with another ball-bouncing beaut in the form of Subpar Pool, which is coming to PC (and phones) on October 12th.

While it might sound complex, the worlds these orbs contain steer you carefully towards a clear goal every time: solve the problem, then grab your orb on the way out. Before you know it, you're carrying orbs within orbs and you're unravelling a cosmic mystery where the floor might be a biomechanical stingray or the path forward a spinal cord composed of ferns. I am convinced everyone should spring to action and hoist an orb on their shoulders. I couldn't put mine down.

The abstract environmental puzzle game has become its own genre in recent years, with some telling stories that are strange but easy to parse and others being so opaque that the player can ascribe almost any meaning to what is transpiring on screen. On this difficult-to-define spectrum, Cocoon lands on the latter half of the scale. I basically never had any idea why I was doing what I was doing or what the larger goal was, but I didn’t mind for a moment because the puzzles scratch your brain so effectively that I was always eager to complete wh…]]></summary>

Gaming franchises need to evolve to stay relevant. Whether it's expanding on certain mechanics or overhauling quality-of-life features, any great series that's been around as long as Bomberman is forced to make changes or be left in the dust. Unfortunately for Super Bomberman R 2, the changes it makes to the formula are mostly unsuccessful. While games with your friends can be thrilling, online play is hit-or-miss, and its story mode is a huge letdown. I respect Konami for trying new things with Bomberman. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a child of the early internet, games like Hypnospace Outlaw can't help but resonate quite deeply with me. This was the internet as I remembered it, goddamnit, and the fact it mixed in a compelling corporate conspiracy story in between its pages was just the icing on an already fine cake (in GIF form, naturally, with a MIDI tune of Vivaldi's Four Seasons blaring out from your internet browser for good measure). But in revisiting Hypnospace for this month's RPS Game Club, there was one page in particular that really brought the rose-tinted shutters down on me. It was beautiful, lovely April, Hypnospace's virtual pet hamster, who can live, snooze and poop on your desktop, and maybe turn a slightly sickly shade of green if you don't pay enough attention to her.  
As with most things in Hypnospace, I can only assume that April and her fellow gaggle of virtual pet friends are riffs on real-life virtual pet games Catz and Dogz from the late 90s, which, yes, as a ten-year-old girl at the time, I was absolutely obsessed with. Developed by the now defunct PF Magic, Catz and Dogz 3 were arguably two of my most formative PC games growing up, and cor, I miss those dumb beasts so very much.

This time it’s Amazon Prime Big Deal Days, it’s happening this October, and god, I am so, so very tired of writing about these things.
Still, as much as Prime Big Deal Days is sillily named and oddly timed (is Black Friday not just a month later?), it may yet prove useful as a source of cheap PC gaming hardware. Amazon sales usually are, with SSDs, gaming mice, keyboards, and even graphics cards reliably among their discounted wares. Here’s everything we know so far, and some tips for the big day(s) on how to secure the best stuff and avoid shady rip-off tactics.

Originally set to release on October 24 alongside the PC version, the team has delayed the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions of the game to spring of next year. The PC version will still launch next month. 
As for why, Colossal Order says in an update made on Twitter that the team needs more time to reach quality targets it has set for the console release. 
"Mayors, we're hard at work getting the game ready for release," the update reads. "We've come to realize that we need more time to reach the quality targets set for console. We want to provide the best experience for our players, we're updating the release window for Xbox & PS5 to Spring 2024."

It also says it is updating the minimum and recommended PC specs as optimization work continues, and that it will share more updates on the console release window soon. 
Cities: Skylines II hits PC on October 24. The PS5 and Xbox Series X versions will be released sometime next spring.

More specifically, Lord of Nothing hits consoles and PC on November 21. This DLC takes players to brand new locations, introduces new characters, and tasks players with taking down new foes. It continues the story of Sendri and Rekarth, and where we last saw them in the Through the Ashes DLC, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega, the publisher behind next month's Sonic Superstars, has canceled some unannounced titles in development and Creative Assembly's first-person shooter, Hyenas. The company cites "lower profitability of the European region." 
As a result of the lower profitability, Sega reviewed various in-development projects from its developers in Europe and the result is the cancelation of Hyenas, which just finished up a closed beta on PC less than a week ago, and some other unannounced games. Eurogamer reports that layoffs at Creative Assembly are expected in the wake of this decision. 


"We will implement reduction of various fixed expenses at several group companies in relevant region, centered on the Creative Assembly Ltd.," a Sega press release reads. "We expect to incur one-time expenses related to reduction of fixed expenses. We will continue to consider measures to improve profitability in European bases apart from above. We will announce the specific details and impact from them as soon as we make a decision." 
Sega says as a result of this structural reform, it expects to record losses of approximately 14.3 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, but that "there are no changes to the full-year consolidated operating results forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, at this time." 
Sega revealed Hyenas as a first-person multiplayer, multi-team heist shooter experience set in space with a punky comic book aesthetic in 2022. It has been playable in recent closed betas.]]></summary>

Is this kind of like when Prince of Persia went all edgelord with Warrior Within? Do I need to call Mintrocket's parents and ask for an intervention?


Thing is, if you take a step back from each game they're actually very similar. Both are fundamentally about scouring dangerous places for resources and ferrying them back to a safe area where you can sell them off. Both pit you, a mediocre human, against strange and unearthly creatures. Both are sort of about redeeming scenario concepts we all hate - in Dave the Diver's case, the water level, and in Nakwon's case, the stealth mission. See, this is practically a remake! Let's have a look at the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced earlier this year and releasing about four days shy of its promised Summer release window (the first day of Fall was September 23), Counter-Strike 2 is now suddenly available on Steam. You can check out the game's launch trailer below.


The game has been playable in limited test form for some time, and rumors were swirling that the game would release soon, but it is still a surprise to see the game suddenly available on Steam. It has taken over Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's spot on Steam and functions as an update to that game.
Below you will find some details from a press release for the game's official release.
Built on the Source 2 engine, Counter-Strike 2 is modernized with realistic physically-based rendering, state of the art networking, and upgraded Community Workshop tools.
In addition to the classic objective-focused gameplay that Counter-Strike pioneered in 1999, Counter-Strike 2 features:
All-new CS Ratings with the updated Premier mode
Global and Regional leaderboards
Upgraded and overhauled maps
Game-changing dynamic smoke grenades
Tick-rate-independent gameplay
Redesigned visual effects and audio
All items from CS:GO moving forward to CS2

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation head Jim Ryan is leaving the company, according to a press release from Sony Interactive Entertainment. Ryan has served as president and CEO since his appointment in 2018. Ryan’s tenure at Sony spans nearly 30 years, during which he’s held numerous leadership roles, including serving as the head of Sony Europe after former SIEE president Andrew House passed the torch in 2011.
Why Is Jim Ryan Leaving Sony?
"I’ve found it increasingly difficult to reconcile living in Europe and working in North America," Ryan said in the press release. "I will leave having been privileged to work on products that have touched millions of lives across the world; PlayStation will always be part of my life, and I feel more optimistic than ever about the future of SIE. I want to thank Yoshida-san for placing so much trust in me and being an incredibly sensitive and supportive leader."
Ryan remains at the company until March 2024. Effective April 1, 2024, Sony Group Corporation President, COO, and CFO Hiroki Totoki will step in as SIE’s interim CEO, reporting to Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida. Effective October 2023, Sony Interactive Entertainment will appoint Totoki as chairman to aid PlayStation ahead of Ryan’s exit.]]></summary>

Most offered live football streams, so not exactly great news for Hollywood, but factors other than copyright may have played a role.

Capcom released Resident Evil 4 remake earlier this year, and despite missing some of the original’s most memorable moments, it was a deserved critical hit. It’s a fantastic, updated reimaging of Leon’s original horrific adventure through an approximation of rural Spain. Separate Ways is represents a different remake, putting players in control of Ada Wong and reexamining the expansion initially added to the PlayStation 2 version of Resident Evil 4 in 2005.

        <updated>2023-09-27T17:09:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix announced in 2021 that it was developing an animated Tomb Raider series starring Lara Croft. Shortly after, Netflix revealed that Hayley Atwell, whom you might recognize as Grace from this year's Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning or as Peggy Carter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, would voice Lara Croft in the series. Today, Netflix released our first look at the series, which is called Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft. 
There's no word on when to expect the series, but Netflix says it's coming to the subscription streaming service soon. 
Check out the Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft teaser trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the teaser above, this take on Lara Croft seemingly follows the recent Crystal Dynamics Tomb Raider reboot trilogy that concluded with 2018's Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Back in 2021, when Netflix announced Atwell's role in the show, it confirmed the series would take place after the events of that trilogy. Looking at this teaser, it's hard to say whether or not that's the case. But it sounds like we won't have to wait long to find out since Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft is expected to hit Netflix soon. 
In the meantime, check out the teaser trailer for Netflix's Devil May Cry anime series released today as well. In terms of new Tomb Raider games, the first three PlayStation 1 titles are getting remastered next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has revealed the first look at its Devil May Cry anime series coming to the subscription streaming service soon. First announced in 2018, it is being developed by Capcom, Studio Mir, and Netflix's Castlevania executive producer Adi Shankar. 
Netflix announced this anime today with a short teaser trailer that gives us our first look at its Dante, who is, of course, escaping a would-be death by sword while firing off bullets from his two trademark pistols. The short snippets of animation we see in the teaser look great, just like Netflix's Castlevania series and its upcoming Castlevania: Nocturne anime, and you can check it out for yourself below: 


Netflix revealed little else about the show although it did call today's teaser a "SSStylish first look." There is no release date for Netflix's Devil May Cry but Netflix says it's coming soon. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Devil May Cry 5 review and then watch this trailer for Netflix's Castlevania: Nocturne after that.

That's because PlayStation Plus subscribers can add Dead Space spiritual successor, The Callisto Protocol, to their libraries alongside Weird West and the ultra-terrifying Farming Simulator 22. All three games can be added to libraries starting next week on Tuesday, October 3, and players have until Monday, November 6, to do so. 
Below, we've included snippets of what PlayStation has to say about each game alongside our reviews (when applicable): 
The Callisto Protocol 
Game Informer's review
Weird West
Game Informer's review
Farming Simulator 22
Before all three of these games go live for PlayStation Plus members next week, subscribers still have time to add this month's offerings – Saints Row, Black Desert: Traveler Edition, and Generation Zero – to their libraries.

Unlike the Tides of the Foscari DLC that was released earlier this year for $2, this Whiteout update will be free on all platforms where you can play Vampire Survivors. 
"It's the first trailer for Whiteout, the new free update we're working on (patch v1.7)," Poncle's announcement tweet reads. "Get ready for a frosty new stage, a new character, weapon, and more. Coming soon to all platforms."

Lego sets represent an ideal, if monstrously expensive, solution. I can build the thing without having to make all the constituent parts of it. I've recently gotten well into the modular city sets, to the extent that I look up discontinued sets on eBay and other such secondhand vendors. I don't actually get sets very often, but last week I built a police station, which can slot next to the bookshop I got for my last birthday. And while the bookshop has cute details - like a book called Moby Brick with a white block leaping from the sea on the cover, and an attic flat with a pet iguana in a glass tank - the copshop has some secret secrets that are the Lego equivalent of leaving a skeleton in a toilet stall. But better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!
Dark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.
This time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. 
Our reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The day has come. We are super happy to announce public beta testing for the iOS port of ScummVM in the store. Yes, you read it right! Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. 
If you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.
We truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.
