        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Are you tiny Thor, god of tiny hammers?".
Tiny Thor from Asylum Square has been a long time coming. After one of its lead developers came up with a rough cut of its concept in a 48-hour game jam in 2012, its development proceeded in fits and starts for a little over a decade before it finally saw release this past June. Games that spend that long in development hell can be notoriously uneven, but we’re happy to report that Tiny Thor has proven to be worth the wait. This is a tough, gorgeous, and altogether great retro platformer that you ought to consider picking up.
The 16-bit-inspired game follows the adventures of the titular Asgardian warrior during a time long before he was the buff, long-haired hero you all know—the story here opens on his eighth birthday. As a present, Odin gifts him the legendary Mjolnir hammer, which Thor immediately takes to. While he’s out fooling around with his new toy, the boy is approached by a certain mischievous individual, who tricks him into destroying the anchor of the Bifrost, cutting off all of Asgard from Midgard. Joined by his father’s ravens, Tiny Thor thus sets out to repair the damage and prevent Ragnarök from causing the end of the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And Nintendo reconfirms its interest in future films.
The most recent Nintendo financial report is packed full of sales figures for games and consoles alike, but let's not forget that the Big-N is now in the world of films too. On a note about expanding the company's IP, the report revealed the viewing numbers from The Super Mario Bros. Movie's box office which is estimated (by Universal Pictures) to have pulled in a whopping 168.10 million viewers.
This will likely come as no surprise. The Mario Movie was breaking records straight out of the gate, quickly becoming the highest-grossing video game adaptation after just one week. It has since gone on to become one of the biggest animated movies of all time with a box office taking of $1.349 billion, according to the report — Nintendo describes this as "the second-highest for an animated film" though figures from Box Office Mojo place the 2019's The Lion King and Frozen 2 above it.

"They will never get us down," the operator says, adding that moving to the Tor network remains an option as well.

Updated with sales figures from Nintendo's Q1 FY23 financial report - enjoy!

At the time of writing, the Switch has the highest number of software sales of any Nintendo console, ever, with over one billion games sold on the platform since March 2017. What's more, its lead is so commanding that it will likely hold this pole position for a good few years to come (unless there is a sudden surge in sales for DS games around the corner that nobody saw coming).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Return Of The Obra Dinn is, quite rightly, one of the greatest video games of all time. It's certainly one of my personal favourites, and as this year's RPS 100 has proven, it's also greatly beloved by the rest of the RPS Treehouse. A brilliantly conceived murder mystery puzzle box (boat?) that not only has you working out whodunnit, but howdunnit, Obra Dinn is one of those detective games that really thrusts you into the thick of its deduction process. As you set about working out the identities and causes of death for each of the 60 souls onboard, it places you firmly in front of the ship's wheel before giving you free rein to steer its hull of supernatural horrors into whatever port of judgment you deem fit. 
There are no truly wrong answers in Obra Dinn, but due to the nature of how you go about solving it, it's also one of those games I can't play too often without feeling like I know all the answers already. It's only now, five years later, that I feel like I could probably go back to Lucas Pope's nautical masterpiece and marvel at it afresh on a second playthrough, but there's one particular set of crew unmaskings that even its time-travelling stopwatch can't erase from my memory banks. Spoilers to follow obviously, but if you know, you know. I'm talking about the shoe and hammock revelation.

Nintendo's financial report for the first quarter of FY2024 shows some pretty big numbers for the likes of Tears of the Kingdom and the Switch family of systems as a whole, but another name that has continued to climb in the rankings over the past few months is Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, which has pulled in an impressive 22.66 million sales as of 30th June 2023.
This is a clear slowdown from the games' launch — remember, the titles shifted 20 million in the first six weeks alone — but the numbers do move Scarlet and Violet ever closer to breaking into the top three best-selling games in the series.

Given that we've already reported on the incredible numbers achieved by The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, it should really come as no surprise to see the sequel make its way into the top ten, bumping Ring Fit Adventure out of the runnings. Not only that, but Super Mario Odyssey has climbed the ranks to come in at number five this time, undoubtedly boosted by the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.

One of the most anticipated games coming to the Switch this month is Vampire Survivors - an indie roguelite bullet shooter, where it's your job to survive against multiple waves of enemies by levelling up and unlocking powerful attacks.
While the only versions are for Xbox, PC and mobile devices right now, there's actually another one that's never actually been revealed until now. It's called 'Vampire Survivors - Directer's Cut' and is "drastically different to the base game" according to video game journalist Laura Kate Dale, who was given special access to it, during a media event for the co-op mode.

Larian Studios recommends players kill a few minutes of their nigh-endless wait to perform a few file management tasks to ensure the best-possible Baldur's Gate 3 experience upon release.
Larian says that it has taken measures to ensure a smooth transition either way, but the company still recommends players perform these three simple tasks before playing the final game: delete your old saves, uninstall the Early Access, and remove any mods.
"Your Early Access saves and player profiles aren’t compatible with the release version of Baldur’s Gate 3, and leaving them in your save folders may in some fringe cases cause issues," Larian says. Here are their outlined steps for taking care of e…]]></summary>

With Charizard serving as the figurehead Pokémon for this expansion, it's sure to be a popular release given that particular Pocket Monster's history with the TCG. 
This expansion continues building on the Scarlet and Violet games with even more Paldean species but also adds type-shifted Tera Pokémon ex. This mechanic recalls the Delta Species mechanic from the early 2000s, where the strongest form of a Pokémon could be of a different type than its evolutionary chain. However, type-shifted Tera Pokémon ex actually make sense within the context of the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet games, as Tera Pokémon often change types when they Terastallize.

The developers at Singularity 6 invited me to jump in and take a look at Palia ahead of its closed beta launch today. Excited for the opportunity to make some friends and go fishing, I pounced on the offer.
After a few days of casually exploring and immersing myself in the world of Palia, I've come to the following conclusion: Palia is exactly what it advertises it is. A cozy experience that focuses on the social aspects of playing a community-driven game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Released on April 28, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor has been a success for Electronic Arts and Respawn Entertainment, earning both critical and commercial acclaim. Although it originally skipped the last-gen consoles, the EA first-quarter earnings call revealed that Respawn has PS4 and Xbox One ports on the way for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. As the released EA report brief reveals, the company is looking to continue capitalizing on its financially well-performing franchises, including Star Wars Jedi.
[caption id="attachment_375326" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
EA is not done with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor yet
As reported by The Verge, EA CEO Andrew Wilson announced during the earnings call that Star Wars Jedi: Survivor will come to PS4 and Xbox One, though a release date wasn't mentioned. This is an unexpected turn of events, as in an interview with PLAY Magazine (as reported by Game Rant) game director Stig Asmussen had previously stated that Jedi: Survivor was skipping last-gen consoles to ensure a "true new-gen experience in the Star Wars universe."
The financial report points to Star Wars Jedi and FIFA as the catalysts for its first-quarter performance. It highlights that in addition to attracting millions of players globally, Jedi: Survivor is also “seeing players spend more time in-game than its predecessor.” FIFA was noted for “delivering a record Q1 for the franchise,” and this comes as the series undergoes massive rebranding following the end of EA’s partnership with FIFA. The next entry in the series will be titled EA Sports FC 24.
Respawn has continually been working on the game since its launch, with patches being released to improve performance on all gaming platforms. Time will tell how developers will manage to ensure smooth performance on the dated last-gen consoles.

Whether it's the central mechanic or a big part of character customisation and building, cooking has become a staple not just in the kitchen, but in many Switch titles. Cooking Mama is one of the first big titles to put cooking at the centre of gameplay, but it's also handy for when you need a quick bit of healing while out in the open world of Hyrule.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["The days of Destiny 2 cheaters being free to engage in a wholesale assault on the Destiny 2 game and its community without fear of consequences are over." That's Bungie's opening gambit in a brand-new lawsuit filed in a U.S. court this week. Alleging copyright infringement, DMCA violations, and civil RICO violations, among others, the complaint targets up to 50 developers, marketers, customer support staff, and sellers of Destiny 2 cheating software, Ring-1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tekken 8 was originally announced in 2022, and a Closed Network Test was recently released on multiple platforms in July. To the dismay of the developers, some gamers have since cracked the CNT to play it in unintended ways. Bandai Namco is warning players against playing Tekken 8's cracked CNT, and those caught could face consequences.
[caption id="attachment_392950" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid.[/caption]
Be patient or risk a ban
Players with the cracked CNT can not only play the game offline, but continue to play it beyond the test period. In a Twitter post, Bandai Namco warned that this violates its Terms of Service and the Tekken World Tour's Code of Conduct.
https://twitter.com/BNEesports/status/1685978121948770305
Unauthorized access to the CNT could result in a ban from the upcoming Tekken World Tour and other official tournaments. In other words, competitive players may want to heed this warning. It is understandable why developers would emphasis this penalty in particular. Those playing the cracked version would have a headstart on practice, which could affect the results of official tournaments.
This isn't the only problem the CNT has caused, as it has also resulted in Tekken 8's partial roster leaking. Though Bandai Namco has officially announced 16 characters, the leak reveals a longer list of playable fighters.
It has certainly been a good time for fighting game fans. Street Fighter 6 launched to critical acclaim in June, and Mortal Kombat 1 will launch on September 19. Bandai Namco has not yet revealed a release date for Tekken 8.

Sonic Superstars takes us back to the 2D era of the franchise, where the gameplay is more straightforward, the story premises are simpler, and the character roster is small. That's certainly the case for the playable roster, featuring just Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy, but it's also true for the villain roster. Sonic Superstars sees the return of Dr. Eggman, as well as Fang the Hunter (previously known as Nack the Weasel and Fang the Sniper) from Sonic Triple Trouble and Sonic the Fighters, but they're not alone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crawly Games has announced that their deckbuilder horror game, Draft of Darkness, is leaving Steam Early Access and going full version on August 23, 2023.
If you’ve never heard of Draft of Darkness, just look at it. It’s like if Pit-Fighter had a personality beyond just “oiled beef.” It has grainy, digitized actors fighting with grainy, unspeakable horrors in rusty lo-fi locales. It has just the right mixture of goofy and sleaze that makes it seem like a lost PS1 game from the creators of Chiller. Ugh, I suddenly have the urge to play Loaded.
https://youtu.be/9sZE1xr7wvI
Draft of Darkness was actually billed to me as Slay the Spire meets Resident Evil. It’s an ammo-focused turn-based deckbuilder where you recruit survivors and battle monsters and government robots. It uses a roguelite system. Maps are procedurally generated, and you keep advancing until you’re overwhelmed by the darkness. You gain credits that can buy booster packs after each run, allowing you to build up your arsenal over time.
It also has a “meta-story progression system.” They say, “Every decision can alter the story's outcome and allow for new ways to progress. Different choices are available in each run, but be careful; some will have serious consequences.”
I’ve recently had some success when it comes to clicking with deckbuilders recently, and this looks right up my alley. I mean, 90% of that statement comes from just looking at the visuals. It’s like pixelated poetry to me.
Draft of Darkness is available right now for PC on Steam Early Access. The full version 1.0 will hit on August 23, 2023.

Life sims can be great stress relievers by letting you build a digital life from the ground up at a leisurely pace. However, many of those titles offer freeform experiences where more purpose-driven players may struggle with having to make their own fun. Palia aims to satisfy both crowds by tossing dozens of players into a fleshed-out fantasy world to build a life while also embarking on an epic quest. I made a new life for myself within developer Singularity 6’s upcoming free-to-play life sim MMO. While much of it feels familiar, the promise of building a home alongside friends while unraveling a central mystery is enticing for the genre.

However, being overshadowed by your siblings is no bad thing, as the 7900X3D has fallen significantly further in price, bringing it back into contention for users that want a lot of cores for content creation tasks and excellent gaming performance. It launched at $600 and now retails for $510, but today on Ebay you can get this processor for just $439 - an amazing price. You even get a free copy of Starfield in the bargain.

That update was noticed by the Starfield Beyond Twitter account, a profile that (as the name heavily implies) chronicles all things related to Bethesda's upcoming space epic. The Starfield store page does currently have the tag.
https://twitter.com/starfieldbeyond/status/1686137526010908673?
To infinity, and – wait, wrong franchise
For those who don't know, Play Anywhere lets you own a game on Xbox and Windows-based PCs at no additional cost. This also means your saves will carry over between systems, so you could literally start playing on one and smoothly transition to the other without any fuss.
With Starfield offering the Xbox Play Anywhere feature, it pretty much means you can have two copies of the game with one purchase. Maybe not everyone will benefit from being able to switch playing "Skyrim in space" between console and PC, but it's a neat little bonus if you're into that sort of thing.
I think it's safe to say we're pretty much ready for Starfield now. We've had everything from the game's PC specs to a 1,000-page compendium outlining as much info as possible. Seems like all that's left is for the game to launch. And it's not far off either. Starfield will touch down on Xbox Series X|S and PC on September 6, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The upcoming reimagining of Alone in the Dark is getting a limited Collector's Edition. A post over on THQ's website says there's only going to be 5,000 of these made worldwide, so you might want to get in quick if you want one.
The Collector's Edition will feature a fair amount of bonus material, including both a statue and miniature, a steelbook case for the game, some DLC (which includes the Derceto 1992 costume pack), and more. You can check out the trailer for this special edition below.

Return to the dark
We all know that Resident Evil is one of the most influential survival horror series of all time. However, Alone in the Dark actually predates Capcom's legendary franchise by four years.
The first Alone in the Dark game set the scene for the genre and while it's massively dated now, it's been cemented in gaming history as a landmark part of horror. Sadly, subsequent releases and attempts at reboots haven't had much of an impact, being overshadowed by other games that have come after it.
However, Alone in the Dark is making another comeback. A recent video uploaded to publisher THQ Nordic's YouTube page gives a brief teaser of the upcoming title, which is being developed by Magicka 2 studio Pieces Interactive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtrvT7aDL1s
While previous attempts at bringing Alone in the Dark into the modern world have not gone down well, horror fans will still be looking forward to this entry.
With Killing Eve's Jodie Comer and Stranger Things' David Harbour on board (not to mention a story crafted by Amnesia and SOMA writer Mikael Hedberg), there's enough intrigue here to hopefully give the iconic horror series another crack at video game modernity.
Alone in the Dark is due for release on October 25, and will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

This headcrab and zombie-infested cess pit is an absolute horror show right from the off. Moans and screeches assault your ears from every nook and cranny of this dark murder hole, and if the hoarse crow calls and suspiciously high number of propane barrels weren't enough to put you off, the bloodied torsos lodged against its log cabin walls by deep set saw blades certainly will. Every fibre of your being is telling you to get the hell out of this place, and that surely, the Combine forces chasing you down here can't be worse than what's in front of you. 
But I'd also add an addendum to that heading that goes something like this: "We don't go to Ravenholm, and definitely not with just a gravity gun." This is a place that demands you to have as much firepower as you can possibly muster, such are the monstrosities that lie in wait here. But what did baby Katharine decide to do when she was playing it alone on her terrible university laptop in the dead of night back in 2010? She decided to have a go at that old Zombie Chopper achievement for no good reason whatsoever. And what followed was even more horrifying than Ravenholm had any right to be.

And now, the voice actor behind Baldur’s Gate 3’s narrator has posted several outtakes, giving us gems such as “I’m a bard, I can fuck my way through any problem.” Have a listen here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lords of the Rings: Gollum launched in May with myriad issues, making it tough to play through at various points throughout the action-adventure game. Head here to read Game Informer's Gollum review. However, developer Daedalic Entertainment is targeting many of those problems in the game’s PC version with a new patch that’s now live. 
Daedalic published an extensive list of changes for the PC version on the Gollum Steam page. It’s unclear if any of these changes are coming to the game’s console versions, but Game Informer reached out to Daedalic to ask and will update this story if it hears back. As for the PC patch, it includes changes that fix issues with quest markers disappearing, interactable objects becoming non-interactable, checkpoint system bugs, and much more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After passing its latest Kickstarter stretch goal.
The Switch is home to a good selection of rhythm games, but one series that has never made it over to Nintendo systems is the Sony-published Patapon — which began life back in the PSP. It's unlikely that we will ever see that series on Switch, but it looks like we will soon have its spiritual successor as the development team has opened up funding for their next project, Ratatan, which has now passed its console stretch goal.
Much like the team's former series, Ratatan is a rhythm-based side-scrolling adventure game where you will take command of an adorable army and send them out against oncoming foes by keeping to the pulsating beat. The Ratatan leaders each possess different skills, so you will have to combine the toe-tapping rhythm controls with a level of tactical thinking to make the most of each run and sacrifice as few troops as possible.

        <updated>2023-08-02T15:00:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead by Daylight is one of those games that wears its horror influences on its sleeve. We've already seen Behaviour Interactive's asymmetrical survival game crossover with franchises like Resident Evil and Silent Hill. We've also recently been treated to Nicolas Cage, so anything's possible with this game. Now, it's the Alien franchise's turn to get the Dead by Daylight collaboration treatment.
A recent teaser over on the official YouTube channel shows that the Xenomorph will be coming to Dead by Daylight. No date on when this will actually be happening has been announced, but the short clip says we can "learn more on August 8."
https://youtu.be/8h6BLFUkbeM
Suffice it to say, if you're a fan of Dead by Daylight and of the Alien films (or at least two of them), then this update is going to be right up your dark and dingy corridor.
In space, no one can hear you crank a generator
Since releasing in 2016, Dead by Daylight has become a force to be reckoned with in the horror community. If you haven't had a chance to play it, essentially the game involves four players trying to survive against one player who takes on the role of the killer on a murderous rampage.
Some notable villains and survivors from the world of horror have been implemented over the years, including Ghost Face from the Scream franchise, Evil Dead's Ash, and even the creepy girl from The Ring.
The game became so popular that a Dead by Daylight movie adaptation is currently in the pipeline from famed production company Blumhouse. We all know that video games being translated to the big screen isn't always the best move.
However, it could be interesting to see how a co-operative multiplayer game featuring a ton of classic horror monsters will work on film. And, of course, there's the aforementioned Alien crossover to look forward to as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know about you, but I've been immensely enjoying the seeming renaissance of tower defence citybuilding games recently. The grimdark horrors of Age Of Darkness: Final Stand might be a bit too hard as nails for my personal liking, but there's something about the act of building up my little settlements and defending them against ever-larger nightly hordes that just unlocks something in my brain that says, 'Yes, more of this, please'. It's the same feeling I got from the blocky delights of Diplomacy Is Not An Option and the deckbuilding, comic-book stylings of ORX, too, but now there's a new kid that's ridden into town who I think might be the king of the lot. 
Thronefall is a more minimalist take on the citybuilder tower defender, but while its bright colours might look like the distant cousin of a Townscaper toybox (it is, after all, made by the same dev wot did the equally charming Islanders), this deadly little thing is absolutely genius. It's only just come out in early access today, but I've been having a great time with a pre-release build of it, and can feel it sinking its claws into me with every attempt at its final level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gunfire Games' Remnant 2 has been making waves since it launched on July 25. The tough co-op shooter wears its FromSoftware influence on its sleeve, which has resonated with fans and critics alike. The developers have revealed that Remnant 2 has already sold over a million copies, exceeding the first game's launch sales by a considerable amount.
[caption id="attachment_394243" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
Remnant 2 soars to the top of the charts
When Remnant: From the Ashes hit shelves in 2019, it took two months before it sold over a million copies. As Gunfire Games has announced, the sequel achieved this feat in just four days. Yoon Im of Gearbox Publishing stated that "Remnant 2 exceeded our expectations. As a commercial and critical hit, we’re incredibly proud of the Gunfire team and everyone here at Gearbox Publishing who brought this title to life."
There were early signs that Remnant 2 was gearing up for an explosive launch. Before its release, it had claimed the top spot on Steam's best-seller list, overtaking trending titles like Starfield and BattleBit Remastered. It currently sits in third place, surpassed only by Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Baldur's Gate 3. When it was finally released, it doubled the number of concurrent players its predecessor had at launch.
The high sales numbers have been accompanied by plenty of critical acclaim, with our own Steven Mills scoring it an impressive 8.5. And with its numerous secrets, we'll likely talk about this one for some time still.
Remnant 2 is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Don’t get me wrong, I'm very much a Short King myself, but I assumed the gas mask-wearing enforcers of City 17 would be more vertically intimidating. As I defiantly refuse to pick up litter in Half-Life 2’s opening sequence, I find the approaching officer and his raised electric baton to be weirdly adorable. Until he hits me, of course. The resulting crack gives me such a fright that I fling my arms out and smack my hand against the corner of a bookcase.
This has been my experience of playing the first few hours of Half-Life 2’s excellent fan-made VR mod, a completely free add-on that transforms Valve’s 2004 masterpiece into a full virtual reality experience. Under my direct control, Gordon Freeman is less a time-displaced MIT graduate with a penchant for murder and instead a gawking tourist who’s more interested in staring at canal architecture than liberating humanity. I spend the majority of my time leaning in really close to walls and muttering, “That’s interesting,” before a leaping headcrab shocks me so severely that I damage some more furniture and scare the cat.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/08/02/ea-is-developing-ps4-xbox-one-ports-of-star-wars-jedi-survivor"/>
        <updated>2023-08-02T12:38:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson has revealed that the publisher is working on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One ports of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.
He did so during EA’s company Q1 earnings call yesterday, as reported by The Verge. Survivor launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC earlier this year, in April, and received critical acclaim – Game Informer gave it a 9.25, making it a must-play game. But it skipped the PS4 and Xbox One generation that its predecessor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, launched on. 


“Thanks to the strength of this legendary franchise and community demand, our development team has committed to bringing this Jedi experience to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,” Wilson said during the call, according to The Verge. 
Fallen Order launched on PS4 and Xbox One with some technical difficulties, and while Survivor wasn’t perfect on that front, it performed a lot better on the now current-gen hardware. It will be interesting to see how it performs on the previous-gen hardware that Fallen Order had difficulties with. As for when to expect this Survivor port, it sounds like it could be a while because IGN reports that Wilson said the port is “in the early stages of development.” 
While waiting for it to hit PS4 and Xbox One one day, read Game Informer’s Star Wars Jedi: Survivor review and then read about how the game’s director wants the series to be a trilogy. Watch our video interview with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan about the sequel after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MariNo Cart.
If you hadn't already guessed, we on Team Nintendo Life love a bit of physical media. Yes, the convenience of downloading a game from the eShop is unbeatable, but if we have the chance to get one of those red-spined boxes on our shelves, we'll take it. We do have one insistence, though: those boxes have to come with a cartridge inside.
Well of course you need your cartridge, that's the most important bit, you might say, but it turns out that there have recently been multiple instances of customers buying a physical Switch game only for the box to arrive with the cart slot empty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you own Half-Life 2 but never bothered with its freebie tech demo, Half-Life 2: Lost Coast, do give it a whirl. Its showcase of HDR lighting might have lost the "Huh, nice" factor it had in 2005, but it’s still a satisfying slice of punchy HL2 combat, with a nod to the original Half-Life that Valve regretted not making in the main game. I know this because Valve told me, via Lost Coast's other innovation: its developer commentary.
I love these things, these spinning speech bubbles inflated with knowledge straight from the FPS coalface. So do Valve, judging by how dev commentary has appeared (in identical, node-activatable form) in most of their games since. They’re interesting and illuminating, don’t interfere with the game unless the player wants them to, and help build design literacy. Why, then, don’t more games offer commentary as well?

The game’s explore-a-craft-y-slasher mix gives it some flavour from Hades and V Rising, only this time with a shadowy French-folklore skin attached. An Ankou hits early access on August 17th, and I’m very excited to juggle it alongside the zillion other games dropping this month.

Nintendo has announced that it will be resuming online play for Mario Kart 8 and Splatoon for the Wii U after commencing emergency maintenance back in March 2023. Both games will be back online from August 3rd, 2023.
The titles were taken offline entirely after a potentially severe vulnerability was identified during online game sessions. As previously reported, this vulnerability was likely to be an exploit known as 'ENLBufferPwn', which effectively allowed attackers to gain access to victims' consoles via remote control.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Longtime FromSoftware composer, Yuka Kitamura, has announced via Twitter that they will be leaving FromSoftware to work as a freelancer.
Kitamura has been with FromSoftware for over a decade, first appearing in the credits as Sound Designer for 2013’s Armored Core V. Their first composer credit was for 2014’s Dark Souls II, and they would continue on as a  FromSoftware composer through Bloodborne, Dark Souls III, Sekiro, and Elden Ring.
https://twitter.com/_Yuka_Kitamura_/status/1686310080512466944?s=20
Kitamura did not say if they would continue to work with FromSoftware in a contractor’s position. However, they did go on to say, “I would like to continue to express myself in-game music through various genres of music. I hope you will look forward to my music in the future!” So, whether or not they return for the next Souls-like FromSoftware title, it sounds like they plan to remain in the games industry, just not under FromSoftware's umbrella.
It still hasn’t been said if Kitamura will be doing the soundtrack for the upcoming Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC or Armored Core 6. They have put up a new portfolio website that lists their previous credits, and neither is mentioned. However, that may just be because they haven’t been released yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was a kid growing up in rural New Mexico, I dreaded the first day of school. I had to give up whole days of biking in the desert with my brother and playing video games, sure, but the real problem was school supplies. My poor mom had to track down a huge list of supplies the school said we needed, from pencils and paper to expensive binders and calculators. Sure, back to school sales took the sting out of these mandatory purchases, but it was often a real stretch to get everything I needed, and I'd need to make friends quickly to borrow anything I didn't manage to come to school with. 
That's why I was particularly amused, a decade and a bit later, to find out that Ebay is offering 20% off back to school purchases in the US, and that category of products includes a $999 LG OLED gaming monitor. Even for a university student, that's one heck of an upgrade for the new school year - but a darn good deal if you're considering this kind of ultra-premium gaming monitor.

        <updated>2023-08-01T20:00:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look, we all want a third installment in Valve's iconic Half-Life series. But the sad truth is, it's almost certainly never going to happen. As such, we're stuck with the first two (as well as the VR game Alyx). But that's a good thing, because Half-Life 1 and 2 are exemplary first-person shooters. So loved is the series, that fans continue to tweak and mod Half-Life and Half-Life 2 to their own ends.
Take Team Vestige over on ModDB (via PCGamesN), which has taken the legendary sci-fi FPS and turned it into a horror experience. Called "Disrepair," this mod for Half-Life 2 sees the player slip into the hazard suit of a Combine worker who's been sent to investigate and photograph the radioactive anomalies that have cropped up around the Black Mesa facility.
https://youtu.be/QX-DsNWBp6g
What ensues is a short but creepy experience, not too dissimilar to the likes of Slender: The Eight Pages. The player is tasked with photographing several pieces of artifacts around the infected building, while ominous sounds drill into their ears. It also has a slight SCP vibe about it, in that internet-urban-myth kind of way. You can see YouTube user Farawaygaming diving into "Despair" above.
Take that, Ravenholm!
When you think of Half-Life, you probably don't think of the word "horror." While the games do have their more unsettling moments (the Ravenholm section in HL2 springs to mind), it's not a franchise known for scares.
That's why this Half-Life 2 mod, and others like it, are so interesting. They take something that has a very distinctive aesthetic about it and turn it into something that's fairly unsettling. With the tunnel vision-style lighting, black and white graphics, and the eerie tones of this darker side of Black Mesa, Team Vestige is just one of many reasons people keep returning to the Half-Life games after all these years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has revealed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope: Rayman in the Phantom Show, the final announced DLC coming to the Nintendo mashup strategy game that hit Switch last October. 
Shortly after the release of Sparks of Hope last year, Ubisoft announced it had three DLCs planned for the game. The first was The Tower of Doooom, which hit the game this March. Ubisoft released the second DLC, The Last Spark Hunter, last month and now, we know when DLC 3 completes the game’s post-launch roadmap because Rayman in the Phantom Show goes live on August 30. 
You can check out the Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope DLC 3: Rayman in the Phantom Show reveal trailer for yourself below: 


“Rayman is back,” the trailer’s description reads. “And he is the special guest in a new mysterious dimension: the Phantom Opera’s network studio. The Phantom, the charismatic ghostly boss of Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, is also coming back and asking for help to improve his channel’s ratings.” 
When Ubisoft revealed its post-launch content roadmap for Sparks of Hope last year, it said Rayman would be featured in DLC 3 and now, almost a year later, he’s finally here. 
Sparks of Hope’s Rayman in the Phantom Show DLC hits the game on August 30. 
While waiting for this DLC to go live, read Game Informer’s Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope review. For more Mario, check out the reveal trailer for Super Mario Bros. Wonder and then watch the Super Mario RPG remake trailer afterward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Illfonic has dropped the third free DLC pack for Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed today. It comes with a new type of ghost based on a Real Ghostbusters figure, a new level, and some new customization options from the 2016 reboot.
The new map takes place in a concert venue, the New Motion Club. It lets you bust ghosts backstage before, I assume, you then dance the night away with some of the lovely ladies who witnessed the disturbance. I’m sort of surprised it took this long to get a concert hall location, but I suppose it fits well with the DLC pack’s theme.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mountaintop Studios has released the first teaser for its in-development competitive shooter inspired by anime, manga, and comics. 
Mountaintop Studios is a relatively new studio formed in 2020 by Nate Mitchell, a co-founder of Oculus. Mitchell enlisted several others to the studio for its leadership with experience at Double Fine, Valve, Naughty Dog, Riot Games, and Blizzard Entertainment. Now, the studio has more than four dozen employees and is hard at work developing a shooter it hopes has 10,000 hours of depth and fosters incredible communities and lasting friendships. 
While its first game remains unannounced technically, Mountaintop tweeted a short teaser today with the caption, “Soon.” Hopefully, we will get more information about the game soon because this teaser looks interesting. Check it out for yourself below:

August 1, 2023
As you can see, the video teases some of the characters and locales of the game, all of which look pretty comic book-y, with a very stylized aesthetic. The symbols at the end might hint at different factions in the game, and the teaser seems to quickly highlight a few maps players will be shooting each other on. 
“For the last three years, we’ve been hard at work on our first project, a competitive shooter for those that love the genre,” a hiring post from last month reads on the studio’s website. “As we shift into production, we’re looking for more talented individuals to join our time of fully-remote veterans.
"The game is set in a brand new universe, inspired by our favorite comics, anime, and manga. It’s a world where players can build a legacy through teamwork and competition.” 

We’ll watch for more information on Mountaintop’s first game and update you on Game Informer. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's list of the top 10 shooters to play right now and then check out our top scoring reviews of 2023.

What's most important is how they set the tone of the fight and if the intractable nature of the stage is well suited to a fighting game. Let's hear the roar of the crowd and get stuck in on what makes an exciting fighting game stage.

The Xbox maker announced the controller in a blog post, revealing that the controller is available for preorder starting today. It will cost $69.99 and you can purchase it from Xbox’s online store, Microsoft stores, and some local retailers. The controller is onyx blue, with a smoky aesthetic that gives the controller a unique look in the lineup of Xbox Series X/S controllers. 
Microsoft says the design is inspired by clouds and storming skies, “with each billowing puff of vapor bringing a unique design to each controller,” hence the Stormcloud Vapor name. It features rubberized, blue diamond-pattern grips and can hook up to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One consoles, PC, mobile phones, and tablets. 
Purchasing this controller also gives you a unique Stormcloud Vapor dynamic background that you can check out in motion in the video below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Published by TinyBuild and developed by Mandragora, the cozy post-apocalyptic survival game, I Am Future, is coming to Steam Early Access on August 8. With that date fast approaching, they’ve released a new trailer highlighting all the features of it.
https://youtu.be/EHwI-4IxivY
I kept getting The Sims in the post-apocalypse vibes from the trailer, and then the hot tub showed up and cemented it. And then I kept watching and thinking, like, “Oh no, this is nothing like The Sims,” but then I just realized that it’s a lot like post-apocalypse The Sims if you took away all the other Sims and let them travel around scavenging.
So, in I Am Future, you play as Chris, potentially the only human left on Earth. And they seem kind of all right with that. I don’t blame them. Their goal is not only to survive but also to search for other survivors and try to unravel the mystery of why the world ended. You explore the sunken city, tear things apart for building materials, and build up your base of operations. You can even build robots to help you with all your chores.
I Am Future is launching into Early Access with “a part” of the main story. The goal for the team is to add new features, areas to explore, and story content over time. They state that they don’t want to keep it “in Early Access for too long,” but are unwilling to give a more detailed estimate on how long they expect it to last.
I Am Future launches into Steam Early Access on August 8. No other platforms have been announced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jujutsu Kaisen is the latest anime to crossover with Epic Games’ free-to-play battle royale, Fortnite. 
The official Fortnite Twitter account officially announced this crossover today with a quick teaser video showcasing some original characters making shadow puppets on a wall in the battle island’s Mega City locale. Shortly after, Jujutsu Kaisen’s Gojo, Megumi, Nobara, and Yuhi crash through that wall, revealing the first look at these skins in-game. 
You can check out the Jujutsu Kaisen Fortnite skins for yourself in the teaser below:


Fortnite’s anime crossovers began with Naruto in 2021, followed by Dragon Ball Z and My Hero Academia last year. While some players have criticized the visuals of some of the earlier anime characters added to Fortnite (looking at you, Goku and Vegeta), Epic Games’ creations have only become better over the years. It brought Attack On Titan characters to Fortnite this year, and those skins looked great, and these Jujutsu Kaisen skins also look good. 
As for when to expect Gojo, Megumi, Nobara, and Yuji, the Fortnite Twitter account says they hit the game alongside the release of Update 25.30, which goes live next week on August 8. 
Fortnite is no stranger to crossovers. The current season brought Transformers’ Optimus Prime to the game, and back in May, Miles Morales and Miguel O’Hara’s Spider-Men iterations hit the battle royale. That same month saw Star Wars' Anakin, Padme, Darth Maul, and more join Fortnite. And before that, Adonis Creed entered the ring shortly after Dragon Ball Super’s Piccolo and Gohan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alliance Arts has announced it will be publishing The Great Villainess: Strategy of Lily. Created by developers One or Eight (Lost Epic), WSS Playground (Needy Streamer Overload), and Alliance Art themselves, it’s a strange twist on a turn-based strategy and is coming to PC in 2024.
You play as Duchess Scarlet, who is sentenced to execution for regicide. Head still connected to her shoulders, she escapes with the help of Lily. She’s turned into a prototypical streamer with the ability to incite people into acting out. She uses her newfound powers to capture enemy commanders and intends to “break” the world.
https://youtu.be/C_OfKwzdSSA
It looks like things are still rather early in development, but the aesthetic seems to be in place and looks great. 2D characters have an ornate anime look to them, and the 3D world has a voxel appearance. The world, with its heavy depth-of-field blur, reminds me of 3D Dot Game Heroes. It’s just very bright and colorful.
There’s also some flirtation going on between Lily and Scarlet, so I’m down for that. I’m not sure about the gameplay. The combat is shown, but I can’t grok the mechanics. It kind of reminds me of that Mii samurai game on 3DS, Warriors Way. Hard to say.
I guess we’ll find out for sure when The Great Villainess: Strategy of Lily launches on PC in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're rapidly approaching the long-awaited release of Baldur's Gate 3 after an extended period of Early Access. However, Larian Studios has stated that the game won't support preloading ahead of its launch. If you've pre-ordered the game and want to jump in as soon as possible, prepare to set aside some time to download this hefty title.

Baldur's Gate 3's release date draws nearer
Baldur's Gate 3 will arrive on PC on August 3 at 5 PM CEST, and PS5 on September 6. An Xbox Series X/S port is also in development, although it has yet to receive a release date. Like other titles in the series, players will be able to create their own characters and partake in a Dungeons & Dragons-inspired campaign.
In a community update on Steam, the developers confirmed that preloading is off the table for Baldur's Gate 3. In other words, players can't install the game ahead of its release. This would have been useful for a game like Baldur's Gate 3 which will weigh approximately 122 GB.
There are a few other things Baldur's Gate 3 fans should know about. Though the game has been available in Early Access, progress made here will not transfer to the final game. Nevertheless, the game will feature cross-save capabilities, allowing you to begin your adventure on PC and continue on PS5 later if you wish.
It fortunately appears that making the game easily accessible is a priority for the developers. Those who purchase Baldur's Gate 3 for PC will receive access to both the Mac and Windows versions, though the Mac version will arrive at a later date. Larian Studios also wants the game Steam Deck Verified by launch, as it is already optimized for the handheld.
With the game's large size, players may have to wait a bit at launch before they can dive in. However, the Early Access version should give you a good idea of what to expect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Citizen Sleeper is a game with lots of brilliant individual stories in it, even the ones that end so catastrophically badly that redemption seems nigh on impossible. But when I look back on this tabletop-infused RPG and think of my favourites, there is one that stands head and shoulders above the rest. It isn't one of Citizen Sleeper's more emotional story beats (I miss ya, Lem and Mina), nor is it its most thrilling (big love to my man Feng). Rather, it's one of the game's quietest and arguably least significant plot points, but the fact it's there at all is probably what cemented Citizen Sleeper as one of my favourite games of last year. It is, of course, befriending The Stray who takes up residence in your Lowend apartment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Reptile has been hard at work on their latest title, a spiritual successor in gameplay and style to Jet Set Radio and Jet Set Radio Future. Bomb Rush Cyberfunk's sleek cel-shaded, Dreamcast-esque graphics are just the start. Team Reptile wants to bring the whole shebang together with music from Hideki Naganuma, the man behind the original. Now, their latest trailer shows a whole lot of what's to come, and for more platforms.
Bomb Rush Cyberfunk was already locked in for Nintendo Switch and PC, but Team Reptile has confirmed it will also launch on Xbox and PlayStation, albeit a little later. Xbox and PlayStation owners will be able to check out the Jet Set successor on September 1, a few weeks after its August 18 release for PC and Switch.

The Latest Bomb Rush Cyberfunk Trailer
The trailer still keeps the mystery of what's going on in the game, as Team Reptile has been very tight-lipped about what Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is going to actually be about. However, the latest trailer teases a bit more. For one, much like it's spiritual predecessor, players will have the choice of choosing between multiple characters. There also styles including BMX, skating, and skateboarding.
We also get a look at some drone enemies, which may take the antagonistic role, like the Tokyo-to Police in JSR. There's also a strange monochromatic environment. Although what it means is still up in the air.
Alongside all there, there are other gangs, antagonistic presences, and many other forces at work in the city. None of it's clear just yet, but we'll probably find out more at launch. There's also another excellent track in the trailer, "Operator" by GRRL.
The truth will be revealed when Bomb Rush Cyberfunk releases on September 1st for Playstation, Xbox, and PC, and August 18 for Nintendo Switch

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the success of the Steam Deck, manufacturers have been warming to the idea of a portable PC, and more competitors are throwing their hats into the ring. The latest reports suggest that Lenovo may be the next to release a handheld gaming PC.
[caption id="attachment_394544" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Lenovo Legion.[/caption]
Lenovo could have a handheld gaming PC on the way
According to a report from Windows Central, the device is called the Legion Go. It will compete with the Steam Deck and the recently released Asus ROG Ally, and it's expected to sport an 8-inch display, which would make it larger than its direct competitors, which both feature 7-inch displays.
The rumored gadget will run Windows 11, and it will be powered by AMD's new Phoenix processors, which could result in a powerful system. Revealed this year, the processors are used in several gaming machines including the Razer Blade 14 (2023), Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, and Acer Nitro 16.
None of the reports have been confirmed by Lenovo, though if true, this won't be the company's first foray into the handheld gaming market. An Android-based cloud gaming device called the Legion Play was never officially released, though a few prototype units went on sale in China.
The Go would expand the Legion range of gaming PCs which includes laptops such as 2023's Lenovo Legion Pro 5 Gen 8. Windows Central does not report a release date for the Go, though Lenovo will have to hurry if it wishes to secure a spot for itself in the growing handheld gaming PC market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can almost remember the moment in the original Dishonored when I realised, "Crap. Chaos is coming, and there's nothing I can do to stop it." It was around the halfway point of the game that the world of Dunwall was visibly starting to sour before me, and it was all because I hadn't quite taken the time to truly understand how its chaos system worked. I'd let too many of my mistakes get away from me, killed one too many people in the process, and now its Low Chaos ending seemed permanently out of reach. I thought in vain that if I behaved really nicely for the rest of the game, it might balance out my former transgressions. But alas, it was not to be. I ended the game in High Chaos, and I was furious. For whatever reason, getting a game's 'good' ending really mattered to me back then.
It was this personal failing that drove me to some extreme lengths when Dishonored 2 came out a couple of years later. Not only did I resolve to do a Clean Hands run this time, guaranteeing a Low Chaos ending by refusing to kill anyone, but as I cast my eye down its list of Steam achievements, I also got it into my head that, 'You know what? If we're going no-kill, let's Shadow run it as well and do it completely unseen at the same time.' A great idea at the time, I thought, if a little unusual for me. Cut to my fifth hour trying to clean out Kirin Jindosh's Clockwork Mansion on a review deadline, however, and you might think that decision would have worn a little thin. But you'd also be totally and utterly wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dishonored 2 is an immersive sim stealth 'em up by Arkane and it's been in my brain a lot more than usual. Partly due to this year's RPS 100, but also because of the mess that was Redfall. Arkane swung at the live service hero shooter and missed, with some comments writing off my sadness in the review as an inevitability. Sure, there's definitely truth to Arkane having changed over the years, of course it has. But I don't think there's anything wrong with being hopeful.
I think of Dishonored 2's A Crack In The Slab mission as both a beacon of Arkane's past pedigree and a symbol of their situation in the present. While I can't look into the future, I still think there's worth in turning to an all-time classic of a stealth level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Expanse is one of those TV shows that I've started to watch about three times now. Matthew (RPS in peace) and I keep hearing great things about it, but every attempt we make has always ended the same way. We get a couple of episodes in, determined to make it a little bit further than we did before, but there's just something about it that can't quite hold our interest long enough to properly stick with it. One day, though, I do hope to finish the first season of The Expanse, and my ideal scenario is for the episodic prequel game from Telltale and current Life Is Stange custodians Deck Nine to be just the kick up the bum I need to get through it.
The Expanse: A Telltale Series started the fortnightly release of its five episodes on the Epic Games Store last week, and I played through the first, Archer's Paradox, over the weekend. As you'd perhaps expect from a first episode, the plot scales lean heavily toward setup here as opposed to actionable 'so and so will remember that' choices. Still, its centrepiece of exploring a big exploded battleship to find some sort of money-printing macguffin is also like such a sedate, threat-free version of Dead Space that it can't help but feel a little lightweight at the same time - and that's not just because you're floating around in zero gravity for half of it. It does a reasonable job of laying down what I hope is some good groundwork for the origin story for TV favourite Camina Drummer, and her fellow crewmates are a fun, bubbling pressure cooker of personalities just waiting to spill over into conflict, but I do also worry that the game will have the same truncated fate as my attempts to watch the show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Four years ago, Baldur's Gate 3 was announced with a trailer that showed how a human could succumb to the small illithid tadpole stuck inside his noggin, thus becoming a mind flayer. The process begins with excruciating headaches, escalates to fingers twisting by themselves, and culminates with an octopus head spouting out of the body. That gross transformation is what you’re (maybe) trying to avoid at the start of Baldur’s Gate 3, but developer Larian Studios have now explained how the parasites "tie into" its RPG systems. Yep, you can choose to either embrace or resist the tempting corruption, with the former giving you some pretty cool party tricks, while the latter means you won’t be subjected to David Cronenberg-esque body horror. Tough decision, I think.

        <updated>2023-07-31T22:00:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Pat Naoum has just launched The Master's Pupil, a game that's the culmination of seven years of hand-painted work.
If there's any doubt, Pat explains that he didn't merely use his hands to pick up an electronic stylus to draw the game on some fancy art tablet. Naoum made every single aspect of The Master's Pupil old-school style before using a high-resolution film negative scanner to bring his beautiful artwork into the game's world.
https://www.tiktok.com/@patnaoumgames/video/7257654317488819458
But what's the game even like?
The Master's Pupil is a 12-level 2D sidescroller. It invites players to go on a puzzle-solving adventure that accompanies some of the most important moments in the life of Claude Monet, the 19th-century French impressionist painter whose works informed the game.
Don't let yourself get fooled by all the beauty, though. Great sadness lives underneath. To avoid spoilers, let's just say that players will have to suffer through the loss of someone very dear to Monet. They will also experience his fight against sight ailments that nearly took away his ability to create art in the way that he loved.
[caption id="attachment_394527" align="alignnone" width="1200"] Image by Pat Naoum[/caption]
At certain points in the game, the entire level will transform to reveal a Monet painting. The way that the various layers come together to form paintings feels reminiscent of Braid, but the art on display here is on a whole other level. Even if it doesn't seem like your kind of game, you should consider giving it a try. The Master's Pupil feels like one of those one-of-a-kind experiences that you soon won't forget.
The Master's Pupil is available on PC and Mac via Steam. It's also on the Nintendo Switch.

However, upon looking at screenshots of Tecmo’s Deception, I fell in love.
Released in 1996, Tecmo’s Deception is just so PS1. While it established the foundation of the long-running series, it mostly failed spectacularly at everything it attempted. However, its King’s Field style first-person perspective and boxy, pixellated graphics just feel so cozy. A lot of what it failed to do was dropped by subsequent games in the series, which almost makes me feel like I won’t like them as much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little while has passed since the release of 2.7.0, and we are now excited to present you with the bugfix release 2.7.1.
We have included a significant amount of fixes and small improvements, in particular:
Added ScummVM Log file viewer, so you can easily report the problems on platforms with limited file access, e.g. Android, iOS or even modern Windows.
Fixed the shader-based scaler loading on some platforms.
Added multiple improvements to AGI, AGS, Cryomni3D and 12 more engines.
We also improved the detection of Broken Sword 1 & Broken Sword 2, so more original versions get properly detected. Thank you to those who submitted bug reports about this, and if you still locate a version that is not recognised, please report it to us (beware that the frankenstein versions that are floating around the internet will not be accepted, only those copied from the original media).
For the full and comprehensive list of notable changes, please refer to the Release Notes.
If you are as excited about the release as we are, you can share our joy by downloading it from our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, or either of the Ubuntu Snap or Flatpack packages, the autoupdater will pick up the ScummVM 2.7.1 release automatically. For our Android app users, the update will be available on the Play Store.
Thank you very much for your continued support. Enjoy!

In the report, several key partners to Nintendo have claimed to have received development kits for the new console. Development kits for consoles are typically sent out well before the retail release so developers learn the new hardware and ensure some titles are ready to launch on the new platform.
The sources went on to share some alleged details on the new system. Like the Nintendo Switch, the next-gen console will have portable mode. Furthermore, the console will launch with an LCD screen rather than an OLED screen to reduce costs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you thought the Skyrim community was done with modding, think again. There are countless ways to tinker with Bethesda's epic fantasy RPG, especially if you play the game on PC. Now, for those who want to see dinosaurs roaming this cold slice of Tamriel, there's a mod that could be right up your alley.
Over on Nexus Mods, user Birbwalker21 (who's done numerous dinosaur-themed mods in the past) brings us "Raptors" for the special edition of Skyrim. As the name implies, this particular download fills the world of Tamriel with a bunch of different raptors for that dose of prehistoric role-playing.
https://youtu.be/0gJxi5xWUK4
It's interesting to note that these particular dinosaurs have been given feathers, which research has shown is what the real beasts would have had, as opposed to the scaly creatures seen in popular culture.
Dr. Alan Grant, if he was a Dragonborn
It's not just one raptor, either. Birbwalker21 has added three different types of raptors to Skyrim. The first one (called the Forest Raptor) is based on the Velociraptor, which many of you will know from Jurassic Park. These can be identified by their black and orange feathers and are typically found in woodland areas.
Next is the Alpine Raptor, designed after the Deinonychus. This is a larger raptor you'll come across in the higher and more northerly areas of Tamriel. They sport blue feathers with white crests.
Then there's the Plains Raptor, which is based on the larger still Utahraptor. They're said to be the fiercest of the bunch when encountered in Skyrim. You can spot them through their brown feathers, but you may want to give them a wide berth, given their aggressive nature.
It's great to see new things still being added to this 11-year-old game. Who knows what the Dragonborn will encounter next? Dragons, perhaps? Or is that too farfetched?

        <updated>2023-07-31T16:00:42.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ah, Half-Life 2. For many, Valve's follow-up to the influential 1998 FPS is the developer's magnum opus. It still holds up today and is often held aloft as one of the greatest shooters of all time. Much of it comes down to its tight combat, intriguing story, and dystopian setting.
But what was life like for the people of City 17 before the Combine came and wrecked everything? Before the famed Seven-Hour War would see humanity become enslaved? Well, that's what YouTuber Radiation Hazard wondered. In a recent video of theirs (and using beta footage from the game), they showed what Half-Life 2 looked like long before Gordon Freeman came into the picture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi_KQ725AAI
The result is what you would expect. With no war and no Combine, the city and its surroundings are as they should be. No damaged structures. No wreckage. No enslaved humans.
Maybe we'll go to Ravenholm now
Even Ravenholm (where the game turns into a horror experience) looks positively tranquil before everything went to shit. True, Radiation Hazard's video only shows the mining town in the daylight, but it's still a stark contrast to see this abandoned and dilapidated locale actually looking habitable.
However, it still feels a little bit...eerie. Maybe it's the fact that Half-Life 2's setting is largely industrial, including almost brutalist buildings, or the fact that even in a non-Combine inhabited city, there are still no people milling about, but it still looks quite oppressive.
It kind of shows Valve's skills in being able to invoke a mood. Even without the carnage, corpses, and graffiti, Half-Life 2 still looks like a place that one probably wouldn't want to visit. Which makes sense. The game probably wouldn't feel right if Freeman had to defend an idyllic fishing village from the Combine.

        <updated>2023-07-31T14:17:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo’s next console will reportedly be portable like the Switch and is targeting a release in the second half of 2024, according to a new report today from VideoGamesChronicle. 
VGC cites “multiple people with knowledge of Nintendo’s next-gen console plans” that reveal Nintendo’s Switch successor is aiming for a release in the second half of next year, to ensure there’s plenty of stock at launch. Nintendo wants to avoid the stock shortages that plagued the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S release for months (and years for some). 


The publication reports that two of its sources suggest the next-generation console will use LCD screens, like those seen on the launch versions of the Switch, rather than the OLED screens used in the Switch OLED models. The use of LCD reduces costs, VGC writes, in light of the likely need for significantly more storage than what’s in the Switch, which will increase costs. 
VGC’s sources also suggest Nintendo’s next console will be playable on the go, similar to the Switch’s console-handheld hybrid nature. Its sources also say the console will continue using physical cartridges like the Switch, although it’s unclear if this console will be backwards compatible with the Switch.
In February of last year, Nintendo said the Switch was in the middle of its lifecycle, meaning that while a new Nintendo console might launch next year, the company might not necessarily abandon the Switch any time soon. However, if Nintendo continues support of the Switch alongside a next-gen console, it’s unclear how that will work as, presumably, this new console will be a good bit more powerful than the Switch. 
Regardless of how Nintendo approaches Switch support following the release of a new console and backwards compatibility, the Super Mario Bros. maker likely wants to convert the Switch’s massive install base into its following product.

The FAQ section states the team feels "very confident in getting everything into the game by April 2025." I'll have the rat-rat-rat-tan chant stuck in my head until then.


Original Story: Patapon’s beloved blend of rhythm and strategy has been sadly relegated to PlayStation consoles, but a new spiritual successor is bringing that cutesy charm to PC as long as the game finds success on Kickstarter. Ratatan was announced at this year’s Bitsummit, and it’s coming from developer Ratata Arts who are led by developers who worked on the original Patapon series. The newest trailer (below) shows off the game’s adorable singing soldiers. Take a look.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetherRealm Studios has released a new Mortal Kombat 1 trailer focused on the Keepers of Time and Geras, a Mortal Kombat 11 debut character returning as a playable fighter. 
The Mortal Kombat studio has released a steady flow of trailers and gameplay since its MK1 reveal back in May, and that continued over the weekend with a new showcase on the Keepers of Time faction and sand-wielding warrior Geras. In it, we get new looks at Liu Kang, including a new fatality for him, and Geras. 
You can check out the MK1 Keepers of Time trailer for yourself below: 


Over the weekend, MK1 director Ed Boon tweeted an image with what many think might be a new character debuting in the game. Boon writes, “New phone. Who dis?” and circles the unknown character, leading many to believe it’s a tease of a new fighter.

Editor's Note: This story previously stated that two new Mortal Kombat 1 trailers were released over the weekend and linked to a Geras trailer for Mortal Kombat 11. It has been updated to reflect that only one trailer was released – the Keepers of Time trailer – which reveals Geras as a playable fighter.]]></summary>

I’ve muddled my way through Elden Ring’s starting peninsula three times now, but have yet to step foot beyond the crumbling gatehouse of Stormveil Castle. The second Godrick The Grafted is reduced to a sickly pile of wobbly limbs, I turn the game off and walk away.
It’s not that I don’t like Elden Ring. I’m not struggling to connect with its open world take on the Souls genre. I’m not put off by the difficult encounters that await me, or the obtuse challenges I’ll be forced to overcome. The answer is weirdly simple. Limgrave provides me with everything I could ever want from a Souls game to the point that when Godrick croaks his final rancid breath and his (presumably) four tongues comically lop out of his stupid mouth, I’m left with the deep satisfaction that comes with the end of a journey, rather than the beginning of one.

We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist or by clicking the links below). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

It's unreasonably muggy where I am, which is a type of weather I'm not built for. I'm not built for rain or snow or sunshine either, to be fair - and if you're like me you could maybe have a crack at Wood And Weather's free demo on Steam this weekend, a game where you can change the weather to whatever you want. It's very sweet. I like games where it's like you're smashing lovely toys together. I've already played that, though, I'm telling you that maybe you'll like it. Oh, you want to know what we're playing this weekend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grinding Gear Games debuted a lovely big chunk of Path Of Exile 2 this evening, taking us through a section of Act 3 of its campaign and showing off two of its six new character classes: the Monk and the Sorceress. With almost 30 minutes of uninterrupted gameplay, we got to see exactly how they work in practice, and most importantly, we got a big long look at the monk's beautifully choreographed staff twirling melee attacks. Yes please and thank you. I have to say, this is instantly more exciting to me than biffing skeletons with my Druid in Diablo 4, and I'm very pumped indeed to try the Monk out for myself when Path Of Exile 2 enters its closed beta in June next year.

Bosses, in particular, will pose much more of a threat this time round, as studio co-founder and Path Of Exile 2 creative director Jonathan Rogers says the big monsters you fought in the first game's campaign were, in hindsight, "pretty anemic".

Since then, however, the scope of Grinding Gear Games action RPG has grown so much in the intervening years that they've now decided to make it a "completely separate game". The news comes from tonight's ExileCon, which also marks the first time we've seen Path Of Exile 2 in action since that original announcement.

As an omnipresent robotic voice condescendingly wishes my team luck, my eyes widen in disbelief as a massive portal materializes over a city block. It spews hundreds of raptors that rain from the sky, tumbling down buildings before they sprint in our direction. It’s a jaw-dropping sight, but that awe turns to intimidation at the staggering number of adversaries thirsty for our blood. Our tank units move forward and activate their shields to create a defensive wall. A healer fills health bars to the brim. A sniper tak…]]></summary>

The game is being revamped with new visuals, music and even a rebuild of its code to help it run in 60 frames per second, if that matters to you in a game about stacking burgers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV is finally coming to Xbox Series X/S next spring. 
Xbox head Phil Spencer joined Final Fantasy XIV director Naoki Yoshida on stage today, during Day 1 of Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival 2023, to reveal the news.
Here's what Spencer had to say:
Spencer says this is a seminal moment "in our relationship with you and the Final Fantasy team as we look to partner more closely together in the future," perhaps teasing more Final Fantasy to come to Xbox down the line. 
While the game will be playable on both Xbox Series X and Series S, Yoshida says only the Series X version will support 4K resolution. The Xbox version of Final Fantasy XIV is expected sometime during the spring of 2024. Before the release of 7.0 and during Patch 6.5X, there will be an open beta scheduled for the Xbox version. 
This means the Dawntrail expansion will be playable on Xbox Series X/S at launch. Like with other platforms, Final Fantasy XIV will only be available as a digital release on Xbox. You can go straight from the Open Beta to the full version, too, as saved data and progress transfer over. 
For more about Final Fantasy XIV, watch the reveal trailer for Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail and then read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker review.

Sonic Superstars aims to give players an experience loyal to those initial Classic Sonic entries on the Genesis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV publisher Square Enix and developer Creative Business Unit III have revealed Dawntrail, the MMO’s next expansion, and it hits the game next summer. 
Square Enix revealed Dawtrail today, the first day of Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival 2023 in Las Vegas, with a new trailer showcasing the tropical New World known as Yok Tural and many beloved characters hanging out there. Shortly after the reveal, director Naoki Yoshida took the stage to discuss the expansion as part of the Fan Festival’s keynote presentation. 
Check out the Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail expansion trailer for yourself below: 


Yoshida says the logo art for Dawntrail was created by Yoshitaka Amano using the color gold, which is the theme color of this expansion. You can check out the Dawntrail logo below:
 














	


  
    

  
      
            


      
  










Speaking to the story, Yoshida says, “We want to bring the very best summer vacation a hero could possibly have” to the Warriors of Light (the players). Without spoiling the events of 2021’s Endwalker expansion, Yoshida says Dawntrail is a significant shift from the previous expansion. Where Endwalker was dark, with the end of the universe on the line, Dawntrail is brighter and seemingly lighter in tone. 
“It’s a new beginning of Final Fantasy XIV [and] the theme is a journey of discovery. As you know, the arc we’ve been on from 1.0 to Endwalker about Hydaelyn and Zodiark has concluded. So you can think of this as our first step into a new story for Final Fantasy XIV.”

That's a tiny fraction of the drive's original RRP and the lowest price we've ever recorded for this size. All told, it's a hugely impressive deal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony's DualSense controller is one of the premiere options on PC, offering enhanced trigger rumble ('adaptive triggers') in a handful of games on top of excellent ergonomics and high-quality buttons that are much appreciated in a huge number of racing, action and other titles. These controllers normally cost around £50 to £60, but today they're down to £40 – as part of a Sony summer sale that sees the Sony console drop from £479 to £399. 
There are a wide range of colours available, far beyond the white models that launched with the console in 2020. I'm a fan of the black and camouflage options, but there's also red, pink and blue. Here are links to Amazon and Currys, with the latter offering all colours apart from purple at £40 at the time of writing and Amazon only for black, white and blue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a complicated relationship with retro-style games in general, and no particular fondness for the Everything Was Nintendo school. Or platformers, or double jumping, or dashing, or neon, or being alive in general. Dislike is the wrong word, but "weary neutrality" about covers my feelings when another retro platformer comes down the game tubes.
Gravity Circuit, however, is good enough that I can't not mention it here. It's loud and bright without being obnoxious or overwhelming, fast and precise without being overly demanding, and generally just a damn good effort at creating a modern action platformer whose main influence is obvious, but isn't just going through the motions for the sake of nostalgia. I'm saying it's good, yeah? Maybe not quite for me, but good anyway.

It’s a meaty and satisfying action-platformer with possibly the best-executed comedy and character work of the entire series; a series that’s essentially grown up alongside me, in tone as much as technical sophistication. I wish I had the time to review it properly but, with a weekend and a Baldur's Gate 3-shaped boulder bearing down, I’m staying in my hardware lane to focus on the performance of and best settings to use in Rift Apart’s new PC version.

Everyone on the team has such varied, individual tastes, and it heartens me to see so many different genres and types of games represented every year. This year's list (available to read now in Part One and Part Two is another great testament to that. 
But as we (sometimes) jokingly say any time we compile a big list like this, the games that didn't make the cut are always at #101. Well, this year I thought supporters might like to see those games at #101 this year, and crikey, there are a lot. There are so many here, in fact, that we would have had to have stretched to an RPS 200 to include them all. So here are our honourable mentions this year (listed, for ease), and I'd love to see you try and guess which games belonged to which member of the team.

Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, released in 2021, was one of the more successful - although criticism seemed to focus on its high price and relative paucity of characters and stages.

Does that make it a good or a bad thing that Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 is in development, then? It'll feature new stages and new characters, while revamping the look and layouts from the original. Among the new characters is Spongebob's perma-frustrated neighbour Squidward, who you can see in the announcement trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been about an hour since Evelyn Mansell - one of the lead art directors on the System Shock remake - and I started talking about guns. Specifically the big, daft chunky guns that she worked on, but also about videogame guns in general - what makes them tick. What separates a good one from a bad one. Whether or not Doom 3’s shotgun is one of the good ones (it is).  


If there’s one area where all of the remake’s ideas truly come together and shine, it’s in the weapons. There wasn’t much to see in the original - nothing beyond the tip of a barrel. Here, the weapons are very much the star of the show. Heavy, industrial things covered in thumb-print smeared LCD screens and superfluous greeblies. NERF guns that've been painted by a 12-year-old and covered in spaceship parts. These are the toy guns you would have wanted for Christmas, and I wanted to know more about them.

Unpacking, a game where you click on items and shelve them nicely, has somehow tamed my urge to punch the boxes open. Except it's done one thing to personally attack me, and that's by not allowing me to unpack stuff and leave it on the floor. It's a fight I simply can't win.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 40 million units sold. 
Sony launched the PS5 in November 2020, after revealing the console the year prior, and since then, more than 40 million consoles have been purchased by players. In February, the console maker announced it had shipped 32 million units in the PS5’s lifetime, which means in just five months, Sony has sold at least 8 million more consoles. 


That’s a significant jump, especially given that it’s been somewhat of a quieter year for Sony so far. There’s no doubt the release of God of War Ragnarok last winter pushed PS5 sales, helping it reach that 32 million mark, but since then, the only first-party PlayStation release for PS5 has been Horizon Forbidden West’s Burning Shores DLC and MLB The Show 23. Horizon Call of the Mountain is also a first-party game released this year but it's exclusive to PSVR2.
However, Square Enix released Final Fantasy XVI last month exclusively on PS5, so while not a first-party game, it likely further pushed console sales. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, which is getting its own special limited edition PS5 console bundle, will likely lead to more hardware sales as well.


SEI President and CEO Jim Ryan discusses this milestone marker for the PS5 in a new statement released today. Below is a portion of it:

At least for a bit, and just in time for Six Ages: Ride Like The Wind (a spiritual successor to King Of Dragon Pass) to to get a depressing-sounding sequel and Myst to get a Humble Bundle featuring its sequels, both official and spiritual. So that got us to thinking: what in the darn heck is a spiritual successor anyway? Are there standard parameters? We have a definitional argument, as is our wont.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Entropy Centre is now available on Switch, and you can pick it up from the Nintendo eShop for 50% off, thanks to a special launch day discount. 
If you like a good puzzle game, especially if you’re a fan of Valve’s Portal series, The Entropy Centre is worth your time. It was one of my favorite games of last year, and you can read about why in my review of The Entropy Centre. With today’s launch day discount on the Nintendo eShop, you can purchase The Entropy Centre for $12.49. 
Check out the Nintendo Switch launch trailer for The Entropy Centre below: 


The Switch version of The Entropy Centre arrives less than a year after the PlayStation, Xbox, and PC versions launched last November. In the game, players take on the role of protagonist Aria, who awakens inside a colossal space station just outside of a constantly exploding Earth. It’s up to you to figure out why this space station – The Entropy Centre – has been abandoned, why Earth keeps exploding, and why your day resets afterward. You’ll do all this alongside Astra, a talking gun with a great sense of humor. 
For more about the game, watch this gameplay trailer and then read Game Informer’s review of The Entropy Centre.

Lords of the Fallen hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this October, and ahead of the game’s release, Hexworks and CI Games are pulling back the curtain on its dark fantasy world and action RPG combat. In the gameplay presentation, we get a new look at the living realm known as Axiom, where players must traverse harsh and gothic environments to defeat Adyr, the Demon God. However, Axiom isn’t the only concern, as players must also fight through Umbral, the realm of the dead.

Disney Illusion Island puts Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy front and center in a Metroidvania adventure, and the result is mostly successful. Where most platformers dole out fun using the adrenaline-inducing triumph of challenge, Illusion Island is instead built around the joy of movement, thanks in part to its combat-less exploration, and the delight of controlling some of the most recognizable mascots in the world. It plays a bit floaty and simple, especially for seasoned fans of the genre, and I wanted my platforming prowess pushed more, but Illusion Island is still a…]]></summary>

Double Dragon may be one of the original pillars of the beat ‘em up genre, but that foundation has weakened in modern times. Infrequent sequels of varying quality have tested Jimmy and Billy Lee’s modern relevance, but Double Dragon Gaiden does a solid job of reinventing the pair with a neat tag team mechanic. Though as enjoyable as this contemporary throwback can be, it often gets in its own way with frustrating combat design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online can now access two of the most beloved Game Boy Color games of all time. The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons join the roster of playable classic games as part of the Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy catalog. 
As was true with the original Game Boy Color cartridges, you can experience the games on their own in any order that you wish, but if you link them together through a password system, some characters and enemies will change, some items can be upgraded, and you can take part in the climactic final battle. It's also worth noting that these games served as Hidemaro Fujibayashi's directorial debut within the Legend of Zelda franchise. Fujibayashi would go on to direct The Minish Cap, Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom.
The Nintendo Switch has steadily become one of the best places to experience the Legend of Zelda series. From Switch releases like Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, and the Link's Awakening remake to nearly every classic Zelda game available through Nintendo Switch Online and its Expansion Pack, Zelda fans can enjoy nearly every beloved mainline entry – though Wind Waker and Twilight Princess remain conspicuously absent. However, with the Oracle games now available, fans of Link and his adventures have two more easy-to-access adventures on Nintendo's massively successful hybrid system.
To see where the Oracle games fall on the list of every mainline Zelda, head to our rankings here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Sonic Mania arrived in 2017, it was a massive success for the franchise. So much so that it seemed inevitable that a sequel developed in conjunction with Christian Whitehead, PagodaWest Games, and Headcannon would be next for the Blue Blur. Unfortunately, it never happened. We asked both Takashi Iizuka and Christian Whitehead what happened to Sonic Mania 2. 
Headcannon continued working with the Sonic brand through 2022's Sonic Origins and its 2023 update Sonic Origins Plus, while Whitehead founded his own studio, Evening Star, alongside fellow Sonic Mania developers in 2018. This past June, Evening Star announced its first game, titled Penny's Big Breakaway, coming in early 2024.
Instead of the expected Sonic Mania 2, in June 2023, Sega, Sonic Team, and development studio Arzest (hea…]]></summary>

Intel's AVX10 announcement noted initial support with Granite Rapids processors that will debut next year but no mention of the E-core-only Sierra Forest. With the AVX10 only coming to P/E core client processors after Granite Rapids, it would appear the high density Sierra Forest generation will miss out on AVX10/AVX-512 and not appear until Clearwater Forest. Meanwhile with the 128-core AMD EPYC "Bergamo" processors now shipping, there is AVX-512 with the Zen 4C cores. Here are some benchmarks looking at the AVX-512 impact for Bergamo.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ideally, the story of Remnant II’s launch would start and end with it being an ambitious success of a shooty Soulslike. Sadly not: in a Reddit post addressing complaints of wonky performance, even on higher-end graphics cards, developers Gunfire Games admitted to having "designed the game with upscaling in mind." 
Working the likes of Nvidia DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS into a game wouldn’t normally be a cause of incredulity. Indeed, as optional performance boosters, they’re pretty much always a welcome sight amid the duller texture filtering and ambient occlusion toggles of the average settings menu. The problem here is that with its dismal performance at native, non-upscaled resolutions, Remnant II essentially forgets about the 'optional' part – and in doing so, undermines what makes DLSS and its rivals such valuable tools in the first place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Under the new rights holders Studio 2.21, cult classic series Little Big Adventure was set to make a comeback after three decades off-grid, with original creator Didier Chanfray attached to the projects. The comeback plans included an all-new reboot, plus remasters for the two 1990s action-adventure games. But today, the studio announced that they were “unsuccessful in securing a publisher,” which has led to the reboot’s cancellation and layoffs at the developer.


“Despite our earnest efforts,” CEO Ben Limare wrote in a blog post, “we were unsuccessful in securing a publisher for the reboot of Twinsen’s Little Big Adventure.” According to Limare, the reasons for this are threefold: genre appeal, the series’ limited recognition, and the planned costs. “Despite a passionate, albeit small, community of fans, Twinsen’s Little Big Adventure isn’t globally recognized, which added to the hesitations of potential publishers,” wrote Limare.


“While indie game studios can often deliver remarkable games with lean teams (as we've seen with Death’s Door and Tunic), our vision for this project involved a team of 15 to 20 people, echoing the original game's size,” he continued. “This considerable investment, juxtaposed with the risk inherent to the genre and IP, was a factor in the decision.”

In real life, I write to you today from a desk covered in a weird detritus of work and life that wouldn't quite see me on an exploitative reality TV show with the word hoarder somewhere in the title, but, you know... maybe give it 15 years.
But I bloody love tidying things in games. Getting everything in the right place. And something that makes it extra enjoyable in Unpacking is the sound design. The house itself is quiet, but everything in the game makes a little noise when you put it away or hang it up or slide it in a shelf, and it's all stuff you recognise from home. It makes the whole experience feel domestic and familiar.

The game previously held various closed playtests, but now the metaphorical doors are being opened for more players.

I’m not sure I agree with the iconic murder clown. I’m watching the first teaser for Peacock’s Twisted Metal, and while I wasn’t sure what to expect from an adaptation of one of my favorite childhood franchises, whatever hopes I had fell away watching this strange out-of-context clip. Sweet Tooth dancing to and singing the lyrics to Sisqó’s “Thong Song?” Showing a comedic fistfight instead of vehicles blowing each other up? I know the showrunners are aiming for laughs, but what have they done to my game?
After watching the show’s first season, I must confess: I really like Twisted Metal.

So, in an evening spare of stuff to do, I booted the game up and created a druid called ANIMALS. After a few hours of pressing 1,3,2,4, in either the same pattern or different patterns, I've come to realise the game doesn't make me feel anything. I bash some skeletons, I equip a staff, I exit to Windows, I couldn't care less. Maybe, though, it's not such a bad thing?
I know I said I'd like Diablo 4 to channel Vampire Survivors and give me an auto-attack switch, so I could just steer my character through encounters without having to think at all. I still stand by my stubbornness! But having obliterated more packs of rabid wolves and legions of demons, I've come to develop what I think is ARPG muscle memory.

The original Remnant: From the Ashes was a surprise success thanks to its Souls-inspired action combined with third-person shooting and randomized environments. The sequel is a refinement with new environments and expanded lore. I enjoyed my time with the game and its final boss and the shooting mechanics feel great, but Remnant II ultimately doesn’t do enough to separate itself from the genres and games that inspired it.

The announcement of Sonic Superstars sparked excitement among the fan base thanks to the return to the 2D style of gameplay found in the beloved retro entries in the franchise but complemented with gorgeous modern visuals. The game plays very much like an homage to those games that primarily lived on the Genesis, but developers Arzest and Sonic Team are adding various new elements to Sonic Superstars to expand on the classic gameplay fans are looking forward to.

But being a director requires turning a switch in his brain. He's an introvert. But when he goes to work, he has to be an extrovert. He has to lead teams, micromanage, make tough decisions, and accept making mistakes – all skills he says he learned without clear guidance. 
To be able to do that, to make that switch, Johanas says you need to be a "weird psychopath." Though he likes to think he isn't a weird psychopath. "Maybe to some people I am," he says. "I don't know." Nevertheless, no one can be at that level all the time. And yet, here he is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Stars is one of the most anticipated RPGs of the year and even graced Game Informer’s cover back in March. While the game is heading to all platforms, its playable demo has only been available on Switch. Today, it’s PlayStation fans’ turn to sample the upcoming title.
A PlayStation Blog post reveals that you can download the demo on PlayStation consoles, which unfolds in an out-of-context, spoiler-free slice of the game. Additionally, when Sea of Stars launches next month, it will be available as part of the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for Extra and Premium subscribers on day one. 
Sea of Stars comes from Sabotage Studios and serves as a distant prequel to 2018’s The Messenger. Inspired by games such as Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, players control one of the two protagonists, Valere and Zale, who wield the power of the sun and moon to stop an evil alchemist. In addition to its dynamic turn-based combat, it features a hefty share of platforming and other traversal mechanics, creating a more active form of exploring its vibrant world.  
Sea of Stars releases on August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can learn by checking out our exclusive coverage hub with features such as an interview with Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda about the soundtrack he crafted for the game. We also have a video interview with creative director Thierry Boulanger breaking down Sea of Stars’ RPG inspirations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dying Light developer, Techland has announced a partnership with Tencent that will see the massive Chinese holdings company become the studio’s majority shareholder.
In a blog post penned by Techland founder and CEO Paweł Marchewka, he explains the studio has partnered with Tencent for support of its continued expansion of the Dying Light series and to ensure its upcoming fantasy RPG lives up to expectations.
“Teaming up with Tencent will allow us to move full speed ahead with the execution of the vision for our games,” Pawel writes. “We have chosen an ally who has already partnered with some of the world's finest video game companies and helped them reach new heights while respecting their ways of doing things.”
Pawel states that he will remain CEO, and Techland will retain full ownership of its IPs. He also assures the studio has full creative freedom. While the Polish company is best known as the maker of the Dying Light series, Call of Juarez, and the original Dead Island, it also has a publishing branch. Titles released under Techland's umbrella include Arise: A Simple Story and Torment: Tides of Numenera.
This is business as usual for Tencent, which has dipped its hands into a number of game studios in recent years. It has invested in (or has outright acquired) companies such as Epic Games, From Software, Turtle Rock Studios, Riot Games, Ubisoft, Activision Blizzard, Remedy Entertainment, among others.

As someone who grew up primarily in the 1990s, I’ve played more than my fair share of 2D platformers. With those decades of experience, it’s no surprise that I consider myself a relatively strong platforming player. However, despite its precise controls, Mr. Run and Jump’s challenging, neon-bathed obstacle courses and hard-to-reach collectibles had me second-guess my skills at every step.
Developed initially as a homebrew Atari 2600 game, Mr. Run and Jump errs on the side of simplicity with i…]]></summary>

Madden NFL 24 brings new improvements to the FieldSense system, Franchise, Superstar, and even the skeletons of the on and off-field character models. Not only that but this year signals the return of the popular minigames that have been missing for many years. 
However, one of the biggest announcements each year comes in the form of the player ratings heading into the new season. Not only does this give fans, players, and media personalities various talking points about which players are overrated and underrated, but it also lets us know which teams will be the most fun to play when the game launc…]]></summary>

Despite the wordplay in the title, the game is unexpectedly dark and violent, which is surprising considering the team's last game is about a cat on a Metroid-inspired mission. In any case, we like what we've played so far. Gunbrella is coming to PC and Switch some time this year.
Join Marcus Stewart and me as we check out some early gameplay and defeat the game's first boss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adibou, the first game in the beloved children's series, is now ready for public testing!
Also known as Adi Jr.'s World of Discoveries, this 1991 Coktel Vision title began the educational Adibou collection aimed at children of age 4 to 7 years.
Many of the iconic activities and mechanisms of the series were already part of this first opus: planting flowers, playing the game Breakout, and being rewarded with sweets upon completing Read/Count exercises. And of course, this was Adibou's first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.
ScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.
As much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!

In the first post, we went into a bit into the infrastructure that runs OpenTTD, from BaNaNaS to our main website. In this post, we will explain a bit about the migration we just did to get to this infrastructure. After over 2 months of work, I am happy to announce we finished (another) infrastructure migration. Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care. But in short summary: (Much) smaller monthly bill as AWS charges insane amounts for bandwidth. Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi. This will be a bit nerdy, so if you like these kind of things, continue the read!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post is part of a two-part series, of which this is the first. In this post, we go a bit into the infrastructure that runs OpenTTD, from BaNaNaS to our main website. The second post will explain a bit about the migration we just did to get to this infrastructure. Often I get comments that people are surprised how complex OpenTTD’s infrastructure is, and why that is. With this post, I will try to explain a bit what is going on in the backend, and why it takes a bit of effort to keep everything running smoothly.]]></summary>
