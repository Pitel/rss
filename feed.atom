        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Behaviour Interactive released Dead by Daylight Chapter 31: All Things Wicked. The Chapter adds a new Killer and Survivor into the mix, as well as a brand new map to explore across all Trials. While the main focus for most fans will be on the new characters, the update released alongside this Chapter does a lot to freshen up the experience.


Dead by Daylight Patch 7.6.0 ushers in Chapter 31: All Things Wicked


Behaviour Interactive is notorious for publishing massive patch notes for its updates, and Dead by Daylight 7.6.0 is no exception. Below, I've listed the highlights for these patch notes. These are the most important and impactful changes that I believe you'll notice as a player.

Few things in Helldivers 2 frost my expendable ass more than getting a surprise tongue-lashing from one of those camouflaged bastards. Thankfully, you can work to stop Stalker attacks in Helldivers 2 by finding and destroying their Lairs.


As mentioned, stopping Stalker attacks requires you to destroy their hidden Lair in Helldivers 2. It's easier said than done, especially in harder difficulty modes. Lairs aren't shown on your mini-map until you track one down. You need to find it while also dealing with other enemies and ninja attacks from the Stalkers. Thankfully, wiping the things out is about as cathartic as you think.

The most widely accepted "best method" to kill a Bile Titan in Helldivers 2 is to take a Railgun and shoot the damn thing in the mouth. There are concerns over the strategy, though. 


With the recent nerfs to the Railgun, it has proven effective, though it'll take a few extra, well-placed hits to take the behemoth down. Secondly, you or someone on your team must have the Stratagem weapon, which is unlocked at level 20.

The best way to use the mech in Helldivers 2 is as a defensive Stratagem, rather than offensive. It's tempting, oh so tempting, to call it down the moment your Hellpod hits the dirt.

Pokemon Go Zygarde Cell locations


Zygarde Cells can be found on Routes, which are designated pathways set by other trainers.

Those who don't see this option must reach Level 5 to unlock it.

After the success of Papers, Please and Obra Dinn, you’d expect Pope’s latest title to be available on the same platforms but unfortunately, Mars After Midnight is only available on one platform - the Playdate.

Mars After Midnight is, according to the official website, “an entry-screening, mess-tidying, session-planning, martian-filled game” that will see you faced with many Martians at an off-colony community support center. 


In his DevLog, Pope has detailed the process which began back in 2021. In the first DevLog, he described the game as “Papers Please -lite, with no border checkpoint, no desk, no paperwork, on Mars”. More recently, Pope revealed that the gameplay would involve planning each day, including what's on offer for the Martians and which free refreshments will be on offer.

What we do know is that the crank on the side of the Playdate will be used to open a shutter window in order to see who is knocking on the other side, while the d-pad will be used to move the field of vision in the first person viewpoint of the game. 
Mars After Midnight will be available at some point today, purchased through the Playdate catalog. It is priced at $6.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightdive Studios has announced that their 2023 remake of classic FPS System Shock will be released on PlayStation and Xbox consoles on May 21, 2024. That’s just short of a year after the PC release.


I reviewed System Shock back during its PC release, and I thought it was fantastic. Nightdive approached the 1994 classic with obvious reverence, as they left much of it intact, including all the rough bits that usually get sanded down by modern design. It was one of my favorite titles released in 2023.


However, the console versions lagged behind for some reason, which is unfortunate for some gamers who mainly dwell in front of a TV. Anecdotally, whenever I would bring up the remake, I’d often hear, “I wish they’d release the console version.” Now, here it is! Soon!




They’re also choosing this time to provide the game with a sizeable content update, including a revamped ending and the ability to pick a female hacker. This was a stretch goal from the game’s Kickstarter. Considering you don’t often see the Hacker (unless you get game over a lot), this didn’t bother me. However, I appreciate the option.


No word on System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition, which is supposed to be free for anyone who pre-ordered the System Shock remake. While we’re on the subject, I’m also still waiting for SiN Reloaded, which was placed on the back burner.


The System Shock remake is available on PC right now. It arrives on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S on May 21, 204.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve's Steam Deck has been something of a big deal in the mobile gaming arena. Offering PC-like performance on the go, it's proved to be a rare instance for the company: a hardware project that's actually successful. Now, just over two years later, we're still seeing the results of this success.


According to figures from SteamDB, (as noted by Gaming on Linux), the Steam Deck now sports a total of 14,058 (at the time of writing) titles that are compatible with the system.


Image via @OnDeck/Twitter.


Of those, 9,444 are labeled as "Playable," while 4,614 are down as "Verified." The former means games should play but may be missing certain things or not be as well optimized. The latter means they should run absolutely tip-top and no mistake.


So, SO many games


If you take the filters out of the search, it shows that 165,119 games reside on Steam currently. That's...a lot of games, so the Deck still has some way to go. The database also shows that, of those, 3.958 are "Unsupported" when it comes to the device.


This doesn't necessarily mean they won't run per se, but you'll likely encounter issues when playing. In any case, it shows there's still potential for a lot more games to become compatible.


But as the months and years go by, the Steam Deck sees more competition muscling in on its territory. We've already seen ASUS, Lenovo, and MSI offer up their own handheld PC alternatives. At this rate, we could be seeing a saturated market before we know it.

While it can't darken the map and spook Survivors by sneaking up on them, its grotesque appearance, a bag of skin, and unnerving gait make me recoil in horror every encounter. There's no doubt this is a Killer design that haunts us all, but what good is that if you don't know the best builds for The Unknown?  


In Dead by Daylight, every Killer is useless in unskilled hands, without a build maximizing the potential for victory. Its abilities lend themselves to some Perks, but it's sometimes fun to use the meta or stick to its three unique Perks to see what the intended vision for the monster feels like.

Vol. 1 suggests the impending existence of Vol. 2. For this volume, the first disc of the digital Vampire Survivors Soundtrack will be immortalized. It includes music from Daniele Zandara and Will Davies. Nimit Malavia is responsible for the cover art, which features a scowling vampire-like character. But that’s not possible, as I certainly haven’t found a vampire within Vampire Survivors.


Everytime I play the game, I always get some of its music stuck in my head. I wouldn’t be able to hum any bars of it, but I can attest to the fact that its soundtrack is full of fantastic aural delights. It would have to be. A normal round of Vampire Survivors is around a half-hour long. You wouldn’t want to be listening to caterwauling that whole time.


If you’d like to know exactly what ear candy will be on this slab of music, here’s the complete list.

To make the upgrade from Class to Job, you need to equip a Soul Crystal, the stone awarded after hitting level 30 and completing the Job quest assigned to every Class. 


Unfortunately, this step can often be overlooked, especially if you’re not used to the system. With new players starting their journey on Xbox, now is as good a time as any to remind players to equip their Job stone, and a review of how to equip your Soul Crystal and why it’s important. 


As a note, you might hear Soul Crystals referred to as Job Stones, Soul Stones, or Job Crystals, but they're all the same thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Those Awesome Guys and developer Panik Arcade have announced that the N64-inspired collectathon driving game, Yellow Taxi Goes Vroom, will release on April 9th on PC.


Alongside the release date announcement, there’s a pretty incredible trailer that – trailer-spoiler alert – ends in a non-sequitur.




The parts of the trailer that do show the game itself depict a chaotic mix of different gameplay styles centered around the titular yellow taxi. Yellow Taxi Goes Vroom bills itself as a platformer with no jump button. Instead, you simply put the pedal down and defy gravity as best you can. Beyond simply filling your trunk with assorted junk, you’re also trying to “unravel the grand conspiracy happening on Grandma’s Island”


While Yellow Taxi Goes Vroom describes itself as N64-inspired, it has a manic quality that you wouldn’t typically find on the console. Or in the rather sluggish early 3D era in general, really. Well, aside from Mad Panic Coaster.


I think it looks pretty cool. Not crazy about the name, but the N64 is one of my favorite consoles, even if it does occupy a really uncomfortable time period of video game history. The collectathon platformer blossomed and died really quickly, and it’s been nice to see a small resurgence in the indie and small-budget areas of development. Thankfully, there’s a demo to try out right now, which I will probably do tonight after work.


Yellow Taxi Goes Vroom is out on April 9th for PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you ask any Final Fantasy fan what their top five favorite songs in the franchise are, there's a 99 percent chance one of them is "To Zanarkand" from Final Fantasy X. However, it turns out, it wasn't originally intended for the game. 
This news comes from Audrey (aitaikimochi on X, formerly Twitter), a mega Final Fantasy fan, Twitch streamer, and CEO of Aitai Japan Inc., who translated a recent interview between Weekly Ochiai and Final Fantasy X composer Nobuo Uematsu, whose credits also include One-Winged Angel and Aerith's Theme from Final Fantasy VII and so much more. In that interview, Uematsu revealed "To Zanarkand" originally began as a piece for a French flute player, meant to be played during a recital. 


"'To Zanarkand' was actually not meant to be the theme for Final Fantasy X," Uematsu tells Weekly Ochiai, as translated by Audrey on X. "There was a flute player from France who originally asked me to write a song for them to play during a recital. When I wrote the piece, I thought perhaps this sounded a bit too sad for a recital. So I set it aside for the time being. 
"Sometime after, when I was making the score of Final Fantasy X, I was falling behind all the while the producers were hounding me. So since that flute piece was unused, I just kind of meekly handed it to them. They listened to it and said, 'Yes! This is brilliant!'" 
In retrospect, it's wild "To Zanarkand" wasn't originally composed by Uematsu for Final Fantasy X because it fits the game's themes so well, nailing the somber and sad tone present throughout Tidus and Yuna's journey in Spira. 
For more about Final Fantasy music, read Game Informer's exclusive four-part series on composer Masayoshi Soken's score for last year's Final Fantasy XVI:
Part 1: Creating The Prelude
Part 2: The Victory Fanfare
Part 3: Finding A Main Theme
Part 4: The Sound
After that, read Game Informer's review of Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nothing fills my blackened heart with gaming joy more than seeing relics of the past remain steadfast in this modern era. In this case, I've found a mod for Doom 2 that scratches that nostalgic itch with its implementation of a classic Mortal Kombat voice line. 


In "Toasty! for Doom," ModDB user MilHouse.wad has brought the iconic announcement to id Software's legendary shooter. While playing the game, it's possible to have sound programmer Dan Forden announce his famous "Toasty!" line while battling hell demons. Certainly a fitting combination. 


Image via MilHouse.wad/ModDB.


This is an obvious nod to the original Mortal Kombat game released in 1992, in which Forden's avatar would appear in the corner of the screen at certain points during a bout. It was glorious.


"Excellent!"


According to MilHouse.wad, in order to get him to utter his famous "Toasty!" line, you'll need to gib an enemy. So basically, just run around with a rocket launcher or the Berserk power up. Will the novelty wear off? Only time will tell.


We're unlikely to see the end of Doom and Doom 2 modding any time soon. And why would we want that? If people stopped tinkering with these FPS classics, we'd never get to see all the beautiful things people can do with the formula, such as make the game run on a toothbrush.


The original games remain an absolute triumph, paving the way for the first-person shooter genre. I realize some people are sick of hearing that, but now you know how your parents feel when they try to tell you how important the Beatles were.

How to find the Eternity Cache

Before you worry about using the Eternity Cache in Last Epoch, you'll have to locate it at the very end of the Temporal Sanctum dungeon. As with a few other dungeons, you'll need a key to enter. Key drops are completely random, but much easier to find in the Monolith of Fate dungeons. Specifically, choosing quest echoes that offer keys should simplify the grind.

The original Helldivers, too, was pretty darn awesome, and some of its content may yet arrive in the sequel!


Now, right off the bat, it’s important to keep in mind that not only does Helldivers 2 take place roughly a century after Helldivers, but the sequel also effectively reimagines many of the original title’s weapons in a more up-to-date format. Case in point: the Liberator family of bull-pup carbines and rifles. The original game’s AR-19 has been effectively phased out in lieu of the more modern AR-23, which plainly suggests that Super Earth has moved on from the older design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once a huge embarrassment for CD Projekt Red, Cyberpunk 2077 has managed to turn the tides to become a pretty big hit in the first-person, sci-fi, dystopian, Keanu Reeves-heavy, RPG genre (so niche). However, as we move forward, the studio is almost ready to say goodbye to the game.


In a recent interview with Game File, Gabe Amatangelo – Cyberpunk 2077's director – revisited the dark days of December 2020, when CDPR's new RPG was finally released. With the launch of last year's Phantom Liberty DLC, the game is thankfully now in much better standing than it was several years ago.


Towards the end of the interview, it becomes apparent that the developer is ready to leave 2077 behind for good, saying, "we're done." However, it's possible there will be a few more bits and pieces "here or there," though the team is now fully moving onto new projects.




Shoulder-to-shoulder with the greats


Despite patch 2.12 releasing recently, Amatangelo's words suggest CD Projekt Red is truly moving on from Cyberpunk 2077. Along with the sequel and a new Witcher saga, the studio is hopefully taking some lessons from what it has learned about that disastrous 2020 launch.


And learned it it apparently has as well, as Cyberpunk has been nominated in the People's Choice category at this year's BAFTA Games Awards. It joins such high-profile titles as Baldur's Gate 3, Tears of the Kingdom, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and Lethal Company.


If you want to vote for your favorite out of the options, you can go to the website here. The winner will be announced at the BAFTA ceremony, which is taking place on April 11.

In perhaps the least shocking news of MAR10 Day 2024, Nintendo revealed that another Super Mario Bros. Movie is on the way and it's coming in 2026.
A sequel should come as no surprise, let's not forget that the first film pulled in 168 million views at the global box office and went on to become one of the highest-grossing animated films of all time. Yet there was something about Miyamoto's announcement that suggested things might not be quite as cookie-cutter as we'd expected — "We are now creating a new animated film based on the world of Super Mario Bros." and "We're thinking about broadening Mario's world further". Hmmm.

A cinematic trailer shows off the now white-haired Akuma’s new look and his apparent mastery of the art of punching giant statues to rubble. We’ll have to wait to see gameplay, but this teaser certainly sets the mood for the brooding warrior.

        <updated>2024-03-12T14:16:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starbreeze Studios CEO Tobias Sjögren is no longer with the studio and the Payday 3 developer is now recruiting for a new leader. This news comes from a recent notice to investors that explains board member Juergen Goeldner is taking over as interim CEO in the meantime, as reported by GameDeveloper. 
While Starbreeze's messaging around Sjögren's leave isn't super clear – the team simply says it is bidding farewell to the former CEO – today's news arrives after Payday 3 failed to meet expectations, according to GameDeveloper. 


"On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to thank Tobias Sjögren for his achievements during the past three years," board chairman Torgny Hellström writes in the notice to investors. "Tobias took over the helm of Starbreeze in a challenging phase of its journey and we wish him well in his future endeavors."
Goeldner, the new interim CEO, adds, "Starbreeze has a strong history of developing and publishing games globally. After launching Payday 3, the company is well-positioned to leverage the strengths of the organization to monetize and develop the IP portfolio. I am looking forward to assuming an operative position and, together with the management, ensure the execution of this strategy."
Goeldner has 40 years of experience in the games industry, including several executive positions, according to the notice. His last executive position was as CEO of Focus Home Interactive. He has been a member of Starbreeze's board of directors since last year. Starbreeze has initiated a recruitment process for a permanent CEO. 


Payday 3 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 21. We enjoyed the game around launch, giving it an 8 out of 10 in the Game Informer Payday 3 review. More than 3 million people played Payday 3 in its first month, but the game still failed to meet the expectations of the studio.

As Turn 10 promised early in 2024, Forza Motorsport is due to receive some much-needed improvements over the course of the year. For some time now, we've known exactly what the developer's plan for Motorsport's questionably received car progression mechanics was, but the rework was announced a fair bit earlier than you'd think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moon Studios co-founder and tech and production director Gennadiy Korol has revealed the team's upcoming action-RPG, No Rest for the Wicked, which is also the game on Game Informer's cover this month, will not require an online connection to play single-player. Although, if you've read our cover story about the game, you already know this, and you also know you can play the game with up to three friends on a shared living server.
What's more, Korol says the game will feature "a rich Offline Mode" for those not interested in the game's multiplayer elements.


Korol announced this today on X (formerly Twitter), expanding on Moon's thoughts about No Rest for the Wicked as both a single-player and multiplayer game. 
"Even though Wicked was built from the ground up with multiplayer in mind, we did not want offline-play to feel like a second thought and we want people to be able to play on the go when connection quality is not always ideal," Korol writes. "Our April 18th [Early Access launch on PC] will focus on the single player experience and we will be sharing more details about the Multiplayer aspect of the game later in our Early Access campaign." 


Game Informer has played hours of No Rest for the Wicked, so far only in single-player, and it's been a blast. You can read our preview thoughts on the game's opening hours here, and you can watch it for yourself in our No Rest for the Wicked New Gameplay Today.
Read about No Rest for the Wicked's early access roadmap and Cerim's Crucible endgame content after that, and for even more exclusive content, head to Game Informer's No Rest for the Wicked coverage hub.

Earlier this month, the Switch emulator Yuzu was shut down in response to a legal push from Nintendo. It wasn't all that surprising given the Big-N's historic protection of its properties and disapproval of unsanctioned emulation, and equally unsurprising is that a new Switch emulator is already stepping up to take Yuzu's place — one that, reportedly, is doing everything in its power to avoid a similar legal fate (thanks, Ars Technica).
Suyu (pronounced 'sue-you' *wink, wink* according to the emulator's GitLab page) is built from the Yuzu source code and its aim is to continue the work of "the world's most popular, open-source Nintendo Switch emulator, Yuzu." It is not ready for use just yet, though the development team seems hopeful that it will get off the ground.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Helldivers 2 PC patch makes life a bit easier for players fighting the Terminids, aka monstrous hellbugs, on difficulty level 7 or higher, with tweaks to spawn rates for Chargers and Bile Titans, while increasing the spawn rates of certain other, less heavily armoured Terminids to fill the gap. The developers have also lowered the health of the Charger’s head, allowing for instant takedowns with a Recoilless Rifle or EAT-17, without (in theory) entirely doing away with the community’s treasured "leg meta", which sees players blasting the juggernaut’s limbs to sabotage it.

Set to go live today on PlayStation 5 and PC, Patch 1.000.102 follows a patch from last week that introduced fire tornadoes, meteor showers, weapon buffs, and more to the shooter. 
"Good day citizens of Super Earth," the patch notes read. "A new patch to aid you in your efforts is coming in. May Super Earth give you courage.

In the early 2000s, tennis video games were everywhere. Whether you were talking mass-appeal titles like Virtua Tennis and Mario Tennis or more niche, lower-budget games like Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament and Hard Hitter Tennis, the market was absolutely flooded with choices. One of the most beloved of this era was 2003's Top Spin, which started as an Xbox exclusive before making the leap to PS2 and PC in subsequent years. Since that inaugural game, Top Spin has seen three more numbered entries, all receiving high review scores.

You can imagine my intrigue when I saw that Tents And Trees, a picross-ish puzzle game previously on Switch and phones, is coming to PC on April 24th. That's a couple of months away, but you can play the short demo on Steam now to get a taste. It's slick and clean, and I like it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've written a bit about playing Helldivers 2 as a solo diver, noting that Arrowhead's frenetic shooter holds up surprisingly well when you rudely insist on treating it like an open world stealth sim, a la Metal Gear Solid V. The developers have weighed in on this front, commenting that strictly speaking, Helldivers 2 doesn't support stealth at all. It's just designed in an "agnostic", systems-first way and this in itself makes stealth a possibility. It's also a quiet attempt to capture something of the intricacy of a full-blown military simulator, while still being a very "arcadey" game at heart, which owes a little to Arrowhead's own collective time in the military.

We know that another Super Mario Bros. Movie is on the way (Nintendo confirmed it's coming in 2026, no less), but that doesn't mean that we are quite done talking about its predecessor just yet. In fact, there's something new to look at.
Jed Diffenderfer worked as a story developer and artist on the 2023 Illumination/Nintendo movie, and he has recently uploaded a fresh batch of concept art to his website which shows an initial vision for some of the movie's memorable moments as well as some sections that didn't make the cut (thanks, Nintendo Everything).

WWE 2K24 leverages WrestleMania’s impending 40-year milestone to celebrate the event, and it proves to be a party worth attending. Enjoyable additions and smart improvements bolster its steadily improving formula, making it the strongest in-ring outing since the series’ return.

"All I knew is I'm doing the new game for Blizzard," Bhimani says. "And I knew that Blizzard was, you know, no slouch. They've done a lot of really cool things before, so chances were this was gonna be really cool. But I had no idea. I don't think anyone really did."

However, Konami seems to be waking up from its gambling-induced stupor and has been coaxing developers to bring back their most venerated franchises. For Contra, they went back to WayForward, who were also the developers behind 2007’s Contra 4 on the DS.


I can confirm that Contra Operation Galuga is, at the very least, a Contra game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With update 1.6 just around the corner, Stardew Valley players are champing at the bit for any news they can get and ConcernedApe, a giving soul, has given just a hint of what’s to come with a teaser from the patch notes that’s got players excited. 


While working on the patch notes, ConcernedApe shared the following tweet:




It’s a small update, but one that makes the game just a little less infuriating. At the moment, no matter what quality a fruit tree is, cutting it down will result in only wood and the loss of the tree. To get a new tree, players have to pay a visit to Pierre's shop in order to purchase a new sapling. 


Well, after 1.6, Pierre’s profits are set to drop because cutting down fruit trees will provide players with a sapling, which can be planted to provide the same fruit. Players are understandably overjoyed at the tidbit of information, with commenters celebrating this as a ‘game changer’, especially at end-game when it comes to redesigning the farm. 


There is one caveat to this update, as ConcernedApe details within the comments of his post; saplings that have been obtained through chopping down a tree will grow faster, but the fruit will not be of the same quality immediately, increasing in quality as it always has. 


Patch 1.6 will go live on March 19, the first day of spring, so we’re not likely to see any more small updates like this before then, but we will of course share the patch notes once they’re available, so watch this space.

In Brazil, a deal between MPA and ANCINE was effectively torn up for allegedly prioritizing U.S. content over that produced locally in Brazil.

Along with a Fish Pie, you’ll need to prepare this 5-star ‘delicacy’ to complete Elsa’s level 3 friendship quest, “What Home Feels Like.” It’s also one of Elsa’s common preferred gifts. 


Outside of this, you can still make the dish and it will give you a decent 2,092 energy if eaten, while it sells for 532 Star Coins, so you can make a decent profit if you already have the ingredients to hand.

Arendellian Pickled Herring requires five ingredients that are all relatively easy to collect. You’ll need to utilise Fishing, Foraging and Gardening in order to procure the following items:



1 Lemon

Foraged from Lemon trees, which grow in the Forest of Valor and the Glade of Trust.




1 Onion

Grown from seeds which can be purchased at Goofy’s Stall in the Forest of Valor for 50 Star Coins each. They take 75 minutes to grow and require two waterings in that time. 




1 Herring

Herring can be caught on Dazzle Beach or in the Glade of Trust while fishing in white fishing spots.




1 Garlic

Foraged from the ground in the Forest of Valor. 




1 Spice

Any foragable spice from around the Valley can be used, such as Basil, Oregano or Mint.





Once you’ve got your hands on the necessary items, head to any Cooking Station and as long as you have some coal either in your inventory or in storage, you’ll be able to cook some Arendellian Pickled Herring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Snufkin compares to you.
Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley opens with a goodbye. The music swells and this goodbye pulls hard on the heartstrings. It’s a goodbye to a Moomin, so perhaps you’d think it’s not an important goodbye – just a Moomin, after all. But it sets up the main arc of a well-paced and imaginative musical adventure.
For the uninitiated – and we’re not exactly experts ourselves here – a Moomin looks like a cross between a snowman and a hippo. They walk upright and talk, and appear to have the ability to cultivate crops and build quite sophisticated houses. The human-like Snufkin has seemingly been accepted into their society and is called upon to assist with their various problems. These problems range from a dry garden to a lost manuscript and everything in between. “What could lie in between a dry garden and a lost manuscript?”, you might ask. Answer: a giant crab to whom Snufkin must play a flute at level 4 inspiration. But more on all that later…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No matter the industry – sports, television, movies, or games – the debate of "the greatest of all time" inevitably comes up. These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.
Though we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.
Will this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. 
While this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet. Be sure to bookmark this page or follow us on social media to be alerted when a new round starts!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn't really know anything about Moomins going into adventure game Snufkin: Melody Of Moominvalley, besides that their heads always looked palatable to me - like bleached kidney beans. Plus the Moomin merch I'd seen over the years in official Moomin shops or the odd gift store was delightful, so if someone had rocked up with a pencil case adorned with Moomin heads back in school, you bet I would've been jealous.
And having finished the game, I'm unsure whether I've truly learned any more about the Moomins and their friends. But then again, I've come away thinking that it's a pleasant universe to spend a few hours in, where the wild is celebrated with rebellious song. If you're after the video game equivalent of a walk through the woods on a warm afternoon, Moominvalley is the place to wander.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MultiVersus, the Warner Bros. free-to-play crossover platform fighter, makes its big comeback on May 28. The game has been rebuilt and returns almost a year after its open beta was taken offline.
Player First Games game director Tony Huynh explains in a developer diary that MultiVersus has been remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, meaning it sports improved visuals and lighting. It also has a totally revamped netcode to provide what Huynh promises will be consistent online performance regardless of platform.
Every existing fighter sports new attacks and combat mechanics, and Huynh promises that new fighters are on the way. Additionally, new stages were teased with concept art depicting arenas based on The Powerpuff Girls’ Townsville and Dexter’s Laboratory.
Lastly, Huynh reveals a brand-new PvE mode is coming to the game. He doesn’t go into detail, only teasing it will offer “additional ways of playing with unique rewards.” 


MultiVersus was first launched in open beta last May and pits characters across Warner Bros. stable of IPs, such as DC, Looney Tunes, and even Game of Thrones, in a tag-team-focused twist of Super Smash Bros. inspired combat. The game was initially quite popular and generally well-liked. Writer Bryan Vore gave the game’s beta incarnation an 8 out of 10 in our review, writing that “Living games have the potential to go in frustrating directions, but MultiVersus has a strong foundation. If it can meaningfully roll out content and smooth out its rough edges, this could become a new crossover obsession for years to come.” 
Unfortunately, months of infrequent updates and lack of communication following the game’s second season saw engagement decline. Player First Games pulled MultiVersus from stores to address these criticisms. When the game returns, it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
Are you looking forward to jumping back into the new and improved MultiVersus? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Dave The Diver's latest update is now live on Switch. While the patch notes might not be the beefiest out there, this one contains a couple of neat new features, all the same.
The update brings the game up to the catchy version number ver. 1.0.2.651. Alongside a handful of the usual bug fixes, the latest patch also adds a new language option, tweaks restaurant customisation and introduces a new 'Dream Live' rhythm minigame.

In case you missed it, Nintendo used this year's MAR10 Day celebrations to reveal that Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door will be heading to Switch on 23rd May. Off that back of this date announcement, the Big-N also provided a first look at the game's box art and gave a sneak peek at some new screenshots too.
We'll start things off by judging a game by its cover. @NintendoEurope gave the following look at TTYD's fresh Switch box art, which sees Mario (with a revolutionary new white outline) take centre stage. A host of familiar faces stand in the background. It's much the same as the Japanese cover for the GameCube original, but hey, we rate the vibrancy of the whole thing.

Following the sad passing of Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama at the age of 68, tributes have been pouring in left, right, and centre from numerous notable figures in the entertainment industry and beyond.
One such tribute that caught our eye was a beautiful crossover drawing from none other than Yasushi Yamaguchi (more commonly credited as Judy Totoya), the original creator behind Sonic the Hedgehog's enduring sidekick, Miles 'Tails' Prower (thanks for the tip, 'Coolmusic').

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aggressively attacked.
With Konami seemingly devoid of both in-house developers and any kind of passion to revive their beloved IPs, WayForward, predominately a licence mule during the '00s, is by far the best option for a new Contra entry. Its work on 2007’s brutally hardcore Contra 4 cemented the developer's prowess, allowing the player to grapple hook between the Nintendo DS’s twin screens. Those who stuck with it discovered a worthy tribute to Konami’s iconic series: a strict memoriser full of magnificent setpieces and high-end destruction worthy of the name.
It’s been 16 years too long, and Contra: Operation Galuga has arrived in a markedly different kind of gaming landscape to that of 2007. It’s thanks in part to modern expectations that this new iteration comes with a litany of adjustable content. Where Arcade Mode follows a classic, uncluttered format, Story Mode is filled with cutscenes, in-game communications, and on-screen NPCs that join you sporadically during the action. It isn’t completely necessary and you’ll tire of repeating dialogue interjections as you practice, but, clunky script notwithstanding, it remains a welcome alternative experience. Although Arcade Mode is fat-free and streamlined, and therefore more appealing, we still appreciate having two different ways to tackle the adventure.

Dr. Mario from Game Boy, Mario Golf from Game Boy Color, and Mario Tennis from Game Boy Color join the Switch Online Game Boy catalog. The collection already includes the likes of Super Mario Land 2 – 6 Golden Coins, Kirby's Dream Land 2, The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX, Tetris, The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages, The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons, and Metroid II – Return of Samus. Oddly enough, the library is missing all of the Pokémon titles, as well as the original Super Mario Land.
Dr. Mario, Mario Golf, and Mario Tennis arrive on the service this Tuesday, March 12.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Released more than a decade ago, Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is a little tricky to go back to in 2024 thanks to its 3DS exclusivity. However, during last September's Nintendo Direct, we learned that this well-liked sequel is making the leap to Switch as Luigi's Mansion 2 HD, joining the third entry in the hybrid console's catalog. Today, Nintendo announced that Luigi and his Poltergust 5000 will return to Switch in June.
When it arrived on 3DS in 2013, it received strong review scores, including an 8.5 from Game Informer. This sequel actually involves the younger Mario Bro visiting a series of mansions to capture ghosts and rescue Mario from King Boo. You can see the reveal trailer for Luigi's Mansion 2 HD below.


Luigi's Mansion 2 HD arrives on Nintendo Switch on June 27. If you just can't wait to bust ghosts as Mario's brother, be sure to check out Luigi's Mansion 3, which is perhaps one of the most underrated first-party games on Switch. You can read our review of Luigi's Mansion 3 here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The beloved GameCube RPG, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, finally has a release date for Switch. Announced during September 2023's Nintendo Direct, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is regarded by many as the pinnacle of Mario's RPG outings, and since today is Mario Day, Nintendo took the opportunity to let fans know when they'd be able to play the remaster on Nintendo's hybrid console.
We still don't have many details for this version, but we do know that Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door features improved graphics. It joins a collection of titles starring Mario and his friends over the last several months, including Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Mario vs. Donkey Kong, Princess Peach: Showtime, and the upcoming Luigi's Mansion 2 HD.


Paper-Mario: The Thousand-Year Door arrives exclusively on Nintendo Switch on May 23. For our review of the latest Paper Mario game, The Origami King, head here.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/10/new-super-mario-bros-animated-movie-announced-for-2026-release"/>
        <updated>2024-03-10T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming off last year's overwhelming success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Nintendo and Illumination have announced that work has begun on a second movie set in the world of Super Mario Bros. The announcement, made by Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri, states that this film will arrive in theaters in the United States on April 3, 2026.
While the announcement stops short of calling this "Super Mario Bros. 2" or even referring to it as a sequel, Miyamoto confirms that Nintendo and Illumination are working together on this one, and the director duo of the first film, Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, are returning. "As for the details of the new movie, as I often say, we'll let you know once we're at the stage where we're ready to share more," Miyamoto said in the announcement video posted on Nintendo of America's YouTube channel. "This time, we're thinking about broadening Mario's world further and it'll have a bright and fun story. We hope you'll look forward to it!"
The Super Mario Bros. Movie stars Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, and Seth Rogen. Nintendo and Illumination have yet to confirm any of the cast of this new film set in the Super Mario Bros. world. The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrived in theaters on April 5, 2023 to positive fan and critic reception, and earned a place among the highest-grossing films of all time. The new film set in this same world is set to arrive almost exactly three years later on April 3, 2026.
What do you want to see from a new Super Mario Bros. animated movie? Do you think it'll be another wide cast film? Or will it zero in on a specific subset of characters, like a Luigi's Mansion or Donkey Kong Country movie?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.
The program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.
Like last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.
ScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.
We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.
Based on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.
Looking forward to hearing from you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

However, a few months after the game's June release during The Game Awards 2023, Square Enix revealed FFXVI would be getting two DLCs. 
The first – Echoes of the Fallen – was a combat-centric DLC released that same night. The second – The Rising Tide – is a more expansive, story-focused DLC about the Leviathan Eikon curiously missing from the main game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like a good management game, but my definition of "good" often includes words like "detailed", "complex", or "dangerously all-consuming". That doesn't mean, though, that I don't appreciate something light and simple now and then. In fact, Minami Lane might barely qualify as a management game by some standards.
There's no real pressure, no chance of failure, and its limit of a handful of levels lasting perhaps three or four hours just about taps it out. But sometimes such limitations are intentional, and exactly what you want from a game.

I don't know how White Wolf's RPG is viewed in the land of table tops these days, but here in computerville it has delivered exactly one good video game in the last 25 years (and don't come gibbering to me about 2022's Swansong, it wasn't fit to polish Bloodlines' fangs). Sure, Bloodlines 2 might prove a winner, but given years of delays and a developer change, I'll believe it when I see it.
Which brings us to Vampire: The Masquerade - Justice, the beleaguered series' first prowl through the rain-slick streets of VR. In theory, this should be exactly my cup of haemoglobin; a gothic, linear stealth game where you use your vampire powers to sneak across the rooftops of Venice. In its mechanics and design, Justice aspires to be a cut down version of Dishonored. Unfortunately, it's in the cutting down where most of its problems arise. It's too cramped, too basic, and too fuzzy around the edges, and the whole experience ends up being a bit mid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Famed manga artist and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama has passed away. He was 68.
The news was broken early this morning in a public letter by Toriyama's manga studio, Bird Studio. Bird revealed in a letter posted on the official Dragon Ball X account that Toriyama died on March 1 of acute subdural hematoma. A private funeral service was held, and the studio has asked fans to respect the privacy of Toriyama's family. You can read the full letter below.

March 8, 2024
Akira Toriyama was born in 1955 and became a manga artist at 23. Primarily known for his works in Weekly Shōnen Jump for works such as Dr. Slump, his biggest claim to fame would be Dragon Ball. First published in 1983, Dragon Ball would explode into a cultural phenomenon, spawning a massively popular multimedia franchise with multiple manga volumes, a successful long-running anime, several films, and a litany of merchandise. Dragon Ball has become one of the most influential mangas of all time and would also become a massive fixture in video games, with dozens of titles across a variety of platforms. 
Upcoming games based on Toryiama’s work include Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, the next entry in the Budakai Tenkaichi series, and Sand Land, an action RPG launching on April 26 based on his 2000 manga. 
Toryiama would also lend his distinct art style to video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger, and Blue Dragon. Six years ago, Game Informer editors current and former got together to talk about Toriyama's influence on the game industry. You can watch that video here.
Game Informer extends its condolences to Toriyama’s family and loved ones.]]></summary>

Is Dune appropriative? Is the appropriation the point? Whatever the case, Funcom want you to know that their upcoming survival game Dune: Awakening has nothing to do with any of that, posting a short Xeet from the official Awakening account that's the written equivalent of sticking your arms straight out, waving your hands, and going "Woahwoahwoah, hang on a minute."
"We agree that religion is an integral part of the Dune universe. This is why in Dune: Awakening you will meet and interact with people of different religions along your journey. However, as opposed to the story presented in the books, the player is not a messiah and will not play a major role in any of them. Leading people on a holy war is not why you arrive on Arrakis," reads the post in full. Personally, I approve of this effort to keep games apolitical. Politics? In my Dune. No thank you. I am of course being facetious. There is still religion and politics in Dune: Awakening, as confirmed by the statement, but you yourself aren't doing much of it.

Sometimes, a great idea can come from a simple premise. That’s how Son and Bone, the next game from TeamKill Media, the studio behind last year’s Quantum Error, came to be: a first-person shooter where you kill dinosaurs. Inspired by the dormant Turok series, TeamKill’s lead developer Micah Jones remarks about a joke the studio’s fans have made since the reveal of its dinosaur shooter at the top of the year. “They say, ‘If other game companies won’t do it, these developers will,’” Jones says, explaining that everyone on the team is a big fan of the Turok series.
After watching roughly 10 minutes of new Son and Bone gameplay, the Turok inspiration is…]]></summary>

Also, I can take the opportunity to make fun of Graham and James, the tallest wrongest boys at RPS, who apparently both liked it.

There's been a certain amount of PlayStation-instigated speculation about whether the meat is CGI-generated, following the last round of Dragon's Dogma 2 previews. Speaking to Japanese site 4Gamer, as translated by Automaton, Itsuno revealed that the game's scenes of sizzling flesh are derived from live action film of steaks being grilled - partly for the sake of authenticity, and partly to save money versus creating computer models of meat products. You can cook several types of meat in Dragon's Dogma, each of which has its own cutscene, and a number of Dragon's Dogmatists are already performatively salivating at the prospect on social media.

Coming off the success of Sonic Mania, the development team behind one of the best games in Sega’s storied series is back with an all-new franchise. Much like how the studio now known as Evening Star’s previous effort was a love letter to a bygone era of platforming, Penny’s Big Breakaway is a fond tribute to the 3D platformers of the late ‘90s. Evening Star clearly knows how to design a fantastic new entry in this well-worn genre, but some important issues drag down an otherwise strong game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the sillier aspects of the original Dragon's Dogma was accidentally falling head over heels for some rando innkeeper, and having them appear beside you as your sweetheart during the ending scenes, much to the surprise of many players who didn't realise they were hitting on every NPC they did a favour for. 


The game's Affinity system saw NPCs organically forming an attachment to players when you interacted with them, gave them things or carried out tasks for them. Towards the conclusion, one NPC is selected as "Beloved" and promptly abducted by a dragon for you to quest forth and rescue. There are a few characters who are positioned more obviously as romanceables, but the brilliance of the system is that you can raise your Affinity with pretty much anybody. If you want to finish the game staring passionately into the eyes of the court jester or that hearty bloke who runs the armour shop, it's within your power.

Discovery has decided to "retire" 2016's noodling around puzzle game Small Radios Big Televisions - meaning it'll disappear off storefronts in the next 60 days. Developer Owen Deery revealed this news on Xitter a couple of days ago, simultaneously announcing that the game is now free to download. Deery also noted you can buy the synthy soundtrack to show support.

Your shopping basket from the Steam store is now shared between devices, so if you put something in there on browser you can finish it up on your Steam Deck. But, more importantly, you can now hide single, selected games from your library, so your friends can't see when you're playing them - or even that you own them. Obviously the first thing that comes to mind is that this could usher in a new dawn of secret perverts able to hide their embarrassing 3D sex games, but are there other use cases for it? We discuss on this week's podcast. Plus: we've been playing current games! Cheese! And some more booze recommendations from James!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zoria: Age Of Shattering speedruns its fantasy RPG origin story in a quick cutscene montage at the start, so we might as well get that out of the way first, too. Low fantasy world, two warring kingdoms, one uses necromancy (this is cast as bad and cheating rather than practical, for some reason) to comprehensively gain the upper hand, and everything is named like a bunch of Scrabble letters were thrown randomly on the table. You play Elion war hero Captain Witherel - gender and class TBD by the player - in a small group making a final stand at the fortress Daeg Marastir, which is being overrun by the nefarious Izirian army. We start in media bellum, as it were.
This first stage, where you escape the fortress, gives you a whistle-stop tour of the main systems in the game. You control a squad of four, the combat is turn-based, you can pitch camp at any time to rest and heal up, and there are crafting systems for potions, food and gear. Zoria isn't really remaking the wheel as much as it is taking spokes from a bunch of other fantasy RPGs you like, and the result is the terrier of RPGs. Small, clearly has a lot of different DNA knocking around in there, and punches above its weight, but it's a bit scrappy and sometimes it's knees dislocate and it falls over. This terrier was made by three people, so that is sort of to be expected.

Not only did it bring a mafia-themed season to the battle royale aspect of Fortnite, with a new battle pass too, but it introduced three new ways to play the game: Fortnite Festival, a Rock Band-like experience developed by Harmonix, Lego Fortnite, a Minecraft-like survival experience, and Rocket Racing, a racing game developed by Rocket League studio Psyonix.
As Season 1 of Chapter 5 reaches its closing hours, Epic Games has revealed the next season is called Myths & Mortals, promising a Greek Mythology-themed season with skins of gods and goddesses and more. 
Prepare thyselves, mere mortals!

Unfortunately, the above announcement and accompanying image is all we have so far of Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 2, but there's plenty to discover in this teaser alone. It seems like the there's a comedic Poseidon skin on the left, and a Hades skin in the center alongside perhaps Zeus and Athena up front. There appear to be some flying Green Goblin-esque gliders at play, too, with new point-of-interest locations themed after these Greek gods and goddesses in the background.
Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait too long because Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 2 – Myths & Mortals begins tomorrow, March 8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the summer of 2020, Unknown 9: Awakening has only existed as a 90-second cinematic teaser trailer. In it, a young girl called Haroona is chased through the narrow streets of Calcutta by a rabble of boys armed with sticks. It's not clear why she's attracted their ire, but as one moves to strike her, a shockwave pulses out from her small body, the world turns grey, and time slows down. As she deftly moves out of harm's way, she turns back to look at her stunned onlookers, a confident smirk rising on her face.
It was a striking, if utterly ambiguous debut, and with talk of accompanying podcasts, books, comics and a web series also on the way to help build out this new world even further, it felt like developers Reflector Entertainment were really setting out to make a bold and ambitious first impression. But it's now been four years since that trailer. The books, podcasts and comics have all come and gone, seemingly making little impression, and Awakening, the game aiming to pull this big, expanded universe together, has arguably slipped from both time and memory. Perhaps this will change with its newly-dated summer 2024 release window on the horizon, but having seen a small, hands-off slice of an early mission in the game at publisher Bandai Namco's offices a couple of weeks ago, Awakening's certainly got its work cut out for it.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/07/helldivers-2-season-2-launches-next-week-with-new-cutting-edge-warbond"/>
        <updated>2024-03-07T14:57:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arrowhead Game Studios has revealed in a PlayStation Blog post that Season 2 of Helldivers 2 launches next week with a new "Cutting Edge" Warbond. This new Warbond is packed with "high-voltage vibes," giving players access to new loadout potential with ultra-futuristic armor, guns that spit lightning, stylish capes, emotes, and more. 
Warbond – Cutting Edge goes live next week on March 14 and brings with it a new "Acquisitions" battle pass of things to unlock. However, don't fret if you're still working through the first free and premium Warbonds in Helldivers 2 – Warbonds don't expire. 
Check out the Helldivers 2 Warbond – Cutting Edge trailer for yourself below: 


Within this new Warbond, players will find multiple EX Series armor prototypes. The EX-03 Prototype 3 includes a rubber underlayer for insulation with "wires that operate at a shocking 400,000 volts." The EX-16 Prototype 16 has an electric arc that generates a strong magnetic field. The EX-00 Prototype X is the "end result of several billion Super Credits and 12 years of research into creating 'the Soldier of Tomorrow.'"
In terms of new weapons, expect electricity. The LAS-16 is a laser rifle that fires in short bursts, and it doesn't need reloading either (just watch for overheating). The SG-8P Punisher Plasma is a modified Punisher shotgun that uses plasma rounds, and the ARC-12 Blitzer projects an arc of close-range lightning. Or, you can charge it up to fire powerful bolts good for taking out multiple targets. 
You can also unlock the new G-23 Stun grenade and the LAS-7 Dagger pistol, too. 

Elsewhere in this Warbond, Helldivers will find matching player cards for each cape and three new emotes. 
Cutting Edge rolls out to Destroyer Acquisition panels on March 14. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about the latest patch that added meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the war.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Studios has released the first official trailer for its upcoming Fallout TV series and unsurprisingly, it features power armor, a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, Vault Dwellers, and plenty more. And it looks great. Today's trailer is just a three-minute tease of what awaits in the full series, which premiers next month on April 11 (originally set to premiere April 12, its premiere has been moved up one day), exclusively on Amazon Prime Video. 
The trailer begins with a character explaining the importance of vaults before the world falls to nuclear destruction. Fast forward 200 years and Vault Dwellers emerge, ready to discover what awaits in the vast Californian wasteland. We get new looks at Ella Purnell's Jean, the primary Vault Dweller protagonist, Walton Goggins' Ghoul, Kyle MacLachlan's mysterious character, Aaron Clifton Moten's Maximus, who is a member of the Brotherhood of Steel, and more. 
Check it out for yourself below in the Fallout TV series live-action trailer: 


"Based on one of the greatest video game series of all time, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there's almost nothing left to have," a press release reads. "200 years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind – and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them." 
Amazon Studios, which is behind series like The Boys and Invincible, is producing Fallout alongside Kilter Films and executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. Nolan directed the first three episodes of Fallout. 
Fallout premieres on Amazon Prime Video on April 11. 
For more, check out the teaser trailer for Fallout released back in December. After that, read Game Informer's reviews of Fallout 4 and Fallout 76.

However, I recently had the chance to meet with publisher Bandai Namco and developer Reflector Entertainment to learn more about the game and see the first gameplay footage.

This news comes by way of VideoGamesChronicle, which reports that the existing pay for "new graduate hires" is around $1,560 per month but, starting in Capcom's 2025 fiscal year, that will change to around $2000 a month, representing a more than 25 percent jump in pay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Xbox Partner Preview gave us a new look at Frostpunk 2, including a release date.  First announced in 2021, 11 Bit Studios’ tense city-management sim arrives on July 25, and it’s also coming to PC Game Pass.
A new trailer shows off some of the game’s bleak, choice-driven gameplay. You’re charged with leading a city set within an inhospitable frozen wasteland, making decisions about how it’s governed to keep mouths fed and, hopefully, happy. That includes managing labor, politics, and even the food supply, which can ingratiate you to citizens or, worst case, cause them to revolt.  


Frostpunk 2 will first launch on PC but will come to consoles at a later date (including Xbox Game Pass). You can read our review of the first Frostpunk here.]]></summary>

But their latest venture - created in partnership with developers Chibig and Inverge Studios, and co-written by Rhianna Pratchett - is drastically different. Titled Creatures Of Ava, it's a fantasy game about saving Pokémon-like creatures, as opposed to, well, imprisoning them and using them for labour (Palworld, I'm looking at you).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About eight months ago, Capcom and Microsoft revealed Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess in somewhat vague terms. It is an action game based in and inspired by historical Japan, but that was about all we knew. Today, Capcom showed a lot more gameplay and offered some additional insight into the single player game. Plus it detailed more of exactly what the game is on its Xbox Wire page.
The action is defined as "dancing swords," but you will also be making decisions about what villagers you will take with you on your journey, leading to some strategic elements. You will apparently be making preparations for battle during the day to protect your Maiden and the village before the night, which is when battle takes place.


Capcom and Microsoft do not have a release date for the game yet, but it is apparently coming this year and will be included with Game Pass subscriptions.]]></summary>

The new and extremely damp survival horror game, set in a heavily flooded New England city in the 1920s, is pivoting the studio to a "'horror-first' focus with gameplay primarily built around combat, exploration and its Lovecraftian setting and story". This is a step away from the studio's mainstay, the Sherlock Holmes detective games, and I am uncertain about the choice. But let's peer through the weeds a bit further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last July, Square Enix revealed that Final Fantasy XIV, the critically acclaimed and long-running MMORPG, would be coming to Xbox Series X/S this spring. After a quick but seemingly successful open beta period on the platform, the company has revealed Final Fantasy XIV will fully launch on Xbox Series X/S on March 21. 
This news was revealed during the Xbox Partner Preview, with a reminder that players can partake in the open beta right now. Square Enix also revealed that the starter edition of the game, which includes the base campaign A Realm Reborn and the Heavensward and Stormblood expansions, will be available through Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. However, you must claim it as a perk between March 21 and April 19. 


The timing of the Xbox Series X/S launch for Final Fantasy XIV comes at a great time as the game's next expansion, Dawntrail, is set to launch this summer. Here's a breakdown of everything you need to know about Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail. 
Before Dawntrail, though, you'll need to play up through the latest expansion, Endwalker, to be fully caught up on the entire story. Getting caught up should be a lot of fun, though, and you'll get to find out why Final Fantasy XIV is ranked so high on Game Informer's ranking of every mainline Final Fantasy game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Alters is a fascinating new sci-fi survival game from 11 Bit Studios, makers of Frostpunk and This War of Mine. First revealed last October, the game stars a man named Jan shipwrecked on a desolate planet with no one to rely on but himself. And by "himself," I mean multiple versions of himself.
Jan is a miner who crashlands on a hostile planet closely orbiting a star, resulting in deadly hot sunrises. His only method of survival is a high-tech mobile base that requires multiple people with various skills to operate. Thankfully, he harnesses a resource called Rapidium that allows him to create several copies of himself, each their own sentient being with independent specialties and personalities reflecting the "what if" scenarios of Jan's life. These copies, or Alters, also have their own ambitions and fears, which will lead to conflicts as you try to work together to survive and, hopefully, escape. 


The Alters is launching sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Today's Xbox Partner Preview also revealed it's coming to Game Pass for console and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost of Tsushima is finally riding to PC. The game’s Director’s Cut is making its way to Steam and the Epic Games Store on May 16 and includes PC-specific enhancements. 
In terms of content, the Director’s Cut includes the full game, the Iki Island story expansion, and the co-op multiplayer Legends mode. Pre-ordering the PC version also earns the following unlocks: New Game+ Horse, Traveler’s Attire, and Broken Armor dyes from Baku’s shop. 


Developer Sucker Punch has partnered with Nixxes Software on this PC port. The game has been optimized for PC with unlocked frame rates, custom mouse/keyboard controls, and various graphical settings.
Per the PlayStation Blog post, “NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3 are available with both upscaling and frame generation options. Intel XeSS upscaling is also supported and if your hardware has headroom to spare, you can use NVIDIA DLAA or FSR 3 Native AA to further boost image quality.” 
Ghost of Tsushima on PC also features ultra-wide monitor support, including 21:9 and 32:9 resolutions, as well as 48:9 resolutions for triple monitor setups. 
Ghost of Tsushima first launched for PlayStation 4 in 2020. It stars Jin Sakai, a samurai fighting to protect Tsushima Island from invading Mongols in 1274. The open-world game gives players the choice to take enemies down honorably (face-to-face in combat) or to utilize stealthier, more dishonorable tactics to rescue the island. You can read our review of the original version of Ghost of Tsushima, in which we scored it a 9.5 out of 10, here, and our glowing impressions of the Director’s Cut here.]]></summary>

One of the prominent changes with the NVIDIA R550 Linux driver is bringing the GeForce and workstation GPU support up to "CERTIFIED" quality when using NVIDIA's open kernel modules that are distributed as part of their driver package. Previously the open-source (out-of-tree) kernel modules were just certified for their data center GPUs while now they are basically acknowledging that they are in good shape too for GeForce and workstation products. In this article are some benchmarks of the open and proprietary kernel driver options of the NVIDIA R550 Linux driver.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not long ago, a few of us from the RPS Treehouse wandered through first-person survival 'em up Nightingale with its boss Aaryn Flynn, and then had it out about the game's crafting menus. I was one of the folks who wasn't so hot on what we'd played, and I'd hoped that the early access version would prove me wrong.
Alas, I am sad to report that I still do not like Nightingale. From what I've played so far, the game is an awkward marriage of survival game and live service loot grind, which makes you feel divorced from the very world you inhabit.

However, Rocksteady is looking to pump something new into the game with the release of Joker as a playable character. 
Teased back in January as an Elseworlds version of the popular villain, this Joker, notably not the same voiced by Mark Hamill in the Arkham games, goes live on March 28. Rocksteady revealed this release date the same day its parent company, Warner Bros., announced it is doubling down on live-service and free-to-play games.

The patch nerfs three of what were hitherto the best Helldivers 2 guns and gear pieces - the SG-225 Breaker shotgun, the RS-422 railgun, and the SH-32 shield generator backpack, all of which break Arrowhead's pretty straightforward golden rule that "each gun has its purpose and none is strictly better than another".

Perhaps the most exciting aspect of Minor Patch 01.000.100 is the addition of new environmental challenges that appear at random on many of the game's various planets. Arrowhead says that includes fire tornadoes, meteor showers, "and many more." The other big change affects Eradicate missions, which task helldivers with killing a specified amount of bug enemies in a small area.

Look out for parts 2 and 3 over the coming week. During the hands-on, I also spent 45 minutes in the shoes of another advanced Dragon's Dogma 2 class, the Magic - sorry, Magick Archer. You might remember this vocation from the original Dragon's Dogma; then as now, it combines relatively straightforward bow combat with various breeds of enchanted ammunition, for a surprisingly technical skillset that is enjoyable to faff around with.

I haven't played an Outlast game since reviewing the second numbered game and having excitable opinions about its portrayal of the moon. I'll be honest, I'd assumed the series had died, but Steam user reviewers seem pretty keen on Trials, which takes the first game's mucky asylum premise and spins it out into a low-key live service game about playing a series of human guinea pigs, trying to escape an experimental brainwashing lab run by the villainous Murkoff Corporation.

Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before I sat down to play three hours of Dragon's Dogma 2 at a Capcom event last month, I gave myself two broad objectives. The first was to discover if there's anything genuinely different about this undeniably enchanting but very familiar sequel to one of the happiest, barmiest action-RPGs of the past 20 years. The second was to royally screw myself by fielding a party consisting exclusively of magic-users. 


In Dragon’s Dogma 2 as in Dragon’s Dogma 1, you lead a gang of up to three AI-controlled "pawn" characters – one permanent main sidekick who levels up alongside you, plus two auxiliary pawns created by other players, who are either summoned at Rift stones or spawned into the open world as hired help. As in most RPGs, the ideal party setup is a mix of pure melee, ranged and magical DPS or support classes, but given the whimsicality of Dragon’s Dogma’s sorcery, with its levitation spells and lightning whips, I’ve always wanted to try a whole playthrough as a posse of unescorted occultists.

Sitting in Capcom's San Francisco, California, office, just 30 minutes to go until my interview with Itsuno, I saw that he tweeted about Dragon's Dogma 2's framerate. Specifically, he revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that Dragon's Dogma 2 will release with an uncapped framerate.

No Rest for the Wicked (NRftW) graces Game Informer's cover this month, and it marks a dramatic shift for Moon Studios for several reasons. For one, it's an action RPG from the team that gave us two of the best platformers/Metroidvanias ever in Ori and the Blind Forest and Ori and the Will of the Wisps. You can read all about what the game entails in our digital issue, which is available now. But another huge shift is that NRftW will first launch into Steam Early Access on April 18. 
That means everything revealed about the game so far is subject…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In August 2023, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem arrived in theaters, and, much to the delight of both longtime and newer fans, it was a terrific and fun watch. Just over a month after its theatrical debut, Paramount and Nickelodeon announced that publisher Outright Games and developer A Heartful of Games would be releasing a follow-up video game set in the Mutant Mayhem universe. While it hasn't had a name to this point, Game Informer can now exclusively confirm that the title is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed.
Warning: This article contains spoilers for the 2023 film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.

The 3D brawler/platformer picks up after the events of Mutant Mayhem; the Turtles have been accepted by society following their heroics against Superfly and his band of mutants. Unfortunately, their dream of attending high school as average, everyday students is suddenly interrupted by a new wave of mutants invading New York City. Featuring an all-original storyline, Mutants Unleashed aims to have the same brand of humor as the 2023 film.
Players take control of the four hero turtles, each with a unique playstyle, as they fight their way through the sewers and streets of New York. Outright Games touts how immersive both the world above and below ground is, as well as the cast of familiar faces for the brothers to meet and fight. As co-op is a massive piece of the history of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games, players can enjoy two-player local co-op in Mutants Unleashed. 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed is set to arrive near the end of this year for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. For more info on the other big TMNT video game in development, The Last Ronin, head here for our exclusive interview with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co-creator Kevin Eastman.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1987, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles creators Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird developed a storyline for their creation that never came to fruition. Titled "The Last Ronin," Eastman and Laird envisioned it as the final Turtles story set 30 years in the future. While Eastman and Laird never got around to creating that storyline in the original run of their comics under their company Mirage Studios, the idea stuck with Eastman through the years, and decades later, as part of the franchise's new life with IDW Publishing, he worked with his longtime collaborator Tom Waltz to bring the idea to the pages of a five-issue miniseries that ran from 2020 to 2022.
The story is bleak and gritty, establishing a universe where the four beloved brothers have been taken out one by one. It's set in an alterna…]]></summary>

After the closure, a former Free Radical developer revealed they'd worked on a "clone" of Fortnite before it transitioned to a remake of Timesplitters 2. And now footage has emerged of the cancelled project, which certainly does look like a team shooter reminiscent of Epic's epic.

Nintendo named an unknown company as the sole defendant, while focusing on the actions of Yuzu's lead developer, who wasn't named as a defendant, or even named at all. A joint motion for a $2.4m judgment in favor of Nintendo was filed on Monday. The cost to the emulation scene appear in a proposed injunction.

That anatomically tricky relationship is enticing by itself, but even if those retro action platformers just register as historical relics in your memory, Berserk Boy does enough that’s new and interesting that it doesn’t need to rely on aping its inspirations. My only beef is that credits rolled before I was properly given a chance to test my newfound robo-bashing muscles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you dislike getting stabbed in the back in first-person games, you might not like Voin. If you like ravaged Gothic masonry and dramatic evening skies, you might like Voin. If you dislike fighting fireball-lobbing demons with a sword, you might not like Voin. If you like open-ended, changeable levels full of loot and secrets, you might like Voin. If you are confused about whether you'll like or dislike Voin, you might want to try it for yourself during the first public Steam playtest on Friday, March 8th.

Having spent all of 30 minutes with an early playtest build, I'm cautiously impressed. I suspect there are cooler, less-known inspirations at work, but this feels like a Demon's Souls-ified Doom Eternal that doesn't quite have Doom Eternal's swagger and precision, probably because it is the work of just one developer, Nikita Sozidar, rather than hundreds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone who finds games about cars wot go fast only intermittently interesting, I'd expect a game about cars wot go slow to be positively soporific. Speed is, ultimately, the modus operandi of a car. It gets you where you need to go faster than a horse, and doesn't do annoying things like pooing on your patio or dying (also, potentially, on your patio). Surely, then, playing a game about cars moving at the speed of a dead patio horse defeats the point, like playing a first-person shooter where all the guns fire backwards.


Expeditions: A Mudrunner Game demonstrates this not to be the case. This bouncy, slimy off-roading simulator is the most fun I've had with an imaginary car since 2018's Jalopy. This is partly because it is as much a physics puzzler filled with limitless conundrums as it is a game about driving, but also because, like Jalopy, it envisions the car as something more than a way to boost egos by doing a big circle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we first meet The Thaumaturge's hero Wiktor Szulski, we're told he's a man cursed by the vice of pride. It's a trait that sits at the heart of his personality, and in this particular alt-history telling of Polish turmoil in Warsaw at the turn of the twentieth century, such 'Flaws' can also attract the attention of otherworldly beings called Salutors - vicious creatures of myth and folklore who follow their quarry around like dark and gloomy shadows, amplifying their worst qualities and, in many cases, driving them to emotional, and often violent, extremes. It's these outbursts that Wiktor will be investigating over the course of this curious detective RPG from the makers of Seven: The Days Long Gone and the upcoming The Witcher 1 Remake, as fortunately for him, Wiktor comes from a long line of storied Salutor tamers, his thaumaturgic know-how allowing him to see these monsters made flesh, exorcise them from their human host, and use them for his own gains.
He's a man that's ultimately made peace with his own arrogance, then, but considering everything he goes through during The Thaumaturge's 25 hour-odd run-time, I reckon his pride is pretty justified. Not only is he able to brush off multiple stab and gunshot wounds and clubs to the face when he gets in a fight, but he also achieves several feats of thaumaturgy that we're repeatedly told are thought to be nigh on impossible. Indeed, at the start of this game, his connection with his original Salutor Upyr is hanging by a thread, his worst instincts having got the best of him in a recent attempt to tame and capture a second beast from the ether. By the end, however, I had six Salutors at my beck and call, out of a total of eight. Wiktor is very much a force to be reckoned with, and he makes for a highly compelling lead as you navigate the branching storylines in Warsaw's political hotbed.

In the middle of the white space there is a curious little yellow machine, a kind of motorised plunger akin to an oil derrick. In the story of Sixty Four, you're late to some kind of social engagement, somewhere beyond that beaming expanse of whiteness. But there is time, even as texts from a friend appear down the lefthand margin, to mess around with the strange yellow machine.

What I find more interesting is that this launched with some official IRL Sims plumbob jewellery that you can buy and wear around your own precious, swan-like neck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eco is a very ambitious, wildly reactive multiplayer survival game in which you try to save the world without accidentally destroying it. There's a meteor scheduled to slamdunk the planet in 30 days, and in that time, you and your fellow players must progress from raising log cabins in the woods to building the means to develop technologies that might somehow avert the apocalypse. The trouble is, pioneering said apocalypse-averting technologies might itself bring about disaster in a gameworld that simulates things like habitat death, species extinction, air pollution and catastrophic flooding. 


Players must thus walk a careful line between resource exploitation and self-inflicted calamity by monitoring their impact on the overall simulation, founding the right kind of government, and passing laws or devising economies (including player-created currencies) that don't flip the ecosystem upside down. The Steam reviews teem with anecdotes about people waking up to find their oil wells underwater, and it sounds like things will only get knottier when Eco releases out of early access around the end of this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I still don’t fully understand the rancor with which the RTX 4070 Ti is often regarded. Where some see an overpriced, memory-deprived albatross of a graphics card, I’ve only ever seen a fast and feature-rich GPU whose 12GB of VRAM is demonstrably fine for 99.95% of games at 4K. A better deal than the RTX 4080 for that resolution, in any case.
Now, though, we can all agree: nobody should buy an RTX 4070 Ti. Not when the RTX 4070 Ti Super is here, doing a better, hopefully less contentious job of smooth 4K without demanding RTX 4080 (or, indeed, RTX 4080 Super) levels of investment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week's alleged Epic Games hack was a scam, so-called "ransomware" group Mogilevich have confessed, or at least, are reported to have confessed in a self-congratulary new statement. The group have not, it now seems, stolen a bunch of login data, WIP software and payment information from the creators of Fortnite; they were only pretending to have done so with a view to duping other hackers into buying their tools. 


Or at least, that's what they're said to be saying now. I haven't tracked down the original source for Mogilevich's latest statement, and in any case, anything you read from a self-described "professional fraudster" should probably be treated with caution. Still, it lines up with Epic's own comments last week that there was no real sign that a hack had taken place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today we released our first candidate for version 14! That means we will start to focus on fixing the remaining bugs and stop adding new features. Thanks to the reports made by many of you, we have already solved many of the issues. But there might still be a few issues lurking around in this release candidate. Please share your findings on our issue tracker. Thanks to our translators, about half of the translations are (nearly) up-to-date. For the other half, we might need your help with translating. If your language is missing or has more than a few dozen missing strings, please consider helping to finish your translation. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

The pixel-art OpenTTD fonts are iconic, but were designed for 640x480 CRT monitors rather than today’s 4k monsters. Without the horizontal smoothing of CRT scanlines, modern pixel-perfect rendering and 2x or 4x upscaling of the old bitmap/sprite-based fonts makes the text jagged and hard to read.]]></summary>
