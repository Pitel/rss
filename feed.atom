Evo, the fighting game championship series is taking place this August, and the main set of games are being announced on the Evo Twitch channel tonight.

Evo 2022's main tournament lineup includes:
Street Fighter V: Championship Edition
Guilty Gear –Strive–
Mortal Kombat 11
Tekken 7
The King of Fighters XV
More as the story develops...
Evo 2022 takes place August 5 - 7 in Las Vegas, NV at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. Not only will the main games above be available to play in the big tournament, but will be plenty of side events and a huge casual play area where all kinds of fighting games can and will be played. For more information, and to register to compete, check out the Evo Championship Series website.]]></summary>

Nintendo's N64 library for the Switch Online Expansion Pack service may have been a tad underwhelming on release, but it's already improved a lot since then.
Not only has Nintendo gone to the effort of fixing a number of issues associated with the emulation of certain games, but it's also bolstered the service with a number no classics. We've already seen games like Banjo-Kazooie and The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, and next up is the futuristic racer F-Zero X, starring Captain Falcon and co.

Destiny enthusiasts had a long wait for this latest expansion, and Bungie rewarded that patience with an outstanding installment. The Witch Queen is one of the studio’s most sophisticated releases, both in terms of storytelling and gameplay systems, and that complexity is especially rewarding to longtime players. That same depth across the breadth of the expansion also means it may be difficult for newer or lapsed players to climb aboard. For those that embrace the full scope of what’s on offer, the Witch Queen has both tricks and treat…]]></summary>

We're just about at the doorstep of Chaos with the impending release of Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin. And since Jack Garland and friends are almost here, Square Enix has come out and announced the PC hardware specs for the game. While it is a cross-generation title, the requirements listed are surprisingly lesser than one would imagine for a 2022 release. 
Introducing the minimum and recommended specs to play Stranger of Paradise @FinalFantasy Origin, Available March 18th.
@EpicGames Store now: https://t.co/muQkLDemU2 pic.twitter.com/gEyhOSEYLv
March 8, 2022
Here's what Square Enix says are the minimum requirements to run Stranger of Paradise:
Operating System: Windows 10 64-bit


And here are the recommended specifications to run Stranger of Paradice at 60 FPS at 1920x1080p resolution:
Operating System: Windows 10 64-bit


Final Fantasy Origin should be able to run just fine on a gaming PC that's a few years old, and given how tough new graphics cards can be to get ahold of, I'm sure these lax requirements will be appreciated by many. It's assumed that going higher in resolution will require a beefier rig than the specs listed above, but how much more power that's needed is unknown at this time. 
Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin releases on March 18 and will be available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, as well as PC.]]></summary>

The twist is that you're trying to identify a song, with each guess revealing an extra few seconds from the opening bars. It's got me in its (melodic) hooks - and you can play it in your browser now.

Political storylines are often a reminder of the ugliness that exists in our world. Greed and corruption usually drive the ship, leading those in charge to make difficult decisions about no-win situations. Triangle Strategy represents the worst side of humanity in these instances, forcing you to question if peace is a naive dream and if we can ever get out of the cycle of war.
As a newly appointed leader, that’s up to you to decide. Thought-provoking questions about how to handle horrible situations make Triangle Strategy a gripping experience, while the entertaining strategy combat keeps you coming back to face them. Unfortunatel…]]></summary>

This is clearly me fighting a losing semantic battle, but in any case, Humble's Boomer Shooters Bundle has a lot of great games, including Dusk, Amid Evil, Ion Fury, HROT, and more for £9.05/$12.

These colourful JRPGs have been hiding some of the deepest and most satisfying levelling systems in all of gaming behind the world's most obnoxious anime characters for years now.

The next brutal gauntlet is Disgaea 6 Complete, with a newly announced released date of June 28th. There's also a new character trailer below, which sets out its stall. Can you survive it?

Nintendo has released a new six-minute overview trailer for Kirby and the Forgotten Land that further showcases copy abilities, mouthful mode, Waddle Dee Town, and more ahead of the game’s release on Switch later this month. 
With the game set to release on March 25, this new trailer will help tide you over until then, especially if you’ve already put the demo available for Kirby and the Forgotten Land through its paces. It begins by setting the stage for how Kirby even arrives to the might-just-be-earth-but-called-Forgotten Land. He’s sucked up into a terrifying storm cloud and spat back to this…]]></summary>

As noted by our friends over at Retronauts (and many others), today marks what would have been the 100th birthday of the man many call the father of video games, Ralph Baer. It's hard to say, but without Baer's work as an inventor and pioneer that developed the first video game console for the home with the Magnavox Odyssey, the industry would look very different today.
Born in Germany on 8th March 1922, Baer and his family moved to America when he was a teenager. Baer signed up to the National Radio Institute as a radio service technician, and graduated in 1940. Just three years later, he was drafted into the army to fight in World War II, where he served in military intelligence.

In this case, though, Nintendo itself has divulged 10 'tactical tips' to help give you an edge in battle. They're pretty good too! None of this "check out the in-game settings to adjust your brightness" nonsense; no, these are genuinely useful hints and tips that are sure to give both newcomers and veterans a decent leg up.

The original Dying Light is getting a new-gen bump thanks to its previously announced new-gen patch finally hitting the PlayStation version today (and Xbox in the near future). 
If you've been itching to fire up Dying Light on PS5, you'll now be treated to the following performance options: 
Performance Mode: 60 FPS in full HD 
Balanced Mode: 60 FPS in Quad HD
High-Resolution Mode: 30 FPS in 4K
The update also increases the draw distance while playing on PS5 by 25 percent. Additionally, Dying Light on PlayStation 4 Pro has an improved 30 FPS cap and network functionality. 
Dying Light on Xbox Series X will receive the exact same patch as the PS5 sometime soon. Those playing on Xbox Series S and Xbox One will get a pared-down version of the patch with the following features:
Performance Mode: 30 FPS in full HD
High-Resolution Mode: 30 FPS Quad HD 
Dying Light 2 Stay Human may be the new hotness, but Techland has continued supporting its predecessor by adding free weapons skins in January and ported the game to Switch last October. It's cool to see the beloved game remain in the spotlight, and this patch brings it closer to parity with its successor.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Future of 'Twinbee'-style shooter 'Steam Pilots' now in doubt.
Former Konami composer Motoaki Furukawa – who composed music for the likes of Snatcher, Sunset Riders, Metal Gear and Salamander – is being sued by the Japanese studio hired to work on his TwinBee spiritual successor, it has been revealed.
The cause of the problem is the game Steam Pilots, developed by Japanese outfit Pixel. Steam Pilots was crowdfunded to the tune of more than 10 million yen (roughly $86,000), but is unlikely to see release.

Previously due on the 24th of May, it's now slated for the 11th of October. Sounds like Squeenix hope to make it the start of a new series, so they're taking time to help ensure it's proper good. Fair enough.

Square Enix has plenty of long-running powerhouse franchises under its belt, from Final Fantasy to Dragon Quest. But every so often, the acclaimed publisher takes a chance on a new idea, and that looks like something we’ll be seeing more of thanks to the establishment of Luminous Productions.
Luminous Productions was formed for the sole purpose of developing new IPs, and for its first project, Forspoken, the studio wasn’t afraid to step outside of its comfort zone and bring in new talent, like Gary Whitta (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) and Amy Hennig (Uncharted), to realize its ambition.

Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is a large expansion hitting the action RPG sometime this Summer, and last December, Capcom promised that news about the expansion would arrive this Spring. It seems that news is coming next week in the form of a 20-minute livestream. 
Revealed on Twitter today, a Monster Hunter Digital Event is happening on March 15 at 6 a.m. PT/8 a.m. CT/9 a.m. ET. While it’s called a “Monster Hunter Digital Event,” which might imply we could see more than just one game in the Monster Hunter franchise, the tweet announcing the stream heavily suggests it’s all about Sunbreak. 
Tune in to the Monster Hunter Digital Event - March 2022 for approximately 20 minutes of programming, including exciting reveals of new monsters, gameplay info, and more! #Sunbreak

As you can see in the tweet above, there’s special emphasis on Monster Hunter Rise’s Sunbreak expansion, due out this Summer, so it’s probably not wise to expect anything else to be announced. However, with 20 minutes devoted to Sunbreak, it sounds like Capcom has a lot to share, like monsters, new gameplay mechanics, and much more.

Fortunately, we don’t have to wait long because the stream goes live next Tuesday. In the meantime, read Game Informer’s Monster Hunter Rise review and then find out why it’s on Game Informer’s list of the top 10 action games to play right now. Check out this story about how Sonic and Tails are (kinda) in Monster Hunter Rise now after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Built by two longtime RTS fans, The Fertile Crescent rekindles the age-old torch of elaborate strategy titles. Its combat and economy chains build on each other, a feat uncommon in the real-time strategy space. Despite taking cues from beloved franchises like WarCraft and Age of Empires, TFC carves out a niche with an unlikely ally: pomegranates. The Fertile Crescent trades the ol’ berry bush for pomegranate trees, a native of Western Asia.


Developers Anders Groenningsaeter and André Read from Wield Interactive looked to the past as they refined The Fertile Crescent’s economy. “Since childhood, André and I have been equally fascinated by RTS games and the Bronze Ages,” Groenningsaeter explained to me. “How we’ve been inspired by history has shaped the game. During the Bronze Ages, the usage of coins hadn’t taken root yet. It was still to a large extent a barter economy, and food played an important role.”

Conan O'Brien, bless him, is a good sport when it comes to gaming.

But that doesn't necessarily mean he's always clued up on certain games, as a recent episode of the 'Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend' podcast has demonstrated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has announced a State of Play presentation for tomorrow, March 9, at 2 p.m. PT/4 p.m. CT/ 5 p.m. ET with a special focus on games from its Japanese publishers. 
This news comes by way of a new blog post released today that says this State of Play will run for roughly 20 minutes. It will highlight games from Japanese publishers, but PlayStation says it will have a few updates from other developers too. Here's the announcement from the PlayStation Blog:
As always, PlayStation will air the State of Play stream on both its YouTube and Twitch channels. As for what to expect, considering Sony is highlighting games from its Japanese publishers, the safest bet seems like PlayStation console-exclusive Final Fantasy XVI, which was first revealed during a Sony showcase like this, or even Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, which will be released on March 15. 
As for the "few updates from other developers located around the world," God of War: Ragnarok seems like a lock considering it's supposed to release this year and we still haven't seen much of it, save for a few trailers. Of course, this is all just speculation. Fortunately, we don't have to wait long because this 20-minute State of Play is just a little over 24 hours away.

Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is Gearbox's next Borderlands adventure. The odd shooter iterates on the same zany cooperative combat loop that the previous trilogy is known for, adding a fantastical touch to the loot pool. And just like the other titles in the franchise, Wonderlands doesn't just end when the credits roll. An endgame dungeon called "Chaos Chamber" was revealed today and looks to keep players inundated in the world even after beating the mainline campaign. You can watch the short trailer below.

Who remembers Interactive Studios' Glover? If you had an N64, you likely snagged a handful of 3D platformers from Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie and its sequel, to Goemon's Great Adventure and Chameleon Twist. There was a glut of them on the system, but not many have been ported to other systems.

As the world watches this historical and terrifying event unfold, efforts have begun to aid civilians and organizations on the ground floor and those displaced, like the Ukrainian Red Cross. Many of these efforts have come from studios within the video game industry, some in the form of charity drives, others with public displays of support for Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not just another entry.
Pokémon's 9th Generation is coming to the Nintendo Switch later this year, and instead of more of the same with only a few minor changes here and there, it's already promising to be a significant jump in the series compared to previous mainline entries.
Nintendo's even boarded the hype train via social media - referring to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet as an "evolutionary" step in the Pokémon series thanks to the "rich open world" filled with towns and cities that seemlessly blend into the wilderness. There are apparently no borders, either.

Ahead of the release of Mario Strikers: Battle League on the Nintendo Switch this June - dataminer, "Mario historian" and Twitter user 'Dogon McBanana' has been sifting through the back end of the original GameCube entry, Super Mario Strikers.
While "digging through the game's files" they've stumbled across an entire team of "generic Mario style humans" and various other unused assets in the final build of the game that they felt was worth sharing with Nintendo fans on social media.

You might recall a story we ran earlier this year about a 1,800-hour Switch OLED burn-in test. It was done by the graphic artist and content creator Bob Wulff over on his YouTube channel the Wulff Den. At the time, there was "no noticeable burn-in".
He's now posted an update over on YouTube, and in this video, he reveals how the system finally has some signs of burn-in. It's happened after about six months and roughly 3,600 hours. Again, that's the Switch running a still screen of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild day in, day out, and it's taken that long for ghosting to appear.

According to Deadline, Amazon is vying to bring God of War to its streaming service as a live-action TV show.
The outlet reports that sources close to the matter have told them Amazon is currently negotiating for the show. Reportedly, the showrunners of Amazon’s hit sci-fi show The Expanse, as well as The Wheel of Time, will helm the series alongside PlayStation Productions. Representatives from both Sony and Amazon Studios declined to comment on Deadline’s story.
There’s no word on what the show itself would entail or whether it’s based on the original Greek mythology series or the current Norse-themed games. Either would make sense given that PlayStation Productions exists to expand Sony’s first-party franchises into broader media, such as the recent Uncharted film and upcoming Ghost of Tsushima movie. 
If true, it wouldn’t be the first video game live-action show on Amazon’s plate. It’s currently developing a Fallout show, recently casting Walton Goggins in an unknown role. Other video game adaptions hitting TV include HBO’s The Last of Us, which premieres next year, and Paramount+ subscribers can look forward to the upcoming Halo series. Paramount also recently announced a Sonic the Hedgehog movie spin-off starring Knuckles.

Anyone who has eyes and a heart and a copy of at least one of the Ace Attorney games will agree that it is a game series full of stone-cold hotties. (Can you be both stone-cold and a hottie?)
From the aloof, dadly suavity of the maroon-suited Edgeworth to the distressing ghost-cleavage of Mia Fey inhabiting other people's bodies, there's something for everyone, and although we definitely play it for the plot, it doesn't hurt to have a few well-dressed fine young lawyers propping up the bench.

Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is due out on April 5, and today, TT Games revealed some of the launch-day DLC that will be available in the game’s Character Collection. 
The Character Collection is essentially the game’s Season Pass, and it will consist of seven DLC packs. The first of those will be packs themed around Season One of The Mandalorian, Solo: A Star Wars Story, the Classic Characters, and the Trooper pack. As you might expect, the first Mandalorian pack will include the Mandalorian, Cara Dune, Greef Karga, IG-11, and Kuill, as …]]></summary>

Fan theories tend to range from the irritating ("My dad's dentist knows a guy at Nintendo who says there's a new F-Zero game but it won't be about racing") to the inoffensively silly ("Luigi is the stronger brother, why does he not simply eat Mario"). Today's rumour is closer to the "inoffensively silly" end of the spectrum, but nevertheless, we feel the need to debunk it all the same. Get ready for the most pedantic rumour-busting you've ever seen!
So: Are Pokémon Scarlet and Violet inspired by a trip that the developers took to the infamously cheeky Afro-Portuguese chicken restaurant (and accidental bastion of British culture), Nando's? Let's find out.

Although WWE 2K22 launches Friday, March 11, review embargo lifted today. However, since we didn’t receive codes until yesterday (Sunday), we need to spend a lot more time in the ring before rendering a complete verdict. Until then, here are some early impressions.
So far, I’ve only played a few singles matches and have started the Showcase mode. Although I haven’t seen every wrestler or entrance, I will say that 2K22 is a good-looking game. As a wrestling fan, it’s hard not to nitpick little things that probably wouldn’t bother a more casual viewer/player (Finn Bálor…]]></summary>

Finally the wait is almost over. The #N64 Era Cult Classic Glover is coming soon! This version of #Glover is a completely redone from the original source code (N64 version of the game), and improved for modern PCs.#remaster #RETROGAMING #Nintendo64 pic.twitter.com/awbq00ALHr
March 7, 2022
With a release date set for April 20 on PC, Piko's port of Glover is said to be "completely redone" using the Nintendo 64 version's source code. Complete with six worlds and 30 total stages, players will puzzle their way through Glover by changing the titular character's form and the properties of magic crystals disguised as rubber balls to navigate and clear each level. 
Originally released in 1998 for Nintendo 64 and PC, with a PlayStation port a year later, Glover was a creation of the Oliver Twins, a duo of prolific British game design brothers who formed the now-defunct Interactive Games. Now, 24 years later, will this new version allow the glove to get the love some think it deserves? We'll know in just over a month.
Are you excited or surprised by the return of Glover? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Are you ready? WWE 2K22 launches Friday and we’ll be stepping into the ring to show off everything it entails on the Game Informer Twitch channel at 2 p.m. Central.
I’m currently reviewing 2K22 and will be playing it on stream while answering your questions. For two hours, I’ll be joined by fellow wrestling enthusiast John Carson as we play some exhibition matches, show off some superstars and entrances, take a peek at Showcase and MyRise, and maybe even create a custom wrestler.

It was a Lands Between where "try jumping" wasn't some evil trickery, and "illusory wall ahead" meant discovering a hidden passage.
Since the game's release, the player messages have taken on a different complexion. Before, I trusted in our small community trying its best to get by. Now I must treat every message with caution as they fight amongst themselves. The world is awash with trolls and their terrible craic, but I'm not sure I'd have it any other way.

There are still a couple of months left in Season 1: Heroes of Reach in Halo Infinite, but creative director Joseph Staten has revealed some of what we can expect in Season 2. 
More specifically, Staten has revealed in a new blog post that Season 2 will be called Lone Wolves. It will launch with its own battle pass, of course, but it will also feature at least one new Big Team Battle map called Breaker and a new Arena map called Catalyst. Both are expected to go live when Season 2: Lone Wolves begins on May 3.

Halo Infinite was released last November after a year-long delay from its original 2020 release date, and it did not launch with highly anticipated features like campaign co-op or Forge. 
With campaign co-op and Forge being staples in Halo games now, the lack of these features at launch last year was disappointing for fans. In February, Halo Infinite creative director Joseph Staten announced that an update regarding these modes due out in January had been delayed and now, we have finally received that update. Sadly, it comes with news that campaign co-op, both online and as a split-scree…]]></summary>

After tackling Metroid in season 1 and then Halo in season 2, Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast turns its gaze to one of Sony's biggest properties: Uncharted. This week we're bidding farewell to Nathan Drake by discussing his final adventure in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.
Released on May 10, 2016, Uncharted 4 was a shake-up for the series in more ways than one. Amy Henning, the franchises' primary creative mind, departed Naughty Dog during the game's development, leaving The Last of Us masterminds Neil Druckmann and Bruce Straley to revamp the game's production. Uncharted 4 introduced players to Nate's long-lost brother Sam Drake (who was originally conceived as a more villainous figure) as well as new mechanics such as a grapple hook and even dialogue choices. How did Naughty Dog tie a bow on this beloved franchise? Tune in to find out. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Game Informer Features Editor Kim Wallace (@kstar1785) as we unpack the history, narrative, and impact of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.

Titled Newfound Adventure, Patch 6.1 will introduce just that: a new adventure to embark on. Or, at least, the beginnings of one. Rolling credits on Endwalker's main scenario closed the book on many ongoing storylines, including the overarching narrative of the Ascians, Primals, the Garlean Empire as we know it, and even more threads.

But when she said she wanted me to do the first one, and that the first GOTY awarded on RPS was 2007's Portal, I almost laughed. Does Portal hold up? Why even bother asking? Shut this whole article down. Of course it holds up. It's Portal.
Of course, conventional bait-and-switch writing would dictate that this is the point where I tell you that, aha, after playing Portal again in the blinding light of 2022 it's actually a heap of rubbish, such as could only otherwise be found on the streets on day ten of a two week bin-lorry strike. But obviously that is not the case, because we're talking about Portal. If anything it's even better than I remember. Like. It's fuckin' Portal.

Gran Turismo 7 is out today and the always-online game’s microtransactions are too. While you’re not required by any means to purchase in-game credits with real money to buy cars in the game, it seems doing so will cost more than it has in previous iterations. 
Video Games Chronicle first reported today that cars that cost roughly $5 in Gran Turismo Sport, the last GT release before today’s, can cost up to eight times more in GT7. That’s obviously not a great look for the newly-released “real driving simulator.” As noted by VGC, microtransactions were not accessible during the review period of t…]]></summary>

A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith.

Blimps is an odd game. At a glance, it looks like an Elite-esque trading game, but it's more like... well. It's more like a game from the time before genres. A confusing, poorly explained time that mostly produced rubbish but occasionally produced a strange little gem like this.


You run a little airship business, on paper. In practice, your job is to figure out how to make enough money to get out. Ideally within an hour.

I'm thinking that Halo 3 "Believe" one that featured a cool diorama, or Gears Of War teaming up with Gary Jules for an emotional rendition of Mad World. We just aren't treated to the same level of grandeur nowadays. A few frames, Guns N' Roses, "RATED M FOR MATURE". That's our lot.
But Thailand clearly puts out good video game adverts. One of note features Elden Ring, a family, a strange trumpet noise, and a story as complex and obtuse as FromSoft's offerings. Give it a watch below, you won't be disappointed. More confused and emotional, perhaps.

I've said before I've never been much of a Soulsite, and it's not for lack of trying. I tried my darnedest to get into Dark Souls III when it first came out, but holy deathrattles, it was such a long, gruelling slog. Vordt of the Boreal Valley, the second (yes, second) boss of Dark Souls III, remains my lifelong nemesis. I just couldn't get past it. I'm someone who always likes to be making forward, tangible progress when I play games, and banging my head against the same boss for hours on end is my idea of actual hell.
I'm no better at playing Elden Ring, to be honest. I spent a good couple of hours last night just trying to get past one of those big tentacle-beard monkey lads with the hollowed out stomachs on the way up to Stormveil Castle. Not even a named, actual sub-boss! And yet, I'm actually enjoying this version of Souls-style head-bashing a lot more than I've ever done before. And I think it's to do with Elden Ring's plentiful supply of save points.

The House of the Dead: Remake was announced last Spring and set to hit Switch sometime in 2021. That obviously didn’t happen and it’s been a minute since we’ve seen or heard anything about the game...until today, because Forever Entertainment has released a new trailer that reveals the remake’s release date. 
Fortunately, those anxious to play this classic won’t have to wait long because the trailer reveals The House of the Dead: Remake will hit Switch on April 7. The new trailer, which showcases some of the classic 1997 arcade gameplay and enemies we’ll be facing, hopefully tides you over until then.

“The House of the Dead: Remake is a remade version of the game introduced in 1997 in arcade platform,” Forever Entertainment’s website for the remake reads. “A classic arcade rail-shooter receives a whole new entourage and gameplay changes to suit modern gaming standards.” 
Here are some of the features you can expect in the game when it hits Switch next month:
Hordes of the undead monstrosities in a fast-paced rail-shooter
True to the original gameplay
Well known arcade classic with modern graphics and controls
Multiple endings
If you need more of the undead now, read about how Resident Evil 2, 3, and 7 are getting new-gen updates on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S this year and then check out Game Informer's Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City interview after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 might be the first GPU to benefit, in a roundabout way, from the bonkers price gouging that’s been spoiling the fun of graphics cards for nearly two years. In normal times, it wouldn’t make much sense to buy this £239 / $249 GPU – not because it’s the lowest in the RTX range, but because the much more powerful RTX 3060 would only cost a few notes more.


And yet, these are not normal times. While the MSI GeForce RTX 3050 Gaming X 8G model I’ve tested has already ballooned to £380 / $450, this leaves it looking like much more of a  genuine alternative to RTX 3060, which is generally around £500 in the UK. And while it’s ultimately still a 1080p specialist, the RTX 3050 takes a big step up from previous GTX XX50 GPUs by offering DLSS and ray tracing support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Babylon's Fall is an online action-RPG developed by PlatinumGames, the devs behind excellent hack n' slashers like NieR Automata and Bayonetta. This is a studio that knows how to craft one-off stories filled with flashy combat, humour, and emotional gut-punches.
But the game is also Platinum's first foray into the dreaded minefield of live service and it's... not good. Aside from the teensiest glimpses of what could've been, the game is a bemusing cascade of loot and stats that don't mean all that much. The combat has its moments but is largely bleh. The story is meh. And it's all yours for £60 - heh?!

If there's no outpouring of questionable illustration following the debut of your single-sentence plot-helper, then you've either failed at fiction or you are deeply blessed. Some breakaway characters begin as a joke, or an afterthought, some as a narrative necessity, or a kind of walking, talking environment art. Others are born as side characters to lighten the story because the main dudes frown too much and Derek from market research says frowns are "cringe". Well, shut up, Derek. You're cringe.

Can’t get enough of Genshin Impact’s open world? Have you tried fishing yet? Anyway, when you’re done working on your in-game house and exploring the huge universe, you can soon augment your play sessions with a new line of Genshin Impact Funko Pops!
The new line comes in three different varieties, including Paimon. That’s right. Emergency food, the Funko Pop. While many players found Paimon exceedingly annoying when the game launched, she’s become a bit more of an endearing character as the game has gone on. Take a look at all that’s on offer below with the new Genshin Impact Funko Pop line.

While we don’t have an exact date for these new arrivals, they’ll make an interesting addition to any Genshin Impact treasure trove.]]></summary>

Many herald The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time as the greatest video game of all time. Whether you were 13 years old or going on 30, the title changed video game design forever. With its vast world, puzzle-laden dungeons, and innovative Z-Targeting lock-on system, the project led to the emergence of the 3D action-adventure genre. Wind Waker and Twilight Princess followed suit, further validating the success of Ocarina's revolutionary format. However, while Ocarina of Time was a defining experience during my childhood, I never considered myself a fan of the ser…]]></summary>

When The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild released alongside the Nintendo Switch in 2017, I was apprehensive to say the least. I enjoyed what I played at E3 2016, and adored the art style, but the myriad ways in which the game took my favorite series and turned it on its head had me worried I'd be left with a shadow of what made me fall in love with it in the first place. Once I finally got the finished game in my hands, it clicked almost immediately for me, and all my fears fell by the wayside.

It's hard to imagine Nintendo released its most recent console, Switch, five years ago today. With it started the handheld hybrid revolution ushered in by one of the greatest games of all time The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and later in the year, Super Mario Odyssey. It's been a hell of a ride so far, and in the half-decade since its release, the Nintendo Switch has gone toe-to-toe with not one, but now two generations of powerhouse consoles from rival brands Xbox and PlayStation, and continues to sell well despite being undeniably a less graphically powerful device.
The Switch has been home to tons of great gaming experiences since becoming available on March 3, 2017. I'd like to know two things from you, dear readers: what is your favorite game …]]></summary>

Season 6 of Sea of Thieves is set to begin on March 10 and Rare Games has released a preview trailer of the new content awaiting pirates in it. 
The big new feature of Season 6 is the inclusion of six Sea Forts on the Sea of Thieves. Described by the team as a new “mini-raid” experience, these Sea Forts can be attacked and plundered at any time by yourself or a full crew. Regardless of who’s sailing with you, Rare says the Sea Forts can be completed, so if you’re a solo player, there’s no need to worry that you won’t be able to loot everything within a Sea Forts’ walls.

As you can see in the trailer above, the forts look much more formidable than the already-existing forts on the Sea of Thieves. Forts are meant to bring players together, whereas Rare says Sea Forts are meant to provide a personalized challenge to players. 
Another new feature in Season 6 is the addition of more Pirate Legend Voyages. These are replayable legends that will task you with uncovering treasure by way of new maps, plundering ship graveyards, and more. On top of all this, Rare has released a 2022 timeline that details what to expect in not just Season 6, but Season 7, 8, and 9, which will take players through all of 2022. 
For more about Sea of Thieves, read about Shrouded Islands, the game’s first adventure released last month, and then check out this story about how Sea of Thieves’ PvP arena is set to shut down this month.

11 Bit Studios, the Poland-based developer behind This War of Mine and Frostpunk, has revealed that it has donated 3m PLN (roughly $695,000) to Ukrainian aid efforts amidst Russia's ongoing invasion of the country.

Update, 3/3/22:
Just two weeks after the release of Season 1 on Netflix, The Cuphead Show has been renewed for a second season. The official Netflix Geeked account announced the renewal, with a new image (presumably from Season 2). What's more, is that it will hit Netflix this Summer. As for what to expect, that's anybody's guess but it will likely continue the ongoing narrative that began in Season 1.

After several years of waiting and a few demos and beta tests, Babylon’s Fall launches today. While pre-release reception has been mixed, we’re taking the game through its paces on Twitch this afternoon at 2 p.m. Central to see how the final product stacks up. 
Babylon’s Fall puts you and your friends in the role of Sentinals, warriors armed with up to four weapons to ascend a massive tower called the Ziggurat in an effort to cure a deadly disease. Each floor of this towering structure overflows with deadly enemies and other hazards, making it an uphill battle in every sense of the term.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Dan Tack, as I show off the combat, progression, and painterly world of Babylon’s Fall. We’ll face off against fearsome knights, strange goblin-esque critters, and maybe even an oversized boss. Regardless of what we encounter, it’ll be a blast to have you, our lovely readers, along for the ride with the rest of the GI community in our Twitch chat.

Housemarque is a modern-day arcade powerhouse. Games like Resogun and Nex Machina were homages to zany, psychedelic shoot 'em ups. Returnal, in its own impressive way, builds upon the developer's lineage by offering similar visuals and mechanics wrapped in a 3D, Triple-A skin. Despite the massive success of the sci-fi roguelike – Housemarque was acquired by Sony, after all – the studio is smartly broadening its horizons again. Housemarque is developing a new game, but it won't be Returnal 2. 
In an award show interview with Venturebeat and an array of other outlets, narrative director Gregory Louden, game director Henry Krueger, and managing director Ilari Kuittinen were asked about the future of Housemarque (among other topics), "...In a time where games are changing, the people playing them are changing, how do you hold on to [your] identity?"
Recently, Sony's pivoted towards a live service methodology, a multiplayer-centric style that Housemarque likely won't employ. That's because the team's already tried it, to middling results:
"We had our stint working on multiplayer games, because a few years back it seemed like you needed to have some kind of multiplayer experience. We tried that, and we really didn't do it as well. But it's early days with us starting a new game, a new IP, concepting it out. We'll see what comes with that."
What exactly this new IP is remains to be seen, but Kuittinen also briefly mentioned that Nex Machina, "a shoot-'em-up game in the style of the coin-ops from the 80s," might be a clue. It's safe to assume that Housemarque might be working on another large-scope game like Returnal, and it'll be interesting to see how the developer finds ways to mix its arcade roots with a modern, new-gen veneer. 
For more on Returnal, read our review.

The train really gets derailed early as we start talking about Elden Ring, and thus, naturally, what bit of Matthew a king would steal for said king's own body? (The answer is Matthew's nice soft hair). We hear more about Nate's orc/goblin dolls house too, of course, and at certain points in the podcast do manage to drag things back round to talking about the actual topic of the podcast. Plus, Nate has a Cavern Of Lies this week which is themed about, er, Nate.

GSC Game World, which voiced its support for its home country of Ukraine last week, has put the development of its upcoming shooter, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl, on the “sidelines” amidst the ongoing conflict happening in Ukraine. 
After weeks of mounting tensions, Russia invaded Ukraine, leading to the deaths of hundreds of Ukrainian civilians. GSC Game World, 11 Bit Studios, Bungie, and many other studios have voiced their support for Ukraine. GSC Game World, based in Ukraine, revealed in a new video that Stalker 2 was sidelined to focus on employee safety and support.

Here’s everything said in the video: 
It’s unclear if this means Stalker 2, which was delayed to December earlier this year, will be released even later. Although, to be honest, a video game delay does not matter in the slightest with everything happening in  Ukraine. Here’s hoping everyone at GSC Game World remains safe.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ziggurat is an imposing presence in the lakeside hub town of Babylon’s Fall, its broad, horizon-spanning arches giving away nothing about the kind of fantastical beasts and secrets you’ll find inside. Based on the Tower Of Babel, the mythological birthplace of all the world’s languages, it’s perhaps ironic that Square Enix and PlatinumGames’ latest hack and slash started life with its own kind of miscommunication. When it was first unveiled at E3 2018, it looked like PlatinumGames were doubling down on all the good stuff they’d delivered just a year earlier with Nier: Automata, giving us another high-octane, single player action game with a dizzying array of weapons and over the top soundtrack, all wrapped up in an enticing layer of gothic high fantasy as players fight their way skyward. 
A long silence then followed, release dates slipped again and again, and its single follow-up trailer during one of Sony's 2019 State Of Play broadcasts remained as inscrutable as its iconic Ziggurat. It wasn’t until E3 2021 that the game’s true nature was finally revealed. Rather than being a solo adventure, Platinum and Square declared that not only would Babylon’s Fall be a primarily online multiplayer game, but that it was also going to be a live service game in the vein of Destiny and The Division. It was surprising, to say the least, but when I put the question to the PlatinumGames and Square Enix’s joint development team, Square Enix producer Junichi Ehara tells me that this was far from a sudden change of heart on their part: “From the very start of the project, it was decided that Babylon’s Fall would include the elements of high fantasy, hack-and-slash, and live service.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some things are synonymous with Soulsborne games. Approachability, which Alice Bee thinks is a very relative term. Nail-biting combat, intricate worlds, a story that's drip-fed through it all. But it's the littlest bits that round off their identity. The dong of their menu sounds (I love a good menu noise) and their elevators operated by pressure plates.
There's also one other big thing that Soulsborne games deliver on. As any seasoned player knows, it's not a FromSoft game without the laughs. While there's plenty of humour in the cliff falls and silly invasions, I'm talking in a more literal sense. The NPCs often round off their sentences with a chuckle. But so far, Elden Ring lacks the despairing "hahaha" of old. And it makes me sad.

At this point I’d already been testing it for a while, and as you can now tell from my Steam Deck review, was already sold on both the promise and (mostly) the execution of this plastic go-anywhere gaming machine. Now, it was time to find out more about how it came to be, what new tricks we can expect in the future, and what work is already going to on ensure compatibility with as many Steam games as possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm replaying the first Portal at the moment, so maybe I'm just extra-susceptible to the Valve man coming around selling tickets for his hype-train, but playing Aperture Desk Job was like sitting in a nice warm bath. It's a "playable short" - basically a 30-minute tech demo designed for the Steam Deck, to show off how to use all the little flaps and controller bits on Valve's new handheld PCxGameboy toy (like the Aperture Hand Lab for VR from a few years back). Crucially, though, Aperture Desk Job is: a) free; 2) playable on a regular PC; and iii) set in the Portal universe.
In fact, it has surprisingly large implications for said game series (no spoilers in this post, btw). And it just reminds me how good Valve are at, you know, making games. Please, Valve, make more games.

As if Elden Ring wasn't enough game to be getting on with, we also had strategy behemoth Total War: Warhammer 3 alongside surprise hit Lost Ark. You could argue that after a month as busy as February, we could all do with a bit of space to actually play these enormous games before we throw anything else onto our already bursting backlogs.
Sadly, I come bearing terrible news. March is yet another jam-packed month for new releases, with huge titles such as GhostWire: Tokyo and Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands threatening to tear our attention away from the wonderful Elden Ring. And that’s before I tell you about promising indie releases like Tunic and Weird West!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve haven’t changed their collective minds on DIY Steam Deck upgrades and repairs; although the portable PC is finally on its way to the earliest reservers, it’s still the company’s stance that you shouldn’t open it up and make hardware changes yourself. That’s according to Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who spoke to us at length on the making of the Deck and its future prospects.


Valve have previously made the peculiar move of showing exactly how to open a Steam Deck and remove individual parts, complete with video, while simultaneously declaring it something owners should refrain from. On pain of borking components, personal injury, and even death, apparently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FixFox is a delighful name to say. I keep calling it Fikfok, once by mistake and then the rest of the time on purpose. You are Vix (vikfikfok), an fox wot fixes things in a distant future, where humans started to gene-splice themselves with animals for the convenience of having, for example, lovely warm fur. This is a step I would 100% take; even as I write this in the office I am wrapped in a blanket I brought in from home, and my fingers are still cold. I would be less able to repair things using bits of tape and coins I found in holes in the ground, but then I am not a mechanic.
Vix is a mechanic, although they are laughed at by their compatriots for being quite a bad one. They have a sentient tool box called Tin, but misadventure means all Vix's conventional tools are lost. In the course of a pretty meaty preview build I got to explore a strange, cuboid planet, top-down stylee, and repair things for a buncha robots. But there are loads of other aspects to FixFox - a preoccupation with food, a kind of space-sokoban game, a story that hints at mystery and evolution and time. Part puzzle game, part sci-fi adventure, part fok.

However, if you’re lucky enough to get a Steam Deck in the first round of order fulfilments, you could see improvements that have yet to materialise on Windows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks. I'm sorry this month's Letter From The Editor is a bit late. February sure has been one of those months, what with two of the biggest games of the year so far, not to mention a whole new piece of hardware launching in the space of two measly weeks. If I'd had my act together, I could have used this letter to give you a glimpse of all the exciting things we've just done - things like our freshly-concluded Souls Week, or all the neat Steam Next Fest bits we had planned, and (maybe) even a sneaky peek at all the excellent Steam Deck stuff we've written about as well. Alas, my time management skills have been a bit of a dumpster fire this month - although if you haven't checked out everything I've just mentioned, please do go and have a read. The RPS team have been very busy bees this month, and it would be a shame to miss out on all the great stuff going on.  
Of course, the question now becomes, how do we carry on this kind of momentum when literally nothing has a confirmed release date past the end of March? The answer is... complicated.

I haven't played nearly as much Elden Ring as Ed or our guides team, but I do feel this statement, while not an exact a lie, definitely needs a lot more qualification than people are giving it. 
In relative terms, one would say that a bowl of hot sick was more enjoyable than eating a bowl of cold sick, for example. Elden Ring is, of course, much better than sick at any temperature, obviously - I'm just saying that so far, I have not found it to be much easier or less opaque than any other FromSoft game, except it has clearer tooltips and sometimes an NPC will say, "You should do this thing." In fact, the open world - the thing that people say is the most good bit - is having the opposite effect on me.

Tentacled masses that writhe on shores, goblins that'll hack at your knees, corrupted priests that sling fireballs. They are mysterious, to a degree, but they're also quite easy to read.

But what makes the game great is its capacity for surprise, the deep well of lore – the gaps left for us to fill. The goats. What's up with them, huh? Can anyone tell me what's up with the goats in Elden Ring?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a few minutes out of Elex 2’s, pleasantly brief, tutorial area I came across a radio. The broadcast was announcing a concert at the nearby amphitheatre. A Billy Idol concert. Yeah, you read that right. I immediately made a beeline for the concert venue and was treated to a rather unflattering rendering of Billy Idol and his guitar-playing chum performing a song. (Whiskey & Pills from his 2014 album, rather than anything you’re likely to have heard.) After the cutscene, you’re left in the empty amphitheatre, alone apart from a couple of guys talking about how great the concert was.


There is no context for this cameo. Billiam doesn’t feature as an NPC. In the 40-ish hours I spent playing the game, I had no reason to return to the amphitheatre. It makes no sense whatsoever and the only explanation I can come up with is that someone involved in the game really likes Billy Idol and just wanted him in their game. It’s the sort of random that I can respect, and I only wish the game had more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Picture the scene: you are at the beach. It is a real-time strategy beach, where metaphors happen. A lawless-looking child hands you a bucket. When you look into the bucket, you find sand, paint, bread, pottery, chocolate, nails, and several crabs all speaking different languages. Isn't this fascinating? What the hell is going on? This is Hero's Hour, an untidy RTS sand bucket filled with so many ideas it's hard to see how this turbulent mix will have any structural integrity at all when you finally up-end the bucket to build a tower. And yet… it sorta does? I don't know. I'm lost. How do I get off this beach?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That up there is Ivan Ivanovitch. He's somewhere between Walter Mitty and Scheherazade. A man who invents successive tales of fantasy in an effort to stay his likely execution by an impatient general interrogating him in a dark room. Ivan is the little guy in every sense, small in stature, a hunching underdog to forces beyond his control. As the likeable hero of Little Orpheus, a vibrant modernising of the cinematic platformer, he builds a rapport with the general that carries the game as best it can through eight beautiful but ultimately formulaic levels. This is a light game, unchallenging by design, and for me, sleepily so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shadow Warrior 3 continues the series tradition of completely rebooting the style of each game. This time it’s going for a more linear arena shooter style, similar to 2013's Shadow Warrior, and it’s got generally the right idea. You play as the former freelance mercenary Lo Wang, and mainly just try to get from A to B. This means jumping through hand-crafted levels, and generally shooting and slicing your way through the various demonic mobs and mini-bosses that spawn in front of you. Whenever you’re not clearing out enemies in an arena setting, you’ll be parkouring between them, or using your skills to navigate some setpieces. That's basically it, that's the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an owner of two cats who regularly bring home all manner of half-eaten wildlife from the neighbouring bins, hedgerows and overgrown student gardens, I often wonder how these adorable murderers are perceived by the local mice and rat population. If it's anything like ginger puss cat Tiger in Jeremy "Aviary Attorney" Noghani's turn-based RPG Small Saga, they're going to be in trouble, as these rodents come bearing switchblades and cigarette lighters to fend off their deadly foes. It's an intriguing take on the classic Final Fantasy-like job types of other RPGs - the switchblade is to protagonist Verm what Cloud's Buster Sword is to a regular human, while Siobhan's lighter allows her to cast fire 'magic' as the party's mage - and based on its hour-long Steam Next Fest demo, it's shaping up to be just as grand a tale as its lauded genre mates.

Piracy numbers are relatively modest but in the Netherlands, there was a significant spike in unauthorized downloads earlier this year after the series left Netflix.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moody new adventure game Who's Lila? has an interesting alternative to selecting dialogue options: pulling faces. And you really have to pull the face. Drag your fella's facial features around to form expressions, and that emotion will be the foundation of his behaviour in conversation. It's an interesting challenge on a timer, and the intentional performance of emotion feels perfectly sinister when maybe we know a little too much about a missing person. Who's Lila? does have a demo, so you can pull some faces yourself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last Friday I asked you, our loyal readers, if you had any burning questions about the Steam Deck. The aim was to answer as many as possible in time for the system’s official launch, which is today! After scouring through your questions and posing them to hardware editor James - who's been putting the system through its paces for a week or so now - we've created a mammoth 19 minute long video that's bursting at the seams with new information about Valve's first handheld PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the course of my Steam Deck review testing, the majority of games I tried ran without issue. Some didn’t get on with SteamOS’s Proton compatibility software, and others needed a bit more work on the ol’ anti-cheat, but I wouldn’t be surprised if most Steam games end up rated as Verified or Playable in Valve’s compatibility review programme.
What, then, are some of the very best games to play on the Steam Deck? Personally I’ve most enjoyed the ones designed with thumbstick controls in mind (like Horizon Zero Dawn and Death’s Door) but since I was interviewing Gabe Newell and members of the Deck dev team in the run-up to the Steam Deck's launch today, I took the chance to ask them if they had any suggestions. Here's what they've been playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Ubisoft to Konami to the Epic Games Store, games companies are doubling down on NFTs as fast as others are backtracking on them. Valve, on the other hand, aren’t likely to get involved any time soon, owing to “a lot of criminal activity and a lot of sketchy behaviours”. That’s according to co-founder Gabe Newell, who recently spoke to us about his concerns around crypto.


While indie game store Itch.io declared NFTs a scam, Newell is more open to the “underlying technology of distributed ledgers” – but says there are just too many bad actors using that technology for nefarious endeavours, namely fraud and money laundering. Steam banned games with NFTs and cryptocurrency last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Praise and curse the Steam Deck, for it has stolen 20 years of my life. A few minutes into playing on this – the first serious attempt at a handheld PC from a major gaming entity - and I am once more a child, alternating between sinking into the sofa to redirect energy into my thumbs and wanting desperately to rush round my friends’ houses to show them the cool new thing. 


Not that the Steam Deck is a nostalgia exercise, given it’s built to run the very latest AAA games as much as it is indies and retros. And it certainly isn’t twee: from its no-nonsense, all-black design to the performance-tweaking options in its OS, the Deck is a serious device, even and especially when it’s serious about giving you a good time. That’s in spite of some imperfections, to be sure – the software, screen and battery life may disappoint anyone expecting another top-end Valve hardware masterclass to follow their Index virtual reality headset. But the Steam Deck is more accessible, more affordable, and far more useful to have on a train.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The consolidation of the games industry – that is, games companies being bought up and absorbed by bigger games companies – has been increasing, intensifying, and giving poor Ed the aches. Exhibited most dramatically by Microsoft stumping up $69 billion for Activision Blizzard, this trend towards conglomerification has raised worries about both creative expression and the potential locking-down of more games to certain platforms.
Valve president and co-founder Gabe Newell is no stranger to making some additions. Valve famously hired the student developers of Narbacular Drop to work on what eventually became Portal, and acquired Firewatch developers Campo Santo in 2018. In our recent interview, I asked him whether he thought consolidation could be a problem for the industry going forwards.

What followed did indeed start with a look at Valve’s portable PC, including the lessons learned from the company’s past hardware attempts, but it soon swerved into a wider-ranging discussion on cryptocurrency, NFTs, consolidation issues affecting the games industry and whether there might be whole new Steam Decks in the future.

Blood West isn't the same as Hunt, but they're definitely related. It also wears its love of Blood on its sleeve. It also also carries Thief DNA, and even takes some notes from Dark Souls, a game I dislike because it's bad and everyone is just wrong. Most remarkably though, Blood West feels almost entirely itself, rather than just an assembly of other things. It's really damn good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing the Steam Next Fest demo of The Wandering Village, a city-builder that has you rustle up a community on the back of a roaming beast. It's called Onbu and it couldn't give a monkey's that you're on its back just trying to get by. At first, that is. Eventually you're able to strike up a bit of a relationship with the big lizard and build a sort of symbiotic relationship. Onbu stays on track, Onbu gets a treat. Good Onbu.
I'm not usually one for strategy games where you've got to manage rocks and wood and allocate workers. Some of that comes down to their many systems frying my little brain, but Onbu has me persevering. Why? Because the resources I'm harvesting and community I'm building help or hinder Onbu. My enemy isn't some army a mile away, it's Onbu.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Harriers are rare among the bird family, in that they’re one of the very few birds to have been overtaken in popularity by their namesake fighter jet*. Mention a harrier anywhere outside of an ornithology summit and people will assume you’re talking about the hovering aeroplane rather than the diurnal hawk. Tell somebody your harrier is hungry and they’re as likely to chuck a vole into a turbine as they are to feed it into your pet bird’s gullet. 


So it’s unsurprising that Tiny Combat Arena is about Harriers of the cold and featherless kind. The one-person dev team behind the air-to-air combat simulator is apparently in love with the floaty-shooty jumping jet, so much so that it’s the only type of plane available to fly in the game's early access release. The retro-styled sim lets you pore over the low-poly plane as it rests in the hangar, to rest your chin in your hands as you lovingly scroll through its various specifications, inspecting its payload like you’re checking a dog over for ticks.
