Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition is now officially available on the Switch, and retro enthusiasts who picked up the game are now discovering all sorts of cool (and not-so-cool) things about this game.
In case you missed it, one thing that is pretty cool about this game is when you set up your profile, you're asked to select your "favourite NES game" (or Famicom one) from a list that appears to feature every game under the sun from this classic Nintendo library.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skeleton Crew, the team behind the 2021 side-scrolling action game Olija, and Devolver Digital have revealed an intriguing new project: Forestrike. The game sports a unique premise: as a martial artist, you can foresee and simulate future combat encounters, allowing you to perfect your execution before laying a finger on anyone. 
The fighter battles to free a captive Emperor from an evil Admiral, and doing so involves mastering Foresight, a meditative technique to mentally predict and play out battles before they unfold (for Dragon Ball fans, think of image training). Gameplay-wise, players are pitted against different combinations of enemy types. They use Foresight to play the battle in advance to find the optimal approach to defeating them while taking little to no damage.
For example, using Foresight may help you learn to dodge a charging enemy so they trample an ally, then finish him off by lobbing a nearby weapon. Determining the best approach may take several Foresight attempts, but once you have your strategy down, you then execute the battle in real-time. After winning a fight, a replay feature allows you to rewatch it using slow-motion and other editing tools to study your strategy or generally feel cool about your performance. 


Using the Foresight makes Forestrike's combat feel puzzle-like in its execution, and winning fights as flawlessly as possible matters. That’s because you have limited health to fight through multiple stages in a roguelike-style branching map. Along the way, you’ll earn upgrades that carry over to future runs, as well as perks called Techniques that enhance your abilities. 
Forestrike is a neat spin on the action genre, and it's slated to launch sometime in 2025 for Switch and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Blizzard introduced Juno, the next Support Hero joining the ranks of Overwatch 2 — and you can see what she's about sooner than you think. Juno will be playable this weekend, so you can check out her abilities before she arrives in August.


As a Support Hero, Juno can dish out pain and heal it in equal amount. A Martian, she zips around the arena with anti-gravity skates like Shadow the Hedgehog and wields just as mean of a gun. Taking a page from Ana's book, it appears Juno's weapon—the Mediblaster—can heal allies and also damage enemies. She's not a sniper, though; it's a burst weapon that looks more akin to an SMG.




Overwatch 2's next support hero is playable this weekend


You'll be able to try out Juno, who becomes available as part of a limited-time hero trial beginning July 19 and ending July 21. It'll be your best shot until she joins the game's roster when Season 12 starts on August 20. 


As you can gather from her trailer, Juno is all about speed and vertical momentum. She can leap into the air with a Glide Boost ability that lets her float. It also seems like she can use it to deliver a nasty kick that likely violates the Hippocratic Oath. Her Hyper Ring creates a field that gives her and her allies a speed boost when entered. If it stacks with Lucio's speed boost, we're probably looking at a new rush strategy.

There are some damaging moves mixed in. Her Pulsar Torpedoes lock onto both allies and enemies alike, delivering healing or damage. Her Ultimate move seems to be the Orbital Ray, which fires a massive beam that slowly sweeps the field boosting ally damage and healing.

Where is Lord Zir in Diablo 4?


You can find Lord Zir by heading over to The Darkened Way in the Fractured Peaks area. The closest Waypoint will be in Yelesna, just south of this dungeon. Make sure it’s unlocked because it is one of the areas that you have to re-discover every season.


From here, make your way through the dungeon until you get to the center of the area called the Ancient’s Seat.

What is Zenless Zone Zero Hollow Exploration?


You'll typically enter ZZZ's Hollow Exploration mode when starting a Story, Exploration, or Combat mission. Players must move their Bangboo across monitors to reach specific spots in the dimension. Some events trigger boss fights, but there are a few helpful blocks, like Observation Data and Supply Boxes. These materials will provide you with rewards, which can be helpful for Agent upgrades.

In an official community update, EA Sports has announced several major changes coming to EA FC 25 across different game modes. Division Rivals will continue to be one of the most competitive modes in Ultimate Team. However, the way you progress will change, especially in the higher divisions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember when Epic Games chose to remove the infamous Nitro Fists from Ranked in Fortnite? Well, it has been 13 days and Nitro Fists are still obtainable in the Ranked mode. 


Epic Games announced on June 5, 2024, that Nitro Fists and vehicles will not be available in Zero Build's Ranked mode. While vehicles have been removed from Ranked, Nitro Fists persist. Somehow, the fists are eluding Epic Games, who have been working on a way to figure out the issue and come up with the necessary fix.




It has taken an unusual number of days for Epic Games to deal with the matter, and it is particularly surprising as the removal should ideally not be a complicated matter. Fortnite constantly rotates its pool of available items, with many weapons and consumable items making it to the vault and subsequently making a return after some time.


With Nitro Fists however, Epic Games is still looking into the matter, and shared an update on July 16 that the team is “aware of this issue” and thanked fans for their patience while the Fortnite team continues to look into the matter.




This is particularly interesting when you look back at the initial announcement that stated that this separation of Nitro Fists and vehicles was supposed to last until July 18, 2024. Well, it is July 18 at the time of writing, so it seems like Fortnite players have been running into Nitro Fists all throughout this specified period in Ranked mode.


Epic Games could extend the duration of this removal once the matter is finally resolved, and the same might apply to vehicles as well. If that does pan out. We'll have to wait and see what Epic announces next.

        <updated>2024-07-18T20:09:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, Streets of Rogue 2 set its Early Access date for August 14, but those plans have since changed. The sandbox roguelite sequel is now set to hit Early Access for all starting on October 22.


The reason for the delay is pretty straightforward: according to developer Matt Dabrowski and tinyBuild, Streets of Rogue 2 simply needs more time for additional polish. The announcement states that the team is "committed to providing the best experience possible," even in this early stage, so we'll just have to wait a little longer to try it for ourselves. 


Part of that polish process involves putting the game through more thorough testing. As Dabrowski says of the new release date, "it will also give me time to conduct a large-scale pre-release playtest." His previous experience on the first Streets of Rogue taught him that this would be "very beneficial to development."


Procedural mayhem


Screenshot via tinyBuild


The first game already had some pretty impressive scope to it, and it sounds like the sequel is going all out in that regard. Dabrowski previously touched upon how "stupidly ambitious" Streets of Rogue 2 is, ramping the procedurally-generated chaos up to absurd heights. 


There are plenty of hand-crafted aspects in the mix, too, and that complex blend could likely benefit from the additional attention this delay affords. With dozens of character classes and an open world that is purportedly over 10,000 times the size of one of the levels from the first game, it'll be interesting to see how it all comes together. In the meantime, anyone can take part in the aforementioned playtest, which will kick off in "late August or early September." You can sign up right here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Roblox’s Slap Battles, the Druid Glove doesn’t have anything to do with actual Druidry. Instead, it’s more related to botany, as the special glove gives you the power to wrap the victims of your palms in vines. That’ll hold ‘em. For five seconds. As long as they aren’t wearing Speedrun gloves.


To get the Druid Glove, you need to get the Gardens and Ghouls badge, which requires the Alchemist Glove. To get the Alchemist Glove, you need to the Containment Breach badge, which you can get by defeating 10 players with either the Plague Glove or Zombie Glove, but now we’re getting out of scope.


How to get the Gardens and Ghouls badge in Slap Battles


As mentioned, the Garden and Ghouls badge requires the Alchemy Glove, which has the ability to summon a cauldron and mix ingredients.


When you wear the Alchemy Glove, you’ll be able to see ingredients scattered around the map. Start scooping them up. Specifically, you’re going to need:



Wild Vines x3


Blood Rose x1


Dark Root x1


Elder Wood x1


Jade Stone x1



Once you have these ingredients, summon your cauldron and drop them in by clicking the item in your list and then clicking on the cauldron in the exact order above. Then, click on the ladle to stir the potion and drink the resulting concoction.


You’ll be transported to “Unknown World,” where you’ll play a tower defense game. Your goal here is to make it through 8 waves by preventing enemies from reaching the end of the path. To do this, you place and upgrade defensive towers.


Once Wave 8 is defeated, you’ll get the Gardens and Ghouls badge and the Druid Glove.


The Druid Glove gives you the ability to send out a wave of vines. If an enemy is hit by them, they’ll be held in place for five seconds. If they’re under an effect that increases their speed (like the Speedrun Glove), then they’ll still be able to move, albeit slower.

Alongside Dragon Ball’s protagonist, a couple of Stranger Things characters seem set to get their Lego skins too. Demogorgon from Stranger Things and Eleven will also reportedly get their own LEGO figure styles too.




The DJ Bop legendary skin from Fortnite is also said to be arriving in the LEGO game. Even though the grey-coloured prototype does not paint an accurate picture of how the skins will eventually pan out, one can expect the fearful Demogorgon to look rather cute, given it is a LEGO game after all.


Several other leaks have been spotted and shared around, so it seems like there's a solid lineup of new figures coming for LEGO Fortnite fans. No official confirmation has hit yet, but we'll keep an eye out for more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are you tired of invisible walls in games? The kind of walls that you don't see, but that are there just to prevent you from venturing into areas that the developers don't want you to reach? Well, then let me introduce you to their evil-er brother: Elden Ring's visible non-wall. It's a wall that seems to be there, but is only just a bunch of hollow textures that might lead you to your death.


Hardcore fans of the series will probably be delighted to learn that Elden Ring's Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC features even more ways to die, but regular players might not be as enthused by the idea.




As warned by Redditor u/Kedalene, the Scorpion River Catacombs introduced in Shadow Of The Erdtree feature a hilariously terrifying threat. It's not a devious trap that will lure in even the wisest of players, but a bug that causes a specific wall to feature no collision. This is not an illusory wall meant to hide a shortcut or great treasure, but a part of the map that, once crossed, will have players dropping out of bounds to their deaths. It's so accidentally devious that it causes you to die outside of the Stake of Marika's range, forcing players to go back to the entrance of the catacombs.


Kedelane made the video above to warn players of the existence of the glitch, but also to show off all the fun they have had with making poor unassuming players die to it. I advise everyone to watch the compilation because it's pretty funny, but also because otherwise you might be next.


I'm writing this to warn players about this ghastly trap, but please know that I do so while extremely worried that Miyazaki will look into this and decide to come up with a dungeon that's all ghost walls.


This glitch might get fixed soon, but you can still die to it right now, or have people fall for it. Beware of strange etchings in front of walls, I guess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Splitgate 2 is teleporting players back into the series' free-to-play shooter action. Developer 1047 Games announced a sequel to its original game, and the studio has brought on talent from the teams of Call of Duty, Overwatch, Halo, and more to help make it.


1047 Games is calling the game "bigger and better than ever," with a large selection of arenas, weapons, and modes on offer. There will also be three factions to choose from "based on your preferred gameplay style and competitive strategies," according to the press release. Splitgate 2 will also be running on Unreal Engine 5, marking a visual upgrade from the 2019 predecessor. 




To coincide with the Splitgate 2 announcement, there's an official Companion app. Once you boot it up, you can get collectibles that offer in-game rewards when the sequel launches. There are also quizzes to complete and a comic series to read through. The first issue is out today, and the next four parts will be released every month. They focus on the backstories of those heroes featured in this week's trailer.


"This is a revolutionary step forward for competitive shooters," said co-founder and CEO of 1047 Games in the press release. "It's the perfect entry point for players new to the world of Splitgate and a comprehensive upgrade worthy of our existing community."


Since launching Splitgate, 1047 Games has grown into a large team of over 150 developers, who have experience with other multiplayer titles like the Halo series, Valorant, and League of Legends. Hopefully, that knowledge will prove fruitful for this upcoming shooter, as the team is currently targeting next year for launch. 


Regardless, you should check out the original if you haven't already; it's one of the best free-to-play games on Steam right now.

Vessel of Hatred ushers in a wave of change for Diablo IV. The game's first expansion takes players to the new jungle region of Nahantu and, most importantly, introduces the new Spiritborn class. I visited the Blizzard campus to go hands-on with the Spiritborn and speak to some of the designers about how it created a class unlike any other in the Diablo series. After spending a couple of hours playing, the Spiritborn may already be my new favorite class in the game. 
Unlike other Diablo classes, the Spiritborn is not based o…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apex Legends is set to introduce 12v12 deathmatch mode, thanks to the upcoming Void Reckoning Event. The event will also include several new Legend and weapon skins to grab, including legendary Newcastle skin. Void Reckoning Event will start on July 23, 2024.


This 12v12 deathmatch mode will be available in the Mixtape playlist. Apex Legends players will receive “improved” health regeneration, and the first team to hit 60 kills will win the match. There will be a total of 5 maps rotating for this LTM mode.




Playing in both battle royale mode and this deathmatch mode will allow players to earn Void points, which can be used to unlock items from the event reward shop. The rewards in the Apex Legends shop will change weekly. There’s a set number of Void points that can be earned in a day by completing daily challenges.


In total, there are 22 knight-themed cosmetics for Wraith, Mirage, Octane, Ash, Caustic, and more, including a reactive Havoc weapon skin. Unlocking all rewards will also unlock the legendary “Galatic Garrison” Newcastle skin, which arrives as the final milestone reward. The milestone rewards unlock at different stages of the event, meaning you receive a milestone reward after obtaining 5, 7, and 17 items.

Players can unlock all 22 items via event-themed packs as well, which can be bought from the item shop. Players in Apex Legends can also directly buy Legend skins for Wraith, Caustic, and more from the shop as well.


If you somehow miss out on some rewards, the milestone rewards can be bought from the store for a limited time once the Void Reckoning event ends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tinybuild and Matt Dabrowski have announced that Streets of Rogue 2, the anticipated sequel to the hectic sandbox game, is having its Early Access debut pushed back to October 22, 2024. It was originally planned to be released on August 14.


The press release states that Streets of Rogue 2 will take “additional time to sharpen its tools of destruction.” It doesn’t get any more specific with its details. In fact, when I initially read the PR, it sounded like it was excitedly announcing the launch date, and I had to re-read it to realize that it had an apologetic tone.




The original Streets of Rogue came out in 2019, and it currently enjoys a 96% “overwhelmingly positive” user review score on Steam. The game’s title should have been workshopped, and I had it confused for a different game for years before realizing that the two aren’t the same and that I should probably play Streets of Rogue. Then I set it aside because I’m a busy person and didn’t get into it for the first time until just now when I needed additional context.


The first game is sort of like a progression of miniature immersive sims, where you’re dropped on a randomly generated floor and have to complete objectives using only the skills on hand and items that can be found in the environment.


Streets of Rogue 2 is taking this to a more open world. There’s farming for some reason. The open world is apparently 10,000 times larger than a level in the first game. It promises “uncompromised” freedom. It looks like how I would imagine a Saint’s Row game would be if it went 2D.


Streets of Rogue 2 is now targeting October 22, 2024 for release on Steam Early Access.

As you'll discover early on, though, a lot of the recipes you can cook require an oven.


Magical Delicacy throws you in at the deep end with a kitchen you can customize with a handful of tools and a few deliveries to make. All you'll have to work with at the start is a Pot, though you can add a Cutting Board and Mortar and Pestle pretty quickly. Each tool allows you to make even more recipes, but the one you'll keep seeing as a requirement is the oven, which requires you to complete a few tasks first.

Earlier, EA Sports made an error when the special card was added to the game's database, but the SBC wasn't released. Now, all players have equal chance to get this item ahead of the Futties promo. Let's take a look at all the tasks to complete so you can get the Nathan Ake SBC for your team. 


EA FC 24 Nathan Ake Team of the Tournament SBC tasks


There are two tasks, and both have separate conditions that have to be satisfied during squad submission. 


Task 1 - Netherlands



Min. 1 Player from: Netherlands


Min. Team Rating: 85



Task 2 - Manchester City



Min. 1 Player from: Manchester City


Min. Team Rating: 86



Completing this SBC is pretty easy, and you won't require any TOTS or TOTW item either. 


EA FC 24 Nathan Ake Team of the Tournament SBC cheapest solutions


The Nathan Ake Team of the Tournament SBC can be completed for about 105,000 coins in EA FC 24. With the Futties promo coming soon, it's best to complete the challenge using the cheapest possible solutions. 


Task 1 - Netherlands



Dani Parejo 86


Cristiana Girelli 86


Bella Bixby 84


Nacho Fernandez 83


Merle Frohms 85


Memphis Depay 84


Dabritz 84


Alex Grimaldo 84


Koen Casteels 84

Romelu Lukaku 84



Task 2 - Manchester City

Thomas Muller 84


Luka Modric 87

The 95-rated card can play as a LB and CB, and offers H-H work rates. For it's price, the card is certainly a decent option to add if you're looking for defensive reinforcements. The 95 Pace is pretty decent, but you'll need to boost the 90 Defending and 92 Physicality to get the best out of the card.

Toree's Panic Pack costs 89p. 99¢. That’ll probably either perk up your ears, or make your face twist in reasonable scepticism. Luckily, as with all the previous Toree games, it’s absolutely worthy of the former and certainly not the latter.
Previous games in the series of short and colourful 3D platformers have had a mantra of ‘easy to pick up, difficult to master’, and if you’ve indulged in any of them and have been hankering for something a bit more ‘difficult to pick up, aching to master’, well you’ve struck gold here, sunshine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While playing Zenless Zone Zero, you might get some items that mention an 'Attribute Counter effect' in its description. While most things are well-stated in the game, Attribute Counter effects are oddly lacking in proper guidance, so here's everything you need to know about them.


What is an Attribute Counter effect in Zenless Zone Zero?


Arrtibute Counter effects are the result of hitting an enemy with a weakness to a specific Attribute. For clarity, Attribute here refers to the typing of an Agent. Rina, for example, is an Electric Attribute Agent, and she has an Attribute Counter when she hits a robotic enemy with Electric Attribute attacks. While this naturally results in robots taking more damage and increased Anomaly build-up from Rina's attacks, specific items, such as the Unfettered Game Ball W-Engine, activate their effects based on this Attribute Counter, resulting in an Attribute Counter effect.

Using the Unfettered Game Ball in a more specific example, its description states that all Agents gain a CRIT RATE bonus for twelve seconds to any targets with an Attribute Counter effect triggered against them. If Rina is using the Unfettered Game Ball and hits a robot enemy with any of her Electric attacks, then the Unfettered Game Ball's effect will activate and all your active Agents will get the CRIT RATE bonus. 


From what I can tell, there is no hard indicator that an Attribute Counter effect has occurred, which does make taking advantage of the mechanic a bit more difficult. Thankfully, I've only found a few things in Zenless Zone Zero that specifically use it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the launch of Episode 1: Act 2 live in Destiny 2, there's plenty of new tasks to chip away at. Its seasonal missions delve further into this new Vex storyline, and even 50 more Season Pass levels to work through and acquire new loot from. Among these additions are two new weapons, including a particularly potent pulse rifle. 


If you're after the new weapons, here's the gold roll for the Corrasion pulse rifle in Destiny 2, including perks and attachments.


The best perks and attachments for the Corrasion in Destiny 2


Image via Destructoid.


The Corrasion joins a fairly rare archetype of pulse rifles in that it comes with the Heavy Burst Frame, converting the usual three or four-round burst into a powerful two-round burst similar to the Graviton Lance. Flinch is also slightly reduced when aiming. This makes it uniquely suited to rolls that prioritize furthering its damage over applying debuffs. The following setup should serve that nicely:



Barrel: Arrowhead Brake


Magazine: Tactical Mag


Perk 1: High-Impact Reserves


Perk 2: Frenzy



The choices of Arrowhead Brake and Tactical Mag here give the Corrasion some better handling and recoil control, which aren't the best on a weapon of this type. You also benefit from better magazines and reload speed, meaning you can stay in that fight that little bit longer. High-Impact Reserves and Frenzy go hand in hand both with each other and with the attachments, as they both provide benefits the longer you stay in a fight. Dealing with hordes of enemies, and particularly higher health enemies, shouldn't be an issue.

It's safe to say that the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate roster goes through quite a lot; after all, the very aim of the game is to beat on your opponent until you can fling them off the arena and into the sweet nothingness of oblivion. So it's only natural, then, that the fighters will want to use their downtime to relax a bit, put their feet up, or perhaps even play a bit of basketball.
That's exactly what Sephiroth and Kirby get up to in a charming and hilarious stop-motion animation posted to social media by @shinohara_kenta (thanks, Automaton). It's a rather short piece, but it's one of the most effortlessly funny pieces of animation we've seen in quite some time.

And yet, I find myself wanting to get hyper-specific when writing about the action of Corpus Edax, because it has an incredibly gratifying metal pipe sound, whether you’re stealthy wrapping it around the back of a blissfully unaware fool’s noggin, or lobbing it directly at their knee caps. In fact - although the game does have a delightful array of classic verbs, along with a few surprises - many of them are simply conducive to a stirring round of fisticuffs, to write my most British sentence of the week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atten-hut!
When you think of survival horror, chances are you think of zombies, monsters, ghosts, and other fantastical, supernatural creatures. Conscript tries something a bit different. Set during World War I, you’re faced with something more feasible and realistic than any of the aforementioned beasties: the horror of war. Yes, the enemies here are your fellow man; soldiers enlisted to fight in The Battle of Verdun, one of the most brutal and well-known conflicts of the 'Great War'.
We must admit to fearing the worst after experiencing Conscript's opening moments. The prologue throws you right into the heat of battle: gunfire rattles in the distance, explosions cut off passageways, and enemies rush at you in groups of two or three. For what is meant to be a top-down survival horror game, it all felt rather chaotic and antithetical to the slow, methodical gameplay and combat. Thankfully, things cool off a bit once you see the title screen and the main game kicks off.

The new game brings back said wormhole-based carnage together with newly "faction-forward" teamplay, and if you want to know what "faction-forward" means when it's at home, I encourage you to stick your whole head into the below crackling cinematic trailer-vortex. I promise nothing bad will happen to it on the other side.

No tunnels choked with sickly, mushy-pea green gas. No rats feasting on my ankles, occasionally inflicting a disease that halves my health bar. “Christ, they’re sending runners now?” the rifleman asks as I hoof south from Fort Souville after a gruelling trench defence whittles down my resources to a busted fightin’ spade and a handful of pistol bullets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Splitgate’s combination of Halo-esque first-person shooter with Portal-inspired portal jumping mechanics made it quite the sensation when it launched in open beta in 2021. With its servers regularly buckling under the weight of its players, the game caught lightning in a bottle but petered out when the game finally went 1.0 and simultaneously ceased receiving support in 2022. Now, developer 1047 Games is back with Splitgate 2 and aims to refine the original's winning formula. 
Like the first game, Splitgate 2 will be a free-to-play 4v4 shooter that arms players with a portal gun and more traditional firearms to battle each other in aerial, dimension-hopping combat. The sequel is being built in Unreal Engine 5 and has a new emphasis on factions. Players can suit up to compete in the Sol Splitgate League as members of one of three groups: the agile Aeros, the time-manipulating Meridian, or the trigger-happy Sabrask. According to a press release, “Factions will grant players the ability to choose and progress based on their preferred gameplay style or competitive strategies.” Splitgate 2 will feature new objective-based game modes across new arenas and upgradable weapons. 
Additionally, a special Splitgate 2 companion app is available to download now. The app lets players explore the game’s universe through collectibles that unlock in-game rewards when Splitgate 2 launches. It also features quizzes and a new comic series called Splitgate: The Games We Play. The five-issue series will flesh out the backstory of the characters featured in the announcement trailer and additional issues will arrive monthly. 
Splitgate 2 launches in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Check out the first batch of screenshots below.]]></summary>

Friends, Romans and countrymen: this is a game about a war between two sets of body-stealing monsters, waged in the neon shadows of a fictional East Asian city. It all puts me strongly in mind of a certain John Carpenter movie about squelchy goings-on in Antarctica.

He would go on to do much of the same work on Perfect Dark, including work on the protagonist herself and leading efforts on the game's memorable motion-captured animation.

And what's frustrating is that I just don't get on with them, despite knowing that they can convey brilliant stories through all sorts of interesting cuts and shots and whatnot. I'm sorry to report that certain stories won't grab me if they're not ticking along at just the right pace or if they don't pull me in straight away. I'm a needy soul, someone who demands immediacy and a special emotional sauce.
Until Then is, without a doubt, the only visual novel-y game I've truly enjoyed. In fact, I'd say I've more than enjoyed it - I think it's superb so far. The teens that drive this story are written with an authenticity I've not encountered before, and the 3D interwoven with the 2D adds some surprising - besides the literal - depth.

It's all very dramatic, but we know what to expect from 'not-FIFA' by this point, so it's hardly surprising.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fallout, a TV adaptation of the popular post-apocalyptic video game series, was released on Amazon Prime this past April. Video game adaptations can be a bit of a mixed bag sometimes, but in this case, fans and critics alike (us included) loved its characters, world-building, and its overall take on the Fallout universe. It should come as no surprise, then, that the show has been nominated in numerous categories at the 2024 Emmy Awards.
Fallout was nominated in 16 categories, but two of them are particularly exciting. First, the show is one of eight nominees for Outstanding Drama Series, ranking it among other big shows of 2024, like Shōgun, which currently leads the pack with 25 nominations. Secondly, Walton Goggins was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor In A Drama Series for his portra…]]></summary>

And just like that, Nintendo's next major release of 2024 is right around the corner. Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition lands on Switch on 18th July (that's tomorrow!) and the reviews are here to give us an idea of what to expect.
Before we dive into the round-up, let's first provide a brief refresher of what we had to say about this one. We scored Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition a 'Good' 7/10 in our review. While we were left "fully entertained" by its bite-sized speedrunning challenges and whistle-stop tour of Nintendo's history, we couldn't help but see it as "a downgrade in many ways to NES Remix".

After decades of patiently explaining to elderly relatives, "No, Zelda is the princess", 2024 is going to be the year that Grandma is finally right. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is boldly going where no mainline series entry has gone before by putting the titular princess in the driver's seat. How shocking! How bold! How unlike anything that we Zelda fans have been calling for for years. Ahem.
The 'Zelda is the hero' reveal was only surprising because of how long it's taken. Aside from the obvious protagonist confusion, the series has been crying out for the Hylian monarch to take a starring role. She shines as Sheik in Ocarina of Time (our apologies to those who have avoided that spoiler for the last 25 years), she edged into the spotlight in Spirit Tracks despite it very much still being Link's adventure, and Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom really leaned into the cool magic shenanigans. Sounds a lot like a game-leading hero, if you ask us.

It seems like only yesterday that people were clamouring for information on the full release of Sea of Stars, taking at least a modicum of attention away from Silksong for a little while. Now that the game's out, however, heads are turning toward the upcoming DLC, and folks are getting a bit restless.
Over on social media, Sabotage Studio has confirmed that the DLC is "going well" after responding to a fan requesting an update (thanks, Push Square). It also states that more information will be released later this year.

Properly dig them, I mean, not just waft them into existence with a wave of your magic trowel, a la Battlefield V. Think Minecraft, but with howitzers instead of Creepers. I have never been to war, but I do own several shovels, and let me tell you, if I ever hear artillery fire or even just dangerously raised voices round these parts, the first thing I will do is tunnel straight down.
Fuck it, I might do that if I read any negative comments on this news piece. Vex me not with your pestilent talk of "map balancing". Watch this trailer for Flying Squirrel's new FPS Over The Top WW1 instead. It abounds with trench-digging, and it looks like you can make some decent-sized craters, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo is, relatively speaking, a family-oriented company. Their games are aimed at kids, their parents, and everyone in between with bright colors, wholesome storytelling, and extremely approachable game design. That said, there are exceptions to this rule, like in this creepy 15-second teaser uploaded to the company's YouTube channel last week. A man in a trench coat wearing a paper bag with a smile drawn on it stares into the camera while a distorted music box plays in the background. The only additional context we got was the hashtag #WhoIsEmio, leaving fans scrambling to figure out what exactly this was hinting at.
Today, that mystery has been cleared up. Emio, also known as "The Smiling Man," is the star of a new game in the Famicom Detective Club series, which hasn't had a new entry in 35 years. The game was revealed today alongside a video featuring series producer Yoshio Sakamoto, who wrote the first two games and went on to direct titles like Super Metroid and Metroid: Zero Mission. According to him, they decided to make this new entry during their time developing the Famicom Detective Club remakes back in 2021.
"In Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, a student has been found dead in a chilling fashion, his head covered with a paper bag with an eerie smiling face drawn on it," a press release reads. "This unsettling visage bears a striking resemblance to a recurring clue in a string of unsolved murders from 18 years ago, as well as Emio (the Smiling Man), a killer of urban legend who is said to grant his victims 'a smile that will last forever.'" Players will assume the role of a private investigator and set out to solve the case and stop the killer for good.
Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will be released for the Nintendo Switch next month, on August 29. Hopefully, the titular killer won't murder too many people before then.

Evidently, players did not sufficiently meet their demand for wanton Orc-massacring, for Robot were forced to release two sequels, which I personally would have titled Orcs Must Die!! and Orcs Must Die!!! or perhaps Orcs Must Die!!?, to indicate a mounting existential crisis.
Now, Robot have stepped things up by announcing Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, a newly roguelite, four-player spin on the goblin-farming formula, whose subheading throws bumbling Orc murderers a bone by specifying that you might try building a trap of some kind, a deathtrap possibly. Please find below a suspiciously innocent trailer, which I promise you isn't covering a wall of arrow launchers or similar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I increasingly judge Souls-adjacent games not by the height of their bosses or the depth of their dungeons, but the cleverness of their shortcuts, and Flintlock: Siege Of Dawn has my favourite shortcuts in an age. Rather than just being routes around to the other side of a barred door - though there are plenty such Lordrannish loops to find in this game - they consist of aerial chains of magic, purple triangles that suck you toward them when you hold a button. They lend vigour to a branching, faux-Napoleonic world that might otherwise be a collection of atmospheric strolls between bonfire-equivalents and fights defined by taut resourcing systems. They're idiot-proof grappling points from which you can launch yourself at another triangle, a ledgeful of upgrade materials, or a loitering musketeer who is in urgent need of a ground-pound.

As you'll likely be aware if you've been anywhere near our home page over the last two days, Amazon's Prime Day sale is now well underway. There are some tempting deals on Switch OLED consoles and all sorts of accessories, but we'd argue that the event's microSD card deals are the ones you really shouldn't be missing.
For the remainder of today only, you can grab microSD cards of any size for fantastic prices – there are even great deals on the Sandisk 1.5TB microSD card, which should eradicate any Switch storage woes for good. These prices are about as good as it gets, making now an absolutely perfect opportunity to expand your Switch's storage.

Unlike those saucy Haricots, however, I’ve always winced at how pricey the Xbox Wireless Controller is – except today, the last of Prime Day 2024, where UK-based Prime members can pick one up for a far more sensible £40.

NES games are difficult to revisit. They’re easy to find and play, but they are showing their age and have been for some time. To play the original Legend of Zelda, for example, rewards a difficult-to-control, often obtuse puzzle game whose importance to the industry is undeniable, but its contemporary fun factor is low. Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition counters this with a strategy that WarioWare has been using to great effect since its inception: you only play classic Nintendo games for exactly as long as they’re fun – which in 2024 is anywhere from three secon…]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-07-16T19:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Xbox 360 digital store shuts down later this month on July 26. Amid a wave of price reductions and other end-of-life updates, nostalgic fans can relive the console's earliest days via a new dynamic background modeled after the old “Blades” interface.
For those too young to remember or didn’t get an Xbox 360 until years later, the Blades interface was the console's first dashboard design. It was the first thing players saw from the console’s launch in 2005 until it was updated to an entirely different interface in 2008. Navigating it felt smooth as butter, and some diehards still believe it's the best UI of any Xbox console. 
Although it's less detailed, and you can’t flip through the Blades of this dynamic background and hear that satisfying “whoosh” sound, it’s nice to see Microsoft acknowledge the 360's like this. Here’s how you to make the Blades your Xbox background:
Press the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide.
Navigate to Profile & system > Settings > General > Personalization > My background > Dynamic backgrounds.
Choose Xbox 360 Blades under Featured or Xbox dynamic backgrounds
Select the background art you want using the A button.

        <updated>2024-07-16T17:33:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead by Daylight’s 8th-anniversary stream revealed a few big updates for the popular asymmetrical horror game. The most immediate is the addition of Lara Croft as the game’s latest crossover survivor along with the impending addition of the much-requested 2v8 mode. 
Tomb Raider Chapter
Lara Croft (the 2013 reboot version, specifically) joins DBD today, and though she lacks her pistols and bow, she sports three new perks highlighting her adventuring prowess. Here's an explanation of each per DBD's website:
Finesse: Your fast vaults are faster when healthy, with a cooldown after a successful use.
Hardened: When you open a Chest and cleanse or bless a Totem, Hardened activates for the duration of the Trial. From that point, every time you scream, you’ll instead reveal the Killer’s Aura.
Specialist: When you open or rummage through a Chest, gain 1 Token (up to 3). When you do a Great Skill Check, consume a Token to reduce the max required Generator progress.


2v8 Mode
On July 25, a new 2v8 multiplayer mode descends into the game. This pits two Killers against eight survivors in expanded versions of five classic maps. The number of generators has been doubled, and Survivors must now repair 8 out of 13 to escape. Captive Survivors are now sent directly into cages, and Survivor perks have been reworked into a new role system designed to encourage teamwork. 


Cross-Progression
Cross-progression is being implemented on July 22. This means players can now sync their progress across multiple owned versions of the game. Everything can be shared across any platform except for Switch, which has a few restrictions as you can see in the chart below. 
Today’s stream also revealed a new trailer and the release date for The Casting of Frank Stone, the single-player DBD game developed by Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Quarry). You can read all about that here.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-07-16T16:31:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Casting of Frank Stone, Supermassive Games’ single-player narrative-driven horror game set in the Dead by Daylight universe, has a release date. This intriguing horror collaboration will arrive on September 3, and a new trailer provides a proper introduction of the main cast. 
Developed by Supermassive (Until Dawn, The Quarry) and published by Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive, The Casting of Frank Stone stars five teenagers – Christine Gordon, Jaime Rivera, Linda Castle, Robert Green, and Bonnie Rivera – who film their own horror movie in an abandoned steel mill. Unfortunately, this mill has ties to a notorious murderer named Frank Stone, and the youth’s innocent art project goes horribly wrong.


We still don’t know much about the narrative other than that it is set within the world of Dead by Daylight and takes place in the town of Cedar Mills during the summer of 1980. Gameplay-wise, The Casting of Frank Stone follows a similar blueprint to Supermassive’s previous horror titles in that it’s a choice-driven adventure where characters can be permanently killed off based on your decisions. You can check out a recent gameplay trailer here to see it in action. 
The Casting of Frank Stone is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The word "kiss" occurs 10 times in the latest blog post for the seventh major Baldur's Gate 3 patch, while the word "bug" occurs 14 times. I think this ratio captures how BG3 updates at large walk the line between dealing with stuff like progression blockers, and sating the inexhaustible horniness of the fanbase. There's more to patch 7 than glitch-hunting and snogs, however. Due in September, it introduces dynamic splitscreen functionality, expansions for Honour mode, modding tools, new endings for evil playthroughs, and a brace of tweaks for Origin characters.

Take Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4060, whose positioning in the RTX 40 series hierarchy would suggest an affordable mid-range GPU, yet routinely pushes £300. Here, though, you can nab the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Windforce OC edition at a 15% discount, bringing it down to a far more agreeable £238. Nice.

Here is when you can jump into each beta: 
Weekend 1: Early Access (for preorder customers/Xbox Game Pass subscribers) - August 30 at 10 a.m. PT to September 4 at 10 a.m. PT

Not bad, for a device with a higher-rez display and more graphical horsepower than the Steam Deck or Steam Deck OLED.

While I do think this is a rather metal logo, there's an argument to be made that it's not current or trendy enough. With this in mind, I think the words "Call Of Duty" should represent the endless, unstoppable nature of existence. And with Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 revealing its multiplayer open beta and early access dates, we must further consume and be consumed by the circular march of COD. Let's dolphin dive in, shall we.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know as much about programming video game monsters as I do the exact flavour and consistency of the sands on Mars, but I've always thought the chief advantage of the Slime monster archetype is its economy. A slime, in most games, is a squashy smiley face. Why, I could grow myself one of those right this very instant, by doodling a circle in MS Paint and squinting very hard. Slimes do take more complex forms - chrome slimes, fire slimes, slimes with angry eyebrows, etc - but come now, it's not on the same level as rebooting Lara Croft's hair to billow in the blowback from grenades.
The simplicity of slime creation may soon become a distant memory, however, for Epic Games tech artist and current Duck Shake Games Asher Zhu is hell-bent on reinventing the homely Dragon Quest sludgeball as a technical tour de force on par with his previous contributions to Unreal Engine showcase Matrix Awakens. That's the impression I garner from the below video of Zhu's latest project, anyway, whose description also tantalises with talk of "Splatoon mechanics in dungeons".

It’s a first person pilot-em-up that puts you in the cockpit of a grasshoppery rust-bucket carrying out a critical mission on an industrial desert planet. The more the intro text stresses the importance of this mission, the more guiltily useless I feel, because I cannot get this beautifully run-down mech to do anything of note, unless you count violently hopping into walls to be notable.

As such, those companions are key to everything happening in Veilguard. 
With such a significant emphasis on these characters, I spoke to some of the game's leads to learn precisely about BioWare's philosophy on companions in Veilguard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the video game follow-up to last year’s TMNT: Mutant Mayhem animated film, has its first trailer and a release date. The game was first announced last September. 
A Heartful of Games is developing the game, which retains the stylized Spider-Verse-inspired art direction from the hit film. The story unfolds after the movie's events and sees Leo, Raph, Donny, and Mikey battling a new wave of mutants invading New York City. 


As previously covered in our exclusive preview earlier this year, Mutant Mayhem is a third-person action/platformer game, and each turtle features a unique playstyle. The game also supports up to two-player local co-op. 
TMNT: Mutants Unleashed launches on October 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. The game is also getting a fancy Collector Edition, and you can see the contents of that here. Mutants Unleashed is one of several TMNT games to arrive in recent years (and the third in 2024 alone, following Wrath of the Mutants and the Switch port of Splintered Fate), and you can read all about the franchise’s history in video games in our in-depth retrospective.]]></summary>

It’s a great hospital, by the way. Spotlight-headed phantasma shamble about corridors reminiscent of The Division 2 or The Last Of Us’s naturalia.
Striking, but also within easy reach of comparisons. And if Once Human was purely the collection of x from ys it very much appears to be, I’m not sure I’d have much positive to say about it. On the surface, what you're getting here is a 6/10 third-person shooter from ten years ago that gleefully spills thumbtacks along any simple paths to progress with live service obfuscation, propped up by a detached crafting and building economy that has you popping mined rocks and chopped wood in the oven then taking out freshly baked shotguns a few minutes later. Its systems run the gamut from numbly enjoyable to being a source of major psychic damage, and even the simple act of replacing your initial tier I rustic baseball cap means navigating several menus, currencies, and resources.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1’s final Year 1 DLC fighter arrives next week, and it’s Takeda Takahashi. The young Shirai Ryu warrior makes only his second appearance in a Mortal Kombat game and looks every bit as capable as his older clanmates, Scorpion and Smoke. 
Although Takeda was Kenshi’s son in his debut appearance, Mortal Kombat X, the remixed timeline of Mortal Kombt 1 has changed him to Kenshi’s cousin. Like Kenshi, Takeda grew up a Yakuza but was more faithful to the clan than his cousin. As such, the Yakuza tasked Takeda with killing Kenshi, and the two battled, with the latter coming emerging victorious. Takeda was mortally wounded in the battle and rushed to the aid of the Shirai Ryu, where Kenshi protected him from being killed by the Yakuza for failing his mission. This causes Takeda to have a change of heart and join the Shirai Ryu to wage war against Earthrrealm’s criminal underground and, eventually, the evil forces of Outworld. 
Takeda still utilizes the Shirai Ryu fighting style, including his signature pair of bladed whips. He also sports shurikens, a barrage of teleporting flame attacks, and an aerial grapple best described as mid-air corkscrew piledriver. Check Takeda out below.  


Takeda will be available on July 23, both as a standalone purchase and as a free download for Kombat Pack owners. The same day also sees previously revealed Kameo fighter Ferra become available to buy. Both Takeda and Ferra will be playable for the first time during Evo 2025 this weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crocs and Pokémon are teaming up again for another collaboration, this time bringing four classic Generation 1 pocket monsters into the shoe line sometime this year. This news comes by way of Sole Retriever, which reports that Crocs is releasing four new pairs of shoes, each themed after a specific Kanto Pokémon: Charizard, Gengar, Snorlax, and Jigglypuff. 
Though there isn't a release date for these Crocs yet – Sole Retriever simply reports 2024 – we know each will cost $70. While each pair has unique theming based on the Pokémon it's representing, each pair of Crocs comes with Jibbitz, which are the detachable charms on the tops of the shoes, the classic Pokémon title on back of the shoe strap, and the classic Pokéball logo as the buttons holding each of the straps in place. 
Charizard

Gengar

Snorlax

Jigglypuff

Sole Retriever says these Crocs will be available through Crocs and online and in-store retailers. 
While waiting to learn more, read about an upcoming Nike x Tekken 8 shoe collaboration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Death Game Hotel came out last week - a comically gory game in which players play casino-style card games around a table and raise the stakes by betting their own limbs. It's a VR game, which is a break from the norm for White Owls, the studio run by Hidetaka "Swery" Suehiro (then again, what is their "norm"?). It's also got a big multiplayer component, with lots of jovial bubble-popping and chicken-squeezing between the comedy blood spurts. And this taste of multiplayer mischief has Swery's head percolating. This game won't be his last dipped toe in the multiplayer ocean, he told us.
"In the future," said Swery, "I would like to leverage this experience to challenge myself with something new in the online multiplayer realm (something you probably haven't even imagined yet)."

One could, I believe, make a convincing argument for Yakuza 0 being - if not the best videogame ever made - then at least the most videogame. While this coming October’s Amazon series won’t be the first live action adaption of Yakuza, I am hopeful its episodic format will give its characters a bit more room to breathe. Or, according to Kiryu actor Ryoma Takeuchi in an interview with IGN, to find the love they’ve always longed for.

These are happy words for anyone who enjoyed 2019's dander among the sandcastles and erasers. A lot of games offer a "sandbox" but in Supraland, the entire world really did take place in exactly that - a sandbox out in a garden, full of toys. The sequel's launch into early access "might be in october," says the post. "We'll see."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lots of games use frogs as a means to appeal to those who believe they are cute, me being one of those people. The humble croaker dominates the wholesome category, where they take centre stage in farming sims or as detectives or as green lads who hop over platforms and hurt enemies by lashing them with their tongues.
Schim is different: you play as a frog of the shadows, not some green attention-seeker. And in a mundane world of vibrant colour, you're to bounce between patches of shade in search of a human pal whose shadow you've been unwittingly severed from. What ensues is a charming puzzler of both freedom and flow, which genuinely has you view everyday environments through the googly eyes of a phantom amphibian. It's a lovely thing, if perhaps not as emotionally charged as it implies early on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a lot of video game awards and most of them are simply popularity contests, and therefore also stinky borefests. The one that isn't, in my eyes, is the yearly Independent Games Festival awards - the IGFs. 

The IGF Celebration Days Steam sale provides plenty of examples as to why, with discounts from now until July 20th on winners and finalists from throughout the IGF awards' history.

Announced back in 2021 and initially due to arrive alongside a gamer-focused streaming service called Binge in 2022, the live action series has been scrapped along with the production company behind it.

Perhaps of greater significance is that the Driver series itself might not be dead, as a Ubisoft spokesperson said that they are "actively working on other exciting projects related to the franchise".

Together we discovered that Lennox, the hot sauce eating green man seen in the game's trailer shouts "exploding knife!" when he throws his exploding knife, but he had nothing on It-Z who had a great SMG, the ability to clone herself when she dodges, and teleportation ability making her easily and indisputably the best character in the game. Alex also liked Duchess. You can check out the archive of the full stream below.

In its fifth major expansion, Dawntrail, Final Fantasy XIV is facing its biggest existential crisis yet: where does your story go now that its 10-year A-plot is over? Dawntrail forges ahead with an enjoyable summer adventure to the land of Tural, doubling as a trojan horse for what lies in store for the future of the long-running MMO’s story. Dawntrail doesn’t match the narrative highs of the previous pair of expansions and is flawed in several ways, but its themes of legacy, the importance of culture, and responsible…]]></summary>

Sometimes, honest accessibility aids are falsely accused of being cheating tools; other times, a monitor will straight-up play League of Legends for you. This week, developments in gaming keyboards have sparked a new debate on what does and doesn’t fall within the scope of fair play, with mechanical keeb specialists Wooting declaring in no uncertain terms that "Rappy Snappy is not the same as Snap Tap." Cool, glad that’s cleared up.

Starfy isn't a particularly familiar franchise to America players. They have received four games – three for Game Boy Advance, one for DS – but only the 2009 DS game ever released in America. Today, the original three Game Boy Advance games are now available for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. The games retain their original title, Densetsu no Stafy, and have not been localized. The gameplay has been describe as Kirby-esque, but I have never been able to confirm that myself until today.

The second I wrested this privilege from Ed Thorn's resentful fingers, however, developers Edgeflow Studio and publishers Hooded Horse delayed the early access release. Perhaps this reflects Hooded Horse's atypically forgiving, when-it's-ready approach to game publishing. Or perhaps they just hate me and wish to deny me things that might bring me pleasure. It matters not, because the game now has a new early access release date - 30th August 2024 via Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store. Catch a celebratory trailer below.

This rampant enthusiasm for teledoors might seem strange, given that video games are make-believe worlds held together by arbitrary squiggles of magic language. There is fundamentally no reason any video game door should obey the customary laws of spacetime. But don’t let that stop you watching the announcement trailer for Motion Blur’s Black State, a third-person stealth shooter which is heavily redolent of Metal Gear Solid but also, awash with doors that work in mysterious ways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kain is merchandised. The clans sell tales of him. Few know the truth. He was a character in a dead franchise once, as were we all. However, his contempt for anonymity drove him to inspire the creation of an upcoming (crowdfunding allowing) graphic novel. The book stars Raziel, the first-born of his lieutenants, and It’s a canonical prequel story to the original Soul Reaver. I have waited a millennium. Over time, I became less human and more…games blogger. I have had the chance to write about Legacy Of Kain precisely once. You’re goddamn right I’m going to froth at the mouth at even the vague promise of more Shakespearean monologues and time-travelling vampires.

This is not all-encompassing. Rather, it's more a conversation about this year's early standouts and other releases we plan to visit before our official Game of the Year discussions in December. Before we properly dive in, Marcus breaks down his review of Anger Foot, developer Free Lives' new first-person shooter. Afterwards, Alex highlights a small desktop game (literally) called Rusty's Retirement. We hope you enjoy this episode and find new games to play!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You ever do that thing on a fairground ride or rollercoaster where you sort of pull your neck and face back in preparation for extreme motion? Welcome to kick-exalting FPS Anger Foot. Violence is brutal and cartoonish. Slight mistakes kill you instantly. The soundtrack slaps. There’s an easy Devolver labelmate orientation point here, but if Hotline Miami was a cocktail of chemical euphoria and gut guilt, like realising you’ve accidentally pocketed someone’s lighter at a festival, Anger Foot is doing whippits out of balloon animals then having a great time rhythmically headbutting a portaloo for a few hours. Similarly, it’s also a bit of a masochistic ordeal to put yourself through. But, man. What a buzz.

Anger Foot exemplifies a simple idea executed to the nth degree. As a furious sneakerhead possessing seemingly the deadliest legs in the world, you must retrieve your prized collection of stolen footwear by kicking everything in sight. The bombast accompanying this wacky premise – fast-paced, split-second action, satisfying gunplay, and delectable destructibility – turns Anger Foot from a one-kick pony into one of the year’s most exciting, challenging, and tough-to-put-down adrenaline rushes.

Righetti says that at times it may appear that Italy's Piracy Shield blocking system is malfunctioning or ineffective, but that's not true. It's all down to pirates' use of "sophisticated services" offered by American intermediaries.  Fortunately, the solution is straightforward; force companies like Cloudflare into compliance and prosecute users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Double Dragon series has been around since the arcades in 1987 and has managed to maintain a surprisingly consistent release cadence in those more than 35 years. It was only last year that we played Double Dragon Gaiden, a pixelated throwback brawler (or belt-scroll action game, per its official YouTube description) take on the franchise.
This next entry is decidedly more modern, with fully 3D visuals. It's not the first time the series has explored this dimension, but it is a rare occurrence. The game is being developed by Yuke's, the developer that worked on the WWE 2K franchise until 2K19 and most recently developed AEW: Fight Forever. It is being published, or presented by, as the trailer implies, Arc System Works, the developer behind Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball FighterZ.
Double Dragon Revive is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and One, and PC sometime in 2025.


For a whole lot more on Double Dragon, but maybe not the version of Double Dragon you're thinking, head here to read all about the 1994 movie. Back in 2019, I tracked down the film's director, James Yukich, to talk about the bizarre film's trajectory, what went wrong, and what he would have done differently had he been giving a chance to try making the film again.]]></summary>

This in itself would be borderline post-worthy, but it's also heavily inspired by Game Boy Advance RPGs such as Golden Sun, and features music created by Golden Sun composer Motoi Sakuraba alongside Terranigma composer Masanori Hikichi.

You have signed a four-page contract with the Devil, cursing you with this fragile body yet blessing you with a fearsome skateboard with which to fulfill your quest to digest Earth's only natural satellite. I've only now got hands on a demo shared earlier this year at Tribeca games festival, and I'm reverberating with pleased energy at the dreamlike atmosphere of this demonic kickflip simulator.

As such, I don’t have enough experience to tell you whether the currently free Pizza Hero is an especially interesting or innovative riff on the formula. However, I am simple-minded enough to enjoy the epic bacon 1.5 humour of a sentient pizza slice with a dog for a companion upgrading itself one topping at a time. This action roguelike reeks of concentrated internet like a week old-slice nestled amidst a stack of free AOL disks. But! It’s cute and fun and free, and that’s enough for me.

Jackson Clayton honoured the proud tradition of getting the 1993 FPS to run on things where no Doom should be by porting classic opening stage E1M1, via level editor Ultimate Doom Builder, into Fortnite’s Unreal editor as a 3D model. Welcome, newcomer Fortnite, to the vaunted halls currently occupied by gut bacteria, jar-grown rat neurons, lawnmowers, teletext, electric toothbrushes, Windows notepad (sort of), and a pregnancy test.

Using the injunction obtained against the Yuzu emulator as a base, Nintendo has just taken down projects including Suyu, Nuzu, Uzuy, Torzu and Sudachi from GitHub.

That's something I learned firsthand while customizing my Rook within BioWare's Edmonton, Canada, office earlier this year during my cover story visit. We were customizing a feminine Rook, and while adjusting body options - read Game Informer’s in-depth feature about Veilguard’s character creator here for more details – our Rook's shirt disappeared to let us customize things like chest size. 
And that's when Veilguard game director Corrine Busche smiled, likely knowing full well that nudity in the character creator means nudity elsewhere in the game, like in Veilguard's romances, something I know BioWare fans will be delighted to hear. "This is a mature RPG," she tells me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We haven't written nearly enough about Fallout London, a gargantuan Fallout 4 total conversion that takes place in a whole new map based on England's capital city - the Big Smoke and/or Great Wen, whose real-life incarnation probably harbours at least one nuke at any given moment, though I haven't asked the King about that lately. Best not speculate.
Anyway, Fallout London is a huge effort from modders Team Folon that was recently sabotaged when Bethesda treated Fallout 4 to a next gen update to capitalise on the Amazon TV show's popularity, rendering several mods incompatible and breaking a lot of stuff. Team Folon have now fiddled with the workings and sent a Fallout London build to GOG for QA testing, which suggests that release is imminent. The catch, however, is that you will need to downgrade your copy of Fallout 4 to play the mod, because even with Team Folon's last-minute adjustments, Fallout 4 next gen and Fallout London simply don't get on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting today, Xbox Game Pass will be experiencing some changes which includes redefining of certain tiers. And later this year, there will be a handful of price increases for various tiers. Here's the exact text as it is presented on Microsoft's website.
Starting July 10, 2024, the following updates to Xbox Game Pass will take effect:
    Price changes will go into effect for new members for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Xbox Game Pass Core, and PC Game Pass.
    Game Pass for Console will no longer be available for new members.
    Members who are already subscribed to Game Pass for Console and have automatic payment renewal enabled will be able to continue to enjoy their membership.
Also, a new Game Pass option, Xbox Game Pass Standard, will become available in the coming months. These changes will enable us to bring members more value and more great games to Game Pass.
The new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier for new members will be $15 a month and will not include access to Day One releases, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, and cloud gaming.
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes access to all the bonuses now not included in the Standard tier is increasing its price from $17 a month to $20.
Xbox Game Pass Core, which offers online access and a much smaller library of curated games, is changing its yearly from $60 to $75. The $10 monthly price for that tier, however, will remain unchanged.
PC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12, but that tier will still include Day One releases.
All of these price changes will be reflected starting on September 12.
Price changes for services you already pay for are always frustrating. What do you think of the change? Do you plan on maintaining your subscription? Or is it time to cancel?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many years ago game designers advised their peers to make their prototypes "juicy". They were talking about the nebulous collection of sensations a player is exposed to when heads explode, coins jangle, and balls bounce. Zenless Zone Zero is a game deeply informed by the philosophy of juice. Like the lootbox hawkers of yesteryear, gacha designers understand the appeal and power of a pleasingly animated gizmo, ker-chunking open and fizzing with potential. This poppy visual and sonic language stretches across Hoyo's latest game, from its cinematic moments, to each character's attacks, to the cute bunny mascots that erupt into gatling guns, to the barista's coffee-making ritual and the recipes of the robo-limbed noodle server. The menu screens, the maps, the free-to-play storefront, everything. It is all very juicy. It is pumped with juice, but only in the same way supermarket chicken is pumped with water.

During a recent playthrough on his YouTube channel, he was asked if he thinks there’s a way to replicate Souls-like descriptions in books. “I’ve wondered that. I really have,” Sanderson replies.

After half a decade on shelves, it’s still the best low-profile mechanical gaming keyboard going, and quite possibly the best wireless keyboard to boot – while the tenkeyless version, the G915 TKL Lightspeed, is just as lovely to use.
Between their nimble performance, crisp mech switches, and impeccable build quality, the only way in which the G915 duo underwhelms is their high pricing – very much the kind you’d want to wait for a Prime Day or Black Friday to dull the pain of. Now, though, there’s an alternative: the new Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL. I’ve been using it. It’s good!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation's PC efforts are paying off, if the latest U.S. Video Game Market Highlights report from analyst group Circana is any indication. That's because developer Sucker Punch Production's Ghost of Tsushima, which originally launched on PlayStation 4 back in 2020, was the best-selling game of May 2024 in the U.S. And that's almost assuredly due to the recent PC release of Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut on May 16. 
Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut hit PC almost four years after the game's initial launch on PS4, which speaks to PlayStation's PC release strategy it detailed last month. It said its live-service games, like this year's Helldivers 2 or the upcoming 5v5 hero shooter Concord, will launch day-and-date on PC, but its tentpole single-player games, like Ghost of Tsushima Directo…]]></summary>

According to ragdoll-prone shooter Helldivers 2, however, it’s better to stand to attention in mid-air and perform a crisp salute. It’s long been known that the game’s emotes confer unexpected defensive advantages, with emergency hugs sometimes shielding you against artillery fire, but now, one redditor has proven via careful scientific experimentation that they also protect you against the force of gravity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nike and Bandai Namco are teaming up to release a Tekken 8-inspired shoe that will be available for purchase this September. Dubbed "Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist," these shoes will be available through Nike, SNKRS, and select retailers in-store and online for $250, as reported by Sole Retriever. 
The shoes themselves are inspired specifically by Tekken 8's primary antagonist, Kazuya Mishima, as the colorway of the shoe is basically a spin on his outfit in-game. Sole Retriever describes the shoes as featuring an iridescent Foamposite material across the design's upper region in armory navy, with a faux crocodile skin texture across the Foamposite material, and black hues over the leather eyestays, shoe collar, and tongue. 
Check out the Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes for yourself below: 

As you can see, the shoes also feature the Tekken logos, a Fist logo with Tekken's signature lighting, and a nice box to hold the shoes. 
Sole Retriever reports that a second colorway in this lineup is on the way and it will reference Jin Kazama, although there's no images of what it will look like yet. 
These Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes will cost you $250 when they release this September. For more, read Game Informer's Tekken 8 review.

The publishing giant has reportedly closed Piranha Bytes, the studio known for cult RPGs like Gothic, Risen, and Elex, according to a worker who spoke to Polish games site CD-Action. The studio's existence had been under threat since early this year, after being targeted in Embracer's purgatorial studio massacre. At that time the German studio were hopeful to avoid being closed down, insisting "don't write us off yet!" Unfortunately, it looks like those who worked at the studio have since been laid off.

The best-known is probably Frostpunk, with its perpetual raging against the dying of the light, its ceaseless scrape for coal and wood as the temperature falls. Anoxia Station, announced this month, is similarly driven by the gathering of fossil fuels, and similarly shaped by questions of worker death and morale, but it takes you deep underground - into a sumptuous, brutal world of quartz crystals, salt caves, magma lakes, moonmilk rivers, swirling gases and, judging from the below trailer, enormous maggots and centipedes. Larva lakes, amirite.

It was reported that Pirahna Bytes was looking for a new publisher following job cuts last year. In January, following a period of radio silence and inactivity from the studio, CEO Micahel Rüve addressed reports of an impending closure by stating the company was in a “difficult situation” while expressing optimism about finding a partner by saying, “Don’t write us off yet!”

It has now been occupied by Russia for almost two years, during which, as reported by the Associated Press, Russia has demolished, rebuilt and renamed much of the city, overwriting its Ukrainian heritage.
The Disco Elysium-inspired RPG Hollow Home is a memory of Mariupol from just before the war - not a 1:1 recreation, but a collection of details, colours, personalities and some familiar buildings, painstakingly amassed and offered up in the face of erasure. Speaking to me during a very brief demo at Digital Dragons in Poland this year, artist Anastasia Hlyniana called my attention to the plants jutting from old car tyres around the game's isometric map, which she says are a common sight in Mariupol.

According to the game's website, Disney Pixel RPG will feature a story about merging worlds, fast-paced strategic battles (with simple controls for mobile and even an auto-play function), customization for your own avatar character, and expeditions that allow you to send pixelated Disney characters out on missions to gather materials and more. Players in Japan can pre-register for Disney Pixel RPG right now ahead of the game's September 9 launch – there's no word on if other regions will be able to pre-register anytime soon, however. 
"The game world that these Disney characters call home have suddenly been invaded by strange programs, and are starting to break down," the story description reads on the game's website. "These previously isolated game worlds have merged, throwing all the characters into confusion. Take on the role of a player of these games and join Disney characters as you embark on an epic quest across multiple game worlds to restore order." 
The game's listing on Apple's App Store notes it will be free-to-play but will feature microtransactions. 
Here's a look at the game's combat: 
And here's a look at the game's avatar customization: 
Disney Pixel RPG launches in Japan on iOS and Android on September 9, 2024. There's no word on when to expect it in other regions of the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another year, another huge amount raised for charity by obscenely skilled gamers. Popular speedrunning event Summer Games Done Quick took place last week and raised more than $2.5 million for Doctors Without Borders, fielding runners who took on a mix of modern and retro games with various quirky goals or challenging requirements. Like an attempt at getting through Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice without being hit (oh god) and a hasty anti-gravitational swim through the solar system of Outer Wilds but without using the game's spaceship (what). Let us be glad these folks use their powers for good.

Not so in cyberpunk tactics game All Walls Must Fall. Here time travel means dodging bullets, reversing flubbed hacking, and replaying that conversation you had with the bouncer that got you booted to the curb. “A bloody good time-troubling tactical shooter,” decreed Adam Smith (RPS in Peace) in his review. Well, now it’s a bloody free time-troubling tactical shooter. Take that, Monday!

Many Stories, and I was immediately taken back to my convenience store (“konbini” is Japanese for convenience stores, generally) adventures days prior. From Lawson’s excellent spicy chicken to 7-Eleven’s life-altering egg salad sandos, convenience stores in Japan are incredible, as strange as that is to write. InKonbini is a ’90s love letter to the konbinis of Japan, and after speaking with Nagai Industries founder Dima Shen about InKonbini, I couldn’t be more sold.

The video games industry is now old enough to have been subjected to its fair share of documentaries, from The King of Kong to Indie Game: The Movie to Netflix’s High Score.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dawntrail, the latest expansion for Final Fantasy XIV, has officially been out just three days, arriving earlier this week after a brief early access release. Despite its story and extra 10 levels spanning dozens of hours of playtime, that’s apparently been ample time for players to complain loudly enough about one of the expansion’s brand new jobs - so much so that Square Enix have already announced a set of incoming changes planned across the game’s next run of patches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's Sokoban! A game whose name I recognise as shorthand for this type of puzzle, and yet have never seen. It's also a genre I'm not overly fond of, preferring puzzles I can sometimes get through by intuition (Spring Falls), brute force (every switch-the-lights puzzle ever), or entering chaos mode (real life).
But I like Isles of Sea and Sky. From starting it almost on a whim, I was playing and figuring things out with zero fuss and no overt tutorialising pretty much immediately, and from there suddenly found that several hours had breezed by without frustration or boredom.

This is on-brand. But, oh no, a wink to real life gambling could be interpreted as a transparent acknowledgement of the gacha genre's psychological claw machine, which is maybe why the developers decided the scratchcard stall should have a sole employee: a very cute dog.

Who thought hip-hop would take it this far?
As we celebrated the 50th anniversary of hip-hop last year, it’s now a good time to look back at how ingrained hip-hop music is in gaming, from NBA2K (remember that 2K13 soundtrack curated by Jay-Z?), Mortal Kombat, and Need for Speed, to Cyberpunk 2077 and, of course, Fortnite.
Mortal Kombat 11 came out of the gates in 2018 with a fiery trailer featuring music by 21 Savage, and later Megan Thee Stallion live-streamed an MK11 match on Twitch. The lore of Grand Theft Auto continues to grow, powered by recent GTA Online upda…]]></summary>

Just within the character creator, there are hundreds of options to customize things like hair, body type, what your playable character Rook's face looks like, and so much more. There are also a ton of armor options, too. 
Companions have an armor slot, a ring slot, an accessory slot, and a weapon slot, while Rook has access to even more – a helmet, two weapon slots, a belt, an amulet slot, and two ring slots. A belt having its own slot might sound odd as it's not an armor piece people typically think of when kitting out an RPG warrior. However, the belt is an important facet of Rook's kit. The better Rook's belt, the better the potency of their healing potions, which are replenished by destroying green pots scattered about the …]]></summary>

And it’s always satisfying.
The parry mechanic is one of the novel additions of the 2023 remake developed by Capcom. Whenever a bolt or melee attack from an infected villager is about to impact Leon Kennedy, you only need to press a button to deflect with the in-game knife. This action grants an opportunity to follow up with an attack on the spot while simultaneously adding to RE4’s original close-quarter smackdown.
Adapting this to the PlayStation VR2 wasn’t easy. Instead of Leon doing a swift animation with just a button press, you need to grab the knife from your chest, lift it up in the air, and match the incoming attack. I…]]></summary>

The first Monaco released in 2013 at a point when Xbox Live Arcade had hit its stride, and there was a new appetite for the type of creative and unique game that existed below the huge budget triple-A, high-fidelity experience. Those kinds of games vastly outnumber the big-budget experiences we are familiar with today, but in 2013 we were discovering such experiences and marveling at their ingenuity. The competition is stiffer for Monaco 2 as it nears release, but creator Andy Schatz is clearly excited to revisit the criminal gameplay saying, “If Monaco 1 is about cat and mouse, Monaco 2 is about complexity and creativity.”

In the wake of such a weird cultural moment, I’m certainly not the only one left wondering how the dust settles, especially as it relates to how we meet up, build friendships and relationships, and socialize. If you’re a gamer, answering those questions requires an additional layer of complexity since we spend much of our free time in virtual worlds. I’ve found myself wondering where our favorite hobby fits into the equation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has announced that it will delist three Battlefield titles from the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 digital storefronts at the end of the month. 
On July 31, the PS3/Xbox 360 versions of Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield: Hardline, along with their associated DLCs, will be removed from sale. Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process. 
https://t.co/2W8dLlGjBM
June 28, 2024
While the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.
It never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Stormind Games and publisher Saber Interactive have released a new story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead showcasing more of this upcoming first-person horror game's silent alien-infested world. And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. 
Though there's still no release date – it's launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. 
Check it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: 


As you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out how the story of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead plays out because it launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn has gone gold, meaning it should be all but ready for its release on July 18. Developer A44 (Ashen) has also released the game’s PC specs and 20-minutes of raw gameplay footage.
The upcoming "Souls-lite" fantasy action game stars elite soldier Nor Vanek and her furry fox-like companion Enki on a revenge quest to kill the gods of their world. She wields an arsenal of melee, firearms, and magic that can be chained to create stylish combo attacks. Nor Venek also has special traversal abilities to navigate the world, which is being besieged by the angry deities.
We last saw Flintlock during the Xbox Games Showcase a few weeks ago, but you can check out 20 minutes of new gameplay footage in the video below. Set during a later stage of the game, a synopsis adds context to the footage: "Join Nor and Enki as they prepare to step into the deserts of Wanderer’s Rest to take on the personal guard of the god Dukmar. With an entire army hunting for her, Nor will need all of her skills to make it to her eventual destination - the City of Sibyl, where she hopes the gods’ true intentions will finally be revealed."


Here are the game's minimum and recommended PC specs:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.
