Awaceb's action-adventure game Tchia has a pretty cool set of tools for getting around its world. In a new gameplay walkthrough, we got a good glimpse at all the ways players will be able to get around and use their powers.
Tchia is a new open-world adventure following protagonist Tchia. She's on a quest to rescue her father, and she'll need the help of both her tools and some impressive soul powers to do it.
A big feature of Tchia is being able to inhabit things, be they birds, lanterns, or fruits, and use them for different effects. As shown in this new gameplay walkthrough with game director Phil Crifo, there's a lot to do with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri2OiksaV88
Early on, Tchia inhabits a bird and soars around, providing a good view. Later, Tchia jumps into a lantern and flings it at an enemy, lighting them on fire. Rad! Crifo even shows off soul jumping into a coconut.
You might wonder why anyone would soul jump into a coconut. Well, Crifo shows how throwing an object with the throw mechanic, then leaping into it to gain momentum. It makes me think speedruns for this could be really interesting.
Hey, soul sister
The walkthrough shows off a bunch of ways for getting around the island, from tree-hopping to sailing. And it caps off with a little ditty with one of Tchia's pals, using the fully playable ukulele. No, they do not play Wonderwall.

Tchia has looked pretty rad so far in its showings, mixing open-world action-adventure mechanics with a gorgeous island world inspired by New Caledonia. While it got a delay earlier this year that's pushed it into 2023, I'm really intrigued to see more of this world and what players can discover in it. The soul jumping alone seems like an incredibly fun mechanic to mess around with once Tchia is out.

There is nothing quite as emblematic of our lost and distant childhood than video games. They are one of the few toys that both children and adults alike can play with and remain socially acceptable, so they serve as a rope tying us back to the past. When that rope is cut — when we are unable to play the games from our past because of decaying technology, or prohibitively expensive consoles — it can feel like we've lost a part of ourselves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How will I deal with a straightforward system like this
In case you missed it, Splatoon 3's Salmon Run PVE/horde mode is always going to be on. No wonky "sign on during this time/date" restrictions: you just queue up for a multiplayer mode and you play it! It only took a sequel for it to happen.
We've known that for some time now, but a tweet today reconfirmed that it is indeed available "24/7," in a bid to reach the "Eggsecutive VP" level. It looks like a ranking (it's shown in the top right-hand corner of the image, complete with an experience bar), and part of a separate XP system. In the past, Salmon Run was essentially playable every other day or so, rotating into Splatoon 2 as a game mode.
Nintendo doles out more info on Splatoon 3's Salmon Run
Nintendo also took the time this morning to talk about a few other aspects of the game, including the break room, which is essentially a training room for Salmon Run. Just like folks experienced in the Splatfest, it looks like you'll be able to practice some basics before a mission. You can try out egg throws here, as well as weaponry. Private games are also confirmed, and Nintendo reminds us that "King Salmonids" could appear in the mode.
All good stuff so far! I mean they had me at "Salmon Run is always on."

My experience with the PS2 version of Destroy All Humans 2 is rather limited. While I enjoyed the original back when it was released, I merely rented the sequel. Then my brother-in-law and I just messed around in co-op and I never made it anywhere. However, the fun with physics gameplay left such an impression on me that it’s been on my hit list for years. The problem is, the memory that stuck out most for me was its ugly-as-sin graphics and oppressive draw fog.
Thankfully, THQ Nordic and Black Forest Games decided to go all the way with the series and gussy up Destroy All Humans 2 in the same way it did for the original title. That means, while the graphics have been upgraded to the nines, the warts of the PS2-era gameplay are still present underneath. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new project will be built in Unreal Engine 5
Developer 1047 Games is moving on to a new project. The studio announced today that it is ending feature development on its portal-based shooter Splitgate, and moving on to a new game.
In a new statement shared on the Splitgate site, 1047 says that the FPS has reached a level of success it could not have anticipated. This has led to the studio growing substantially and bringing on new talent. It's also meant a lot of time trying to rework older content and systems, in what it characterizes as "bailing water" from a ship.
In light of this, 1047 Games has decided to build something new. And to do so, it's ending feature development on Splitgate.
"We’re turning our attention away from iterative, smaller updates and going all-in to focus on a new game in the Splitgate universe which will present revolutionary, not evolutionary, changes to our game. It will be a shooter, it will have portals, and it will be built in Unreal Engine 5. Oh, and it will be free."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5XKcTM_NM8
A portal to a new world
That doesn't mean Splitgate is going away, though. 1047 Games says Splitgate will remain online, as will items and progression. There's also a new Battle Pass rolling out on September 15. The pass will be free for everyone, as a thank-you to everyone who's played Splitgate.
Support will also continue, though it will be limited in scope to smaller updates and fixes. The bulk of 1047's focus, the studio says, will be on an entirely new shooter.
Splitgate started out as an interesting combination of Portal and Halo, which worked pretty well at the time for those waiting on Halo Infinite. It's since grown to be its own thing, and it'll be interesting to see what 1047 does with a new engine, larger team, and all the lessons learned from making Splitgate.

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We wished it to happen, and it was so
Masahiro Sakurai's YouTube channel is chugging along since it launched just nine days ago, and now he's amassed nearly one million subscribers already.
Having watched every video so far, it's easy to see why! Sakurai is essentially bringing a game development boot camp to the masses, with his signature calm and easy-going approach. He's touched on topics such as accessibility, technical considerations, design mechanics, and game philosophy.
At the time of publication, here is how his YouTube situation is going:
405,000 English language subscribers
355,000 Japanese language subscribers
Below are a few of the videos Sakurai's YouTube channel has shared since our last update. I've been checking back in daily! The bite-sized format is such a great way to end the day.
Risk and Reward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXqEykD5Ub4
In this video, Sakurai uses the ever-popular game Space Invaders to illustrate the concept of risk and reward, and how a careful balance of both can lead to a more engaging experience.
Game Development Isn't a Game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlFkxfkICO8
In the vein of many, many GDC and DICE-esque talks (albeit with his signature light touch), Sakurai warns folks that making games isn't always fun and games.
Down with Lag!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoKKyskco4
In a segment called "grab bag," Sakurai talks about miscellaneous topics: this one deals with response time and input delay in a more digestible, less technical format. It also has a nice little anecdote about how he was shocked at the amount of lag during a live Nintendo game demonstration!

Reported on by NickALive! (via ResetEra and TheGamer), a choice quote has been spotted in the September 2022 edition of Toy World Magazine. On page 170, under the 'Paramount Consumer Products & Experiences' section, the very last line says that Paramount, who is the parent company of Nickelodeon, "will launch a brand-new original Triple-A game in 2023" based on the Heroes in Half Shells.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The City of Steel
Fallout 76 Season 10 has been revealed, and it'll debut alongside the massive upcoming update for The Pitt on September 13.
As usual, the "seasonal" approach is mostly a high-level aesthetic sheen on the modern season pass, complete with a reward track. Bethesda says this will be the "first time ever" that you can unlock gear crafting recipes, which is sure to ruffle some feathers. For the most part though, Season 10 is business as usual. The 100-ish rank system is still in place, but this time the rewards are themed around the rust-filled Pitt locale.
Here's the full description from the team:
"Enjoy the city of the future, brought to you by Red Rocket, as you accrue S.C.O.R.E. and progress through 100 ranks of rewards. Unlock new gear and cosmetics as well as tons of currency to spend, including Atoms, Caps and even Stamps to trade for new Expedition-related goods. Fallout 1st members can unlock even more in Season 10, including exclusive rewards and even bonus S.C.O.R.E. boosts that last throughout the Season for active members!"

While the setup isn't that exciting, it does come with the Pitt update itself, which can be played while ignoring the season pass system wholesale. And of course, playing it at any point after the addition of The Pitt will include all of the iterative content released so far after the underwhelming launch. For folks that have avoided it thus far: the prospect of randomly playing it on Game Pass one weekend keeps getting more enticing.
Here's the full schedule for the Fallout 76 Season 10 lead-in, as well as beyond:
September 1 – 6: Scrip Surplus Weekend
September 8 – 12: Legendary Purveyor Sale (up to 25% off) AND Double Mutations Weekend
September 13: The Pitt & Season 10 launch
September 22 – 26: Double Mutations Weekend
September 29 – October 3: Scrip Surplus Weekend, Gold Rush Weekend, AND Minerva’s Big Sale

We heard back in June that Red Art Games' upcoming release, OmegaBot, would be landing on Switch in September (much like every other game in the world!). However, today the studio has reached out to say that the game is being pushed back to a release on January 20th 2023.
In its statement, Red Art Games states that the reason for the delay is to ensure that OmegaBot is released in the most polished state possible — something that we are sure will only benefit the final product. The studio was also quick to add that the game will be receiving a physical Switch release as well as digital, so we are hoping for some lovely cover art to match the game's signature colourful aesthetic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DC Fandome, the virtual fan convention showcasing DC movies, TV shows, and, of course, video games, will not take place this year, Warner Bros. Discovery confirms. 
The first DC Fandome took place in 2020, serving as a livestream alternative to in-person conventions in the wake of the pandemic. It featured virtual panels with celebrities and filmmakers that provided new announcements, trailers, and early looks at all things DC media. In terms of video games, the 2020 and 2021 editions gave us substantial new looks at Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. 
In a statement to Popverse, Warner Bros. Discovery explains the decision by writing:
Fandome’s cancellation is an unfortunate blow in the ongoing transition resulting from April’s Warner Bros./Discovery merger. Although only two years old, Fandome has found great success, generating millions of views. Last year's show was highlighted by new trailers for The Batman, Black Adam, and The Flash. Unfortunately, the DC film slate has largely been flipped on its head since then as several projects have been delayed (Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Shazam! Fury of the Gods), in limbo (The Flash), or canceled (Batgirl). 
While we won't see them during DC's big event, Gotham Knights launches on October 21, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League arrives sometime in 2023.

As a total freshman to the series, I was a little intimidated by the prospect of sinking my feet into the trenches of a dense strategy bonanza, especially as things kicked off with a literal history lesson.
But after watching and absorbing one of the game's early missions, I can genuinely say that I'd be confident enough to give it a go when it comes out. Even perhaps, confident enough to say that I'd genuinely enjoy it quite a bit as a total newbie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh my goodness, what a creepy, funny, and odd game Northern Journey is. I almost don't want to say any more about it, not because it can be spoiled but because it seems appropriately respectful. Not in a reverent sense, you understand. It just feels like such a world should be preserved, even slightly feared, rather than trampled on by some idiot with a camera in her face.
To call Northern Journey "retro" would completely misrepresent it. It's beautiful in an ugly, desolate way reminiscent of Kenshi or Morrowind. It's translucent in its exposition but not obtuse, hostile, or obnoxiously hard. It's a bit clunky, without that ever undermining the experience. It's vaguely amateurish, yet almost consciously so, like a painter who knows their talent and intent is enough to overcome any technical flaws. This is a bloody treat and I'm so glad I got to play it.

The initial rollout of Sonic Frontiers information was messy, to say the least. After a series of confusing videos that didn't exactly showcase the game in the best light, we finally got a look at Cyber Space, and a glimpse into the narrative. This Sonic Frontiers overview trailer (which reiterates the November 8 release date) basically compiles all of that into one digestible package.
Clocking in at roughly three minutes, this new video from the Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube account is actually pretty helpful! It starts at the literal beginning, with Sonic, Amy, and Tails chilling, before they're "sucked into a dimensional portal to Cyber Space, then ends up on the Starfall Islands." It then moves into a mechanical perspective, talking up its open world (which it calls "open-zone platforming") and "the freedom to play the game in the order that matches your playstyle." A slight overview of the combat system and in-game puzzles are also touched on.
There's also a crucial part that actually talks about how critical path story progress is made. You'll defeat bosses to earn "Portal Gears," which in turn unlock Cyber Space stages. Once you finish challenges therein, you'll then earn keys that can be used to unlock Chaos Emerald vaults to "progress farther in the game." That seems to be the loop!
Hopefully that can last for —I'm going to guess — 10-15 hours, and beyond? Either way, they should have led with some of these videos (especially Cyber Space) out of the gate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unearthed Treasure
Tokyo Game Show is yet to officially get underway, but already it seems that some of its surprises are just too durn exciting to keep under wraps. According to a new leak uncovered by Gematsu, legendary shmup developer Treasure is getting set to reveal a new project under the banner of one of its best-loved IPs, Radiant Silvergun.
Gematsu found evidence of a new Radiant Silvergun title after poking around the TGS website uploaded by publisher Happinet. Alongside assets and titles pulled from over 30 franchises was a brand new logo simply depicting "Radiant Silvergun," complete with a silhouette of the game's iconic starship. Treasure, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, will apparently be showcasing the new title at this year's TGS, which will no doubt get retro game fans and shmup aficionados into a suitable tizzy.
Radiant Silvergun was released in Japanese arcades in May 1998, before finding its way onto the Sega Saturn in the console's twilight years. For the longest of times, it would remain something of an urban legend among western players, available only via expensive imports and poor early-day emulation. The classy shmup would eventually be ported to Xbox 360 in 2011, which represented the title's first, readily available, global release. Today, Radiant Silvergun still stands proud, holding a deserved reputation as a genuine classic of the genre.
What form this project will take remains to be seen, but I would think a remaster or remake is more likely than a sequel. In either case, we won't have to wait too much longer to find out, as Tokyo Game Show will kick off September 15, emanating from Chiba's Makuhari Messe complex. We will bring you all of the details from Radiant Silvergun (and many other TGS exclusives) right here on Destructoid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another indie developer has come forward publicly with allegations that UK-based publishers PQube have withheld money from them. Thai dev team Corecell claim they’ve only seen some of the minimum guaranteed money agreed when they signed the European console publishing rights to their action-puzzle game AeternoBlade 2 over to PQube in 2019. 

Corecell say they attempted to resolve things with PQube but that didn’t work, and they had to terminate the publishing agreement in 2020. Since then, Corecell have tried to regain the rights to AeternoBlade 2 from PQube to no avail. Corecell allege that PQube did offer to return the rights to the game, but only if they would agree to keep the situation secret.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll take a gamble on it
Mario Kart Tour gacha is no more, at least come "late September," according to a new update from the game's official Twitter account.
Here's the full rundown:
"Here's a peek at #MarioKartTour's update coming late September! Battle mode will be added, along with a Spotlight Shop, where you can exchange rubies for drivers, karts, and gliders! Also, pipes you can fire by using rubies will be removed. See the notification for details."

So checking out that notification on the app, it seems as if "new drivers, karts, and gliders, as well as drivers, karts, and gliders that have appeared in the past, will be available." This "Spotlight Shop" system will likely work similarly to the Fornite (and company) spotlight shops, which only showcase a few things to buy at a time, in a bid to get you to keep checking out the storefront and buy something before it leaves. The in-game update also says "lots of other things are in the works too."
Obviously, a lot of games still have gacha elements, and clearly (in addition to this primarily being a business decision rather than some gift on high) this helps Nintendo enter into markets that don't currently allow it. But for folks who didn't like the gambling element of Mario Kart Tour gacha, it's a win.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Statistically, there’s a good chance you clicked onto this page with a Logitech G502 mouse. Between its Proteus Spectrum and refreshed Hero models, the G502 has sold boatloads, and was voted as RPS readers’ favourite gaming mouse in both 2019 and 2021. Not undeservedly either, as it’s sat atop our best gaming mouse rankings for years. Making more drastic improvements to it wouldn’t therefore seem like a pressing priority, but Logitech have had a crack regardless with the new G502 X series.


There’s a trio of redesigned rodents in this family: the standard G502 X I’ve got on review here, the wireless G502 X Lightspeed, and the G502 X Plus, which is essentially the G502 X Lightspeed with added RGB lighting. Since prices max out at £150 / $160 for the G502 X Plus, the two Lightspeed-equipped mice could be less expensive alternatives to Razer’s new DeathAdder V3 Pro and Basilisk V3 Pro – but as the cheapest and most direct successor the G502 Hero, it’s the G502 X that’s likely to see the most desk action. Does it deserve to?

For the uninitiated, Night City Wire is basically like CDPR's version of a Nintendo Direct, except the showcases are specifically focused on Cyberpunk 2077. They were quite prevalent in the leadup to the release of Cyberpunk 2077, but now, with it nearing two years old, Night City Wire has grown to be rarer. The next one airs on Sept. 6 at 8 a.m. PT/11 a.m. ET, though, and will be "about our upcoming anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners and what's next for Cyberpunk 2077."
Choooom! There's something new on the horizon – a special episode of Night City Wire!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First impressions can be interesting. I didn’t know what to expect when I met David Ventura at the Backbeat booth, after a long opening day of the weekend-long Japanese indie gaming event BitSummit. I knew of his work - now the CEO of his self-founded studio Ichigoichie with developers based both in Japan and Sweden, Ventura has had his hands in a number of highly-influential rhythm games over the course of his career. This includes work on Gitaroo Man and Elite Beat Agents during his time in Japan at iNiS, having worked at the studio for a decade before moving to Sweden to work outside of games on educational music software. In 2018 he returned to games by founding Ichigoichie (stylised as 151A). Their first game, Hexagroove, blended strategy, rhythm and educational tools for a game that captured the building blocks of being a DJ.


Ventura was at BitSummit to showcase the successor to this game, Backbeat. It’s a bit of a departure from much of his past work, acting more like a puzzle game with a musical soul, albeit one where the act of creating and playing music together is imbued into every solution. As the crowd began to leave the bustling convention hall for the day, I went to the booth for one last demo, and the chance to speak to the person behind it all… who was sat at his demo kiosk playing the keytar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The city that nevers sleeps.
These days, it feels like deckbuilding elements are finding their way into all kinds of roguelikes, but it’s not too often that you see new releases purely built around card games. City Wars: Tokyo Reign is one of those rare releases, and we’re pleased to report that it presents an interesting and unique take on CCG gameplay. There may be some minor rough edges to the experience, but it overall manages to provide an addictive and engrossing experience fans of card games won’t want to miss.
The cyberpunk narrative here plays second fiddle to the mechanics as you fight your way through a series of procedurally generated city districts to defeat ne'er-do-wells and reign supreme. Battles play out across a two-phase setup, alternating endlessly between the two until either you or your opponent dies. The first phase has each of you taking a few turns to lay cards out on your respective sides of the track, while the second phase consists of chronologically executing the effects of those cards. Each tick on the track represents one unit of time, and cards with a higher ‘duration’ will thus take up more ticks. Cards placed the farthest to the left will be the ones that are played first, so before you’re even considering any of the stats or effects of a card, you first need to consider both where you can fit it on the track and how early or late you want it to activate in the execution phase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Avalanche and Warner Bros. Interactive have released a new Hogwarts Legacy featurette that dives deep into the design of the titular school. It also features the first-ever look at the four house common rooms in Hogwarts Legacy, a sneak peek of some of the easter eggs in the game, and more. 
This new featurette runs more than four minutes long and gives players the most in-depth look at the actual school of Hogwarts in this game thus far. As noted in the video, the design of Hogwarts is based on the eight Harry Potter movies and the books written by controversial author J.K. Rowling, who will undoubtedly be making money from the sales of this game. 
Check out the featurette for yourself below: 


As you can see, Hogwarts is looking great, as are the four common rooms. What’s especially interesting is it gives viewers a look at the Hufflepuff common room, which has rarely been seen on screen in the wizarding world, as pointed out in the video. 
What’s more, the featurette also contains information about linking your WB Games account to your Harry Potter Fan Club account. Doing so will automatically bring your Fan Club wand into the game alongside your Hogwarts house, which can be determined on the Fan Club’s site through a special sorting quiz. You’ll also unlock some in-game rewards for doing so, too, including a special decorative house robe and a beaked skull mask. Check them out in the gallery below: 

For more, read about how Hogwarts Legacy has been delayed from 2022 to February 10, 2023, and then check out the unique PlayStation 5 DualSense features for Hogwarts Legacy. Watch this Hogwarts Legacy trailer from last week that showcases unforgivable curses and Sebastian Sallow’s Dark Legacy questline after that.

During the session, it was also confirmed by Blaze that the handheld will come bundled with 18 classic Capcom games - a handful of which have appeared on the likes of the NES and SNES - making a prospective purchase all the more tempting for Evercade fans and newcomers.

And, a security researcher has managed to use the adapter and Pokémon Crystal to take control of an opponent's Game Boy remotely.
In a chat with Vice's tech column Motherboard, Xcellerator shared his fascination with retro tech. So, with the annual Binary Golf Grand Prix — a competition to find "the smallest file which will crash a specific program" — Xcellerator wanted to use this adapter in his entry. Instead, what he ended up discovering was what he thinks is the very first case of 'remote code execution' (a hack where you can run any kind of code on a target device) using a Game Boy Color.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many archival and emulation projects are underway to preserve the wonderful history of Flash games, and best of all are those which try to recreate the original experience: just clicking a link then playing a game inside your browser. Now one unofficial Flash Player emulator is adding support for more classic games, ones made in the (relatively) newfangled ActionScript 3 language. So you can party like it's 2008 by heading over to Newgrounds and playing You Have To Burn The Rope again, as well as Wonderputt and a handful of others.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inti Creates have earned themselves a reputation in recent years, through titles like Blaster Master Zero and the Azure Striker Gunvolt series, of creating visually-intricate and technical 2D platformers. Their games scratch the nostalgic itch while not reverting to the technical problems and gameplay hurdles that we’ve long since moved beyond. Part of what makes Gunvolt appealing is that it refines and expands upon a formula we see in the Mega Man X series, and it’s a similar intent that defines the company’s approach to their latest project, Grim Guardians: Demon Purge.

The game’s campaign network co-op, season 3 of multiplayer, and Forge mode have been pushed back, and couch co-op outright cancelled. And if there’s one thing about Halo that you don’t mess with then it would seem that’s couch co-op.

In celebration of GoldenEye 007's 25th anniversary last month, a diehard Mario fan, known on YouTube as StupidMarioBros1Fan, sought to remake the game with Super Mario 64 characters at the helm. The result was fantastic — in a kind of deeply horrifying way — and the team has now dropped an update to the PC fan game which includes two new custom levels, an updated Peach's Castle design, and dialogue changes.
Shared on Twitter by GoldenEye world champion, @Graslu00, the playthrough video shows how the developers have transferred the title's signature gameplay into the Mario 64 level format. This time, instead of jumping on your enemies, you will have to contend with grenade-throwing Bob-ombs (presumably the equivalent to a human throwing a baby) and Koopas with machine guns. When we heard that the Mario movie would start shooting soon, this isn't what we expected.

A bundle of trouble is headed to Warner Bros. Games crossover fighter MultiVersus in just a few short days, as developer Player First Games has dropped a new teaser trailer that points to the arrival of Gizmo, the heroic little Mogwai from Joe Dante's 1984 hit, Gremlins.
A short teaser video sees the ancient, ornate chest that is Gizmo's home open up in response to the sound of cavorting mayhem, suggesting that the sweet lol' fuzzball is headed to MultiVersus in order to keep his arch nemesis, Stripe, in line. While details on Gizmo are very sparse at the time of writing, it is believed that he will be an individual character from Stripe, with his own moveset and abilities.

Nintendo has announced a handful of new updates coming to its mobile racing game, Mario Kart Tour, throughout September. But one big change — coming in October — is that the game will no longer have gacha elements, instead opting for what it's calling a 'Spotlight Shop'.
If you've ever used a capsule toy machine or a gachapon machine, then you have a pretty good idea of what gacha games are like. They entice you to spend in-game currency — which you can either earn by playing the game or get by spending real money — to buy random in-game items. Popular games that use gacha include Genshin Impact, Dragalia Lost (which is sadly closing down in November), Fire Emblem Heroes (which is Nintendo's most-popular mobile game) and Pokémon Masters EX.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As indie developers from Japan and around the world descended upon the former Japanese capital of Kyoto for Bitsummit 2022, some developers present at the event were showcasing their games a little closer to home. Having already been hyped up amongst Japanese games outlets for its unique visuals and inspirations from Japanese yokai and folk tales, Kitsune: The Journey Of Adashino was a rather hot ticket at the event, and with an English localisation and a release in 2023 or 2024 planned, it stands with the opportunity to shine a light on the Japanese indie gaming scene.


While it may perhaps be reductive to make a Studio Ghibli comparison to the game’s opening moments, the familiarity many have with those films compared to Japanese folklore makes the equivalence an easy one. My time with the demo was from a moment early in the game, when you’ve already set foot into this new world but don't have much knowledge about the yokai-infested supernatural surprises that await you.

Bandai Namco's Pac-Man World: Re-Pac has been a blast from the past for those of us that had a PlayStation growing up. So imagine being one of the people who worked on the original game, seeing all of your work on-screen, prettied up and refined — it's likely exciting! But for former Namco Hometek game designer Scott Rogers, he was only met with disappointment when he reached the end of the remake to find that he — and the rest of the team on the original — hadn't been credited.
Speaking to our friends over at Time Extension, Rogers said that crediting the original staff should be a "courtesy". Rogers also told Jason Weesner and Hardy LeBel — who also worked on the team — of this, and expressed his frustration, because crediting the original staff is "just the decent thing to do, right?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Made by skaters, for skaters.
Skateboarding games have had a resurgence in recent years, and it seems the Nintendo Switch could be getting one more in the near future.
Yet another rating has popped up, this time in Taiwan. As highlighted by Universo Nintendo (via GoNintendo), it's Session: Skate Sim. This title is due out later this month on Xbox, PlayStation and PC (currently Early Access), but there's been no official mention of a Switch release so far.

Unconventional controllers are one of my favorite gaming content niches. They're something I've enjoyed out of the corner of my eye for years, with my personal favorite being Rudeism's full-body goose costume/controller to play Untitled Goose Game. The Twitch streamers are back at it again, but this time the spotlight is on an Elden Ring streamer MissMakkaa, and her build that uses a dance pad peripheral as a controller.
Basically, she got one of those at-home dance pads you use for games like Dance Dance Revolution and hooked it up to Elden Ring, which is already a funny enough concept on its own. What's even more impressive, then, is that she's already beaten five of the game's bosses to date (thanks, Eurogamer), and she isn't stopping there.

As a 3D platformer fan who loves scooping up collectibles, Tinykin is such a breezy time.
Playing as a shrunken explorer in a gigantic bedroom with insect citizens just living their lives, you're constantly on the lookout for glowing bits of pollen to collect and new (Pikmin-like) tinykin creatures to command. For folks like me, it feels like a continuous brain massage. The game's sense of progression is so fast, you're usually just seconds away from finding something to pick up. It maintains this pace the whole way through its six-hour run. That is until you start nudging your way toward 100 percent completion.
Without spoiling anything, Tinykin has two main collectibles — pollen and tinykin — and there isn't a radar or ability to help sn…]]></summary>

This does not, though, preclude a game like Call of Duty from hitting PlayStation platforms. Spencer has previously stated that Microsoft does not intend to "pull communities away from that platform" if the deal goes through.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Press X
Sonic 2022 has a nice ring to it (ha), but according to Sonic producer Takashi Iizuka (who has worked on the series since Sonic 3), this year will be the "biggest year" for the character to date.
Speaking to Twinfinite, Iizuka elaborates on his claim:
"We believe that 2022 is going to be the biggest year for Sonic. We have a lot of great things that we’ve done this year and a lot of great things for the future as well. The success of movie two has been really amazing and it really brought a lot of people into the audience. So we thank everyone for enjoying movie two. We had the release of Sonic Origins right after that. We have the release of Sonic Frontiers coming up on November 8, and we also have the Netflix TV show, Sonic Prime, coming up this winter."

"The Netflix show" is none other than Sonic Prime, which is rumored to be out in December of this year (and the whole "winter" statement helps reconfirm that). That short list above also doesn't account for some other Sonic-related happenings, so let's recap them below.
What does 2022 have in store for Sonic?
Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (movie)
Sonic Origins
Sonic Frontiers
Sonic Prime (TV show)
Updates for Sonic Forces and Sonic Dash mobile, which are still in operation
More Sonic collabs in games like Roblox and Fall Guys
More merch collabs
Another Sonic Symphony concert in October
From a broader perspective, I can easily see what he's saying. Sonic Origins didn't have the best launch, and Frontiers really has an uphill battle to prove itself, especially after Forces. But if you count the wide success of the Sonic 2 film and add in a major Netflix series on the way, things get a little more exciting for Sonic fans as a whole.

Deadly Night (PC)
Developer: Cubyte Games
Publisher: Torture Star Video
Released: September 2, 2022
MSRP: TBA

Deadly Night follows Carol after she’s dropped off at a motel. I’m sure it isn’t difficult to guess that she’s in for a bad time. What is interesting is that you have some control over what kind of bad time you have. Regardless of what you choose, though, Carol eventually winds up in the basement of a creepy house.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[They're available until September 6 at 6PM PT
More Kirby icons are now live for Nintendo's Switch Online reward system, with a new suite from Kirby's Dream Buffet.
As you may recall, Dream Buffet dropped in a low-key manner a few weeks ago for $15 on the eShop. Given the relatively short amount of time from its announcement to launch, a lot of folks were confused as to what the game even was and/or if it was free-to-play. Much to the delight of many, it ended up being a fully premium game with no microtransactions, and a host of unlocks. If the online functionality is shored up, it could become even more enticing as a longer-term party game.
Either way, the Dream Buffet subseries is now in full swing, and these Switch icons prove it. While they're mostly Kirby (the character) related, they're also showing off multiple iterations of the Puffball, akin to all the alternate versions of Yoshi in games like Mario RPG or Yoshi's Island/Super Mario World. On top of that, you can pick up Dream Buffet's version of an item block (like Mario Party), as well as an icon for Elfilin from Kirby and the Forgotten Land. You can pick them up from now through September 6 at 6PM PT.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

With Tokyo Game Show 2022 bearing down on us, publishers on both sides of the Pacific are preparing to drop a fresh round of updates and reveals from their upcoming catalogs. NIS America is the latest to tease an upcoming showcase, which will take place on the morning of Wednesday, September 7.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuokBsXyLSI
While the publisher did not drop any hints as to which titles and localization it will bring to the party, we can expect to see no less than four new game announcements. NIS America is obviously notable for its standard practice of localizing Japanese releases and bundling together classic JRPGs for modern platforms. But we'll simply have to wait and see what the publisher has up its sleeve for 2023.
The NIS America Showcase will premiere on the official NIS America YouTube channel, on September 7, at 08:00 PT / 11:00 ET / 16:00 BST. The stream will be followed by an aftershow, which will feature chats with developers, as well as a competition to win a one-of-a-kind artwork reproduction taken from one of the day's revealed titles. We will, as always, bring you all of the exciting details right here on Destructoid.
NIS America's next release is the compendium Prinny Presents NIS Classics Vol 3, which compiles the quirky releases La Pucelle: Ragnarok and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure. It launches on Nintendo Switch tomorrow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[They're out in Free Title Update 2
More Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak quality of life updates are on the way, according to a new tweet from Capcom.
The tweets showcase a change to shortcut loadouts, which will increase the threshold of the mechanic to eight slots in all. We'll also be getting a long-awaited "lock" mechanic, which will let you sidestep accidentally selling or crafting armor pieces you don't want to get rid of. This has been a thing for many years in many high-profile games with inventory management, and it's very much welcome with Rise.
Note that this is all coming in the next major Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak update. Title Update 2 will arrive in "late September," and we'll likely get full confirmation soon, including a stream to show it off. Capcom has been running a thankfully predictable and effective hype campaign for these updates.
As a reminder, Title Update 1 already arrived on August 10 on both PC and Nintendo Switch. This is in addition to regular patches, which are separate from content-heavy title updates, and typically focus on bugs. In other words, the team has been pretty busy! All of this work is clearly translating into sales, as Sunbreak alone (not to mention the success of Rise) is climbing Capcom's Platinum Title (million-seller) list week after week.

However, the microphones I'd like to focus on today are those popular options, specifically the Blue Snowball Ice and the Blue Yeti X. These represent the top and the bottom of the Blue spectrum when it comes to gaming-friendly USB mics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gonna be a borstal breakout
Fans of those schoolyard roustabouts, the River City Girls, will be pleased to hear that the pugilistic duo's series debut, River City Girls Zero, will be making its impact felt on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox this month, following on from its release on Nintendo Switch back in March of this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpJ-UYq9T1k
As a quick cram session, River City Girls Zero is a revamped remaster of the 1994 Super Famicom title Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka, which is the first title in the Kunio-kun franchise to introduce Kyoko and Misako as playable characters. WayForward's remaster sees the scrolling brawler officially localized for the west for the very first time, while sporting a freshly translated script, new manga cutscenes, and an amusing intro song by River City Girls series composer Megan McDuffee.
As a game... welllll... it has to be said that time has not been too kind to Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka, which was already quite dated by brawler standards even in 1994. But, as a little piece of franchise history, it's still nice to see the long-lost title get some time in the spotlight. This release, of course, will also serve as an appetizer to WayForward's long-awaited sequel River City Girls 2, which will be gracing us with its presence at some point later in 2022.
River City Girls Zero launches on PlayStation and Xbox platforms September 13, with PC (Steam) to follow on September 22. It is available right now on Nintendo Switch. Be sure to check out our thoughts on the remaster right here, along with our recent interview with Megan McDuffee!

At the beginning of last month, we were blown away by the amount of fun that we had getting to grips with Two Point Campus — earning the game a top-of-the-class 9/10 in our review. It is therefore with great joy that we spotted Two Point Studios' announcement that the game has now amassed over one million players worldwide.
It is true that this total is representative of players across all consoles, so yes, we assume that this also includes Xbox Game Pass. But a total of one million players in under a month for an indie developer is nothing to be scoffed at.

Years back, the concept of "early access games on Nintendo platforms" sounded silly, but here we are with Disney Dreamlight Valley arriving on the platform on September 6. As a reminder, it's described as a "hybrid between a life-sim and an adventure game rich with quests, exploration, and engaging activities featuring Disney and Pixar friends, both old and new." Naturally, it will have some early access kinks to work out, and maybe even some Switch-specific hardware issues to patch, so keep an eye on that one as you would any early access game.
Ooblets is the other big release, which feels like it's been in early access for two years: because it has! That's out today. LEGO Brawls (September 2), Here Comes Niko (today), and JoJo's Bizarre Adv…]]></summary>

September is already setting up to be a packed month for game releases. Lego Brawls, Temtem, Splatoon 3, Return to Monkey Island, The DioField Chronicle... the list goes on. But despite the fact that our micro SD cards are already dropping a belt loop to make way for all of this upcoming content, we couldn't help but get excited about just one more title.
Haiku the Robot is an adorable 2D pixel Metroidvania which looks as if it has stepped right out of a Game Boy cartridge. Sort of like Pixar's WALL.E but with much more hacking robots to pieces with an oversized sword, the game will see you control Haiku as you attempt to navigate a world bereft of all life after a nuclear explosion. See? Just like WALL.E.

The Beasts of Burden is the third in the series, following after The Isle Dragon Roars and The Forsaken Maiden. This is a standalone experience though, so no need to worry about missing the plot.

James Bond aficionados eager to dive back into his video game adventures may have to showcase the steel-nerved patience of 007 himself. A recent financial report from developer IO Interactive appears to suggest that the previously teased Project 007 may still be some years away from receiving its release date.
As noted on Twitter by DarkDetective, the report notes that the Hitman developer is on track for a relatively successful fiscal year — predicting revenue in the region of $65 million USD — but that the company is bracing itself for at least two further years of decreased profit, due to a lack of any new releases and extended production periods. By proxy, this would suggest that although the Danish dev might already be hard at work on the untit…]]></summary>

Conradical Games' The Outbound Ghost has been haunting our thoughts ever since it was confirmed to be coming to Switch, and we might not have too long to wait. Merge Games has confirmed it's working on a physical release of the turn-based RPG, heavily inspired by Paper Mario, and we should be able to pick up a box of this ghostly adventure on 25th November.
Developer Conradical Games shared a launch trailer for the game yesterday — which is hovering over to PC via Steam, Epic, and GOG on 21st September. As for an eShop release, all we know so far is "later in 2022", but if that 25th November physical date is true, then we imagine we'll be seeing it before then.

        <updated>2022-09-01T17:26:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After growing to become one of the most-leaked games in franchise history, Ubisoft has confirmed that Assassin's Creed Mirage is real and we'll be learning more about it next week.
That's because the publisher is hosting a Ubisoft Forward on Sept. 10 at Noon P.T./3 p.m. ET, which has been previously advertised as the event where we'll learn more about the future of Assassin's Creed and more. It seems Assassin's Creed Mirage will be the big highlight of the show, but it's possible we learn more about Assassin's Creed Infinity, which is Ubisoft's in-development Assassin's Creed live-service platform. We might even learn about non-Assassin's Creed games, too. 
Assassin's Creed Mirage is the next Assassin's Creed game.

September 1, 2022
If rumors and leaks about Assassin's Creed Mirage are correct, we're in for a game set in Baghdad with Basim, a major character from Assassin's Creed Valhalla (if you know, you know), as the protagonist. Leaks indicate that he's not yet an assassin at the start of Mirage and instead, a thief who comes to discover the Hidden Ones, which later become the Assassin's order in the series. Rumors also point to this game being a much more stripped back take on the franchise, feeling more like older games in the series rather than the massive and sprawling open-world RPGs of late.
The potential for this to feel like a bridge between classic Assassin's Creed and new Assassin's Creed has me incredibly excited. I love the new games, especially Origins and Odyssey, but they're downright exhausting. An Assassin's Creed game I can beat in less than 80 hours? Sign me up!
In the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of every Assassin's Creed game and then catch up on everything announced during the Assassin's Creed 15th Anniversary Celebration stream that aired earlier this summer. 
Are you excited about Mirage? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

The best-selling Switch game of the week is SD Gundam Battle Alliance, a multiplayer action RPG set in the hugely popular Gundam universe.

The Pokémon Company is suing six Chinese companies over a mobile game that shares stark similarites to the Pokémon franchise itself, citing copyright infringement and unfair competition behaviour, as reported by South China Morning Post (thanks, GamesIndustry,biz).
The Japanese giant, owned by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures, is seeking damages of 500 million yuan (US$72.5 million) and requesting that the offending companies issue public apologies on Chinese websites and mobile apps. Naturally, it is also demanding that the game in question - Pocket Monster Reissue, or Koudaiyaoguai Fuke in Chinese - be removed from sale alongside all promotional material.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say hello to the newest addition to the Paldea region
Following several posts teasing the news, we're seeing the newest addition to the Paldea region. Grafaiai is a new Pokemon debuting in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.
Grafaiai is categorized as the "Toxic Monkey" Pokemon. It's naturally a Poison/Normal Type, and is pretty tiny.
According to the Pokemon page, Grafaiai is a moody Pokemon with a "fastidious" disposition. It's a bit of a loner, and usually gets caught up in territorial fights with other Pokemon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yrrF83tnY0
Grafaiai is nocturnal, and covers its hands in poison to mark patterns on trees as part of securing its territory. This poisonous saliva can paralyze Bug Pokemon, which Grafaiai can then collect up. Better keep your Butterfree away from it!
The saliva can change color based on what Grafaiai eats, and becomes concentrated when the little guy senses danger. I'm guessing by the name that Grafaiai is based on an Aye-Aye, which also forages for food and has incredibly long fingers.

Another addition to Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
This adds to the list of new Pokemon arriving in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. Alongside the Pokemon Grafaiai, we've also seen newcomers like Lechonk and Fidough, who both overtook the internet with their adorable designs.
While Grafaiai doesn't seem to have the same ability to accost social media's attention, I think it's a neat design. And hey, another painter Pokemon to hang out with Smeargle.
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are due to arrive on November 18 for the Nintendo Switch, with a host of features in tow. From riding a Legendary Pokemon as a bike to co-op adventures, it certainly seems like a very different Pokemon journey. Hopefully we'll see some more new Pokemon, and maybe even some neat new regional variants for Paldea, in the run-up to November.

        <updated>2022-09-01T15:18:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a new blog post, Xbox head Phil Spencer discussed Microsoft’s intentions for Activision Blizzard’s IPs following its ongoing acquisition of the company. Among those plans, naturally, is to bolster the value of Xbox Game Pass by adding Activision Blizzard’s library of titles, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, and Diablo.
Spencer discusses expanding player choice through Game Pass by offering library titles for an affordable subscription fee, appealing to players of various budgets. Spencer hopes that including Activision Blizzard games will make the service more appealing to existing and potential subscribers. 
Spencer also reiterates Microsoft’s promise to keep popular Activision Blizzard franchises multiplatform, citing its handling of Minecraft as an example. Additionally, the company hopes to expand Activision’s portfolio to mobile platforms and make them available to play on other devices via cloud streaming. 
Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard is projected to be completed sometime during the summer of 2023. After that, it's anyone’s guess as to how long it will be before we see these franchises land on Game Pass. On the Blizzard side, Overwatch 2 launches in free-to-play early access on October 4, and Diablo IV is seemingly years away. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II releases in October, but the series will reportedly skip 2023, meaning the first entry under the Microsoft banner won't be until 2024 at the earliest.

Set in a dystopian future straight out of the cocaine haze of the 1970s, Rollerdrome takes two of gaming’s most cherished pastimes—pulling off sick combos and murder—and mashes them up into an audacious spectacle that is definitely not Norman Jewison’s Rollerball. Taking control of mysterious rookie Kara Hassan, it’s skate or die for players as you’ll have to grab, grind, flip and twist your way to high-score combos while gunning down enemies hellbent on stopping you. Kara clearly has the skills to be the next Rollerdrome champion, but with the corporation behind the sport plotting against her, she’ll have to use every trick in the book to survive.
Again, this is not Norman Jewison’s Rollerball. With most of the social commentary pushed to the background in f…]]></summary>

Later in that same year, the studio revealed Deathpool, a second original character that imagined what a child of Deadpool and Death would look and act like.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) began the preliminary stage of their investigation at the beginning of July, with a deadline set for September 1st. That initial stage of investigation found that the deal could “substantially lessen competition in gaming consoles, multi-game subscription services, and cloud gaming services”.

The cheerful game blends monster collecting (the Ooblets), farming simulation, and light town management as you restore a wacky village to its former glory. Though an overall laid-back experience, there’s a lot of spinning plates involved, and it can take time to figure out how to maximize each day to keep your farm brimming with valuable crops, your roster full of different Ooblets, and your wallet stretched with Gummies (the game’s currency). That’s where I come in. I’ve spent many hours playing the final version of the game, and I’d like to offer some helpful tips to make your early hours in Badgetown as enjoyable and efficient as possible.

And when more Sons of the Forest footage was revealed the following year (2021), my excitement level reached an all-time high. Sadly, the sequel has been delayed again, but the devs seem confident in the horror survival game's early 2023 release period.  
Hey Everyone,

August 31, 2022
Endnight Games' post on Twitter (seen above) says, in recent months, an exact drop date has been hard to pinpoint, but the newfound scope led to the team's hard decision:
Based on trailers, Sons of the Forest is the studio's most ambitious title yet, with a vast open world, a new AI companion, updated visuals, and multiple warring factions scattered throughout the landscape. It looks to be even more brutal and terrifying than the last game, and I can't wait to get my hands on it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stories always came first for the team at NOVECT. The critical and commercial success of The House In Fata Morgana surprised many upon the title’s international release, including the developers themselves. Headlines were made when the game shot temporarily to the spot of most critically-acclaimed game of all time on Metacritic, despite being still relatively under the radar beforehand. Fata Morgana first released to the public in Japan in 2012, and gained a cult following before its eventual successful international release. The reason for it's acclaim? Storytelling. Every single review praised Fata Morgana's surprising and enthralling twists and turns as what made this visual novel a must-play title, even for non-fans of the genre.


At the time development started, NOVECT were less a development studio, and more of a group of univeristy friends with minimal coding experience but a love for telling stories; a hobby project run by friends on the side of university and normal jobs inside and out of the games industry, only becoming a fully-fledged studio later down the line. Fast forward to today, NOVECT are a firmly-established indie developer with games and multimedia adaptations of their work under their belt, and new project still mysteriously known as "Project Code Name 'M'" now in the works. Originally starting development in 2019 and announced earlier this year, Project M had its first public demo at this month’s Bitsummit indie gaming showcasing in Kyoto.

There were Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing memes aplenty in the run up to release, with players hungry to customise their own cosy piece of Hydaelyn.


Meant as a casual mode to relax away from dungeons and grinding levels, Island Sanctuary has no Job level limitations and can be enjoyed by anyone. Even though you can craft your own buildings and gather materials, you don’t need to have played any gathering or crafting classes. With a base to customise, crops to tend to and a pasture full of animals to pet, it’s easy to see why comparisons were drawn to other farming games such as Stardew Valley.

In it, you'll see him control Anita, one of the game's many playable characters, as she searches for her partner in the small town of Sardinia, Italy.
Unfortunately for Anita, it's not a great time to be in the town because of some strange ritualistic things happening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightdive's remake of 1994 classic System Shock hasn't had the smoothest development run, first having some money issues in its Kickstarter a while back, then having to reboot itself with twenty-twenty-something release dates chucked out there more as hopeful concepts than assurances. 
Having gone hands-on with a short 20-minute-ish demo of the game at this year's Gamescom, I can confirm that the remake is real and seems faithful to the original despite some heavy tinkers in the modernisation station. For nostalgic fans it should make for an exciting revisit to cyberspace, but I'm unsure whether it'll land quite as well for newcomers seeking a showdown with Shodan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've got a pretty good line in interesting folk traditions here at RPS. I grew up in a county where staying up all night at the stone circle to welcome the Summer Solstice was an annual tradition (later augmented by a woman wearing antlers offering a selection of downers and hallucinogens), and as a child I had an unnecessary encounter with the Salisbury Hob-Nob. For the past few years Alice0 has gone to the Burryman's Parade, gracing us with pictures of that most wholesome gentleman. Rural traditions are fun if you're part of them, but to outsiders they can be unsettling at best. 
This is relevant to my thinking about Saturnalia, an upcoming survival horror game by Italian studio Santa Ragione, where a small group of outsiders try to escape a village on the night of an ancient ritual. I've been playing a preview build of Saturnalia for the last week or so, and also got to talk about it with the studio director Pietro Righi Riva. "I usually tell people, 'Oh, you should make a game in like six months', and I have tried to do that in the past," he tells me. "This one just kind of got out of hand. I found an email yesterday, as I was looking for finishing the credits, about me discussing some story items in April 2017." And, while I am sure that most developers don't wish they'd been making a video game in the middle of the pandemic, I think the extra time may have allowed Santa Ragione to make something excellent.

Accessibility Options
The Last of Us Part I comes with Naughty Dog's full suite of accessibility options. And that's something worth commending. This comes in the shape of fully customizable controls, a host of visual aids, options to alleviate motion sickness, help with navigating levels, options for the deaf or hard-of-hearing, and combat accessibility.

In 2013, I was 19 and still practicing the unfortunate act of pre-ordering video games before I knew if they were good or not. As misfortune had it, it came out while I was out of town, but my Dad went and picked it up from our local GameStop for me. Like an absolute dork, I remember spending weeks looking at the picture of the box he sent me, practically counting the nanoseconds until I could play it myself. 
And when I did, it was everything I could've hoped. I was admittedly a less savvy media viewer back then and truly believed its story was unlike anything else. I don't think that's true anymore – it pretty shamelessly borrows from Cormac McCarthy's The Road, No Country F…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stranded: Alien Dawn is Haemimont Games’ second sci-fi sim on the trot, and despite being set on a planet that actually has air this time, it could well make Surviving Mars’ well-funded colony building feel like an afternoon playing with Lego. In Stranded, as I saw from a hands-off preview at Gamescom 2022, you’re certainly not planetside by choice, having crash-landed on an uncharted world with just four surviving astronauts left to scavenge, hunt and build their way towards something resembling a life.


“Like RimWorld”, I thought to myself upon hearing the pre-demo pitch, and subsequently wrote in my notes four separate times before ceasing to bother. If only mere words could convey just how much “like RimWorld” Stranded: Alien Dawn is – other 3D-ified clones exist, like last year’s Going Medieval, but here, even the exact spaceship-wrecking premise matches that of Ludeon Studios' seminal survival sim.

Just today, Chinese developer-publisher NetEase announced it was acquiring Detroit: Become Human dev Quantic Dream, and now, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Tencent have increased their stakes in From Software, the prolific developer behind the Dark Souls series and this year’s mega-hit, Elden Ring. 
This news comes from Gematsu, which posted a press release from Kadokawa Corporation, the parent company behind From Software. It says that through third-party allotment, Sixjoy Hong Kong, a Tencent Holdings subsidiary, has purchased 16.25% of From Software’s shares, while SIE has acquired 14.09%. Despite this, Kadokawa Corporation is still the largest shareholder of From Software, holding 69.66% of the shares.

But in a surprising turn of events, I left thinking the game was a real highlight of my time in Cologne's multi-hall maze of excellent people and overpriced schnitzel.
And most importantly, the guns didn't annoy me at all! In fact, their craic contributed a great deal to my enjoyment of the strangest FPS I've played in a while - one where I was forever grinning at the screen like an idiot. If you're a fan of Rick And Morty from before it got weird to be a fan of Rick And Morty (or Squanch Games' back catalogue, or general bizarro laughs), this is one for the wishlist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most 'realistic graphics' mods make games look worse, but that's not the case with NaturalVision Evolved. The long-in-development Grand Theft Auto 5 mod is a comprehensive revamp of lighting, textures, models and much more, but it remains faithful to the art direction of the base game. 

You can now download a Single Player Beta of the mod - and even if you don't plan on doing that, it's worth watching the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[God of War Ragnarök is set to conclude the Norse era of the series, a saga that’s seen Kratos atone for his troubling past by becoming a more conscientious god and (mildly) affectionate father. In the upcoming sequel, Kratos and Atreus must stave off a preordained catastrophe, calling on old and new friends to succeed against Asgard and, hopefully, prevent all-out war.  
I spoke with God of War veteran and newly appointed director Eric Williams as well as some lead UX, combat, and level designers about their experience crafting the long-awaited sequel and the most significant changes coming to the action and exploration loops. Moreover, you’ll learn about Kratos’ tools/toys, a never-before-seen dwarven realm that feels lived in, the unprecedented number of accessibility features available …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get your shovels ready because Shovel Knight Dig will burrow its way onto Switch, PC, and iOS via Apple Arcade next month. 
More specifically, the exciting Shovel Knight follow-up/spin-off title will hit those platforms on Sept. 23. What's more is that if you have an Apple Arcade subscription, you can play the game for free. It'll cost $24.99 on Switch and on Steam, however.
This news was revealed in a comical trailer released by Yacht Club Games, which you can watch for yourself below: 


"When Drill Knight and his dastardly digging crew blast apart Shovel Knight's peaceful campsite and steal his loot, he grabs his trusty Shovel Blade and starts tunneling after them," a press release reads. "But as he and Shield Knight soon discover, this adventure goes much deeper than a simple heist."
"Meet new friends and foes, visit strange lands, and outfit yourself in your quest to keep the entire land from collapsing underfoot. Jump, slash, and dig your way down an ever-changing chasm of mystery in Shovel Knight Dig, an all-new Shovel Knight adventure." 

While waiting to play Shovel Knight Dig on Sept. 23, read about Scrap Knight, a new character that will be featured in the game, and then watch the reveal trailer for the title.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The thrill of a card game is in the hand you get dealt. Luck can either be on your side, or you can earn it back by using your wits, carving out a victory you never thought possible. Other times, it all goes to pot and you get absolutely walloped, but hot damn if you didn't go down fighting. ORX has these moments in spades. Part deckbuilder, part roguelike and part tower defence, this is a real-time strategy game played by the seat of your pants, where a rolling deck of cards determines not only what kind of defences you can build, but also what buffs, spells and additional forces you can deploy to help defend your keep from the oncoming hordes. It's a gripping mix that's already claimed over a dozen hours of my time in recent weeks, and it's a number I can only see going up and up and up as it continues to develop in early access.

The Samsung Odyssey Ark, for the unfamiliar, is a kind of all-in-one entertainment screen: a mammoth 55in Mini LED panel that can act as a desktop gaming monitor or living room TV, complete with honking great speakers and built-in support for all the big game streaming services so you can play on it without a PC or console. Unlike other monitors of this magnitude, it can also rotate into portrait mode, leaving the top curve towering over you like an unsympathetic Victorian headmaster. 


I actually enjoy a touch of design madness creeping into the occasional piece of PC gear, regardless of whether it can hang with the best gaming monitors that sensible people might buy. What I experienced with the Odyssey Ark, however, was a device that too often veered onto the wrong side of senseless – when it was even working properly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm going to level with you: I'm not a GSG player. I play strategy, sure, but grand strategy has always been a bit beyond me. I'm a fundamentally un-grand person; I spend most days dressed like a 14-year-old fan of Tony Hawk, I do not like olives or scallops, and I'm unable to predict the consequences of actions if they exist outside of, say, a 12 month timeframe. A game like Victoria 3, where the whole point is making decisions that have country-wide effects and outcomes years in the future, is essentially operating in a different language to any I understand.
I'm trying to learn new languages, though, so it's not an unwelcome challenge. The problem is that previewing Victoria 3 is quite an advanced level to dive in, the Paradox GSG equivalent of being a live translator for a UN summit when you're only just about able to read the French version of The Famous Five. In a presentation before I and others were let loose on the better part of a week with the game, it was claimed that Victoria 3 is the best yet for onboarding newcomers, with a deep and detailed tutorial system. And to that I say: kinda. Luckily, the AI in Victoria 3 is so advanced it's better at playing the game than I am.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of all the games I saw at this year's Gamescom, sci-fi team-based shooter Hyenas easily claims the title of "Most Confusing Overall Experience". Bouncing between appointments in this sea of booths and lanyards was jarring, but I'd eventually settle in after a few minutes of reconfiguring my brain to whatever presentation or control scheme was placed in front of me. Hyenas never gave me a chance.
I sat in a 20-minute presentation of the game and tried my level best to understand SEGA's stab at a live-service FPS. Instead, I exited the booth with whiplash... and a sense of curiosity. Somewhere inside the game's insufferable tone is a kernel of cleverness, I just need to get my mitts on it to confirm my suspicions. Otherwise, it's very difficult to really understand whether it can survive in such a saturated space.

But I can tell you that Sonic Frontiers is the first entry in the series I’ve been looking forward to since the Dreamcast.  
For reference, the last time I was excited to play a 3D Sonic game, it was attached to the Dreamcast kiosk at my local target. And to be fair, the orca jumping over the racetrack in the Sonic Adventure demo was a great reason to bug my mom for a new Sega console.

There’s even a release date, September 27th, which will see AMD launch an initial salvo of four mid-to-high-end chips. These will aim to leapfrog Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake processors, several of which are among the best CPUs for gaming we’ve yet tried, with the aid of a new Zen 4 core design, DDR5/PCIe 5.0 support and some ambitious clock speed boosts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Drumroll, please, for the latest interactive, live action, film archival puzzle from Sam Barlow, of Her Story and Telling Lies. This latest rumination on voyeurism also delves into storytelling, sex, death, religion, love, lust, lies, pretence (as distinct from acting), power and self. That's a lot to pack into the partial, out of order clips of three different films, which manage to span both decades and careers. The central figure is Marissa Marcel, an almost-star actor who made three movies before disappearing. So the question you strive to answer, by looking through unedited takes and rehearsal footage, is: what happened to Marissa Marcel?
In typical Barlow fashion, the entirety of the footage isn't easily spooled through. From one starting clip you're able to watch it, flick back and forth through the recording, and pause it to use the in-game search tool to focus on a face or object on screen. Selecting it will then take you to that face or a similar object in a different clip, and eventually you build up a much fuller catalogue of footage.
Now. Immortality also talks quite a bit about sex, in various ways and for various reasons, and there is female nudity. So yes, you can enhance! Zoom! on a tit. And the game will take you to another clip featuring a similar tit. Ba-dum, tsh!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gungrave G.O.R.E. marks the return of the Gungrave franchise after almost 20 years (well, besides that VR game), and today we found out that the sequel is coming just in time for Thanksgiving. A new cinematic trailer shown during Gamescom reveals a November release date, and it runs down the wacky cast of characters and why you'll be riddling them with bullets. 
The largely CG trailer sprinkles in a bit of in-game action, though you should check out this previous gameplay video for a better taste of the over-the-top combat. We’re introduced to Grave’s allies who band together to take on a fearsome foursome of antagonists looking to rule the world (probably). Fans of the PS2 games and the anime that spawned from them will be happy to know that G.O.R.E. looks as bombastic and absurd as they'd expect. Newcomers that enjoy bullets, blood, and insanity will likely feel right at home. 


Gungrave G.O.R.E. launches November 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Pre-ordering nets you a special Grim Reaper skin designed by former Tango Gameworks designer Ikumi Nakamura, who is working on G.O.R.E. as a character artist.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mafia celebrates its 20th anniversary today, and in a new blog post by Hanger 13, the principal minds behind the series reflect on its creation and history while also teasing what’s next.
Longtime Mafia designers Roman Hladík (general manager), Tomáš Hřebíček (head of production/media director), and Alex Cox (game director) sat down to discuss Mafia’s entire history and their most cherished memories of the franchise. It’s worth a read if you consider yourself a diehard fan (check it out here), but the most exciting news from the conversation is the confirmation that the next game in the series is in development.
Hřebíček writes: 
“A few years away” is a long time to wait, especially since the last mainline entry, Mafia III, is approaching six years old, launching in October 2016. But we're happy to see the series continue and are curious to see where it heads next. In 2020, Hanger 13 released enhanced remasters of all three games, the most substantial being a complete remake of the original dubbed Mafia: Definitive Edition.

        <updated>2022-08-29T13:06:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has reportedly canceled its Resident Evil series after just one season. 
This news comes from a report from Deadline, which reports that Netflix has decided not to move forward with a second season of the show following the release of Season 1 last month. As far as why, there’s no official reason as of yet but considering Netflix’s past, it’s likely that Resident Evil didn’t meet expectations in terms of both critical and audience response. The show will now join many other shows canceled after just one season at the streamer including Cowboy Bebop, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, and more.
Deadline notes that Resident Evil’s release came right after the highly anticipated Season 4 of Stranger Things, which might have led to its less-than-stellar first weekend on the service. However, the series still debuted in the number two spot, behind Stranger Things, pulling in 72.7 million watch hours. Deadline reports that viewers watched Resident Evil for 73.3 million hours in its second week, taking the number three spot on Netflix, before dropping out of Netflix’s Top 10 by week three. 
This isn’t Netflix’s first foray into the world of Resident Evil, though. Its 2021 movie, Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, holds that title, but that anime series wasn’t well-received either. For more about the series, check out this retrospective video that looks back at 25 years of Resident Evil.

There’s something about the memory of that taste that is amazing, even if you know the sophistication of your palette has evolved a lot in the intervening years. That’s a bit how I feel about the early Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games. I can recall with crystal clarity being gathered around a TMNT arcade cabinet with my friends, pumping in tokens to try and beat Shredder before the birthday party ended. Or spending a weekend banging my head against the wall of the first NES game and its absurd sewer challenges. The Cowabunga Collection exists to service the nostalgic recollection of these types of experiences, and it does so with aplomb. Are these truly great games worth …]]></summary>

You’ve likely heard of Lies Of P after it took the internet by storm after Gamescom Opening Night Live. If you haven’t, I’ll quickly catch you up to speed: it’s a Pinocchio-themed Soulsborne.
You play as the iconic marionette fighting to become human in a fictional French city inspired by the historic Belle Époque era – a time of abundant affluence for the country. Familiar characters like Geppetto, Pinnochio’s creator and father figure, and Gemini Cricket help familiarize the story, but Lies Of P promises intriguing twists through a dark reimagining.

Endless Dungeon, the successor to 2014’s Dungeon of The Endless, is a tower defense twin-stick shooter created by French developer Amplitude Studios; and after my hands-on session at Gamescom 2022, it has the potential to be the next big roguelite. 
Interestingly, this upcoming roguelite is more a reimagining than a sequel. Instead of the point-and-click navigation and automated combat featured in the first game, players now directly control characters and weapons in real-time. Endless Dungeon reimagines its predecessor’s pixel art dungeons into larger, gorgeously-lit 3D spaces. Also, up t…]]></summary>

Monday is a bank holiday for us here in the UK, so we'll leave you with Alice Bee until the rest of us return on Tuesday (well, aside from those of us taking more time). This is the last big holiday weekend of summer, a traditional time to get out in the countryside or down to the seaside. Could use a little heat and joy with the terrible, terrible winter to come. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on!

Neodash is a type of racing game that pops up relatively often; a time trial crossed with an obstacle course and a little of what I suppose is the endless runner. Picture Trackmania but with the courses condensed into short bursts of high speed dodging and you're basically there. They're often very throwaway and don't really hold my interest for long. Neodash grabs hold immediately.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Drinkbox Studios’ Nobody Saves The World is getting a shot in the arm via a new expansion arriving next month. Dubbed Frozen Heath, this update adds new forms, challenges, and a fresh region to explore.
Frozen Hearth takes place in an underground region that hosts The Tempering, a series of trials consisting of combat challenges and puzzles. Overcoming this contest rewards two new forms: the Killer Bee and the Mechanic, which can be used in the main game. 


On September 13 you can buy the Frozen Hearth expansion separately for $4.99 or pick up it alongside the main game in a bundle for $27.99.  
Nobody Saved the World launched in January and became one of our early favorites of 2022. Former editor John Carson scored the game an 8.25 out of 10, writing in his review that, 
“Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish as I leveled my way through form ranks for the next body or ability to work with. It's most fun when unleashing devious yet approachable combat scenarios, keeping me on my toes to find the best solution to survive. Thankfully, it gave me plenty of those unrelenting loops throughout, justifying the time to save this funny little world.”]]></summary>

In case you missed it, it's a 3v7 asymmetrical multiplayer adaptation of the cult 1988 horror film of the same name, but details on how its creepy clowning around would actually work were few and far between, to say the least. Thankfully, I sat in on a developer presentation earlier this week to find out exactly how it stacks up to other asymmetrical horror film games out there at the moment, as well as how it hopes to evolve and redefine the hide-and-seek genre as a whole.

The games are called Penny Blood and Armed Fantasia (no points for guessing who's making what), and based on what I've seen so far, I'm intrigued.

It launched at £125 for a 1TB size earlier this year, but now it's down to £84 where it's rather more fetching. The 2TB size has also been reduced and is even better value at £152. Here's why we rate these SSDs - and where to find them at the lowest price.
Let's do the 'where to find them' bit first. It's quite simple: WD's UK store is offering the 1TB at the best price right now, while Ebuyer is the place to go if you'd prefer the larger 2TB model.

Tuesday's Opening Night Live showcase featured a huge amount of trailers to gawk at, a baggage carousel of content that moved at a blistering clip. Despite its two hour runtime a lot of interesting (and in most cases, new) titles weren't given a huge amount space to breathe, their moment in the spotlight frequently cut short by another trailer waiting impatiently in the wings.


You'd be forgiven, then, for missing a few bits and pieces because you were blinking really fast or distracted by the cat eating something unknown underneath your coffee table. Not to worry though, as I've once again gathered team RPS to tell me in detail about the games that caught their attention during Geoffcom 2022.


Much like our E3 roundup from earlier in the summer, each RPS staffer took ten minutes out of their day to wax lyrical about an upcoming project featured within the showcase. All eight (including yours truly, who thanks to Katharine actually remembered to contribute this time around) chose completely different games. Some picks are more obvious, whereas others are a little off piste. In a good way, of course!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Ninja’s dark fantasy action title Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty impresses in a new gameplay trailer that captures the fast-paced thrills you'd expect from the minds behind Nioh and Ninja Gaiden. 
Fans of the studio's previous action titles should find plenty to love with Wo Long if this video is any indication. Set during the Three Kingdoms era of China, you'll battle invading demons as a soldier using a blend of graceful swordplay and Chinese martial arts based on the Five Phases philosophy. The trailer shows off the many demonic foes awaiting your blade, including a bipedal tiger that is swiftly kicked out of the way by the protagonist. 


Next month, those attending Tokyo Game Show will be the first to play Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty via a show floor demo. Everyone else will have to wait until early 2023 to experience the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.]]></summary>

The Lexar Play 1TB is now retailing for £110 at Amazon, compared to a usual price of £140. If you'd prefer something a little more high performance, the highly-rated SanDisk Extreme 1TB card is also on sale, dropping from £220 to £140.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Sony Interactive Entertainment announced it will increase the price of PlayStation 5 consoles in various non-U.S. territories due to global economic conditions such as inflation. Microsoft then declared later that day that it will not be doing the same with the Xbox Series X/S. Now, Nintendo has chimed in on the matter. 
In a statement to Eurogamer, Nintendo reiterates a quote from president Shuntaro Furukawa, made in June, in which he stated the company has "no plans to increase the trade price of its hardware.” Furukawa made this statement during the 82nd Annual General Meeting Shareholders that month, in which he also said: 
"While we cannot comment on pricing strategies, we currently do not have any plans to change the price of our hardware due to inflation or increased procurement costs in each country. We will determine our future pricing strategies through careful and continued deliberations.”
Although the PlayStation 5's price will remain unchanged in the U.S. (for now), both versions of the console have become more expensive in Canada, Europe, the UK, Mexico, Japan, and Australia. The price hikes have already gone into effect in those regions except Japan, which occurs on September 15. 
The only time Nintendo significantly adjusted the price of its current consoles was last fall, when it permanently reduced the cost of the standard Switch model in the UK and Europe. Nintendo has yet to do the same in the U.S.

But despite both of these events, it's been difficult to ascertain what the game actually, well, is. Aside from being a real-time strategy spin-off, there's been nothing else to scan with our eyeballs for more info.
Colour me intrigued, then, as I sat in a quickfire presentation at this year's Gamescom and bore witness to some mythical gameplay. I can now report that what Minecraft Legends appears to be is as mix of real-time strategy and building, made all the more approachable by being set in Minecraft's colourful cube-verse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eight years ago Graham (who used to be to blame for all of this) got hands-on with Dead Island 2, back when the game was being developed by Yager, the folks behind Spec Ops: The Line. Since then, development changed hands like a baton at the Olympic relay; Yager left a year later, to be replaced by Sumo Digital, only for Sumo Digital to leave and be replaced by Dambuster Studios. Usain Bolt hasn't expressed interest yet, but there's time.
So going into a 20-minute hands-on with the game in the year 2022, I was a bit apprehensive. What sort of Frankenstinian horror awaited me behind closed doors? But, far from a shambling mess, what I played was a zombie 'em up that seemed close to what Graham saw in 2014, only polished up to a surprising, bloody gloss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dunno if you’ve noticed by there’s an awful lot of sci-fi games on the way, most of which – these being games – revolve around shooting space creatures to glowing green bits. Deliver Us Mars, the recently delayed sequel to Deliver Us The Moon, takes a more peaceful option, now blending the original’s puzzling with some Tomb Raider reboot-style platforming. Your deadliest enemy here is gravity, and as far as I understand, you can’t shoot that.

No clue yet as to how much they’d be paying, but it’s likely to be ranging in the hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. Maybe just not as many as Microsoft’s $68.7 billion buyout of Activision Blizzard, revealed in January.

He’s best known for overseeing three of The Hunger Games movies and is working on the prequel coming out next year, The Ballad Of Songbirds And Snakes. 


Netflix have also hired screenwriter Michael Green for the BioShock flick. Green wrote the Kenneth Branagh versions of Agatha Christie’s Murder On The Orient Express and Death On The Nile. I guess that means he’s got experience of period settings.

Join us at 5:00 P.M. Central Time (6:00 P.M. ET/3:00 P.M. PT) to watch the build. We likely won't get through the whole thing today, but we'll be live for at least a couple of hours. 
And as you might've guessed from the picture above, we have a lot more Gunpla kits to get through. Bandai was nice enough to send us a few, and we'll absolutely be live streaming lots of fun hobby-adjacent activities over the next few weeks.
 Again, we're going live on our Twitch channel at 5:00 P.M. Central Time (6:00 P.M. ET/3:00 P.M. PT). Hope to see you there!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not that all the other wars were just a bit of goofing around, but World War One – a conflict remembered more for its bleak, arduous trench warfare than any great triumph over evil – seems like a particularly unusual source of inspiration for a strategy game that will, presumably, be played for fun. Nonetheless, The Great War: Western Front, a combination of macro planning and tactical RTS battling revealed this week at Gamescom, has elected to lean right into WW1’s complexities and difficulties rather than dance around them.

Developers Petroglyph have gone for historical accuracy in various ways, senior designer Chris Becker and audio director Frank Klepacki explain to me at a hands-off demo in Cologne. The soundtrack will even include licensed music from the era. But something they want to really hammer home is the brutality of the war: territory won’t be won in heroic pushes but slowly and bloodily, while collapsing morale is as much a danger as any advancing army.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atomic Heart reemerged during Gamescom with a new trailer devoted solely to showing off its impressive, Bioshock-esque combat. Over three minutes of gameplay footage shows off the carnage you'll unleash against adversaries, both artificial and organic. 
Players wield melee weapons or firearms in one hand and more, shall we say, unconventional abilities in the other. That includes electrifying targets with lightning bolts, tossing them around with a telekinesis-like power, freezing foes solid with an ice blast, or using wires to hijack machines. The action-packed video shows off how players can creatively combine their arsenal to dismantle and disembowel anything standing in their way. 


Atomic Heart was first announced in 2018 and takes place in an alternative futuristic version of the Soviet Union in 1955. Robotic technology flourished post World War 2, allowing humanity to create a high-tech utopia. Unfortunately, these mechanical helpers have started rebelling against their human creators. If that wasn’t enough, killer mutants born from secret experiments have also run amok. Players control private agent P-3, who embarks on a secret mission to get to the bottom of what’s caused this seemingly perfect society to collapse and clean up this mess. 
Atomic Heart launches this fall for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It’s also launching on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

It’s a game clearly designed to mimic the picture book imagination of childhood with its hand-drawn visuals and the innocent silent presence of its protagonist, a young boy named OU and his opossum friend. Even its music is reminiscent of some lost, unknown childhood as we’re lulled into the strange world of U-Chronia with the smooth instrumentation of a single guitar and its occasional percussion. Yet it’s clear with the presence of beasts that threaten your safety and a shadowy clone that this isn’t some peaceful retreat into childhood.

A video game sequel is hard to create, especially if the previous game was a commercial success. Why did the game resonate with fans? How many new features does the sequel need to justify another price tag? Should anything be changed at all? How do you make something fresh while retaining the identity established in the first release?
These are the questions developers constantly ask themselves while making a game. The road to publishing a project is full of pitfalls, and it’s easy to lose the path.

The singleplayer spaceship shooter hit Game Pass in June, and all you need to know is: once you power through the boring bit, you get to play as a spacewitch pilot who fights with guns and magic while weaving through the innards of battleships and megastructures. It's one of those good 7/10 games.

You can now fly over Hanover, Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Bonn and Cologne. They’re rendered with the fancy photogrammetry technique that’s already plonked hundred of cities into Flight Simulator’s rendition of Earth. 


That means that you can zoom over Koelnmesse, which is where Gamescom’s happening right bloomin’ now. Nice bit of Inception-style weirdness there, Microsoft Flight Simulator devs. I’ll give it a go later and see if I can spot our roving reporter Ed. Witness the realism for yourself by watching the trailer below, like some kind of human aircraft gliding above.

Matthew isn't here this week, which means we are very well behaved. I talk about BioWare games a normal amount, and Nate tries (and, in fairness, succeeds) to find a way to make moral choices a thing that you can apply to the sort of games he likes. Not Age Of Empires II this time, though. 
Because there's no Matthew, I change the Cavern Of Lies into a cavern of moral judgement for Nate, and make him run a gauntlet of some of the most important choices in Dragon Age Inquisition with no context. He turns out to be both authoritarian and kind of wholesome as an Inquisitor.

While NHL 23 doesn’t rebuild the gameplay from the ground up, it does offer several features, tweaks, and enhancements in hopes of being better than the last iteration.
NHL 23 represents the series’ second entry using EA’s Frostbite engine. As such, various refinements come online as the development team further familiarizes itself with the proprietary engine.

It's eschewing the robotic antics of its predecessor in favour of a Middle Eastern-inspired semi-open world filled with towering blocks of sand, rolling dunes, and mahoosive beasties.
I managed to see a brief 30-minute presentation of the game here at Gamescom, which gave off the impression that it's shaping up to satisfy those craving a AA title to plonk on their shelf. I've got to say that in action that combat really looks good, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["The thing we're doing with The Dark Pictures is exploring different sub genres of horror," explains game director Tom Heaton. The Dark Pictures Anthology is, well, a horror anthology, each a compact standalone scary game where you explore and deal with QTEs and hazardous choices, in the vein of Supermassive's smash hit Until Dawn. The idea, says Heaton, is that each one takes one or two horror sub-genres and mines them, maybe subverting the tropes here and there. Up next is The Devil In Me, inspired by the infamous Chicago serial killer H. H. Holmes. 
"What I think we decided with The Dark Pictures games early on was that the next game in the series would be very different from the last game, because we want to keep it fresh, we want to give the audience new," Heaton explains. So, after a zombie ghost ship in Man Of Medan, the psychological witch hauntings in Little Hope, and military squad vs. vampire aliens in House Of Ashes, Heaton pitches The Devil In Me as kind of Saw meets The Shining. It's a serial killer slasher in a weirdo hotel, and it has a true crime element. And I have to say, it's probably the most excited I've been for a Dark Pictures entry.

Attackers "executed arbitrary code on a remote device, meaning they could take control of a player's PC." But thankfully, seven months later, the servers are back online. 
The official Dark Souls Twitter account initially confirmed servers would remain offline beyond the release of Elden Ring. However, the extensive deactivation period that ensued couldn't have been anticipated. The RCE hack affected all three Dark Souls games. And now that the third entry's multiplayer modes are available again, hopefully, the other games in the franchise will see the light of day, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Dark Pictures Anthology returns this November with The Devil In Me, which serves as the season finale for the franchise (until the next batch of games arrive). A new trailer showcases the host of new features designed to ensure the season ends with a bang.
The Devil In Me stars actor Jessie Buckley and follows a group of filmmakers fighting for survival in a dangerous house, a replica of H.H. Holmes’ infamous “Murder Castle.” The new trailer runs down additions such as being able to use important tools from a character inventory and extended exploration mechanics; players can freely run, jump, and climb now. Supermassive also reveals the story is over seven hours long. An online shared story lets you enjoy the experience with friends from afar, though you can explore the adventure with friends in the room in local multiplayer. 


The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil In Me arrives November 18 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. You can get a better sense of the game's narrative by watching this recent story trailer.]]></summary>

Original story:
Off The Grid was announced earlier this year, the first product of District 9 director Neill Blomkamp's partnership with Gunzilla Games. A new video released tonight offers a longer look at its setting, in the form of a Blomkamp directed in-engine cinematic, while also giving a sense of how the cyberpunk battle royale might feel to play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you enjoy over-the-top, stylish action games with plenty of silliness, Wanted: Dead should be on your radar. First announced last fall, the game comes from Soliel Ltd, developer of the upcoming Valkyrie Elysium, and consists of Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive alumni. With those credentials, it's little surprise that Wanted: Dead looks absolutely bonkers. 
The story centers on Hong Kong cop Lt. Hannah Stone, a member of the Zombie Unit. She and her squad must get to the bottom of a corporate conspiracy, but the game doesn’t appear to be nearly as serious as its premise lets on. Gameplay blends stylish swordplay with explosive gunplay as players slice and/or shoot through gang members, mercenaries, and other foes in an adventure that looks ridiculous. The release date trailer also shows off anime cutscenes, rhythm music gameplay, cute cats, and whatever else it manages to cram in. 


Wanted: Dead is launching on February 14 and is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

Happily though, there are also now a range of much more affordable keyboards that still include the unusual colour schemes, high-quality components and brilliant typing experiences that make mechanical keyboards so fascinating to me. One of the best makers in this space is Akko, and today a range of their best full-size and compact keyboards are on sale at Amazon UK.

I love Minecraft and have been playing it on and off since it landed on Xbox Live Arcade in 2012, but I couldn’t care less about the series’ spin-off games like Dungeons or the Telltale-developed Story Mode. While those games were fine, they defeated the point of why I love Minecraft – building, and crafting. 
Developer Mojang Studios is shaking things up with its next spin-off, and after my behind-closed-doors demo at Gamescom, I’m interested. 


Minecraft Legends is a third-person real-time action strategy game. Yeah, that’s a lot of keywords, but I promise the game is easier to understand than you think…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft’s chief executive officer of gaming and Xbox head Phil Spencer believes games exclusive to a single console will become something we see less of over time. 
This news comes from a new interview with Spencer from Bloomberg discussing Microsoft’s in-the-process acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the landscape of console exclusivity, and more. He believes that this is a good thing for the gaming industry in the long run. 
“[It] is something we’re just going to see less and less of,” when discussing the idea of specific games being exclusive to a single device. “Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox, and I buy a PlayStation, and our kids want to play together, and they can’t because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television.
“We really love being able to bring more players in reducing friction, making people feel safe, secure when they’re playing, allowing them to play with their friends, regardless of what device – I think in the long run that is good for this industry. And maybe in the short run, there’s some people in some companies that don’t love it. But I think as we get over the hump and see where this industry can continue to grow, it proves out to be true.”
Bloomberg also asked Spencer about the status of Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition, how the company will handle unions and ongoing unionization efforts happening within Activision Blizzard, and more, so be sure to check out the publication’s full story here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pentiment, Obsidian Entertainment's medieval narrative adventure title, is coming on November 15. We first learned of the project during the Xbox Games Showcase in June. 
The game's art direction emulates medieval manuscript illustrations and woodcut prints while the story unfolds in 16th-century Bavaria. You play as an illustrator who becomes wrapped up in a series of murders over 25 years. You'll engage in choice-driven conversations where your decisions steer the plot and create lasting consequences in a tale that expands into a larger conspiracy. Check out the original reveal trailer below to see it in action. 


Pentiment is made by a small team within Obsidian led by director Josh Sawyer. You can pick it up on Xbox consoles and PC (day one on Game Pass). It will be the second game that Obsidian ships this year, following the 1.0 release of Grounded in September.]]></summary>

Modern homages to classic video games often go one of two ways: They either stick close to the gameplay conventions to which they are paying tribute, or they expand the original games’ styles in meaningful and innovative ways. Blossom Tales II: The Minotaur Prince, like its 2017 predecessor, is more the former than the latter, adhering closely to the classic Legend of Zelda blueprint, most notably that of A Link to the Past. Despite this lack of innovation, Blossom Tales II still manages to capture many of the acclaimed elements of what many consider to be one of the greatest video …]]></summary>

When the Splatoon 3-focused Nintendo Direct hit two weeks ago, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the information and how much content the Splatoon team was bringing at launch. As someone who very much enjoyed the first two Splatoon games (as well as Splatoon 2's Octo Expansion), that Nintendo Direct was all I needed to bring my excitement levels up a few notches. However, having the opportunity to get my hands on the soon-to-be-released Splatoon 3 only skyrocketed this game up the list of my most anticipated 2022 releases.

Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn't find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obsidian, the first supported game of the mTropolis engine, is ready for public testing!
Created in 1996 by Rocket Science Games and published in early 1997, this ambitious 3D-rendered first-person adventure has you journey through 4 surreal, dream-like worlds in search of your lost colleague.
ScummVM currently supports the English and German versions.  It features a widescreen mode, improved cinematic quality, and a few bug fixes. A Japanese version also exists, but we need more information about it to support it. Please contact us if you have a copy of the Japanese version or some other language version that we haven't discovered yet.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. You can also download a demo here.  If you encounter any issues, please submit them to the issue tracker!
