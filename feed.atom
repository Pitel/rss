Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition has been out for less than a month on the Switch and it seems we've already got our first major tournament scandal. While glitches aren't actually allowed in this game, it seems a player has used one to top the ladder in the 'World Championships' Donkey Kong competition.
The individual with the best run for 'Donkey Kong Barrel Roll' (with an 'S' rank and time of 00:15:68) has used the "invisible ladder glitch" to set this leaderboard record. We've reviewed the replay in the game and can confirm it's the winning run.

The early missions ease you into the game as you learn how to face your foes. But things can get hairy the higher you go.


There are nine difficulties in Helldivers 2. You begin at Difficulty 1 - Trivial when you graduate the tutorial with your first cape. Trivial missions are often straightforward, teaching you the basics and pitting you against only small groups of foes. It's a stark contrast to Difficulty 9, in which most divers learn the true meaning of "Helldive."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thank Goodness You’re Here!, a game which feels like someone took a snapshot of a North Yorkshire town in the mid '70s and somehow turned it into a full-blown quest filled adventure, has gained Steam Deck verification just one day ahead of its release date. 


Coal Supper, the development team behind the bizarre yet incredibly enjoyable romp through a small British town, revealed on Twitter that the former Steam Next Fest featured game is now completely verified for Steam Deck just in time for its release on August 1.


In case you have no idea what I’m talking about, here’s the trailer:




In Thank Goodness You’re Here!, you're sent into the fictional town of Barnsworth for a meeting with the Mayor, but things go horribly wrong right from the beginning of your journey. From taking a dive out of the window, or shrinking down in size and floating around in a pint, or using a large amount of butter to help someone get their arm out of a drain cover, there’s a lot of chaos and a lot of fun to be had.


With Matt Berry providing his very recognizable voice for multiple roles and some lovely photographs from a bygone era of British history as pause menus, Thank Goodness You’re Here! is full of puzzles to solve and good times to be had.

Thank Goodness You’re Here! shares its publisher with another delightfully bizarre game which you may have heard of - Untitled Goose Game - so if you’ve ever taken a jaunt around town as a thieving goose, you’ll likely know exactly what to expect from Thank Goodness You’re Here!. 


Thank Goodness You’re Here! will also be releasing on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch on August 1, so if anything, the game is more portable than not at this point. Like Untitled Goose Game, if you’re planning to play Thank Goodness You’re Here! on PC, you’ll need to do so with a controller.

The War Within's pre-expansion event, Radiant Echoes, doubles down on some of the most baffling design decisions from Dragonflight: an increasing insistence on community-focused events that just do not work.


Ready, Set, Remember


Radiant Echoes as an event is easy enough to explain: there are three zones of yore that the event rotates between, on a 90-minute timer. At the beginning of this timer, the event begins in earnest, with three phases to be completed cumulating in a boss that everyone needs to work together to kill.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The touch pass might not be an easy one to pull off in College Football 25 if you're unfamiliar with it, as there are no explicit instructions provided to you.


Yet, one of the earliest tutorial objectives in the game requires you to perform touch passes successfully. You might not get any instructions for it, but it turns out, it's really more simple than you'd think.


What is a touch pass in College Football 25


In simple words, a touch pass is somewhere between a bullet pass and the more advanced lob pass. It's the middle spot in both speed and air-time, not quite zipping into the receiver's hands, but not airing it out for a high grab either.

How to perform a touch pass in College Football 25


The controls for performing a touch pass is pretty much the same across all control layouts. You press the icon button of your receiver, and the main challenge is to choose the correct power. Let off the button too early, and you end up performing a lobbed pass. Keep the button pressed for too long, and you throw a bullet pass.


Typically, I try to lift off the button when the power is between one-third and two-thirds filled. In simpler words, charge it up about a halfway or so, and you'll throw a touch pass.


Do note that this pass will be easier to perform in Revamped and Placement-Accuracy passing schemes. In Placement passing, the power bar has to be filled till three-fourths. In classic, it's very difficult to perform a touch pass as there's no power meter to begin with. (My recommendation - just go with Revamped passing as it will make your life a lot easier.)


I usually go with a touch pass only in certain situations when a defense doesn't surround my receiver, but he isn't also making a forward run. It offers just that extra bit of time for the receiver to grab the ball in a secured fashion.

The community is furious because the system is so easily exploited by scalpers and seems designed to prevent fans from buying the cards they desire. 


Over on the MTG subreddit, moderators have had to create a Rant Megathread for every user to post their frustrations in because so many wanted to make individual posts about the Secret Lair situation. One of the TCG's biggest content creators, Tolarian Community College, who is always incredibly fair to Wizards of the Coast when it comes to business matters, has said that he's done and won't be buying any Secret Lairs until something is done about the situation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chivalry 2 is dead, long live Chivalry. Developer Torn Banner Studios has announced that, after three years, Chivalry 2 is finished and "feature complete." But the team isn't done with the franchise, and more Chivalry is on the way.


The news was announced yesterday in a note by Steve Piggott, the studio president and creative director. According to Piggott, May's Regicide Update will be the last bit of new content coming to Chivalry 2. The team is pivoting to maintenance mode, but the bard has sung. 


"With the Regicide Update we consider the game to be content and feature complete," Piggott writes in the Steam message.

Not the end of Chivalry


Chivalry 2 launched into Early Access in June 2021. Since then, the multiplayer medieval combat game received eleven major updates. As noted by Piggott, fans enjoyed content drops that included mounted combat, new game modes, more maps, a new faction, and additional weapons to use for ye olde stabbing and beheading of foes.


According to Piggott, the team is now focusing on the future. Its next game is No More Room in Hell 2, a multiplayer co-op shooter where you fight against hordes of zombies — coming this Halloween. But, as the headline spoils, that won't be all.

"With this final content update delivered to players, we’re excited to focus our efforts and resources on compelling new multiplayer projects, both in the Chivalry universe as well as within terrifying new co-op territory," Piggott writes. "We’ve been building our team in number and skillset to take on these following challenges, with a focused effort to ensure that when the next Chivalry title is released, it will utterly blow players away."


Chivalry 2 won't be hung out to dry. Torn Banner will still deliver fixes and patches for its game, which is scheduled to stay online for quite some time.

If you're thinking of pulling her from her banner, or you're just looking for a little insight, here's everything you need to know about building her.


Strongest Yunli Build in Honkai: Star Rail


Yunli is a Physical Destruction character whose central focus revolves around using powerful Follow-up attacks through counters to destroy her foes. From a gameplay perspective, Yunli plays incredibly similarly to Clara. She plays so close to her that anywhere you could slot a Clara on a team, you can, instead, replace with Yunli. Effectively, she is a more powerful version of Clara, with a majority of her weaknesses omitted.

Sometimes it's very difficult, no matter how you try to frame it in your head, to get excited for re-releases of certain retro fighting games. It's a genre that's ripe for the picking, absolutely stuffed full of crackers to be revisited but, for every delightful return to the likes of Samurai Shodown 2, Guilty Gear, or Street Fighter, you're gonna end up with something that has no real reason to be revived at all. Something like SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos.
A product of what's known as SNK's 'dark period', what you've got here is an arcade game that looks the part, sounds the part, and has a roster that should be kicking ass and taking all the names. However, as nicely as it's presented — and a quick glance at these screenshots still makes us want to go on a retro-fighter bender — it's just...not very good, and it never was.

This brings the Ministry of Truth to life in an entirely new way and extends the game's lore in an unexpected way. 


User SurrexSnek posted their incredible experience on the game's subreddit, which began with a relatively simple request for a refund of 1,000 Super Credits for the Deluxe Edition upgrade. Instead of a standard support ticket, they sent a request for their refund using the voice and language a Helldiver would in-game. I'd expect the support team to have a good laugh at this but respond using standard language and process requests. They absolutely did not do that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to mounts in Final Fantasy XIV, we’re all a little spoiled for choice. And yet, with every expansion, we get more and they’re always glorious. One new mount added in patch 7.05 was the Monowheel S1, and it’s probably one of my favorites yet. 


However, it’s not easy to get. Before you can drive around on your Monowheel S1, you’ve got one hell of a battle simply to get it to drop. Things are going to get pretty savage.

The Monowheel S1 is a drop from The Arcadion: AAC Light-heavyweight M4 (Savage). This means that you’ve got a bit of work ahead of you if you want to be the proud owner of this unique mount. 


First, you’ll need to unlock and complete all of the normal Arcadion raids. This isn’t too much of a tall order, they’re fairly easy to complete once you’ve got the hang of the mechanics being thrown at you. 


Then, you’ll need to unlock and complete all of the savage versions of these raids. That means diving in and taking on Black Cat, Honey B. Lovely, Brute Bomber, and Wicked Thunder with no holds barred. This is no mean feat, with even some of the best raiders in FFXIV taking over 10 hours to get through the four bosses during the World First Race. 


On the plus side, the Monowheel S1 Identification Key seems to be a guaranteed drop after you’ve taken down Wicked Thunder, so you’ll only need to complete the fight a maximum of eight times (as long as you keep a consistent party) before you get the mount. 


Is there another way to get the Monowheel S1 in Final Fantasy XIV?

In short, no. As with all raid reward mounts and minions, the Monowheel S1 Identification Key cannot be sold on the Marketboard or traded. This means that your only choice if you want it is to dive into savage raiding.

When I say ‘not easy’, I don’t mean you’re going to have to battle through encounters with particularly difficult enemies (although this is true). The difficulty when it comes to getting the Honeysuckler minion is that it relies solely on luck and, if you’re anything like me, you’re likely wondering what you did to upset the rolling gods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Kristen Hamilton FUTTIES card is now available in EA FC 24 Ultimate Team, and you can add this special item to your squad for free. 


Hamilton's FUTTIES item is part of the latest objective in Ultimate Team, and it can be a great addition, especially for beginners. To get the card, you'll need to complete all the tasks that are part of the objective set. 


EA FC 24 Kristen Hamilton FUTTIES objective


The Kristen Hamilton FUTTIES objective has four different tasks, and all of them have certain conditions. The tasks can be completed in any order, but some of them will end faster. 



Lightning Speed: Score 5 goals using players with Min. 93 PAC in Squad Battles matches on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).


Pinpoint Accuracy: Score 2 goals from Outside the Box in Squad Battles matches on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).


Play 5: Play 5 matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).


Win 4: Win 4 matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions) while having Min. 3 players from the United States in your starting 11.



To complete the objective, the best option is to play Squad Battles. It's highly likely that you'll have to play some of your weaker cards to complete the tasks. In Squad Battles, you can choose the match difficulty, and play against AI. This is easier to manage than other modes like Division Rivals and Champions Finals. 


After completing the tasks, you'll get a 94-rated ST item which can also operate as a CF. It has four playstyles+, including Finesse Shot, Technical, and Rapid. This is a great combination to have on a center forward. The lack of 5* Weak Foot will be an issue, but this is a free card. At worst, the card could help you complete a more expensive SBC at a lower cost.

It's been a while, but Undertale's Toby Fox is back with yet another newsletter update on Deltarune, this time delving into everything we need to know about the development progress on chapters 3, 4 and 5 (thanks, GoNintendo).
We know that Chapter 3 is pretty much complete (Fox confirmed this back in February), and it sounds like it's full steam ahead on the next two entries. In his latest newsletter, Fox states that Chapter 4 is "making great progress overall" and is "basically playable minus some polish". In fact, some of the team has moved to focus on Chapter 5, according to Fox.

Bungie are also transferring a further 155 roles to parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment, and are spinning out an untitled incubation project - an "action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe" - to form a new PlayStation studio.

During the recent Grasshopper Direct showcase, in which more information was provided on the upcoming Shadow of the Damned: Hella Remastered, legendary Japanese creator Shinji Mikami stated that he would love to see Goichi Suda (better known as 'Suda51') create a sequel to the GameCube title Killer7.
The comments, covered by our pals at VGC, came toward the end of the presentation (37.54, to be precise) when both creators were asked to share information on upcoming projects. Mikami was rather coy and simply said "I've realised that I want to stay as hands-on as possible when it comes to game creation", before stating his desire to see Suda51 create a Killer7 sequel.

This news comes mere days after the mind-blowing conclusion to the second major Act of Destiny 2's first Episode, and only a month after the launch of The Final Shape.


In a candid blog post, Parsons cites "rising costs of development and industry shifts as well as enduring economic conditions" as the reasons it's had to eliminate so many staff. He adds that "it has become clear that we need to make substantial changes to our cost structure and focus development efforts entirely on Destiny and Marathon." Both IPs now seem to be its main focus.

The developers have just released a nine-minute explainer video, which teems with scenes of gimp suits, winged vans, rocket-propelled pinkies, vicious card battles against small excited dogs, and a surprisingly in-depth management component. There are bits that make me think of Batman: Arkham City, and bits that make me think of Pathologic, and bits that make me think of Yakuza - a combination fit to burst the brain. Quick, before your brain bursts, watch the video for yourself below.

Some elite teams took things one step further, joining the World First Race.


The race was over in a remarkably short 10 hours (roughly), with the Japan based team GRIND coming out on top, defeating Wicked Thunder in M4 first. According to their FFlogs upload, the team achieved the feat in just 17 pulls of the boss. Sadly, GRIND was not streaming their efforts, so results were unclear in the moments after the first clears started to happen.

The game's Switch port is due out in October 2024, and fans can pre-order a physical edition from FanGamer ahead of time to ensure they've got it for Halloween. 


Faith: The Unholy Trinity is a collection of three chapters of pure retro horror. The first chapter was initially released in 2017, but the trilogy came together as its own title in 2022. Each one is inspired by the 8-bit classics of the '70s you might have played, if you had a system to play on back them. Organ Trail: Director's Cut is a more recent reference you might be familiar with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a lot of meals in Disney Dreamlight Valley, though some offer more benefits than others. Whether you’re looking to make Star Coins or gain Energy, four or five star meals are definitely the best. One easy four star meal is Maguro Sushi. 


Maguro Sushi is a base game entree meal and, as with all four star meals, it’s made using four ingredients. Thankfully, these four ingredients are very easy to get, so let's take a look.

Tuna

Can be fished up in either the Glade of Trust or the Forgotten Lands from white or occasionally blue ripples




Seaweed

Can be fished up anywhere in Dreamlight Valley or the Wild Tangle on Eternity Isle from any water where there aren’t any ripples


1 Red Algae can be used to craft 5 Seaweed




Rice

Grown from seeds purchased for 35 Gold each from Goofy’s Stall in the Glade of Trust


Rice takes 50 minutes to grow and needs watering twice




Ginger 

Foragable herb from the ground in The Forgotten Lands

Maguro Sushi is moderately useful if you’re looking for an energy boost, offering 1,206 energy per serving. You can also sell Maguro Sushi to Goofy for 338 Star Coins each. 


Other than this, Maguro Sushi can sometimes come up as a desired meal in Chez Remy, or otherwise as a villager’s favorite gift on any day. It can also be placed down as a decoration. To do this, simply drop it from your inventory and then enter furniture placement mode to move it to wherever you like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adding a bit of showboat to a touchdown in College Football 25 might just be the flex you want to do over your opponent.


There is no shortage of celebrations to perform. Even landing a successful first down allows you to celebrate, but showboating is slightly different. For starters, it's performed in real-time while a play is still active, which makes it separate from any post-play celebrations. Secondly, knowing when to do it is important, to ensure you don't end up looking like a fool.


College Football 25 showboat guide


Showboating is the ultimate flex you can pull on your opponent in College Football 25. Like every good celebration, it has its time and place.



On offense, reach a position when you're approaching the end zone without the fear of being tackled. This is a crucial point to remember. If you're in close proximity to a defender, showboating shouldn't even be on your mind.


Once you're in the clear and about to approach the end zone, press and hold the L2, R2, and X buttons. For Xbox users, this will be LT, RT, and A buttons.


Your ball carrier will start a series of over-the-top motions as they continue to run forward.



You'll still need to steer your player into the end zone. Then, you can celebrate once again by picking one of the available options.


As cool as it might feel to showboat in College Football 25, it's better to concentrate on securing a touchdown first. When playing against another human opponent, chances are that you won't get an open run to the end zone unless there's a vast difference between your skill levels. When playing against AI, the Freshman and Varsity difficulties do allow you chances to a few easy touchdowns, which are good opportunities to showboat.


Ultimately, a showboat is merely a flex - it won't help you get extra points. However, it could just be the right tool to irritate your friend before scoring a touchdown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A particular University of Alabama course this fall will feel like a "Hide, Hideaway" for many students as it's heavily inspired by Square Enix's Final Fantasy XVI.  The class "Mythos to Logos: Religious Deconstruction and Reconstruction in Final Fantasy XVI" will examine the religious deities of the game to help explain real-world concepts. 


"Once a week, the class will engage in what I call a 'Game Lab,' where students will spend class time playing a video game under my guidance, with lectures interspersed to frame their gameplay," said the course's teacher ProfNoctis on X/Twitter.

The class focuses on eight aspects or attributes of deities and theologies in various religions and "asks students to carefully examine the life-giving aspects of these representations from the harmful aspects of them."  


To help students understand these real-world religions, which ProfNoctis claims "can prove difficult for students," the class will be using Final Fantasy XVI to help with the education process. Students will be able to enroll for ProfNoctis' class at the University of Alabama for this fall. The lab will include PS5s for students to use, thanks to a grant. 




Video games as an educational tool


Video games have been a great teaching tool for many. Minecraft, for instance, has an Education Edition to help kids learn math, coding, and computer science. 


Additionally, Dance Dance Revolution has been used in schools for physical education. The Assassin's Creed games also have the Discovery Tour, which helps players learn history without the violence. Hopefully, more university classes will take inspiration from the neat ways games can make education interactive.

Back in 2022, we reported on a long overdue reunion in the world of Resident Evil when the original actors for Chris Redfield (Charles Kraslavsky), Barry Burton (Greg Smith), and Albert Wesker (Eric Pirius) all sat down to reminisce on their time shooting the intro to the 1996 classic (or the Deadly Silence release if you're a staunch Nintendo fan).
Now, courtesy of Residence of Evil, they're back for another chat, but this time, the original actress for Rebecca Chambers joins the crew. Known only as Linda (presumably to protect her privacy), she recounts her experience in Japan and shooting the introductory cutscene with Capcom, noting her surprise and delight at the robotic dobermann dogs used to represent the franchise's 'zombie dog' enemy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After being announced in December 2023, those who have been waiting for Visions of Mana to become a more tangible entity finally have a chance to get a hands on experience with the game’s demo.


The first addition to the Mana series in 15 years, Visions of Mana is set to release fully on August 29 on Xbox, PlayStation and PC (via Microsoft Store and Steam). If you’ve been waiting for the next installment, you can now get a hands on experience by downloading and playing the demo. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


The demo takes place part way through Chapter 1, and players have the change to explore Rime Falls, Fallow Steppe and Rhata Harbor. In the latter, you have a chance to purchase new gear and weapons, which is good, because the demo culminates in a challenging battle with the first Chapter's boss, the Kraken.


Within the demo, you play as Val alongside three party members (Careena, Hinna, and Morley), and experience a range of classes including Wind and Moon. You'll also encounter many field enemies, and even this little cutie, who goes largely unexplained.

Sadly, any save data from the demo will not be passed on to the full release, although there’s an incentive to play and save your progress. If you do, you’ll be rewarded with three weapons for Val once you purchase the full game and progress as far as Chapter 1 - Gladius, Lux, and Horn Lance. 


You’ll be able to equip Gladius as soon as Val becomes playable in Chapter 1, while Falx and Horn Lance will become usable once it’s possible to change to the Wind or Moon classes respectively.


The Visions of Mana demo is available on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC now. If you're playing on PC, I strongly recommend using a controller.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mandabore.
In the early 2000s, the Star Wars universe was expanding. While the prequel trilogy was setting its sights on Anakin Skywalker's epic arc from good to evil (or from 'Yippee’-ing child actor to underappreciated grown-up actor, depending on your point of view), LucasArts turned to the video game scene to provide some 'wider reading' for those who wanted to know their Midi-chlorians from Mandalorians.
One such release in this era of new characters and lore was Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, a 2002 (2003 in Europe) GameCube and PlayStation 2 action-adventure that put you in the Beskar boots of badass bounty hunter Jango Fett — before his all-too-brief head-to-head (or, head-to-no-head) with Mace Windu in Attack of the Clones.

The critically acclaimed 8-bit horror Faith: The Unholy Trinity will be launching on the Nintendo Switch in October. Not only that, but a tasty physical edition from Fangamer is also available for pre-order now.
Comprised of three chapters, the first of which was released in 2017 by developer Airdorf Games, Faith utilises retro 8-bit visuals reminiscent of the Atari 2600 and the Apple II, all the while telling a chilling and gruesome narrative about demons, cultists, and religion.

This has less to do with GTA in itself, Vermeij says, than with the fact that changes in computing capacity today simply aren't as dramatic as in the days of the very first PlayStation. It's becoming rare, he suggests, that you see a "jump" akin to GTA going 3D.

This character-driven RPG is all about the vibes of a classic tabletop experience. You'll build a band of unassuming heroes and take them on a journey where their development and interactions are all shaped by the decisions you make along the way. The procedural storytelling means you're unlikely to see the same adventure twice, so brace for a good amount of replayability.

This week marks the second anniversary of the Switch exclusive Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and while there's nothing planned for this occasion, it seems the game's character designer Masatsugu Saito has shared some new artwork on his social media page.
It's an illustration of the character Eunie, with some English text on the side to commemorate this two-year milestone. Saito previously shared a similar image marking the launch of the game in 2022.

Original story:
Earlier this month it was reported that Skibidi Toilet, the YouTube phenomenon, may be heading to film and television via director Michael Bay. Now Invisible Narratives, a production company co-owned by Bay, has apparently sent a DMCA takedown notice to Garry Newman, citing the large number of Skibidi Toilet games and assets advertised within Garry's Mod.

Characters can be permanently killed off due to your actions, and this blueprint has given past Supermassive works like Until Dawn and especially The Quarry (which boasted 186 different outcomes) plenty of replayability for fans who wan…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus launched to generally solid reviews on July 18, but those playing the hand-drawn action platformer on consoles will have to wait longer for any post-launch updates. Developer Squid Shock Studios revealed that last week's sudden closure of publisher Humble Games has adversely affected its ability to provide timely support to those versions of the game. 


In a statement posted to Twitter, Squid Shock Studios states that Humble Games' apparent closure last week, which saw its entire 36-person staff laid off by owner Ziff Davis in what it calls a “restructuring,” has adversely affected its ability to provide post-launch support for the console versions of Bō. The studio states that this is due to the game’s porting and QA support being tied to its deal with Humble. The PC version doesn't appear to be affected, with the studio currently working on updates for that version. Here’s Squid Shock Studios’ full statement:

July 29, 2024
Given the number of games Humble published, both released and upcoming, this likely isn’t the only game or studio to have this kind of wrench thrown into the works due to the sudden layoffs. If you're planning on picking up Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus, PC seems like the best way to go for the foreseeable future. 
Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus is inspired by Japanese folklore, with players controlling a warrior named Bō who descends from Heaven to fulfill an ancient prophecy. Armed with his shapeshifting Bō staff, players traverse a dreamlike, Metroidvania-inspired world battling monsters. Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Earlier this year, I flew to Malmö, Sweden, to get an exclusive first look at Star Wars Outlaws for our cover story. During that time, I played through an hour of early-game content, spoke with various members of the developers, and dove deep into the approach the studio behind The Division took when crafting its adventure in the galaxy far, far away. Several months have passed since my trip out to Sweden, and with Ubisoft hosting one final preview event prior to the game's August 30 release date, I traveled to Irvine, California, to get my hands on a longer section of the game.

Whereas AMD’s first take on driver-level frame generation – the same kind of framerate-roiding image generation trickery that FSR 3 and DLSS 3 are based around – came yoked to a barrel of jittering, stuttering, and visual artefacting issues, Fluid Motion Frames 2 is as smooth and you’d like. Without compromising on the ability to deploy it in theoretically any DirectX 11- or 12-based game, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Visions of Mana is a month away from release, but anxious players can get an early taste starting today, thanks to a free demo. Available now on PlayStation consoles, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, this playable slice lets players experience the game’s first chapter and a big boss fight.
The demo begins in the middle of Chapter 1 at Rime Falls and takes players through areas such as Fallow Steppe and Rhata Harbor. The chapter’s final boss, the Kraken, awaits the playable party of Val, Careena, and Morley. 


Unfortunately, save data will not transfer from the demo to the full game. Square Enix states this is because the final version of this section has been altered “for a more satisfying experience.” Instead, those with save data from the demo who purchase the full game will receive three weapons for Val upon reaching Chapter 1: Gladius, Falx, and Horn Lance. 
First revealed at The Game Awards 2023, Visions of Mana marks the first original Mana entry in 15 years. Set in a vibrant, semi-open, fully 3D world, the adventure stars Val, who travels to the Mana Tree alongside his lifelong friend Hinna. You can watch the game’s most recent trailer here. 
Visions of Mana launches on August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.]]></summary>

Peel back the curtains of American cultural hegemony however and you may find the true pulsing core of British comedy that lies beneath: innuendo. No American network is in a bidding war to import Vic and Bob or remake Bottom, and Carry On and Benny Hill are assumed to be anachronisms in our modern times, but Thank Goodness You're Here! enters the conversation with a nudge and a wink. It's a cheeky 2-3 hour adventure through a small northern town, and it's here to educate the entire world of our nation's obsession with sausages and bare bottoms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edwin spotted this game called Beta Decay that's not got a release date yet or anything, but looks very cool. It's being developed by Rotoscope Studios and it's a low-poly, 90s-inspired mix of dystopian RPG, survival, third and first-person shooter, with some roguelike bits slapped in there, as well. Whew, that's a lot. Potentially too much. But hey, I am here for something ambitious and interesting, of which it ticks both boxes.

Well, funnel all that anticipation into your mouse-clicking finger, because developers Square Enix have just put up a playable demo of the bright JRPG on Steam. I'm not sure how much the demo offers, as we're only told it includes "a section of the story, battles and exploration." But that's better than nothing, and with a full month before release, you have plenty of time to scope it out.

A Roomba capable of tunnelling through miles of procedurally generated, monster-infested crust so as to reorganise the Earth's core and bring about its ultimate objective - a sparkling living room. I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation. There are sprawling underground ecosystems to discover, yes, weird plants to harvest, fractious clumps of tentacles to appraise, avoid or slaughter. But all of these things are contemptible details to be swept up and bagged and thrown in the dumpster.

Oded Gabbay was also a maintainer of the new Intel Xe kernel graphics driver. That was a surprising move with Oded Gabbay having been at Intel / Habana Labs for 7+ years and oversaw the creation of the Linux kernel's "accel" accelerator subsystem and more while prior to that having been at Red Hat and AMD. Ofir Bitton was named the Habana Labs driver maintainer following that but now he announced he too is leaving Intel...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, we learned Sega and Amazon had partnered to create a live-action series based on the Like a Dragon (formerly Yakuza) series. Over the weekend, during the San Diego Comic-Con, the studio unveiled the first teaser trailer. 
Like A Dragon: Yakuza centers on Kazuma Kiryu (played by Takeuchi Ryoma) and follows his life during two time periods: 1995 and 2005. Set in the series’ fictional Tokyo district of Kamurochō, the trailer’s synopsis states the show “depicts the lives of fierce yet passionate gangsters and people” and will explore stories the games haven’t been able to. 


The six-episode series will be released on Prime Video in two parts, with the first three episodes premiering on October 24 and the last three arriving on November 1. It will be subbed and dubbed in 30 languages. Like a Dragon: Yakuza is directed by Take Masaharu (100 Yen Love).

"The controller's design features Astro's signature blue accents on the handles and buttons, carved in, sci-fi lines as well as the trademark playful pair of eyes on the touch pad," a PlayStation Blog post reads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Games Fest gave us the cinematic reveal of Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, an upcoming game based on the popular wizarding sport. A new trailer provides the first look at gameplay, including glimpses of a couple of modes and character customization. 
Quidditch Champions features a single-player career mode that allows players to climb the ranks of the sport. Each victory takes them to larger, grander venues, from Hogwarts to the Quidditch World Cup Stadium. An online competitive mode pits teams of real-life players against each other. Playable characters include Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Draco Malfoy, but you can also create and customize your own athletes using an extensive character creator. 


Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions launches digitally on September 3 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. A Switch version is planned to launch sometime this holiday. 
Quidditch Champions will be available in two versions. The Digital Standard Edition ($29.99) simply includes the base game. Digital and Physical Deluxe Editions ($39.99) include the game, House Packs for Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Gryffindor, and 2,000 in-game gold (earned in-game, as Quidditch Champions does not have microtransactions). The house pack includes a broom skin, travel school uniform, and crest emblem representing each house. The Physical Deluxe Edition goes on sale on November 8. 
Additionally, the Standard Edition will launch as a PlayStation Plus title on day one and will be available to subscribers until September 30.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller has posted a lengthy blog on Steam about the transition from 6v6 player matches in the first Overwatch to 5v5 in the poorly received free-to-play sequel. It's a juicy read for armchair designers and lapsed Overwatchers like myself, packing in analysis of class roles and the shift from the free choice of heroes to single hero picks and enforced team compositions.
In broad strokes, Keller summarises how the Overwatch experience has drifted away from "player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players". It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now "exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The story of Mortal Kombat games in recent years has been a mish-mash of double-crosses, weird friendships, and alternate dimension wobbles. They often feel like a casualty of Marvel movie bloat. Mortal Kombat 1 was marketed as a "reboot", for example, but is really just a continuation of previous nonsense, with developers NetherRealm saying "I don't know, stick a multiverse in it."

I return from holiday to find that Nic, James and the others have been experimenting with the use of Maw-shaped sock puppets to feed the Maw, in the hope that the Maw might form a filial bond with our news-wranglers. Unfortunately, we've learned in the process that anything that resembles the Maw behaves like the Maw. The sockpuppets were last seen tunnelling towards Los Angeles, like the sandworms in Dune. Sorry, America! Anyway, let's have a looksie at the PC game release sheets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1’s much-anticipated story expansion has been revealed, and it’s called Khaos Reigns. It unfolds after the events of the story campaign and centers on the invasion of Titan Havik from an alternate reality, who seeks to spread anarchy across all timelines.
The expansion's cinematic story introduces new playable characters, Noob Saibot and the now female Sektor and Cyrax. These three fighters make up half of Kombat Pack 2 and will be available when the DLC launches on September 24. 
In keeping with the tradition of prior games, the second half of Kombat Pack 2 features guest fighters from various films. Scream’s Ghostface, Terminator 2’s T-1000, and Conan the Barbarian are on the way, but there’s no release window for their arrival. Kombat Pack 2 comes included with Khaos Reigns and cannot be purchased as a standalone character bundle. 


Animalities are making their return as a free content update upon Khaos Reigns’ release. First introduced in Mortal Kombat 3, these beastial finishing moves see fighters morph into animals to eviscerate opponents. The trailer reveals Mileena can turn into a giant, horrifying praying mantis, for example, and a press release states every playable fighter will have an Animality (which would include the movie-born guest fighters for an interesting thought). 
Speaking of free content, today, owners will receive the MK95 Scorpion skin modeled after his appearance in the live-action 1995 Mortal Kombat film. 
Khaos Reigns launches digitally on September 24 for all platforms MK1 is available on. It will run for $49.99 on every platform except for Switch, where it costs $39.99. You can read our review of the base game here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix’s upcoming film adaptation of Bioshock is still happening, but it won’t be as grand as originally planned. During a panel at the San Diego Comic-Con yesterday, the film’s director and producer revealed the movie now has a reduced scope due to budget cuts.
As reported by Variety, producer Roy Lee (Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, The Lego Movie) revealed during Collider’s Producers on Producers panel that since the film’s announcement in February 2022, a regime change at Netflix has affected the project. Netflix’s film chief at that time, Scott Stuber, has since been replaced by Dan Lin. While Stuber emphasized large spending for an expansive film slate, Lin has scaled back to a more modest strategy. This means the Bioshock film’s budget has been reduced, with director Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) stating its been reworked as a “more personal film”. 
“The new regime has lowered the budgets,” Roy Lee said. “So we’re doing a much smaller version. … It’s going to be a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project.”
A partnership between Netflix, Bioshock publisher Take-Two Interactive, and Vertigo Entertainment is bringing the Bioshock film to life. In addition to Lawrence and Lee serving as director and producer, respectively, Michael Green (Loga, Blade Runner 2049, American Gods) was announced as its writer in August 2022.

"If you play that right now," he said, "there is no compass, no map, literally the quests are like 'go to the third tree on the right and walk 50 paces west'... And if you did that now, no one would play it. Very few people would play it." Well sir, have you heard of a little open world RPG called Dread Delusion? It's pretty good. And what's more, it has just added a whole new area with - let me see - a giant floating squid creature with an entire town of citizens living inside its shell.

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles starred in several iconic video games throughout the franchise's 40-year history, but none are more beloved than the beat 'em up entries like the 1989 arcade game and Turtles in Time. However, that genre often lacks the depth modern gamers desire. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate takes various cues from recent popular games – specifically Supergiant's smash hit, Hades – en route to modernizing the action-packed hack-and-slash gameplay the Turtles have been known for since their earliest days in the medium. The result is a fun rogueli…]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-07-26T14:15:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Date Everything, those looking for romance don’t need to look any further than their refrigerator, smoke alarm, or dining room table. That’s because this wacky sandbox dating sim by developer Sassy Chap is all about forming relationships with everyday household objects that, it turns out, are actually pretty hot.
The game bestows players with special “Dateviator” glasses that allow them to speak with objects and see them in their true, absurdly attractive forms. Dozens of objects await your affection – even elements like air and water can be courted – and branching dialogue can lead to three relationship resolutions for each character (Love, Friend, Hate). Whatever you decide will be reflected in the ever-changing 3D overworld that is your house. 


Date Everything boasts over 100 voiced characters played by performers that include Felicia Day (Critical Role, Supernatural), Johnny Yong Bosch (Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Bleach), and Grey DeLisle (Scooby-Doo, Avatar: The Last Airbender). Given the huge amount of speaking roles, Date Everything boasts 1.2 million words and 70,000 voiced lines. 
Date Everything looks delightfully silly, but it unfortunately doesn’t have a release window. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Anyway, yeah, they don't appeal to me at all. Not as much as "Dateviator" glasses, which come courtesy of Sassy Chap Games and their upcoming dating sim Date Everything! As the title suggests: you date everything, from kitchen sponges to lampshades, as they morph into absolute fitties once you've donned the special specs.

An attendee at San Diego Comic-Con was looking at a set of figures based on characters from the series when they saw that the plaque accompanying the figures was labelled with the words "Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 & 2 Remastered" alongside the logo for Crystal Dynamics. I suppose if you throw a coin enough times, one day it will land on the side with the head of a jawless vampire on it.

Nobody Wants to Die’s world terrifies me. Set only a few hundred years in the future, it paints a dystopian society where humanity has unlocked the secret to immortality, but instead of eternal bliss, it paved the way for the government to have full legal control of our bodies. The world is as fascinating as it is upsetting, and a high-profile murder becomes the catalyst for a gripping (though not always actively engaging) mystery within it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl, the beautifully grotty sci-fi shooter sequel from Ukrainian studio GSC Game World, has been delayed once again. It’s a relatively good-spirited delay, though: first off, it’s not that long, with the previously planned September 5th launch pushed back just a few weeks to November 20th. There’s also clever little in-universe announcement video (one which gives the fourth wall a study kick on its way out), and an accompanying promise of a meaty "developer deep dive video", set to reveal much more of the game’s radioactive hellscape on August 12th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl has suffered yet another delay. The long-awaited post-apocalyptic shooter was slated to arrive on September 5 but will now launch on November 20 to give developer GSC Game World more time to address technical issues.
Additionally, the studio announced it will release its first-ever Developer Deep Dive video to give a comprehensive behind-the-scenes look at the game. The video will feature new gameplay footage, overviews of its world and locations, a full walkthrough of a story quest, and developer interviews. It is being made in collaboration with Xbox and will premiere on August 12. 


The delay marks another bump in the road for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl. It was formally unveiled in 2020 after years of teases at the Xbox Games Showcase but has hit snags along the way, including garnering backlash for now-canceled plans for NFT implementation. The biggest disruption was Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC Game World is based, which upended development and forced the staff to relocate to Prague, Czech Republic (though some team members actively fought and sadly perished in the war). Despite all of this, the game has managed to come together, and we even played it during Summer Game Fest this year.
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl launches on November 20 for Xbox Series X/S and PC. It will launch day one on Xbox Game Pass. If nothing else, this delay gives players more time to catch up with the Xbox re-release of the original games that arrived earlier this year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The immersive sim has seen a revival in recent years. Not only from larger studios like Arkane, keeping the faith alive with their time loops and space stations, but also from a bunch of smaller developers bravely exploring a typically ambitious genre. RPS has always had an affinity for these systemically luxuriant simulations, historically lauding the likes of the original Deus Ex as the best game ever made. But given everything that has come since, is that still the case? Only one way to find out: make a big list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Animal caretaking sim Zoochosis is about being an ordinary zookeeper working in an ordinary zoo. What's that? There are no ordinary zoos? My mistake. Let me start again. Animal caretaking horror game Zoochosis is about being a stressed-out zookeeper in a hideous zoo where the giraffes have tendrils coming out of their chests and the kangaroos have rows of chattering teeth in their marsupial pouch. There, got it right in the end. We've known about the development of this terror-heavy tourist attraction since its announcement early this year. But now the upcoming horror sim has been given an autumn release date in a new trailer.

That’s thanks to initial production units not being up to standards, an AMD executive admitted, and comes shortly after rivals Intel copped to a potentially chip-killing fault in their latest Core processors. Ah well, there’s always – oh, wait. No. Those are the only two.

The poems I've engaged with the most are those read out during wedding ceremonies, those that pop-up before the start of a horror game, or The Tiger by 6-year old Nael that occasionally pops up as I'm doomscrolling. But thanks to the multiplayer web game "fridge poetry", where you drag words to create poems, I might become a day-to-day poem guy. Going off my first effort, I don't think many will appreciate my career switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grit And Valor 1949 certainly evokes the tactics of Into The Breach, with its stompy machinery and floating tile battlegrounds. But, despite all appearances, this one isn’t actually turn-based at all. A tiley, tiny real time strategy then? Aye, and one that’s actually pretty frantic as it happens. Missions are snappy, intense skirmishes. You’ll fight off waves while trying to protect your useless, freeloading command vehicle. This threat, combined with on-the-fly tactical consider-me-do's like utilising cover and keeping rock-paper-scissors matchups in your favour ends up spawning something quite distinct. Please, do stomp on, preferably with less hypens for all our sakes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re not far off from the August 9 premiere of Borderlands, and Lionsgate is giving the final hard sell for the upcoming adaptation in the form of a new trailer.
Like the first game, Borderlands centers on a group of gun-toting Vault hunters searching for treasure on the planet Pandora. They also get roped up to save a mysterious girl who holds the key to a great power. If you’re still not sure what to make of the film after watching its first trailer, hopefully, this last preview will help you decide whether or not you’ll be making the trip to theaters in a couple of weeks to see it. 


Borderlands is directed by Eli Roth and stars Cate Blanchett (Lilith), Kevin Hart (Roland), Arianna Greenblatt (Tiny Tina), Jack Black (Claptrap), Edgar Ramírez (Atlas), Florian Munteanu (Krieg), Gina Gershon (Moxxi), and Jamie Lee Curtis (Tannis).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Games has acquired Player First Games, the developer of its cross-over platform fighter MultiVersus. The price of the sale was not disclosed, but according to a press release, Player First Games will continue to operate under its current leadership of co-founders Tony Huynh and Chris White. 
The announcement comes only a couple of months after MultiVersus' relaunch on May 28. Player First Games served as a work-for-hire studio on the game, and Warner Bros. is apparently pleased enough with its performance to formally bring the studio in-house. The move comes only a few days after Warner Bros. shuttered the entire mobile division of Mortal Kombat developer Netherrealm Studios. 
“We have worked with Player First Games over several years to create and launch MultiVersus, and we are very pleased to welcome this talented team to Warner Bros. Games,” said David Haddad, president of Warner Bros. Games. “The bright and creative team at Player First Games adds to our extensive development capabilities.”
“Our team is excited to join the Warner Bros. Games family, and we feel that this will be great for MultiVersus overall,” Huynh said. “We are working to make the MultiVersus game experience the best it can be and having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players.”
MultiVersus is a 2v2 spin on the Super Smash Bros. blueprint that pits a variety of characters from different Warner Bros. properties against each other. It was first launched in open beta in 2022 (read our review of that version here), then taken down months later to be rebuilt and expanded before returning this year. MultiVersus recently kicked off its second content season, and it has received new fighters such as The Joker, Agent Smith, Jason Voorhees, and the recently announced Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice.]]></summary>

For me, though, and possibly many others, I simply don't think this mix ever truly captures what makes even the simplest of tower defence games so captivating.

Coming from Dark Horse Comics, a publication company responsible for all kinds of video game related books and comics, including a similar art book for 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition, "The Art of Dragon Age: The Veilguard" will likely feature official game art, concept art, and more.

The blame, Intel told PCG, lies with the same kind of pernicious force that fills your Twitter feed with pillocks, has turned Google into an AI-sodden shell of its former self, and keeps making Spotify suggest I listen to ninety different electroswing arrangements of Everybody Wants to Be a Cat.

This spiffier version of the 2011 console game was announced earlier this year. Aside from a few costumes and NG+, it's basically the original package you know and - if you’re one of the fifteen people that bought the original - love.

The Casting of Frank Stone is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and we learned some exclusive details about the upcoming horror game during our trip to Behaviour Interactive’s studio in Montreal. Speaking to Supermassive creative director Steve Goss, he clued us in on the game’s most central and unique mechanic: the Super 8mm camera. 
Set within the Dead by Daylight universe, the game story unfolds in the summer of 1980 in the unassuming small town of Cedar Hills. It follows a group of teenagers who set out to film a horror movie at an abandoned …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 has been one of 2024’s biggest successes, and developer Arrow Head Games is prepping to launch its most substantial update yet. Escalation of Freedom is an upcoming update that adds new missions, new hazards, and, of course, new bugs.
Arriving on August 6, Escalation of Freedom challenges players with a new level 10 difficulty and introduces new mission objectives, such as locating and extracting a crying larva that attracts Terminids. The game also receives new, larger fortress-like outposts for players to capture. The swamp biome gets a spookier facelift, and acid storms can now reduce the armor for players and enemies so both sides take greater damage. New Terminids and Automatons will clash with players, and Arrow Head Games teases that Escalation of Freedom features more surprises players will have to discover on their own. Check out the trailer for a look at what's to come. 


Escalation of Freedom also brings quality-of-life improvements including an update to address grief kicking. Per the PlayStation Blog, the game is getting "a system where if a player is kicked, they will spawn into a new session as the host with all of the team’s loot from their previous session. All items can now be picked up by the player before extraction. The squad doing the kicking will see a message in the chat widget that a player has been kicked, yet their loot remains unchanged."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III will be available on Xbox Game Pass tomorrow, July 24. This marks the next big Activision Blizzard title to join the service. 
The move comes less than a year after Modern Warfare III launched last November and represents the fruit of Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year. It’s also the biggest AB title to appear on Game Pass since Diablo IV was added to the library in March.


This gives subscribers a chance to check out last year’s entry before 2024’s installment, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, launches on Game Pass on October 25. It also comes ahead of the new Game Pass price increases and subscription tier arriving in September, a move the FTC has taken issue with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the heyday of Sierra's adventure game years, there was a series called Space Quest that featured an intergalactic janitor named Roger Wilco. The series was more satirical than King's Quest, less preachy than Police Quest, and not quite as adult as Leisure Suit Larry. Spearheaded by Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe - a pair of devs who called themselves "Two Guys from Andromeda" - Space Quest was renowned for its humour, and there was a nice sense of progression throughout most of the series, with Roger Wilco leveling up from working class spaceman to the head of his own Star Trek ship.

Developer Behaviour Interactive agreed and enlisted the cinematic storytelling expertise of Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, The Quarry) to create an original story in the DBD universe. That game became The Casting of Frank Stone, and it terrorizes Game Informer’s cover this month.


We traveled to Behaviour’s studio in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to play an early slice of the game and speak to lead developers from both studios to learn how the collaboration came to be. The story also reveals some of the DBD-style mechanics remixing Supermassive’s traditional…]]></summary>

Even if the fallen culture you’ll defend against waves of gribblies offers fascinatingly few concrete details on its origins, there’s a lithe and impressionistic otherworldliness and use of colour in Cataclismo’s art that evokes unearthed layers of history. Also, everyone is just so gosh darn likeable, with their foppish hats plopped atop stretched bodies, and dialogue that remains resolute, chirpy, and eager, even when you’re click-marching these poor folk straight to their deaths.
Still, none of this will stop me will sacrificing every last man, woman, and child of these beleaguered warriors if it means preserving a single one of my immaculately crafted staircases.

I can only imagine it controls a bit like Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons, but with added ragdoll jollity. We'll know next week, when it releases on Steam.

I’ve spent a non-zero amount of time this week compiling a wishlist for potential Stardew Valley-likes that also let me keep pets. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to play, but I knew I was burnt out on both stabbing and shooting, and wanted something light and colourful with a solid loop that I could veg out (pun intended) with at the end of the day. I even went to so far as to create a chap named Karrot King in Stardew before quitting in disgust because I couldn’t easily access carrot seeds.
I cannot in good conscious claim that I manifested such a videogame - that was the work of Skyreach Studio. However, this is the internet, so I will both take credit for it and offer you an exclusive discount on my course. While I’m waiting for your membership fee to arrive, I’ll be playing Critter Crops. It’s a witchy farming sim in which you grow odd pets and cast spells from flesh-bound grimoires. One of the verbs it offers on its Steam page is 'noodle'. Apologies to all the other games on my wishlist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3’s latest patch was due to launch in closed beta yesterday, but Larian have decided to give it a bit more time in the oven due to bugs. Namely, a bug that caused passive rolls - like those that detect traps - to stop working.
Happily, if you hadn’t already registered to take part in the beta, you now have more time to sign up. Scroll down a bit on the RPG’s Steam page and click the ‘Request Access’ button.

But I still have this one last feature to publish, and it's about Bellara Lutare, the Dalish elf and member of the new Veil Jumpers faction in the game. During my visit to BioWare's Edmonton, Canada, office earlier this year, I checked out the game's expansive character creator, its in medias res prologue, and the first mission after said prologue.
Though BioWare released a big look at Veilguard's prologue via a 20-minute gameplay trailer last month, they haven't released much about that subsequent mission, where you meet and recruit your first companion, Bellara. I learned a lot about this character, and knowing I was one of the first outside of the stud…]]></summary>

Kunitsu-Gami is the kind of wonderful, left-field Capcom release we don’t see often these days. Bound to be a cult classic in the future, Path of the Goddess is original and does not lean on any of Capcom’s established properties. Instead, it relies on an admittedly difficult-to-explain but well-executed gameplay loop that I found hard to put down with an art style that is equally challenging to look away from.
Players take on the role of Soh, a masked swordsperson bound to protect the divine maiden Yoshiro as she slowly dances along the path …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MultiVersus has two new fighters on the way in the form of Jack from Cartoon Network/Adult Swim's beloved animated series Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice of, well, Beetlejuice and its upcoming sequel (don’t make me write it a third time). The game is also getting a ranked mode.
Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice are part of the Season 2: Back in Time content, which kicks off tomorrow, July 23. Jack becomes available at launch, letting players cut down opponents using his signature katana (as you can see in the trailer below). Beetlejuice arrives later in the season at an unknown date, so we don't get to see him in action just yet. However, Warner Bros. confirms he’ll become playable before the September 6 theatrical premiere of Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. 


Season 2 also introduces a new ranked mode, allowing players to battle for leaderboard points to earn exclusive rank-based cosmetics. A new map, the Warner Bros. Water Tower, will also be added.
MultiVersus is available now on PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as PC. Since its return, the game has been bolstered by new fighters such as The Joker, The Matrix's Agent Smith, and Friday the 13th's Jason Voorhees.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps the most unexpected announcement at EVO 2024 was the reveal that 2003’s SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos is being re-released. Not only does this make it available on modern platforms with new bells and whistles, but you can play it right now. 
The game was originally launched in 2003 for the Neo Geo arcade before it was ported to PlayStation 2 (in Japan) and Xbox in the U.S. It pits 36 fighters from SNK franchises such as The King of Fighters, Samurai Shodown, and Metal Slug 2 against Capcom fighters from series like Street Fighter, Mega Man, Darkstalkers, and more.


SVC Chaos now features quality-of-life updates such as a hitbox viewer, rollback netcode for online play, and an art gallery. It also makes formerly secret characters Athena and Red Arremer available from the start. The game's surprise launch on Steam on July 20 followed its reveal, and it comes to PlayStation 4 and Switch today. You can pick it up now for $19.99.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On an almost weekly basis, Fortnite announces new crossover events, adding characters to its Battle Royale, Lego, and Festival modes. Whether it's a fictional character like Jack Sparrow or a real person like Ariana Grande, it's hard to find a corner of pop culture the game hasn't touched. These crossovers, however, are almost always exclusive to characters, but Fortnite players don't always have to traverse the Battle Royale map on foot – there are vehicles as well. Today's crossover comes in the form of a particularly polygonal vehicle: Tesla's Cybertruck.

@tesla Cybertruck in Fortnite tomorrow! pic.twitter.com/CA8xuYQreS
July 22, 2024
For the unfamiliar, the Cybertruck is one of Tesla's latest electric vehicles, a futuristic-looking pickup truck with a distinct shape and stainless steel exterior. It's a vehicle that, quite frankly, always looked like it belonged in a video game, both because of its angular aesthetic and the word "cyber" in its name.
It's unclear exactly how the truck will be present in Fortnite, as the trailer doesn't include any actual gameplay, but it's likely a vehicle skin that can be purchased from the in-game store. With car skins attached, whenever a player enters a vehicle, it will morph into the selected skin of their choice, and it's available in Battle Royale and Rocket Racing alike. This is purely speculation, however – it's equally possible the vehicle is introduced in some other limited-time event.
The Cybertruck will be added to Fortnite tomorrow. If you drive one, just pray your opposing players aren't wielding a steel ball.
how do you feel about the Cybertruck being added to Fortnite? what other vehicles would you like to see in the game? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tekken 8’s next Season 1 fighter was revealed during Evo this weekend, and it’s none other than Heihachi Mishima. The mainstay villain has apparently survived his presumed death (again) and is ready to reclaim his throne. 
A cinematic trailer rolls out the red carpet for Heihachi, setting up his return after he was seemingly killed (i.e., tossed into a volcanic lava river) in Tekken 7. The video doesn’t explain how Heihachi managed not to melt into goop, but he does sport a Kazuya-esque scar on his chest now, so he didn’t walk away completely unscathed. 


Heihachi becomes available sometime this fall. He follows Eddy Gordo and Lidia Sobieska, who joined Tekken 8 in the spring (i.e., July 25) and summer, respectively, leaving one fighter left for the winter season. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions automatically receive these fighters, and each can also be purchased individually for $7.99.

Movement is the entire basis for the puzzles in Arranger, and is hard to explain without showing you (if you're able to watch the trailer that will be helpful). The world of Arranger is divided into a grid, and you don't move the main character, feisty misfit kid Jemma, across the squares. Rather, imagine that the row or column Jemma is on becomes a travelator, and you control the direction and speed of it. Jemma stands still and you move the ground, and anything on it left, right, up or down - like How To Say Goodbye but with more squares. It's one of those things that makes sense when you're doing it, trust me.

He was last seen with his loving son Kazuya, who threw him into a volcano. Of course, to be fully submerged in impossibly hot liquid rock is merely a long-running family prank for the cast of this 3D fighting game, sort of like forcing your granddad to do the ice bucket challenge, but with lava. Nobody truly expected the horn-haired headbutter to be fully removed from the series. But I am a little surprised to see him back so soon.

Now FlatOut, FlatOut 2 and FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage have all received an update on Steam to add Workshop support, Steam Deck verified status, improved performance, and in the case of FlatOut 2, re-enabled online multiplayer.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took issue with these changes in a filing yesterday to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
In case you missed it, Microsoft revealed a new tier called Xbox Game Pass Standard, a $15 monthly subscription for new members that excludes day-one releases, EA Play, PC Game Pass, and cloud gaming. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes those perks, will have its monthly price raised from $17 to $20. Xbox Game Pass Core, which only offers online play and a smaller library, is raising its yearly sub from $60 to $75 (the $10 monthly fee remains unchanged).

Deep in the Dark Place of Alan Wake 2 there is a forest that is not a forest - a zig-zag tunnel adorned with murals of a grisly woodland scene. Entering that tunnel, you find yourself sealed in at either end. But the mural suggests a way out: it changes when you turn around, following an unspoken narrative. It's a device as delicate as the graffiti elsewhere in the Dark Place is obnoxious. In hindsight, it feels like an example of "metsänpeitto", a concept from Finnish folklore about forests which, as writer Sinikka Annala explains, saturates the design of Alan Wake 2. It's a fascinating idea I'd love certain much larger, less intriguing video game worlds to learn from.

For instance, it's thanks to her that I know and am excited about Roots of Yggdrasil, a roguelike deck-and-city-builder which casts you as a posse of vikings in a flying longship, touching down on floating islands to found a quick settlement and harvest some magic before the apocalypse - here known as the Ginnungagap, a swirling purple void - catches up with them.
Katharine called it "a real grower" before the early access release in January, likening it to both Dorfromantik and The Banished Vault - a chalk and cheese comparison if ever I heard one. Well rejoice, perverted chalk-and-cheese mixers, because Roots of Yggdrasil now has a 1.0 release date - 6th September 2024.

Following the Steam and PC Game Pass releases yesterday, there are widespread reports of heavy stuttering spoiling the fun; I’ve given both versions a test, and indeed, Flintlock does have a serious case of the framerate stammers. Especially the Game Pass build, which is significantly worse for it.

He shouldn't have slept with the Queen's sister, for example. He shouldn't have insisted his lover subsequently pay him for a confession to absolve herself of the guilt accrued from sleeping with him. He shouldn't have felt safe in a room next to the Queen, a woman described as "reckless" in her character traits, and who is perilously close to having a nervous breakdown. This, my holy friend, is how your bed chamber becomes a raging inferno. 
By the end of my first game of Norland, the village of Nandos (you can name your own settlements) is covered in more blood than the back end of the bard's best work. In storytelling terms, it is a tragedy. In terms of fantasy management games? It is great fun. The failure cascade as waterslide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paramount has canceled Halo, the live-action TV adaptation of Xbox’s flagship franchise, after two seasons. The show’s second season premiered on Paramount+ earlier this year. 
According to The Hollywood Reporter’s sources, Halo showrunners Amblin, Xbox, and 343 Industries are seeking a new outlet for a potential third season, with Paramount reportedly supporting the move. 
“Paramount+ can confirm that ‘Halo’ will not move forward with a third season on the service,” Paramount said in a statement. “We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work. We wish everyone the best going forward.”
After years of development, Halo premiered on Paramount+ on March 24, 2022, and stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief. Season 1 received a mixed reception from critics and fans, with many lambasting it for deviating from the games’ established lore and characterizations. Season 2, which premiered earlier this year on February 8 and concluded on March 21, was received more positively, with several critics and viewers hailing it as a dramatic improvement. Season 1 currently sits at 70% on Rotten Tomatoes/61 on Metacritic. Season 2 garnered a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes/64 on Metacritic.

Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn does its best to provide an epic adventure despite clear limitations. This semi-open world action game’s bright spots include an exciting premise, a unique tag-team spin on Souls-inspired combat, and an entertaining exploration mechanic. Unfortunately, it falls short of providing a wholly satisfying or polished adventure, resulting in a respectable but flawed revenge quest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like many an addled follower of the games industry, I have recently fallen under the spell of Balatro, and especially, its jokers. The mechanics and overall presentation may be exquisite, but it’s the thrill of discovering another mutant jester modifier that has me lunging for the Steam Deck in my sleep. Well, now those jokers have competition: ducks. Step or rather waddle forward Placid Plastic Deck - A Quiet Quest, a quacked-up card battler which somehow takes inspiration from both the Pokémon series and Inscryption.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many moons ago, I remember having a chat with Brendy about FPS Metro Exodus’s choice to have characters frequently speak over each other in conversation. It’s something I always appreciate in films (Brendy mentioned Fleabag, I brought up Shane Meadows), and although the flow of many of Exodus’ scenes were quite awkward, it was still refreshing to see a game break away from the common, unnatural back-and-forth line delivery. Bioshock and Judas’s Ken Levine has a name for this - “turn-based dialogue.” According to Levine, it’s “one of the biggest problems” in the way games portray conversations.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/18/forestrike-is-a-puzzle-like-kung-fu-game-by-the-makers-of-olija"/>
        <updated>2024-07-19T01:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skeleton Crew, the team behind the 2021 side-scrolling action game Olija, and Devolver Digital have revealed an intriguing new project: Forestrike. The game sports a unique premise: as a martial artist, you can foresee and simulate future combat encounters, allowing you to perfect your execution before laying a finger on anyone. 
The fighter battles to free a captive Emperor from an evil Admiral, and doing so involves mastering Foresight, a meditative technique to mentally predict and play out battles before they unfold (for Dragon Ball fans, think of image training). Gameplay-wise, players are pitted against different combinations of enemy types. They use Foresight to play the battle in advance to find the optimal approach to defeating them while taking little to no damage.
For example, using Foresight may help you learn to dodge a charging enemy so they trample an ally, then finish him off by lobbing a nearby weapon. Determining the best approach may take several Foresight attempts, but once you have your strategy down, you then execute the battle in real-time. After winning a fight, a replay feature allows you to rewatch it using slow-motion and other editing tools to study your strategy or generally feel cool about your performance. 


Using the Foresight makes Forestrike's combat feel puzzle-like in its execution, and winning fights as flawlessly as possible matters. That’s because you have limited health to fight through multiple stages in a roguelike-style branching map. Along the way, you’ll earn upgrades that carry over to future runs, as well as perks called Techniques that enhance your abilities. 
Forestrike is a neat spin on the action genre, and it's slated to launch sometime in 2025 for Switch and PC.]]></summary>

Vessel of Hatred ushers in a wave of change for Diablo IV. The game's first expansion takes players to the new jungle region of Nahantu and, most importantly, introduces the new Spiritborn class. I visited the Blizzard campus to go hands-on with the Spiritborn and speak to some of the designers about how it created a class unlike any other in the Diablo series. After spending a couple of hours playing, the Spiritborn may already be my new favorite class in the game.

It's arriving on Steam sometime soon and it's probably worth a looksy if you're after biohazard disposal with a tactical twist.

And yet, I find myself wanting to get hyper-specific when writing about the action of Corpus Edax, because it has an incredibly gratifying metal pipe sound, whether you’re stealthy wrapping it around the back of a blissfully unaware fool’s noggin, or lobbing it directly at their knee caps. In fact - although the game does have a delightful array of classic verbs, along with a few surprises - many of them are simply conducive to a stirring round of fisticuffs, to write my most British sentence of the week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Splitgate’s combination of Halo-esque first-person shooter with Portal-inspired portal jumping mechanics made it quite the sensation when it launched in open beta in 2021. With its servers regularly buckling under the weight of its players, the game caught lightning in a bottle but petered out when the game finally went 1.0 and simultaneously ceased receiving support in 2022. Now, developer 1047 Games is back with Splitgate 2 and aims to refine the original's winning formula. 


Like the first game, Splitgate 2 will be a free-to-play 4v4 shooter that arms players with a portal gun and more traditional firearms to battle each other in aerial, dimension-hopping combat. The sequel is being built in Unreal Engine 5 and has a new emphasis on factions. Players can suit up to compete in the Sol Splitgate League as members of one of three groups: the agile Aeros, the time-manipulating Meridian, or the trigger-happy Sabrask. According to a press release, “Factions will grant players the ability to choose and progress based on their preferred gameplay style or competitive strategies.” Splitgate 2 will feature new objective-based game modes across new arenas and upgradable weapons. 
Additionally, a special Splitgate 2 companion app is available to download now. The app lets players explore the game’s universe through collectibles that unlock in-game rewards when Splitgate 2 launches. It also features quizzes and a new comic series called Splitgate: The Games We Play. The five-issue series will flesh out the backstory of the characters featured in the announcement trailer and additional issues will arrive monthly. 
Splitgate 2 launches in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Check out the first batch of screenshots below.]]></summary>
