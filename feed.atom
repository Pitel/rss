        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie has officially announced an unexpected collaboration for both Destiny players and The Witcher fans. CD PROJEKT RED will partner up with Bungie to debut Witcher-inspired content in Destiny 2. The crossover is set to launch alongside Destiny 2's Season of the Wish on November 28. 


This isn't the first time Destiny has seen a crossover with another franchise, but it's certainly among the more high-profile, right along with the previous Sony crossover. That collaboration introduced armor sets inspired by God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Ghost of Tsushima. The next set of Guardian cosmetics adds more armor to your closet, along with a finisher, Ghost shell, ship, Sparrow, and emote.

The MX Keys S basically feels like the best laptop keyboard you've ever tried, with quiet scissor switches that are quick to operate with precision. The graphite colour scheme looks pretty neat too. 
At £85, rather than the regular £110, this is a pretty good value for a full-size wireless keyboard that supports both 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth, making it a good fit for Mac, PC and many more devices besides.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It appears the next Subnautica game is diving deep sometime in early 2025. It's been roughly two years since fans dove into the chilly waters of the series, and it feels like it's nearly time to strap back into that diving suit once more. And then get eaten by a Reaper Leviathan.


As spotted by RPS, the game's potential launch window came out of a recent financial report by publisher Krafton. Details are sparse and will continue to be so until the company is ready to announce the game proper. It's currently unknown if the next Subnautica in 2025 is set to be a spin-off or sequel, but judging by the development time, it's likely going to be the latter. Of course, that's just speculation. But isn't it fun to imagine?


Yeah, I take it back. Image via Unknown Worlds Entertainment


The next Subnautica game set to terrify in 2025


The next Subnautica has been in the works for some time now. We last heard of it back in April 2022 when developer Unknown Worlds advertised a Senior Narrative Designer position on Twitter. Since then, fans of its signature undersea horror themes have been waiting to know more. If the game is scheduled for a release in the first half of 2025, I wouldn't expect to see any reveal until Summer Game Fest next year at the very earliest. It should at least make for a good addition to a prediction list. 


As noted by RPS, the financial report covered some future Krafton projects. Project Gold Rush is an "Action-Adventure Sandbox" set to launch in the first half of 2025, much like the new Subnautica. The publisher also listed a Dark and Darker mobile game, Project inZOI, and Project Black Budget all under development for 2024.

If what you wanted was to fling swarms of AT-ATs against swarms of X-Wings then, yeah, you could do that. Darth Vader versus entire platoons of rebel soldiers? That too.

Why am I talking about a 2006 RTS? Because it just got a new official patch to make it run in 64-bit and fix a number of bugs.

Before I was even in high school, I had a binder full of designs for a game I had dreamt up, but I never really got the means to even attempt to make it. Programming has always bored me, and I tend to get frustrated with art. Even attempts at small projects to just motivate myself with some visible progress fizzled.


The closest I got was a brief stint writing for a game company. I co-wrote a game that is still unannounced and may, at this point, be canceled. I’m not sure. However, I got the gig at the lowest point of my life, and it gave me something to focus on. I’ve always wanted to return to doing it, but again, there’s a wall I have to climb over to make any progress.

That's because it's a Metroidvania platformer and, when it is time for back-and-forth combat, you're not choosing attacks from a menu. Instead you're stringing together combos in real-time, then when your alotted attack time is over, you're parrying enemy assaults with rhythmic flair. 

So, turn-based, yes, but with a twist. It's also out today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Epic Game Store's Black Friday sale 2023 has kicked off, bringing plenty of discounts for games. Most notably, Epic is offering a 33% off coupon during the sale, which can be applied toward Alan Wake 2. 


The Epic Coupon can be used throughout the event. It lets buyers take 33% off any checkout purchase that rings up to $14.99 or more. Even though Alan Wake 2 is already set at a reasonable $49.99, using the coupon during the sale will drop it to an even more reasonable $33.49 USD. I may be biased, but that's a damn good deal for a very recently launched GOTY contender. It's a fantastic game that can last you up to around 30 hours. 





Alan Wake 2 and more are on sale at the Epic Games Store


The Epic Coupon seems to be pretty much the sale of the Epic Games Store Black Friday sale. You can find a host of games at a discount, but the coupon itself seems to be what's taking off the big, meaty chunks. The rules of the coupon state that it can be used at checkout, and you'll get another every time you "complete an eligible transaction." And by that, Epic means any purchase, solo or combined, that adds up to $14.99 or more. Likely, that means you can apply it to Assassin's Creed Mirage Deluxe Edition, even though it's already listed at 20% off. 


Having both games already on such a steep sale isn't such bad news. The year has been full of bangers, so some may at least appreciate the softer hit on their wallets. 


The Epic Games Store Black Friday sale lasts from November 21 at 11 am ET to November 28 at 10:59 am ET. 


At the other side of the aisle, the Steam Store has also started Black Friday shenanigans with its Autumn Sale, which also lasts until November 28.

In a recent Reddit AMA, the developer said “adjustments” for this outfit are “in the pipeline.” In response to one user asking what the studio’s plans were regarding the “problems [the skin] has brought forward to [Modern Warfare 3] from [Modern Warfare 2],” it responded confirming the fixes were incoming, and that the Gaia and Gaia Blackcell Operator skins will be disabled in a future update until the changes are ready to be deployed.


The Gaia / “Groot” skin has been plaguing Modern Warfare 2 players since its launch in late-September alongside Season 6. While it does closely resemble the tree-like creature in the Guardians of the Galaxy films, it’s advertised as “an earthen form of Mother Nature herself.” It would seem the major issue most players have with this skin is that, due to the nature of being a bundle of tree branches, the camouflage allowed it to blend in too well with its surroundings.


The alternate skin for Nova was adjusted in an October 11 patch which “added VFX to base skin that reflects the same level of visibility as BlackCell skin,” and “improved visibility compensation,” but some fans aren’t happy. Since the skin has made the jump to Modern Warfare 3, fans have taken to Reddit to accuse the skin of being pay-to-win and questioning how it hasn’t been fixed yet. Here’s hoping the team at Sledgehammer Games gives this skin a complete overhaul and alleviates players’ concerns. Because I think the skin looks really neat — if only it could not be broken on a fundamental level.

Another thing I'm a sucker for is fairytale-inspired stories. Whether a work takes obvious inspiration from Alice in Wonderland or Little Red Riding Hood, I take note of it. 


Little Goody Two Shoes combines both concepts into a game, taking a cottagecore lesbian life sim and combining it with exploration-based survival horror. I never knew I needed a mashup like this until this game. 


While Little Goody Two Shoes has some flaws, it might be my favorite horror game of 2023. It's a bold statement when regarding the Dead Space and Resident Evil 4 remakes, but AstralShift's Pocket Mirror pre…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CCP Games has revealed that the "First Strike" live event for EVE Vanguard will kick off on December 7. The online playtest is for EVE Vanguard, the upcoming sandbox FPS module that will connect to the long-running MMORPG EVE Online.

Persistent Universe with EVE Online


According to CCP Games, EVE Vanguard will connect directly to the EVE universe from Day One with a persistent new world. Players in Vanguard will be able to fuel the ongoing wars in the EVE Online MMO allowing players to add corruption to the frontlines, deliver vital resources to the EVE economy, and complete contracts to alter the tides of battles.


The playtest will last for four days, beginning at midday UTC on December 7 and ending at midday UTC on December 11. Any EVE Online Omega subscriber will have the opportunity to join the playtest by choosing EVE Vanguard character profile via the EVE launcher once the playtest begins.


New Patch for Havoc


Alongside news of the EVE Vanguard playtest, CCP Games also revealed an upcoming patch for the latest EVE Online expansion, Havoc. Highlights of the patch include:



Lifted restrictions on EverMark trading, reinstating players’ in-game transaction freedoms.


Dynamic, in-game music that adapts to the unfolding narratives of corruption and suppression.


Quality of Life improvements for Corporation Projects.



I'm excited to see what EVE Vanguard is all about. Years ago when CCP Games tried this before with Dust 514, the concept itself was very intriguing but felt like maybe it was a bit before its time. Now, however, technology is in the right place to make a truly persistent online shooter that ties in directly with an ongoing MMORPG.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The World Ends With You fan artist @caehum on Twitter has showcased what Neku would look like in an HD remake or possibly Kingdom Hearts 4 through an immaculate 3D render. Since its publishing on Monday, it has received over 2,500 likes.




The 3D model looks like it's ripped straight from a modern Kingdom Hearts game, and has plenty of detail around the face and the odd jacket that Neku wears. The more realistic take on Neku is quite different from the most recent game NEO: The World Ends With You, which takes on a graphic novel art style instead. 


The World Remade With You


It would be cool to see a realistic take on the original DS game through a remake in the future. It has been re-released on Switch with a Final Remix version, however, to mixed results. 


"Final Remix‘s failure to utilize the extent of the Switch hardware shows a lack of understanding as to why so many people consider the Nintendo DS original to be the masterpiece it is," said our review.




Neku is expected to appear in Kingdom Hearts 4 by some fans. In Kingdom Hearts: Dream Drop Distance, Neku and Sora promise to see each other in Shibuya. After the events of KH3, Sora actually ends up in an area inspired by the real-life location. We could see Neku in a model like this, in an official capacity.


If you don't know where Neku comes from, he's the main character of a cult classic JRPG called The World Ends With You. It's one of the highest-rated DS games at an 88 Metacritic score. There was then a follow-up sequel called NEO: The World Ends With You featuring a new character named Rindo. 


"NEO: The World Ends with You is a sequel worth waiting for," said our 8/10 review. "It brings together many of the best concepts from the DS original but in a more approachable and accessible experience."

Few manufacturers understand this better than Logitech, whose G915 Lightspeed Wireless keyboard has been the ideal way to type without tethers for years. It combines a slim yet robust build quality with wonderfully tactile keys, incredibly fast response times, respectable battery life, and a truly standout volume wheel. Perhaps for that reason, the G915 Lightspeed has also maintained its lofty price point, with an RRP of around £220. But as part of Amazon's Black Friday sale, you can currently grab the best wireless keyboard for almost half price. It's currently available for £125 in the UK, and $160 in the US, which is 46% and 36% off respectively.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A pair of dungeon-crawlers are about to make their way back to adventurers around the world with the announcement of Class of Heroes 1 & 2: Complete Edition for PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.


The collection includes Class of Heroes: Anniversary Edition and Class of Heroes 2G: Remastered. Both will be available together on consoles and sold separately on Steam. There's no release date in place, but PQube has them penciled in for an early 2024 launch. You can see how the updated RPGs look today in the announcement trailer. 




Developer Zero Div's series first opened its doors to students when the original Class of Heroes hit PSP in Japan back in 2008. A North American release followed in 2009, which is also when the sequel launched in Japan. The Anniversary Edition version of the first game made its debut in Switch in Japan in 2018, adding in a room for changing outfits, difficulty options, and more.


Class of Heroes 2G introduced some new features when it made its way to PlayStation 3 in 2010. Additional party members, new dungeons, and full voiceovers joined the mix, giving players more reason to go back to the grind. With both games combined there are over 175 dungeons to traverse, so now's a good time to invest in some knee and elbow pads if you plan on crawling through 'em all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite has just announced its Big Bang event, and there are already reports circulating that Eminem is one of many surprises in store. 


According to Fortnite leaker @HYPEX, the upcoming Big Bang event will be the multiplayer game's largest to date, weighing over 1.5 GB. In addition to providing the artwork featuring an animated version of the rapper, the leaker also claims LEGO will make an appearance, and there'll also be a rhythm mode and racing mode. 


According to @HYPEX, the rhythm mode will let you play vocals, guitar, drums, and bass. It comes December 9, and you can expect the following artists and songs to be featured: 



Alice Cooper - 'Poison'


Imagine Dragons - 'Thunder'


Lady Gaga - 'Pokerface'


Linkin Park - 'Numb'


Toto - 'Africa'



Another leaker, @iFireMonkey, revealed two Eminem skins. One has the rapper with his iconic blond hair, while the other has him in the suit and fedora he wears on his Music to be Murdered By album.




As for official details, all we know so far is that Epic has the event planned for Saturday, December 2, 2023, at 2 PM ET. It'll be available in the Battle Royale tile in Discover 30 minutes prior, and it'll support parties of up to four players. It's being described as "a new beginning," which may explain why Fortnite is going all-out. 




For those who don't have a dedicated gaming device, you can use NVIDIA GeForce NOW and Amazon Luna services to access the game via cloud gaming. 


This won't be the first major music event from Fortnite. Past concerts have featured artists like Travis Scott and Ariane Grande, and the experience has been an interactive one allowing you to enjoy a virtual concert from the comfort of your home.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh biscuits!
Given Bluey’s meteoric rise since the show's television debut in 2018, it seemed inevitable that a video game adaptation would eventually make its way into the hands of eager fans worldwide. Thanks to developer Artax Games and publisher Outright, that adaptation is now here, with Bluey: The Videogame letting you directly control each member of the Heeler family: Bandit, Chilli, Bingo, and of course, Bluey. It’s a charming effort that manages to successfully emulate the Australian cartoon in terms of visuals and audio, but falls deeply short of capturing the same magic. Despite this, young children will still likely get a kick out of the experience, but more on that later.
Taking place across five locations from the show, including the Heeler household, the backyard, the beach, the playground, and the creek, Bluey: The Videogame tells a short, reasonably wholesome story in which the family goes in search of Bandit’s lost childhood treasure. When we say “short”, however, we mean it: the game’s story is split into four episodes, and each of these will take roughly around 10-15 minutes to complete. So you can make your way through the entire game in about an hour, tops. Add in the various collectibles and you might be able to stretch it to two hours, but that’s it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can you believe we're coming up to three years since Cyberpunk 2077 released? What a rollercoaster it's been for CD Projekt Red's non-Witcher game, and soon you'll be able to own a special Ultimate Edition version of the dystopian RPG.


In a recent post on CDPR's website, the developer has said it will be launching the Ultimate Edition of Cyberpunk 2077 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. It's releasing digitally and as a physical purchase, both of which will be available from December 5.




As for what's in it, well, you'll get the OG game (natch), along with the free 2.0 update that overhauled a lot of stuff, and the one and only DLC, Phantom Liberty. It's basically an all-in-one package, if that's what you're after in time for Christmas.


We can forgive, but can we forget?


As time goes on, it becomes easier to talk about Cyberpunk without having to remind ourselves of the bad old days. However, I'd wager it's a sting that's still felt by many, especially for those of us who tried to play it on console when it released.


Things are, thankfully, much different now. The aforementioned 2.0 update was just one of the ways CD Projekt Red made some key changes to the game, improving things along the way. Before that was the rather substantial patch 1.5 that rolled out in February 2022.


In short: we've finally arrived. However, it's at a time when the studio is looking to move onto new things. While we're getting a Cyberpunk follow-up and a new Witcher saga, CDPR has also said that 2077 is getting no more major updates.

With that said, the gaming industry isn't a charity, and people deserve to know what they're potentially spending their hard-earned money on. Here's what you need to know: the problem with Flashback 2 isn't merely that it is buggy, sometimes to a hilarious degree. Instead, the main issue is that even if the bugs weren't present, it still wouldn't be worth its current price tag.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Petroglyph Games is still patching Star Wars: Empire at War all these years later. The game originally launched in 2006. The newest patch was released on November 20, 2023.


The latest patch is for maintenance, but it makes a rather significant change: it shifts the game from a 32-bit executable to a 64-bit one to try and solve out-of-memory bugs. Beyond that, it addresses out-of-sync multiplayer issues and “numerous gameplay fixes addressing balance and incorrect unit behavior.”


It’s impressive. Some of my favorite games of that era aren’t even available for purchase anymore, let alone getting continued support. Petroglyph states that they worked with the community to locate and address some of the bugs fixed in this release.


Image via Steam


I’m somewhat surprised that they’re still able to patch the game. Not that I think Petroglyph wouldn’t want to since it was the studio’s first game and one that still gets played today. It’s just that, since the license belongs to another company, oftentimes there’s little incentive to offer continued support and other times they’re contractually not allowed to make changes after a certain period. Nevertheless, such a major update so long after Star Wars: Empire at War’s initial release is an impressive showing of passion from the developer. In a world without official Battlefield 1942 servers, it's nice to be reminded that some people still care.


While I was in high school playing StarCraft, I dreamed of a Star Wars RTS. I don’t know why I didn’t play Star Wars: Galactic Battleground, but by 2006, the prequel trilogy had left me badly disillusioned with the franchise. I have never recovered, and at this point, probably never will.


However, I may install Star Wars: Empire at War to check the game out now.


Star Wars: Empire at War is available for PC. The newest update is available now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After four seasons of brand new content, Epic Games injected a healthy dose of nostalgia into Fornite Chapter 4's fifth season, officially called Season OG, by bringing back the Chapter 1 map for players to experience once more. Season OG has included weekly updates to add items from Chapter 1's various seasons, too, making it a fun romp through what Fortnite was like years ago. However, Season OG ends on December 2, which is also when Fortnite's next live event, The Big Bang, goes live. 
The Big Bang begins on Saturday, December 2, at 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, and Epic says, "This event marks a new beginning for Fortnite." 
✅ Unforgettable event
pic.twitter.com/xAhMKtmwiG
November 21, 2023
Before the event begins, Epic says players will see The Big Bang in the Battle Royale tile in the Discover section of Fortnite 30 minutes prior to its start; that way, you can jump in before the event starts to link up with friends and get your cosmetics in order. And speaking of friends, The Big Bang will support parties of up to four players. 
The Big Bang will be available anywhere you play the most current build of Fortnite, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. If you won't be near a dedicated gaming device during the event, you can check it out using Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Amazon Luna services to play Fortnite via cloud streaming on your computer or mobile device. 
"To prepare for The Big Bang, Fortnite experiences made by Epic will be disable starting 12 p.m. ET on December 2," Epic writes in a blog post. "Creator-made experiences will remain enabled until downtime for Fortnite v28.00 starts at 11:30 p.m. ET."
While waiting for The Big Bang event, read up on everything you need to know about Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG, and then read about how Epic says it's aware it missed the mark with a recent cosmetic restriction update for Fortnite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2021, it was announced that Knights of the Old Republic would be getting an official remake, with plans to release it on PC and PS5. However, things have not been going swimmingly for KOTOR's return, and if you've clicked on this headline, you already know where this is going.


A few days ago, Giant Bomb's own Jeff Grubb claimed that "this game is not being worked on right now." And by "this game," he definitely means the remake of Knights of the Old Republic. He goes on to say that no studio anywhere is currently developing it. The discussion begins around the 31-minute mark.




Grubb also adds that fans may have already been picking up the pieces, and it certainly seems like Embracer Group is sitting on this long-awaited game. However, nothing official has been claimed yet regarding the remake, so take this information at face value for now.


Embrace for disappointment


KOTOR is in the care of Saber Interactive, which is owned by Embracer Group. Last week, Embracer CEO was not willing to pass comment on the status of Knights of the Old Republic. And last year, there was another report about the remake being put on hold, so at this stage, it's safe to assume the project is likely in development hell.


It's a bit of a shame really. The original 2003 release – which was made by BioWare of Mass Effect fame – is considered to be one of the best Star Wars video adaptations of all time. To see it make a comeback at a time when remakes and remasters are still in vogue feels like Embracer with its figurative finger so far from the pulse, it's levitating.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes an indie game can come out of nowhere and cover itself in glory, even for a bit. Zeekerss co-op survival horror title Lethal Company is just such a game, and it's currently taking the PC world by storm.


According to the latest Top Sellers chart over on Steam, it's ranking as the best game in terms of revenue. This puts it at the number two spot overall, just behind the Steam Deck. Seeing it climb up from sixth place in a matter of weeks is hugely impressive, especially because there seemed to be little hype surrounding it.


Screenshot via Destructoid.


It was also revealed yesterday that Lethal Company had smashed 100,000 concurrent players. Well, according to data pulled from SteamDB, that record has been smashed again. At the time of writing, it's now at a peak of 117,278, which it achieved less than 12 hours ago.


Pretty good going for a small indie title


Sons of the Forest experienced a similar burst in popularity so quickly after it was released. Selling two million copies in its first 24 hours, the follow-up to the 2017 horror game The Forest was a phenomenal success. Admittedly, it didn't last too long, and there are currently 6,618 people playing right now. In contrast, Lethal Company is recording just over 19,000 players.


For those who have yet to play it (yo!), Lethal Company is a cooperative horror title that tasks players with scavenging items on abandoned moons in order to sell them to an entity known as the Company.


It's been out for a month and it's already showing "Overwhelmingly Positive" reviews on Steam. It's still in early access so no doubt the studio has a lot of work ahead of it. Still, this surprise horror hit is something fans of the genre may want to keep an eye on, especially those who enjoy things like Rust or Dead by Daylight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sequel to the masterful Cities: Skylines is now out, but it didn't quite stick the landing. 


Even though Cities: Skylines 2 shows great promise, it also suffers from various performance issues that developer Colossal Order Ltd. was aware of before its release. The company decided not to miss the intended release date for the game despite possible problems but has since adopted a different stance. Colossal just announced that the DLC will be delayed while the company works on fixing the game's performance troubles.




In a long developer note, Colossal Order informs of the company's main goals moving forward. In summation, those are:


Performance improvements - which will focus on getting better GPU performance. The current version of the game infamously features too much detail, and fans have criticized it for rendering stuff as useless as teeth that you never see. The teeth are, reportedly, not the issue, but the team is aware that the performance needs improving.


Bug fixes - the developers are working hard on over 100 instances of reproducible bugs reported by the community.


Editor and Mod support - the developers are working on improving the map editor as well as its interface before they do a proper release.


Cities Skylines 2 post-launch roadmap


The company doesn't have a release date for the upcoming content but has presented a broad window.

The Asset pack has been delayed to Q1 2024 (from Q4 2023)


The Creator packs have been delayed to Q2 2024 (from Q1 2024)


The expansion is still set to release during Q2 2024

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt Red released Phantom Liberty, the first and last expansion for its 2020 RPG, Cyberpunk 2077, in September. We loved it – find out why in Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review here – and if you enjoyed the base game, it's not an expansion to miss. Currently, it's only available for purchase as an add-on to Cyberpunk 2077, but if you haven't yet picked it up, it might be worth waiting just a couple more weeks. That's because CDPR has revealed Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion in one single package.
Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 5, and will be released in both a digital format and physical. Check out the box art below: 
Big news… Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition arrives on December 5th in digital AND physical form for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC!

November 21, 2023
All that CDPR has shared about this new edition is the tweet above so it remains to be seen if the Ultimate Edition includes any new goodies or enhancements. Given Phantom Liberty and the Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 update improved the game in big ways, reworking and revamping several of its mechanics in the process, it's unlikely the Ultimate Edition will include any changes in that vein. Only time will tell, though. 
For more, read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review and then read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review. After that, read about the things to remember and know before starting Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, and then check out this feature about how the team behind the expansion created its spy-thriller soundtrack. Read about this live-action Cyberpunk 2077 project that's now in the works, too.

In the run-up to the GTA 6 trailer reveal next month, he's started blogging about the development of several Rockstar games, from GTA through grotty snuff film simulator Manhunt to cancelled projects such as the zombie title and Cold War stealth fest Agent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 developers Sledgehammer Games (umpteenth reminder: that's Modern Warfare 3 as in the 2023 game, not the 2011 FPS of the same name) have hosted a Reddit AMA in which they answered a bunch of questions about the evolution of the game's competitive meta. That's meta as in the overall balance of power between Modern Warfare 3 loadouts, playstyles and so forth based on a variety of factors such as map design, rather than the Alan Wake 2 kind of "meta", where characters talk about how they're just characters in a game and so on. I would dearly like to see some crossover between these types of "meta". I guess the Call of Duty that comes closest to fulfilling that idea is Black Ops 3, with its fourth-wall-breaking cyborg theatrics.


Anyway, the discussion is interesting because it touches on the fact that the evolution of an FPS competitive meta is an artful balance of prediction and reaction, imposing new directions on players at times, taking direction from them at others. The developers want the Modern Warfare 3 meta to change "from season to season" - the question, of course, is how to do this without alienating fans of certain weapons and strategies.

While the exceptional 5800X3D takes the title of the fastest gaming CPU from this generation, the standard 5800X is another capable performer - and this eight-core, 16-thread CPU is significantly cheaper during Black Friday, costing just £181/$207. 
That's pretty good going for a CPU that cost double that at the start of 2022 - especially when it also costs 60% as much as the Ryzen 7 5800X3D while delivering 75% to 95% of the performance, depending on the game.

        <updated>2023-11-20T22:34:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation Plus Premium members can now try their hand at two of the most notable games of the year. The subscription service is adding free trials for a bizarre duo: Baldur’s Gate 3 and The Lord of the Rings Gollum. 


LOTR fans will get to check out Gollum for a full hour, and based on the game’s terrible reception, that might be more than enough time with it. Gollum has a Top Critic Score of just 37 on OpenCritic, with only 4% of critics recommending it. 


Following the game’s release in May 2023, publisher Daedlic Entertainment closed its development studio in Hamburg, Germany and canceled its plans for another game set in Middle-Earth. Now, any PlayStation players who skipped out on the game thanks to the rough reviews can get a chance to evaluate it for themselves.


Baldur’s Gate 3, on the other hand, is one of the most celebrated games of the year. The massive CRPG has been blowing everyone away since it debuted in August. It earned eight nominations at The Game Awards, including Game of the Year and Best Game Direction for Larian Studios. 


It’s one of those games that stays deeply engaging even after hundreds of hours, so the two hour trial coming to PlayStation Plus Premium will hardly be enough for players to get a taste of what the game has to offer. That said, the opening hours are exciting enough that the trial will likely snag more than a few new players for the game. 


Both of the trials are currently available through the PlayStation Store.

        <updated>2023-11-20T21:54:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After Enclave HD made its way to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch back in June, a December 5 date has been locked in for PlayStation 5.


Somehow, it's been over two decades since the original Enclave launched on Xbox in 2002. The medieval action-RPG was developed by Starbreeze Studios, and the HD version from TopWare Interactive and Ziggurat Interactive adds in updated visuals, an enhanced soundtrack, and some quality-of-life improvements. The results might not exactly be the most PS5 looking game in the world, but it does include exclusive haptic trigger effects for the DualSense controller. 


You can see some quick action-packed footage in the PS5 release date trailer:




Enclave lets you fight as either a goodie or a baddie — very real technical terms — with six class options available for each faction. The story puts you in the land of Celenheim, which experienced a rift between the forces of Light and Darkness a thousand years ago. The rift protected Celenheim's people from the vile Dreg'Atar, but now that it's beginning to close that peace could soon come to an end. Thus, it's time for everyone's favorite "unlikely" hero to rise up! Or you could just be a nasty lil' champion of evil. It's up to you.


It's been about, oh, 20 years since I played Enclave myself, but I remember it being a pretty engrossing and challenging game at the time. I haven't played the HD version yet, so I can't personally say how well it holds up in 2023. Either way, with this launch we'll have Enclave HD on all major consoles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yakuza: Like A Dragon was a very silly game in spite of its dramatic narrative, but its follow-up, Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, looks to give it a run for its money. Between letting Ichiban ride a dolphin and its Animal Crossing-style city-building mode, fans of the franchise’s goofball nature should be in for a treat, and a new batch of screenshots highlight this.
The images provide looks at Ichiban, Kiryu Joryu, and their returning friends, such as Nanba, Adachi, and Saeko, kicking butt in a variety of classes and looking absurd doing so. Other familiar faces will be playable party members for the first time, such as Seonhee, who is shown brutalizing opponents with a whip in the images. It's clear that Hawaii will never be the same once these guys are done with it. 


Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 26. You can learn more about the game and see it in action in this pair of trailers. Be sure to also read our review of its direct predecessor, Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It feels like Steam has some sort of sales event almost on a weekly basis. Recently, we had the Scream Fest to celebrate Halloween, and now we're getting another one as we head towards the tail end of November.


As always with these things, we can never be 100% sure of what games will be discounted. However, if you take a look at the video below, there are a few major titles that do crop up, suggesting they will part of Steam's next sale.




We're treated to clips from the likes of Hitman 3, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, Sons of the Forest, The Last of Us: Part 1, and even Starfield. The Autumn event begins November 21 and goes through until November 28, and with such a line-up, it looks like it'll be an interesting one to keep an eye on.


It's been quite the year


As we edge ever closer to the closing weeks of 2023, many of us will start reflecting on the last twelve months that have been and gone. While this year has been great for video game releases, a lot of joy has been sullied by the ongoing (and rather brutal) layoffs that have occurred across the industry in general.


As such, it's been quite the rollercoaster, but things seem to be trundling along unabated, and the Steam Autumn sale event is just one example.


Of course, Christmas is coming up soon, so we'll be seeing the Winter sale go live over the holiday period. Nothing like a ruck of discounted games at a time when everyone's spending too much money anyway.

November 21st, 2023 marks the 25th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time's Japanese launch. To mark this historic Hyrulean occasion, we'll be running articles throughout the week dedicated to the game, our memories, and its legacy. Today, Ollie sings the praises of Ocarina of Time's mystical opening location, Kokiri Forest...

Before Ocarina of Time launched back in 1998, the Legend of Zelda franchise didn’t really provide players with a good opportunity to acclimatise to its world. Think about it: both NES games threw you into the middle of Hyrule with little introduction, A Link to the Past saw you almost immediately infiltrate Hyrule Castle’s dungeon, and while Link’s Awakening started off in the cosy confines of Tarin’s house, it's not long before you're on the beaches of Koholint Island, surrounded by Sand Crabs, Leevers, and Octoroks.

If you’re unfamiliar Against the Storm is a city-builder where you’re dropped in the middle of the forest and need to get a settlement up and running before the world’s monarch gets pissed off at you. Your job is to obtain enough reputation points to complete the expedition, at which point you’ll be rewarded for your success with meta-resources that you can spend to progress up the technology tree.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The co-op horror / scavenging game Lethal Company has exceeded 100,000 concurrent players via Steam. In fact, according to Steam Charts, the horror experience has reached a peak player total of 114,672 at the time of writing.




“While I was asleep Lethal Company passed 100,000 concurrent players,” the developer wrote in a post on Twitter. “Unbelievable, thank you for playing. Releasing updates for this game will be very fun.”


Lethal Company entered Early Access on Steam on October 23, so the fact that less than a month later it’s celebrating over 100,000 concurrent players is kind of amazing, especially for a game made by a solo developer who got their start on the Roblox platform.




Following the peak players announcement, Zeekerss wrote via Twitter that Lethal Company’s “next enemy is seasonal,” but the developer made certain to clarify they used the word “enemy” intentionally. “These ones will not be 'creatures' as I refer to the rest. These are Enemies. Antagonists. Combatants. Foes. Enjoy this pre-invasion time.”


In the replies, one user asked if their usage of the word “seasonal” implied the new enemy would only be present in the game temporarily. Zeekerss clarified that their use of the word “seasonal” was meant to suggest the enemy itself will be themed around the holiday season.




Lethal Company entered Early Access on October 23. In the co-op experience, players must salvage from “abandoned, industrialized moons” in order to fulfill their obligations to a mysterious “Company.” But, there’s a reason it’s co-op — while you’re hunting scrap, something else is hunting you. It is available via PC, and there are no indications at the moment of a console release.

In an effort to iron out the game’s technical problems and implement the mod editor, Paradox and developers Colossal Order have now delayed post-launch content included in the Expansion Pass.

The device's HDR OLED display is definitely its strongest feature, but there's more to it than just that.


More specifically, the graphics and tech analysis authority Digital Foundry has performed some in-depth testing of the Steam Deck OLED. "In receiving an impressive upgrade to its display, Steam Deck OLED attacks input lag seemingly on two fronts," says Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter. 


Leadbetter explains that not only is the OLED "typically" about 10 milliseconds faster than the old LCD display during regular use, but that its 90Hz refresh rate also plays into this, as a game that's been capped at just 30 FPS…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a post on Twitter, Square Enix revealed that the previously mobile-only title Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis has been published to Steam and will be released on the platform later. The Gacha-style game revisits the story of Final Fantasy 7 and Final Fantasy 7: Crisis Core while also telling a new original story about Sephiroth in his younger days.




SOLDIER 1st Class


Our very own Timothy "The Wordsmith" Monbleau wrote about his feelings on Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis when it was released on mobile devices a couple of months ago. I've also had the chance to play quite a bit of it—well, completed all the original content in the title, at least—and can say everything he mentions is pretty on point. Even though the idea of more FF7 is always appealing...this isn't the way to do it. FF7:EC feels like a gacha game was developed and then a FF7 skin was thrown onto it.


However, I know even with the warning, some people just want more Final Fantasy. Even though you could previously access Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis through emulators like BlueStacks, this will be the first time it's easily and officially available on PC. New players who jump in on the Steam version will also get the pre-order rewards that were available on mobile. The rewards will help you get a jump start on progressing through the early missions, so it's a cool touch that they are giving the rewards to PC players as well.


There's no release date yet for when Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis will actually go live on Steam. According to the Twitter post, the release date will be announced soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[November 19 was officially the 25th anniversary of Half-Life, one of the most influential FPS games ever made. Two and a half decades! It's hard to imagine, and it's even harder to imagine it's still going strong, as evidenced by recent statistics.


Spurred by this milestone birthday, Half-Life has received an influx of players, with SteamDB reporting the game's highest player count on record. Over the last 24 hours, 33,471 players have jumped back into the world of Black Mesa, the most it's ever achieved, according to the history.


Screenshot via Destructoid.


Going back as far as possible, the graph shows that, aside from a few spikes here and there, the game has retained a fairly steady flow of players. Until recently, of course. At the time of writing, nearly 19,000 people are playing right now. That's more than Starfield.


That's a lot of resonance cascades


It's no secret why Half-Life is experiencing a boon right now. To go with the 25th anniversary, Valve released a new update for the game, as well as a special documentary about the development of this absolute classic.


As such, it's on a lot of people's minds right now, and understandably so. Featuring one of the most iconic openings in an FPS, Half-Life raised the bar for what was possible in video game technology and storytelling.


If you've never played it before, now's your chance, as it's currently free on Steam. We might take a lot of its elements for granted these days but, take it from an aging gamer, this stuff was revolutionary at the time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a stellar career at Housemarque, Harry Krueger is ready to move on to the next adventure in his life. 


In the announcement by Housemarque, Krueger is thanked for the work he has done, especially with Returnal, which played a large role in catapulting the studio from a small group of Finnish creators to a first-party Sony partner. Krueger also reflects on this and expresses pride in all the accomplishments his team has earned. 


Ilari Kuittinen, who is the General Manager and Co-Founder of Housemarque, also comments on Krueger's departure. He claims Krueger's "passion and direction have been vital" for the studio which has endured the death and rebirth of the "Arcade". 


Although Krueger doesn't explain what prompted the departure, he states that it was a difficult decision. He is also confident that the studio has a bright future ahead, as it has "an exciting new project in the works, a fantastic team that’s stronger than ever, and the continuous support of Sony and PlayStation Studios."


Krueger isn't the only notable industry figure who has stepped down from a long-held position. Pete Hines announced his departure from Bethesda not long after Starfield's launch, and Activision Blizzard's Bobby Kotick is also preparing to leave after 32 years with the gaming giant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Rare find.
It was almost 10 years ago that a group of former Rare developers got together and established Playtonic Games. This was a team consisting of many of the minds behind Banjo-Kazooie, Donkey Kong Country, and other such classics, so when their first title, Yooka-Laylee was released in 2017, we were relieved to see that level of creativity still very much alive and kicking (even more so with the improved Switch version later that year).
Playtonic would go on to release the side-scrolling platformer Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair in 2019, a title that we felt took all of the best bits of its predecessor and improved on them — awarding it a 9/10 in our review, no less. While the studio has since been behind several games on the publishing side of things (Lil Gator Game, Demon Turf, and many more) a good few years have passed since it was last in the development seat. So, just what has been going on at Playtonic?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though Starfield isn't doing all too well at this time, especially compared to Skyrim, it's bound to jump back up again once its Creation Kit releases in 2024. In the interim, modders have been making do, leading to the creation of an "immersive survival addon" for Starfield.


The aptly titled "Starvival" comes from a modder known as lKocMoHaBTl, and it successfully introduces a fairly important new gameplay mechanic into Starfield: the so-called Needs. Needs are, essentially, a comprehensive set of counters, buffs, addictions, and other complimentary features that turn Starfield into a game where food is, in fact, necessary. In the simplest terms possible, Starvival allows your Starfield character to get hungry and, if you're persistent enough, addicted to alcohol, which turns the g…]]></summary>

Kona 2 Colon Brume's snowy post-blizzard setup makes pretty good on the promise, and also smartly contrasts those stark snowbanks and deadly cold forests with the traditional cramped, dark indoors of many a horror game. I suspect I'd have enjoyed it less had it started with the latter, and truth be told, I'm not sure it's quite my thing overall. But it's held my attention so far, which most of its peers don't.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s do the Time Warp again….
If we had to choose two words to describe In Stars and Time, we’d pick 'beautiful' and 'strange'. This story-driven RPG is ideal for fans of titles like Undertale and EarthBound. Don’t take that comparison to mean that it is identical to these games, though — it’s still its own experience.
Right off the bat, In Stars and Time looks great, with 4:3 aspect ratio that makes it feel more retro than it actually is. The music is gentle and soothing, and it pairs perfectly with the monochrome art style. The menu and settings are easy to navigate from the off, and the story starts with a detailed trigger warning; the game does have some text-based depictions of topics like suicide, which is worth being mindful of. Nothing is shown, but the dialogue is intense in places.

Worldless opens with a battle of opposing stars; they cascade towards each other in what seems like an endless battle. From that epic scene-setter, we follow the journey of one such celestial body, who gains sentience and treks across an alien landscape to find…purpose?
The central mystery at the heart of this gorgeous platformer isn’t as important as the journey we take to solve it. This will serve to be a frustration in the long run, but the opening moments are all about the sensory experience. Left to wander an empty expanse, the glow of your own body illuminating the ground and sprouting ghostly flowers wherever you go. It’s both calming and tense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mazes and labyrinths can be confusing, frustrating, oppressive, nightmarish. They are the kinds of structures videogame developers are reluctant to put in their games, because the potential for the player losing heart or patience is relatively high. But as productions, they can be strangely economical, oddly light-footed. Mazes and labyrinths, after all, twist up space and as such, discover or create additional space within space. They allow vast journeys to happen within areas that are modest when judged in terms of square footage, journeys that encompass a multitude of locations that have an inherent, automatic atmosphere: tantalising forks in the path and mocking dead ends, hubs with corridors leading in all directions, leisurely perimeter paths and gristly knots of inner passages.
As such, I think they're useful to reflect on at a time when the mantra of growth for its own sake has conquered the heart of videogame world design: bigger budgets for grander maps in terms of both explorable area and computational resource, all the way to Armageddon (did you know that Suicide Squad's Metropolis is twice the size of Arkham Knight's Gotham City?). But don't take it from me, an armchair developer with armchair socialist sensibilities. Take it from The Legend of Zelda.

Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness. As Spider-Man's first fully 3D action-adventure game, it laid the groundwork for mechanics such as web-swinging, a variety of web shooter attacks, and wall-crawling stealth gameplay. Let's see how it holds up 23 years later. 
Starting today and every Friday at 2:30 p.m. Central on Twitch,  join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they'll stream two hours of the game each week until they beat it. If you can't watch us live, new episodes will be uploaded the next Saturday morning on our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. You'll also find archived episodes on this page as they're uploaded.

The Talos Principle II often left me staring at my screen in awe. Sometimes, from sheer intimidation in the face of a seemingly formidable puzzle. Other times,  from my incredulous pride after unraveling said problem. But most of all, the experience regularly gave me pause as I pondered a philosophical idea or argument that challenged my viewpoints on the nature of existence and humanity’s place in the cosmos. These moments spurred me to solve the game’s 100+ puzzles in search of answers, and I’m largely satisfied with what I discovered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, I think this is probably the first and only time I've ever heard British documentarian Adam Curtis appear as an ominous backing sample in an RPG boss battle theme, but in many ways, I hope it's not the last. Forget the operatic choral chants of Final Fantasy bosses. The new rallying cry against peak villainy is now some no-nonsense British commentary about the state of human extinction. It works surprisingly, well, and Small Saga is a game shot through with these kinds of Britishisms, set in the parks, streets and underbelly of modern-day London. 
Only this isn't an RPG about humans, but the rodents that live beneath their feet - the mice, rats, squirrels and moles who have developed a kind of proto-medieval society of their own built from the trash and discarded objects they've scavenged from under our noses. In this world, humans are terrifying 'gods', supermarkets with their shelves of seeds and grain are called 'Heaven', and your main mode of transportation is a pigeon with a wicker basket. It's a fascinating world solo developer Darya Noghani has created here, and it would be a thrilling turn-based RPG, too - if only its battles didn't completely cheese it when it comes to providing any sense of challenge.

Nobody must know! Oh drat. Anyway, despite my lack of expertise, the Supergiant action-roguelite was the first comparison that came to mind while watching the trailer for Realm of Ink, which has just been announced.


It makes use of a similar angled perspective, appears similarly focussed on build customisation, with hundreds of magic items to equip, and sees you playing out the backstories of various mythological personalities - derived, in this case, not from Ancient Greece but China and Buddhism.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth arrives in February, which isn’t too far on the horizon, so Square Enix is getting players prepared with a cinematic refresher of its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake. The company pairs that with a batch of fresh screenshots and art, including the first glimpse of the Highwind airship. 
The video sees Red XIII narrate the broad strokes of the 2020 adventure. While it doesn’t touch on the finer details and background of the characters, it provides a decent summary that's perhaps better served as a reminder for fans who played Remake rather than someone coming into Rebirth completely fresh. Unfortunately, the recap doesn’t touch on the events of the Intermission expansion that introduces Yuffie, who joins the party in Rebirth, so unfamiliar players will have to do their own homework on that. 


Square has released some new images, including a piece of art depicting Aerith in front of the Highwind. The screenshots show off the town of Kalm, the summon Kujata, the abandoned Mythril Mine, and a few side characters. Oh, and Chadley is there too. 

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on February 29 for PlayStation 5. You can watch us play two demos of the game in this video and read our hands-on impressions here. You can also get the answers to some of Rebirth's burning questions in this interview with Square Enix.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 11/20/23:
Last week, developer Epic Games updated Fortnite to include a new rating restriction that applies to certain skins. Depending on a Fortnite skin, it might only be useable on a creative island with a T rating, meaning the Resident Evil Claire Redfield skin, which features a pistol in a holster on her thigh, can't be used on islands rated less than Teen. Players were upset with this change as it made skins they paid real money for (often $10 to $20 per skin) unusable in all the ways they might have previously been usable. 
Epic said only 7 percent of Fortnite skins are only usable on Teen-rated islands, at the time, but it's clear enough skins are affected to have the community unhappy with this update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reader, I have a confession to make. I have tried long and hard to like adorable citybuilder Townscaper, but I just cannot muster much affection for it. I love how it looks, I love what it does, and I will endlessly admire how its little multi-coloured building bricks morph and shift, smooshed together in far more creative ways than I could ever manage myself. But when presented with a blank canvas and no direction on what to do with said multi-coloured building bricks, my mind seizes up and straight up refuses to extract any joy from it. It's a feeling I fear will apply to the equally charming Tiny Glade when that eventually comes out as well, based on the very lovely GIFs I've seen of it so far, and honestly, there are times when I worry my brain is just a teeny bit broken and I have lost the ability to find joy in what are clearly very joyful little creations.
But then I play games like Pile Up!, a micro citybuilder that's very much in the same vein as Townscaper, and realise, oh no, I do just need some objectives and structure to my game playing for everything to be fine again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Dragon Age: Dreadwolf production director and veteran Mass Effect scribe Mac Walters has founded a new studio, Worlds Untold, with funding from NetEase. According to the official site, the studio will develop "triple-A action adventure games with an emphasis on narrative and worldbuilding": its first project is a single-player-focussed, "near future action adventure game in a breathtaking world filled with mystery and exploration". 


Amongst other things, this reflects Walter's desire to move away from the "space opera" RPGs he's made in the past and develop a more linear, story-driven sci-fi game, whose universe might also host TV or novel adaptations. Which might not sound very appealing to BioWare diehards, but you can rest easy on one count: the game will have plenty of lore, though how it's served up to the player is another question.

True, they’re pricier than any gaming mouse or Steam Deck accessory to begin with, but basic principles of proportions mean that the choicest deals will lop off enormous wads of cash.
And these are quality lappies, too. Some of my personal favourites (the Gigabyte Aorus 15X! The Razer Blade 14! The Acer Nitro 5, if you’re on a budget!) have made it into this season's Black Friday deal highlights, and there are plenty more besides. Most of them are rocking up-to-date Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 series GPUs, too, so they’ll be able to handle ray tracing and roid their own performance via DLSS 3. To varying extents, naturally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reports suggested Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 was a crunch-driven 16 month project, and our campaign review thought it displayed characteristics of a rushed schedule-filler. Besides quality gunplay and a fantastic array of classic maps, MW3's multiplayer doesn't do much to differentiate itself from MW2, aside from being more of a frustrating grind. And its awkwardly positioned zombies mode, though it might appeal to some, has been robbed of its sickle-sharpening soul. All of it does smack of being rushed, and I'd only recommend the game if you're an ardent fan of COD who's happy to accept little in the way of changes. Otherwise, this FPS simply isn't worth spending your hard-earned bucks on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the time of Star Fleet II: Krellan Commander's release, I was still learning to spell and wrestling with the whole "going to the toilet independently" business, but if I'd had access to an MS-DOS PC between potty-training sessions, I dare say I'd have tried my hand at being an intergalactic warlord. Originally published in 1989 by Interstel Corporation and distributed by a little-known company called Electronic Arts, it's an absurdly in-depth and fiddly-looking space sim in which you fly around a randomly generated cosmos in your horrible Klingon-adjacent battlecruiser, blowing up or commandeering other ships, bombarding or invading planets, and generally speaking being a nuisance. 


According to its creators, Trevor Sorensen and Mark Baldwin, the game had a rushed launch that led to a lot of technical issues. The developers released another, relatively bug-free version in 1991, which is the version you'll find on most retro game preservation sites. Then, in 2018, Sorensen decided to make a new 2.0 version of Krellan Commander using his original 486 PC, which finally launched this week on Steam and GOG.

Back in the '90s, Nintendo played faster and looser with its library of characters. Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Persona 5 Tactica riffs on a lot of the original game’s mechanics and retools them for a tactics-based grid. At first, it’s pretty simplistic, and the opening chapter painstakingly tutorializes all these mechanics with the most straightforward use cases. But as I played through the Phantom Thieves’ latest journey, I…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Mario RPG, the original and the remake, is full of secrets, references to other video game franchises, and a whole lot more. Arguably the most interesting secret boss of the original game was Culex. He is not a Final Fantasy character, but he looks and feels like one and features Final Fantasy music and sound effects.
Culex appears in Super Mario RPG remake as he did in the original game, which is to say he is a pixelated, 2D creature. He also features the original throwback soundtrack and sound effects. You access him the same way, too – by buying fireworks and trading them with the little girl nearby in Moletown for a shiny stone. You then use that shiny stone in Monstro Town on the locked door.
However, upon defeat, Culex teases another encounter in the future, which is where thin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck OLED releases today, providing a new avenue for game players (especially those with big Steam libraries) to take their gaming experience on the go. The new OLED models (one at 512 GB and another at 1TB storage) effectively replace the original release as the new Steam Deck flagship hardware. The older 64 GB and 512 GB LCD models are being phased out, while the 256 GB LCD will remain available at a reduced price.
Steam Deck OLED is not a fundamentally new platform. In many ways that matter, our review of the original still stands, and snagging one of the older LCD screen models is now an even more substantial value at the lower price. However, several of the concerns that surfaced in that review have been remedied by the new model – enough that a new evaluation is warranted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month, we launched a documentary called "Violence Is Inevitable: The Making of Humanity." And then, in a bit of a meta twist, we hung out with Humanity co-developer and publisher Enhance and discussed how we made our making-of documentary. Even cooler, we made a Game Informer level within Humanity – and you can play it now.
All this happened on the "HUMANITY Hub Community Stream," where myself (Blake) and Alex Van Aken discussed why we decided to make a documentary on Humanity, how we crafted the video, and even cutting-room floor content that didn't make the final product. We closed the show by putting our collective brains together to make a level based on the GI logo.
You can check out an archived version of the stream below:


By no means is our Humanity level an official partnership between Enhance and GI, but it's certainly a fun way to end a project that was a months-long labor of love. To play for yourself, either search via the name "GAME INFORMER FUN!" in the game's User Stages options or the stage ID: 013-020-5453.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright, fine, if you’re consulting a list of the best Black Friday gaming PC deals, it’s probably already too late for me to convince you to build a PC from scratch. "But it works out cheaper!" I’d plead, sobbing, into disinterested ears. So be it – at least with the Black Friday sales going on, a prebuilt rig can be much better value that it would otherwise. The PCs on this list, some of which have several hundred pounds/dollars off their usual prices, are testament to that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this episode of the Electronic Wireless Show podcast, Nate and I put on some ill-fitting industry analyst hats to consider the current state of the free-to-play games market: a peculiar arena, one that that enriches some almost as often as it dooms others. It’s all proven just too dangerous for Alan Wake 2 devs Remedy Entertainment, who’ve rebooted their upcoming F2P shooter Vanguard as a more traditional paid game. We later return to our core competences, in press release-speak, to talk about the Steam Deck OLED and the games we’ve been playing this week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ocean planet of GUP-14 is not a happy place. Its seabed has been gunked up with piles of trash, globs of purple gunge and nasty clouds of micro-plastics, all because an industrial megacorp couldn't be bothered to clean up after themselves after bleeding it for resources. That megacorp's since upped sticks to, sadly, continue their terrible ways somewhere else in the solar system, but calling out these bad practices (beyond them being obviously bad and not good for the planet) is not really Loddlenaut's concern here. 
Rather, your job is to simply clean up this mess with your array of high-tech gadgetry, healing its polluted environments so: a) it's not a grim, purple hellscape anymore; b) native, axolotl-like loddle creatures can move back in and prosper. It's simple, satisfying work that's designed to make you feel warm and fuzzy inside without having to think too hard. But its straightforward, frictionless tale may leave some wishing it had just a little more bite, and less of a sense that you're laying the ground for some other faceless corpo power to go and splurge all over it again.

In South Korea, where pirate movies and careless clicks turn innocent teenagers into crazed gambling addicts, anti-piracy messaging may have hit the jackpot.

By any measure, the PlayStation Portal is a very targeted and specific-use product, and it’s worth clarifying out of the gate: This is not a standalone console in any way. Rather, the Portal allows you to connect to a PS5 you already have in your home over your Wi-Fi network (or any Wi-Fi network) and play the games you have downloaded on that PS5 from other places around your home.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven’t heard by now, Metal Gear Solid’s Master Collection - which includes the first proper outing for MGS3: Snake Eater on PC - is a bit of a mess. Lacking graphics options, suffering from visual limitations and crashes, and generally barebones as a package, the catalogue of the first three Metal Gear Solid titles and their two Metal Gear prequels hasn’t exactly gone down well with players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Naheulbeuk’s Dungeon Master is a staff management game disguised as a dungeon management game. At the start of each week, your minions might choose to go on strike, demanding everything from more cells in the prison to fewer dwarves in the workplace. If that second example elicited a startled little “yikes”, then good, you’re paying attention. Your minions are also occasional racists – which at least makes some of the more brutal options at hand for dealing with striking workers more palatable.


You can sacrifice the entire picket line to your in-house demon lord, or terminate their employment without tribunal. You can also lock them up in those prisons they repeatedly claim are so lacking in cells. Or you can agree to their terms to expand the canteen and sack all of their shortest colleagues. But no matter which option you choose, minion strikes are inconsequential, only ever amounting to a comedy aside. Just as the turn-based Dungeon Of Naheulbeuk set out to skewer D&D, Naheulbeuk’s Dungeon Master is a brave and self-aware parody of dungeon management games. But it's far too barebones to invest in seriously.

Following in the wake of Microsoft, Epic, CD Projekt, Sony and, well, take your pick, the company aim to cut roughly 30% of their workforce to shore up profits. The specific reasoning here is that Digital Bros think that people aren't interested in playing original new games; they'd rather get to grips with fictions and franchises they know and love already. As such, the company plan to "limit" their big budget projects in future, though no specific cancellations have been announced.

I’m exaggerating – for effect! – but there genuinely are some chunky savings to be had here, even on the very latest graphics cards with enhanced ray tracing and DLSS 3 support. It’s not just super-duper-high-end cards like the RTX 4080 that are getting cuts, either – the deals I’ve found so far cover more affordable and/or mid-range far as well, like the Intel Arc A750 and RTX 4060 Ti. And there could be more to come, with Black Friday itself not rolling around until November 24th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever watched critically acclaimed 1998 comedy drama The Truman Show and thought "What if the whole city was people who didn't know they were in a TV show?". That's kind of the deal with American Arcadia, a puzzle-platformer about a dude who lives in an ultra advanced dome city that is for some reason 70s-themed, and is also a huge reality show for the Twitch generation. 
I actually love the 70s theme. This combined with story-within-a-story-within-a-story framing, bits of lovely, almost Wes Anderson-esque art design, and some extreme multi-tasking combining 2.5D and 3D makes American Arcadia an interesting little treat. Do the twists upon twists get a bit over cooked? Maybe. But you can live with it.

The PlayStation 5 was the best-selling console of the month, too. 
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 taking the top slot last month isn't surprising – it's the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game ever and sold through 5 million copies in just 11 days.


Behind Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on October 2023's best-selling list is Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the latest Switch exclusive from Nintendo at-the-time, and Assassin's Creed Mirage, the shorter throwback title from Ubisoft starring Assassin's Creed Valhalla's Basim.

It released Phantom Liberty, the first and only expansion for Cyberpunk 2077, debuted its soundtrack on streaming services, revealed plans for a live-action Cyberpunk project, and just this week, nabbed four nominations for The Game Awards 2023. Now, CDPR has announced it is working on a mod editor for The Witcher 3 that will hit PC sometime next year for free. 


"We're thrilled to announce that we're working on a mod editor for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt," a tweet from the official Witcher Twitter account reads. "It will allow you to create your own experiences in the game by making something completely new or editing existing quests and content. We're planning on releasing it for free in 2024. Stay tuned – we'll have more to share next year."

Notably, CDPR says this mod editor for The Witcher 3 will allow players to create their own experiences in the game, meaning people can develop their own fantasy adventures starring everyone's favorite monster hunter. In a reply on Twitter, the official account confirms this mod editor will only be coming to PC.
If you haven't yet played The Witcher 3, you should and you can read about why in Game Informer's review of The Witcher 3.

The original Super Mario RPG, released for Super Nintendo in 1996, felt like it was meant to be your first RPG. In an era when Final Fantasy tried its best to tell mature stories within the medium's limitations and Dragon Quest demanded hours and hours of your time, Mario’s adventure felt much brighter and more manageable. Familiar characters, a lighthearted story, a reasonable length, and timed button-pressing during combat made it stand out against the competition. Revisiting the game more than 25 years later in this new remade shape shows the original formula did n…]]></summary>

It’s powered by what the developers are calling “living ink”, an art style that fills in each papery map as you play. 


The game certainly looks arresting: your cursor is a quill, the HUD is a collection of smaller parchment scraps, and the terrain is a slowly brightening wash of swirling colours, leaking beyond the outlines of trees and buildings. Lovely stuff. And what's more, you get to beat up a bunch of wolves.

Well, you probably would, because it's Minecraft, the sandbox building sim that contains all possibility and all human endeavour, with the exception of good PvP mechanics, yes I went there. 


Anyway, Minecraft update 1.21 is just around the corner, and a few players have gotten early access via Mojang's snapshot releases. I had thought the crown jewel of the update would be the new Trial Chambers, aka trap-filled mazes. It turns out the real star might be the new Breeze mob - in the hands of imaginative players, at least.

Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution was arguably the most interesting title. Developer WayForward began development on the game 20 years ago, but never completed it. Next year, the game will finally make its way to Switch, but retain the Game Boy Advance aesthetic it was always meant to have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Persona 5 kids are trapped in high school, their semesters stretched into infinity by the inescapable march of spin-offs that have been retroactively stuffed into every available blank spot. Since the credits rolled on Persona 5 (and also before, and sometimes concurrently), the Phantom Thieves have spent their time in a rubbish Dynasty Warriors knock-off, got lost in a dream about a really cheap rhythm-action game and ended up trapped in a cross-generational dungeon crawler. Now they find themselves embroiled in - of all things - an X-COM style turn-based strategy game. 


Your energy for Persona 5 Tactica is going to come down to how much tolerance you have for the Persona 5 brand’s Baz Luhrmann-style maximalism. If you're emotionally invested in the gang, it'll definitely help. But even if you're a Persona veteran or a total newcomer, you'll find the story a bit loose, the chats a bit tiring, and the combat a bit simplistic. Then again, if you're a Persona fan, it's still more than a good excuse to sink back into another adventure with your pals.

Persona 5 has become its own sort of mini-franchise within the Persona series. With many spin-off titles released over the years, such as Persona 5 Strikers, Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight, and Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth, Atlus seems to love using Persona 5’s popularity to explore new stories and gameplay ideas. However, I applaud Atlus for making all of these spin-offs in completely different genres from each other. The latest, Persona 5 Tactica, delivers an entertaining story, a colorful cast of charact…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Making a strategy game is "harder than people give it credit for," Bit Reactor's CEO Greg Foertsch tells me. The same could probably be said of any game this year in particular, but having spent over 20 years shepherding the art teams at Firaxis on Civilization, XCOM, Sid Meier's Pirates, Alpha Centauri and most recently Marvel's Midnight Suns, Foertsch has seen firsthand what it takes for strategy games to break new ground over the years, and what an arduous road it's been for the genre to get where it is today. Not only was it "late to party on 3D, they were late to the party on consoles," but it's also "suffered from lower budgets, which means it just hasn't pushed in the way that other genres have," he says. 
Even now, "it's got some catching up to do," he continues, but there are plenty of reasons to be positive, too. As we speak at the beginning of September, our conversation quickly turns to Baldur's Gate 3, whose enormous success Foertsch cites as a clear and obvious sign that "there's a thirst for something different now," both within RPG circles and, perhaps a little unexpectedly, for strategy heads as well. It's his hope that his own upcoming project, the closely guarded Star Wars strategy game his new studio Bit Reactor are working on in collaboration with Respawn, will follow in these lauded footsteps. "We want to make a game and just have people say, 'Man, that's amazing game, and oh, it happens to be strategy.' That's the goal."

Much like The Boys, it's got a not-very-nice version of Superman, Omni-Man, who you might have seen doing not-very-nice things in Mortal Kombat lately.
Skybound and Kirkman's first videogame based on the license isn't about Omni-Man, though. Developed by Terrible Posture Games, it's about Atom Eve, a high-school do-gooder who can manipulate the atomic structure of the world, changing one thing into another.

Victory is dependent on rapidly issuing movement, attack and ability commands to several small squads of soldiers, and your units will pay a heavy price if your attention leaves them for more than a few moments.

If that's not your thing, move along. If it is, Realms Of Ruin is a solid, button-down war 'em up and you should read on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve been enjoying Jusant, Don’t Nod’s post-apocalyptic climbing sim, you might also like the alpha playtest for Chasing The Unseen, which has just been updated with a new level. It doesn’t have Jusant’s quietly innovative grip and abseiling mechanics – the climbing is closer to Shadow Of The Colossus, consisting of just one button you hold to cling on till your stamina runs out. Nor does it have the Don’t Nod game's beautifully nested chunks of backstory - no seashells you can press your ear to, alas. But it does have massive flying cephalopods, giant red mushrooms, and floating, fractured landscapes of rock and grass. 

The gameworld drifts whimsically between categories, neither macroscopic nor microscopic, at times a kind of ocean reef, and at other times, a mysterious, alternate dimension we might summarise as “Cthulhu’s Zen Chillout Room”. The climbing aside, you can glide short distances by inflating what looks like a blowfish, and there are (regular-sized) capybara to chase down and collect. When you die, the game plays a didgeridoo at you in a faintly jocular way. The whole thing pongs of quantum physics.

A quality microSD card is a must-have, after all, while docking stations make it far easier to extract the most flexibility out of your Deck’s desktop mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lies of P is one of the year's best games – read why in Game Informer's Lies of P review – and both critics and fans have enjoyed the Bloodborne/Sekiro-style take on the story of The Adventures of Pinocchio. Mustakro on Twitter has taken their enjoyment of the game's boss designs and turned some of Lies of P's toughest challenges into Cuphead-style bosses, and it rules. 


I came across Mustakro this morning, scrolling through my Twitter feed, when I saw a really awesome rendition of Lies of P's King of Puppets boss (one of the most difficult in the game) in the style of Rubberhose, which is that classic animation style popularized in the 1920s seen in Cuphead.

Then I clicked through some of Mustakro's other tweets to find even more Lies of P bosses in the style of Cuphead, and I love these renditions so much that I just wanted to share. So, enjoy their other art below:

Hard-nosed private eye Rachel (RPS in peace) pronounced herself fascinated but a little stumped by it, back in April, while Graham described it as his "ideal game" in a post about the recent addition of infidelity cases and lost-and-found jobs, adding to my suspicions that Graham is some kind of jigsaw killer and that his news posts are actually ciphered confessions of his terrible crimes.
Well, these already viscous plots are about to thicken into a borderline-immobile soup of intrigue, for ColePowered Games are adding modding tools to the game. These will allow you to pen your own detective mysteries, and even alter the surrounding city to fit.

Call of Duty cycles through its lineup of villains on a yearly basis. Sometimes it's Nazis, other times it's Russian nationalists or zombies. But the most dangerous threat is one without a lust for brains or access to weapons of war; it's stagnation. And while many Call of Duty teams often switch up just enough variables to stave off monotony, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III fully submits to the annual churn.


Speeding ahead also impedes the storytelling since it barrels through beats at …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After months of character reveals, Tekken 8 has announced the final fighter of its launch roster: Reina. This brand-new character sports a lightning-quick moveset, earning her the nickname “Purple Lightning," and has mysterious ties to the Mishima clan.
Bandai Namco states that little is known about Reina's history besides she’s a student of the Mishima Polytechnical School. For some reason, she really wants to fight Jin (move over, Hwoarang), and based on her gameplay trailer, she seems more than capable of taking him on. Check Reina out in action below. 


With Reina’s addition, the 32-fighter roster is now complete. Here’s the full list of characters, with new fighters denoted and links to applicable articles/trailers:
Alisa Bosconovitch
Asuka Kazama
Azucena Milagros Ortiz Castillo (New)
Bryan Fury
Claudio Serafino
Devil Jin
Feng Wei
Hwoarang
Jack-8 (New)
Jin Kazma
Jun Kazama
Kazuya Mishima/Devil Kazuya
King

Lars Alexandersson
Lee Chaolan
Leo Kliesen

Lili Rochefort
Ling Xiaoyu
Marshall Law
Nina Williams
Panda
Paul Phoenix
Raven
Reina (New)
Sergei Dragunov
Shaheen
Steve Fox
Victor Chevalier (New)
Yoshimitsu
Zafina
Additionally, the game's first Season of post-launch DLC will add four unannounced fighters. These characters will be released separately each season throughout 2024, with the first arriving sometime in the spring. 
Tekken 8 launches on January 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Check our early hands-on impressions of the game here.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-11-13T18:37:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon is laying off 180 jobs in its games division, hopping on the tragically overcrowded bandwagon of layoffs in the game industry this year. The news comes via Aftermath, which reports that the layoffs are focused in two areas – the Crown Twitch channel, which will reportedly be eliminated altogether, and the game growth teams. Employees were notified of the changes through an email from Christoph Hartman, VP of Amazon Games. This is the second wave of layoffs this division of the company has faced this year.
An excerpt of the announcement email can be read below:
There have been so many layoffs in the gaming industry this year that it's getting hard to keep track of. Last week, we learned Free Radical Design is on the verge of closing down and that Ubisoft laid off more than 100 employees. The week before that, roughly 100 employees were laid off at Destiny 2 developer Bungie. 
In January, Microsoft laid off 10,000 employees amidst its ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which it completed last month. 
In August, Striking Distance Studios, the team behind last year's The Callisto Protocol, laid off more than 30 employees, and that same month, Mass Effect and Dragon Age developer BioWare laid off 50 employees, including long-time studio veterans. The following month, in September, Immortals of Aveum developer Ascendant Studios laid off roughly 45% of its staff. 
Just last month, The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog laid off at least 25 employees, and Telltale Games underwent layoffs as well, although an actual number of laid-off employees has not yet been revealed. And in late October, Dreams developer Media Molecule laid off 20 employees.
The hearts of Game Informer's staff are with the people laid off from Amazon Games, along with everyone else who has lost a job this year.

As with every Indie World Showcase, the question must be asked: is this the time where we finally see Hollow Knight: Silksong, the Hollow Knight sequel from developer Team Cherry that began life as a DLC to the original game? It probably won't be but it's always fun to get your hopes up a little bit so that they may be gently crushed. 
Tomorrow's Indie World Showcase for Nintendo Switch begins at Noon ET. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Hollow Knight review and then check out everything announced during the last Indie World Showcase, which was held in April, for a glance at what to potentially expect with tomorrow's.

In the wake of the expansion announcement and seasonal reveals that rolled out about Diablo IV, we had the chance to speak with Diablo franchise manager Rod Fergusson and game director Joe Shely. We asked about the studio’s development processes post-launch, the specifics of gathering and responding to fan feedback and criticism, and the most critical priorities for Diablo IV in the months following launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Put your sleuthing caps on, detectives—it’s time to solve some mysteries! We are proud to announce that a whole batch of HeR Interactive’s Nancy Drew games are now ready for public testing:
In Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. 
Nancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.
In Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.
And if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.
The games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've seen Netflix's Arcane League of Legends animated series, there's a high probability you really like it – the show's great, even for non-League of Legends fans. It tells the heartwrenching story of sisters Vi and Jinx and their struggle to come to terms with each other in the high-tech (and magical) utopian city of Piltover and its seedy underbelly known as Zaun. The first season hit the subscription streaming service in November of 2021and now we know that Arcane Season 2 hits Netflix this time next year. 
More specifically, Arcane Season 2 drops on Netflix in November of 2024. To coincide with the news, Netflix has released a short teaser featuring Jinx. Check it out below:

With roughly a year to go before Season 2, if you haven't yet watched Arcane, which features voice actors like Hailee Steinfeld, Yuri Lowenthal, Ella Purnell, and more, you've got plenty of time to do so – and it's well worth your time!
In the meantime, check out the League of Legends Jinx champion skin that was added to Fortnite to celebrate Arcane, and then read Game Informer's review of Ruined King: A League of Legends story. Read about Convergence: A League of Legends Story after that.

Originally slated to release in 2021, the project has quietly remained in limbo for years, but developer Thekla Inc. has revealed that it’s finally arriving on April 30. 
Braid was first released for Xbox 360's Live Arcade on August 6, 2008, and stars Tim, a boy searching for a princess captured by a monster. The 2D platformer centers on time manipulation mechanics that players utilize to solve puzzles and locate/assemble jigsaw pieces.

A week later, in a quarterly financial results briefing, Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki revealed that PlayStation planned to launch more than 10 live service games by March 2026, with Bungie helping the company in the space. In an earnings call held today, Totoki stated that of its 12 live service games, it will only release six by Fiscal Year 2025, which ends March 2026, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. 
Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Bungie was evaluating some of PlayStation's in-development offerings, including Naughty Dog's Last of Us multiplayer project, which is reportedly on ice. It seems that evaluation has led to Sony retooling its approach as the company has delayed at least six liv…]]></summary>

For context, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 outsold Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which is the fastest-selling Super Mario game after selling through 4.3 million copies in two weeks. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was named the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game just three days after its release, too.

If you purchase a new Gundam model kit at your local store today, it originated in this facility in Shizuoka, Japan. The factory contains 35 plastic color-molding machines – 25 electric and 10 hydraulic – all helping produce millions of models yearly.
Bandai Spirits employee Miyuki Nakagiri, the subject matter expert on how exactly the factory operates, escorts us through the building. Our translator during this tour is Atsuo Yoshimura, a video game production manager who’s worked at Bandai Namco for the last 17 years. Notably, Yoshimura worked on last year’s Elden Ring – Game Informer’s 2022 Game of the Year, and most recently, Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon. Additionally, Yoshimura was instrumental in helping to coordinate Game Informer’s recent Armored Core VI cover story trip.

According to a new financial briefing from the company, it plans to support the Switch seemingly long after the release of rumored new-gen hardware expected to launch next year. 
It's been a big week for Nintendo, with the company revealing that Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the fastest-selling Super Mario game in the series and that a live-action Legend of Zelda movie is on the way. We also learned yesterday the Switch has surpassed 132 million units sold on the heels of great results for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4. Now, Nintendo has pulled back the curtains a bit on its approach to the Switch platform moving forward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!
Kingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. 
Escape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.
Both games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.
To play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!
