        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With over five billion visits and hundreds of thousands of daily players, Dress to Impress is one of the most successful games on Roblox. And much like other games on the platform, it’s got its fair share of items you can purchase with Robux. 


One of these options is the coveted VIP status, which gets you a golden title above your avatar and other sought-after benefits. If you’re just jumping into the game, you might be wondering if the VIP status is worth it. We’re here to give you all the details.


How much does VIP cost in Dress to Impress?


You’ll need 299 Robux to unlock a month of VIP status or spend 799 Robux to unlock it permanently. This translates to $10 for permanent VIP access and roughly $3.99 for the monthly one. If you plan on sticking with the game for a while, the perm…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you don't agree that Dandadan is this season's best anime, you have to at least admit it features the most impressive animation in a long while. It is the adaptation of the still-running manga of the same name, which has just had its 18th volume released on January 5th.


The anime's first season has recently come to a close, but — given its overwhelming audience love — I'm willing to bet we'll be seeing more Dandadan in the near future.


The events of the anime's season one go from the start of the manga up until the end of the fourth volume, where it ends on a cliffhanger. The story still has a long way to go to even catch up with the manga, and it was only in one of the latest episodes that we caught a glimpse at what the series' main plot would be about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It might be the winter season all over the globe, but Forza Horizon 5 players can enjoy new content as part of the Autumn Festival Playlist in the form of the Charmed I'm Sure Treasure Hunt, which is now live inside the game.


Incidentally, this treasure hunt will be a trip down memory lane for many veterans who have been playing since 2023, for this is not a new event. It has been released earlier in 2023, but if you're new, now is your chance.


Let's take a look at how to complete the Charmed I'm Sure Treasure Hunt in Forza Horizon 5.


Forza Horizon 5 Charmed I'm Sure Treasure Hunt guide


To begin the Treasure Hunt, you will have to start by checking out the clue.



‘Hypercars turn up the charm by five as they narrowly avoid others on the highway’




This clue is followed by a picture of a 2020 Koenigsegg Jesko, but you don't need this particular Hypercar to complete your task. In fact, you can use any Hypercar available in your garage to complete the Treasure Hunt.


Start driving along the main freeway (located right at the center of the map). You'll have to achieve five "Near Miss" skills. This is pretty easy to do: just drive close to the oncoming vehicles, but make sure that your car doesn't make contact.

Once you complete this objective, you'll be notified that you've solved the clue. The Charmed I'm Sure Treasure Hunt is located near Guanajuato, and you'll have to travel to the location. You'll find the chest at the base of a monument found at this location. Just drive through it, and you'll complete the Charmed I'm Sure Treasure Hunt.


Additionally, completing the objective will also get you 3 points that will contribute towards the Festival Playlist completion and 300 Forzathon Points. The points can be spent in the Forzathon shop.

Sega is no doubt aware of the bitter feelings surrounding the decision. The company announced the news at the tail end of the LAD Direct video as a "one last thing" surprise. Sega hasn't confirmed when the mode will arrive, mind. Yakuza in Hawaii will sail the salty seas on February 21, 2025, so the mode should (hopefully) arrive soon after.




For those unaware, the last mainline entry didn't include New Game Plus as part of the package. To play the mode in Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, players had to shell out 20 bones …]]></summary>

But I want to be upfront: My Summer Car is wildly unconventional. It has an almost incomparable design philosophy, completely shirking the evolution of games that came before it. As a result, it’s clearly for a specific type of person, but I can’t tell you what that type of person is, nor can I tell with any certainty if you would fit in that category. At best, I hope I can get you curious enough to try it. At worst, you won’t get what I’m talking about.

Leaks and rumours regarding the upcoming 'Switch 2' have seemingly exploded since the beginning of 2025, with accessory maker Genki in particular causing a stir with its recent exhibit at CES 2025. Not only that, but photos shared via Reddit seem to showcase a genuine Joy-Con from the Switch successor, hinting at a new feature in the form of an optical sensor.
Naturally, fans are going wild with speculation, and many have taken it upon themselves to produce renders of the Switch 2 that they claim may be accurate representations of the final machine based on the miriad of leaks.

Where to find the Lifer in Wuthering Waves


The Lifer is at the center of the massive maze located at the heart of the Fagaceae Peninsula zone, within Oakheart Highcourt. This location makes up most of the entire zone in size, and it is difficult to navigate, especially since some illusionary trickery is involved with reaching the center. More on that soon.


Upon laying eyes on this huge maze, your first instinct might be to use the Flight Utility tool to soar over the walls. Unfortunately, those illusions I just mentioned will prevent you from doing so: you'll get to the center…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Caroline Weir NumeroFUT objective is now live in EA FC 25, and you can select between two special versions of the Scottish playmaker.


This is the first time Weir has received a special card in this year's Ultimate Team. To obtain her card, you'll need to complete all the tasks of the objectives. Let's look at the tasks' requirements and the rewards you'll get. 


EA FC 25 Caroline Weir NumeroFUT objective guide


The Caroline Weir NumeroFUT objective has four tasks, and here are the requirements, along with their rewards. 


Task
Requirements
Rewards




Scottish Score
Score 1 goal with a player from Scotland in 3 separate matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals).
78+ x2 Rare Gold Players Pack


Assist 5
Assist 5 goals in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals) using a player from Liga F.
80+ x2 Rare Gold Players Pack


Play 7
Play 7 matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals) while having at least 3 players from Liga F in your starting 11.
81+ x3 Rare Gold Players Pack


Win 5
Win 5 matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals) while having at least 3 players from Liga F in your starting 11.
82+ x3 Rare Gold Players Pack






You can complete the tasks in Squad Battles and Division Rivals. It will be easier to complete the tasks in Squad Battles as you play against the AI and control the difficulty of the games. Choosing Squad Battles will allow you to focus more on the objective tasks rather than the end results. 


Picking one of the two cards will be difficult, as both look great on paper. I like the one with Power Shot+, as I tend to use Shadow Strikers in my squad. You can go with the one that has Trickster+ if you prefer to use Playmaker. You can also put this card into the Mentality Monster evolution to upgrade some of the in-game stats.

While both versions are pretty special, you can only choose one to add to your squad. Let's take a look at how you can complete the latest player SBC for cheap and if it's worth completing at all. 


EA FC 25 John Stones NumeroFUT SBC tasks


The John Stones NumeroFUT SBC has four tasks, and here are the conditions.


Task 1 - Manchester City



Min. 1 Players from: Manchester City

Task 4 - 87-Rated Squad

Endler 88


Renard 88


Swanson 87


Sugita 83


Mead 88


Dimarco 84



Between the two versions, I like the one with Anticipate+. This playstyle is easily the best defensive playstyle available inside the game, and it also offers Defender++. You can also use him as a Fullback at LB or Holding at CDM. It has great defensive stats and playstyles, making him the perfect candidate for being a defensive shield. 


For the price of about 180,000 coins, it's a great challenge to complete.

After Festival of the Lost 2024's wizard-themed armor sets, Bungie is now steering back towards the event's horror roots. What better way to do so than with a suite of monster costumes from contemporary pop-horror media, then? Once again, players get to vote on each of the three Classes' respective armor sets, and it is going to be a tough choice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bloody Baron is the first important sub questline you can come across in Velen, the first area from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's main quest. Though you might tackle it before or after the "Hunting a Witch" quest, I'd recommend you do the Baron's story first.


The titular man might immediately strike you as a typical good-for-nothing drunken abuser — as he struck me — but don't let the game fool you. Despite his many flaws, the Bloody Baron is a surprisingly deep character with intricacies that require your attention should you want to experience the full emotional range of this story. The Bloody Baron's questline is one of the best and definitely the most harrowing one you'll encounter in the base game. 


How many endings are there for the Bloody Baron quest in Witcher 3?

In video games, it generally helps smooth out the perceived frame-rate in a video game, but it also smears the image to a ridiculous degree. The good news is that BlurBusters might have an alternative.


As you may or may not know, the old cathode-ray tube screens weren't without merit. Heavy, clunky, and egregiously outdated in some respects, CRTs handled motion much, much better than any modern screen does. This isn't magic, justthe nature of the beast: Black Frame Insertion came part-and-parcel with these displays, drawing lines of pixels (phosphors, really) so quickly that motion remained crystal-clear no matter your refresh rate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Corrupted Soul is a pretty important item you can find in A Universal Time, and following the AUT 4.2 update, the importance has gone up.


This specific item is required for certain functions. For instance, if you want to obtain the reworked Umbra Ability inside the game, you'll need to get the Corrupted Soul to complete the process. Needless to say, it's not an easy item to obtain.


Let's take a look at how to get it inside A Universal Time.


How to get Corrupted Soul in A Universal Time


As you complete the game, you'll come across loot chests. These chests can be obtained by completing different quests. You can also get them by clearing Boss fights, and they can help you get a lot of valuable resources. The Corrupted Soul is also among one of those items that can drop from the Loot Chests.


While getting chests might not be a hard task, the difficulty increases if you're specifically looking for Corrupted Soul. The odds of it dropping from the chest are low since it's an Epic item, so it's best to have many chests to improve your chances. That way, you will have better odds (although the chest-specific odds don't change based on how many you open).




An easier way out is to go down the trade route. If you have a friend who might want to trade it to you, the job is done. You can do the same with any other player as well, but they will want something amazing in return. Make sure to offer something substantial in exchange to sway their minds.


The Corrupted Soul will be essential to unlock the reworked Umbra Ability. It's substantially better than its older form, and here's a complete guide that will help you to unlock it in A Universal Time's 4.2 Update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Come August, it will be nine years since we had a Deus Ex game, Mankind Divided, released in 2016. Some of you unfamiliar with the series may be shrugging your shoulders right now. "So what?" you may say, "we're still waiting on Half-Life 3." However, much like the elusive Half-Life installment, fans of the exploits of Adam Jensen also never got closure.


You see, Mankind Divided ended on a rather disappointing note, with the closing moments of the game strongly suggesting more was to come. However, it never emerged. As such, it's become a major sore point in Deus Ex's history, and the game's writer appears to agree.




In a recent interview on the YouTube channel "From Script to Life" (thanks, Kotaku), Mark Cecere – whose writing credits include the two Deus Ex reboots, Watch Dogs: Legi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While there might've been some skepticism over Nvidia RTX Remix, there's merit in this project yet. Though it's still a work in progress, the astonishingly good-looking Need for Speed: Underground RTX mod shows just how potent RTX Remix can be. And you can start playing it right now, to boot.


I'm not one to bemoan the current state of the Need for Speed franchise, as I genuinely feel that Unbound is on to something special. At the same time, though, there's no denying that Underground, Underground 2, and Most Wanted were the heyday for the series, and it's a real shame that there's no official remaster or remake in tow. That's where Alessandro893's RTX Remix version of the original 2003 NFS: Underground comes into the picture. Don't believe me? The neon speaks for itself, I feel.

Shoving other players requires pushing the Push action in Shrimp Game's store.

        <updated>2025-01-10T14:04:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite releasing to PS5 in 2020, The Last of Us Part 2 is only just about coming to PC. On the one hand, it will be the remastered version when it is released (it's up to you to decide whether a four-and-half-year-old game even needs remastering). However, if you're planning to get your gritty zombie action on via Steam or Epic Games Store, you won't be able to escape Sony's clutch.


As noted by VGC, if you want to play The Last of Us Part 2 on PC, you'll need to connect a PlayStation Network account in order to do so. Indeed, if you look on the game's Steam page, you can see it says so on the right-hand column.




This is despite two things:



TLoU is a single-player game, so it doesn't make sense to require a PSN account.


A similar tactic was tried last year with Helldiver 2. Guess how that went down...



It seems Sony has learned nothing


As the report from VGC also points out, having to have a separate account in order to play through Steam or Epic renders the game useless in countries that don't have PSN. Obviously, this means a lot of people around the world won't be able to play The Last of Us Part 2 (remastered or not) when it comes to PC this April.


While Sony has reneged on this decision in the past – doing a complete U-turn when it tried to introduce it to the aforementioned Helldiver 2 – the company also admitted it was "still learning what is best for PC players." However, this doesn't appear to be the case if Sony goes forward with PSN requirements for a PC port of a single-player game.


There was also the incident in September 2024 when a mod for God of War Ragnarök removed the PlayStation Network requirement altogether. This alone should show how unpopular it is. Will Sony relent for The Last of Us Part 2? It seems well within its best interests to do so. Sadly, I have no influence over that decision.

Forever Entertainment has announced today that House of the Dead 2: Remake will finally make its way over to Switch in Spring 2025 — that's only a few months away!
Initially announced with its predecessor's remake back in 2019, this one has felt like a long time coming. What's more, aside from some rogue age ratings that popped up online last year, we have been given very little information on this gory gunning trip across Italy.

The very secret goal of the column is for the guests to name every book ever written. It's a task every single one has failed miserably at with two notable exceptions. One was Dan Griliopoulos, who listed 400 books in a document before he got bored and gave up - a heroic, if ultimately futile effort.

You'll need to link to a PlayStation Network account to play The Last Of Us Part II on PC, say Sony. The requirement was reported by Video Games Chronicle, and sure enough, the Steam page for the "Remastered" version of the third-person fungus fighter includes a footnote in the game description that confirms it in plain language - "Account for PlayStation Network required". For a lot of people this is a minor nuisance, for others it more likely means that the game won't be on sale in your country at all. Sony's reasons for enforcing the requirement remain obscure.

Nintendo has announced that it is collaborating with Lego to launch a brand new set based on the classic Game Boy handheld.
Currently scheduled to launch in October 2025, the set follows on from the Lego NES set that the companies launched back in 2020. Presumably, however, it probably won't be quite so ludicrously expensive. Well... we'll see, you never know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I died in Beyond Citadel, the game treated to me a close-up shot of my character's scantily clad, bisected body lying in a pool of guts and ripped underwear. It turns out you can turn off a lot of the gore and nudity. You can also swaddle yourself in some nice, sturdy, PG-13 body armor. But you're seemingly stuck with a certain base percentage of bulging, softcore gratuitousness in both the character portrait on bottom left, and in the mildly boobulent background art of the world. I'm not sure I can put up with all that, which is a shame, because Beyond Citadel is otherwise a promising, eerie FPS that mixes ideas from 90s shooters in pretty appealing ways.

Dreams On A Pillow is a stealth adventure that tells the story of a young mother during the Nakba - the 1948 ethnic cleansing, displacement, and cultural suppression of Palestinian Arabs by Israel.

When Nintendo released the 3DS, it equipped all new game cartridges with a plastic nub, preventing them from being inserted into your classic clamshell. Why are we bringing this up as 'Switch 2' leaks reach fever pitch? Because accessory manufacturer Genki (the talk of the town this week) has claimed that a similar 'indentation' approach has been used to keep people from squeezing their new console into a 'Switch 1' dock (thanks, IGN).
In case you haven't graced the internet in the past 48 hours, Genki has taken this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) by storm, showcasing its upcoming accessories via a "Switch 2 replica". This model, which is allegedly based on the real thing and appears very much in line with what every other leak has suggested, has given us our best look yet at what 'Switch 2' might be (remember, Nintendo is still yet to officially reveal anything). What's more, the accessory manufacturer has been answering questions about it.

Accessory manufacturer Genki has well and truly stuck its middle finger up to Nintendo in recent days, opting to openly showcase its planned accessories for the as-yet unannounced 'Switch 2' during CES 2025.
Now, in a new interview with The Verge, Genki's co-founder and CEO Eddie Tsai divulged a few more details regarding the console itself, including the new magnetic Joy-Con controllers. According to Tsai, pressing the release buttons on the back of the Joy-Con causes a small pin to protrude from the side of the Joy-Con, thus pushing it away from the main body enough to break the magnetic connection.

This is a warning to all those who are yet to play Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club and want to work through the mystery unspoiled: do not watch Nintendo's latest trailer for the game.
Yesterday, Nintendo uploaded a new trailer for the 2024 mystery entitled 'What Lies in the Past' (we've linked it in that last sentence but won't be embedding it for obvious reasons). It's an innocent-looking title and, without any form of warning at the start, bar the age certification the Nintendo of America upload, you would be forgiven for thinking it's just another promo. Perhaps, at a stretch, the reveal of some upcoming DLC. But no, it's actually loaded with late-game content that you might want to avoid.

Yep, while our friends across the pond landed plastic figurines of Sonic and co. to mark the arrival of the third movie, UK Happy Meals instead get a range of fabric balls with the faces of Sonic, Tails, Knuckles or Shadow emblazoned on the front. There are also some, uhh, Super variants of select characters, but we won't get into that here.

Despite the sheer excitement surrounding Nintendo's upcoming reveal and release of the 'Switch 2', Circana (NPD) analyst Mat Piscatella has predicted that Sony's PlayStation 5 will sell more units in the US this year overall.
Speaking via Bluesky (thanks, Push Square), Piscatella states that he expects the Switch successor to sell around 4.3 million units in the region, provided it launches within the first half of the year. That's still a pretty hefty number, but Piscatella reckons there will be some hardware constraints after an initial surge of high demand. As such, he thinks the PS5 will ultimately outsell the Switch 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the onslaught of Switch 2 leaks continues, and most especially the very convincing appearance of what are likely to be the new console’s Joy-Cons, a weird sense hit me: I’m a bit disappointed. I love the Switch, I think it’s a wonderful piece of tech, and I would really love to have an upgraded version of it that’s…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone who believes in the ideal of the trim, tidy PC interior, I do applaud the intent behind MSI’s Project Zero X. Currently on show at CES 2025, it’s a prototype desktop build that uses clever geometry and an unconventional motherboard I/O layout to hide practically every single wire in the joint, for a clean design that's housed for your viewing pleasure within a four-sided glass chamber. It’s the closest PCs have come to the simple Victorian pleasures of a nice terrarium, and honestly, good on it.
The problem is that if Project Zero X’s components ever actually go on sale, there becomes a non-zero percent chance that I will come into possession of that see-through case. And there is a one hundred percent chance I will ruin it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a quiet month for video game releases, as January tends to be, but there’s at least one approaching asteroid in the shape of Space Engineers 2. Announced over the winter, it’s a spruced-up reimagining of your scientifically determined 22nd favourite space game - the hectic Second Coming of a simulation we’ve devoted 14 whole-ass features to since 2013, including a seven-part diary series featuring many a starfaring Vengabus or Wild Wild Westerly giant robot spider.
It really is high time we gave the new game some attention, then. The very first alpha launches into Steam early access on January 27th. Here’s what’s in store.

It's an idle clicker, obviously, which starts with a single button in the centre of a browser screen. The more "stimulation" you accrue through clicking, the more options become available. It escalates. And escalates. And escalates. I found that my feelings of delight grew roughly in proportion to the toll taken on my computer's processor. After 30 minutes, I was huffing and hooting like a drunken horse to a soundtrack of disintegrating laptop fans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year’s annual CPU tug-of-war was cleanly won by AMD, its obscenely fast Ryzen 7 9800X3D almost singlehandedly leaving Intel and their Core Ultra chips in a heap of mud and P.E.-spec rope. Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.
No pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.

The list in question is part of a strategy of counteracting what the US sees as the close relationship between China's armed forces and various civilian technology suppliers and research projects.
At the time of publication yesterday, a Tencent spokesperson had commented that the listing was based on a "misunderstanding". In a statement sent to RPS overnight and also published online, Tencent's chairman Ma Huateng and executive board have now said that they're prepared to get legal if the misunderstanding isn't resolved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: I neglected to specify that the development costs of all three titles were incurred "over the game’s lifecycle," as per Game File's report. I apologise if you felt genuine shock instead of the far more apt medium to mild surprise.

The development of 2020 FPS Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War cost $700 million, making it the most expensive video game project yet reported. That’s according to a court filing reviewed by Stephen Totilo’s Game File (paywalled) in which Call Of Duty creative head Patrick Kelly divulged the budgets of three games in the series.

Yet that's the challenge taken up yesterday by speedrunners at Awesome Games Done Quick. The UFO 50 speedrun includes an impressive dart through the retro collection's most bewildering game, the ancient and mysterious Barbuta, in which your character is a frustratingly slow hero with a fearfully short attack range. They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gentle reader, I have previously written exactly two boob-related articles in my life. One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.
Now it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs. Behold.

Mass Effect 3 tried voice commands. Socom U.S Navy Seals shipped with a headset. "Dunno if I wanna be shouting out tacticool commands in my living room," wrote a Redditor on the subject four years ago, speaking to my very soul in the process. "Gimme the clunky buttons instead".
Thankfully, you can also use your keyboard to interrogate suspects in murder mystery Dead Meat. It’s a moody, slightly goofy noir puzzler that lets you ask anything you want. Whether this means you’ll always get a worthwhile response, I’m not sure. "Want to discuss their alibi? Probe them on the meaning of life? Confess your love? Or just troll them mercilessly? Your words hold power, and anything goes," reads the Steam page. Here’s a trailer.

Those eventually grew into their PCIe shoes, but only after months of dial-shifting driver updates – whereas the flagship B580 promises Nvidia-besting games performance from the off. Even at such a stage in the current graphics generation (the GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 could be revealed literally tonight, at CES 2025), there is something enticing about that proposition.

Let's see if we fare better this time round: Sonic Galactic is an absurdly accomplished Sonic fangame from Starteam that, broadly, imagines how the Mega Drive and Genesis platformers might have looked and felt had they been made for the Sega Saturn. There's a new demo, if you fancy trying it for yourself. Please find it here on Itch.io. Perhaps if I'd put the download link higher up the page in the other article, people would have got distracted and refrained from dunking on me so awfully.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An upcoming life sim which claims to be a competitor to Grand Theft Auto VI is continuing to amass followers and wishlists on Steam, despite the game being unmasked as a vehicle for a dodgy cryptocurrency. Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules. But it's still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.

That's specifically RPGs with "AAA" budgets, whatever AAA means these days. Cain is, of course, well aware that there are many RPGs from smaller teams that "evolve past the paradigm of violence being the default way in which the player interacts with the world", and that there are plenty of puzzle games, adventure games and the like in which there is no violence at all.

It is, like Dark Souls, a game about equipment and stamina management, but it finds most success as a soulslike in the sensation that you are alone somewhere bad, not able to do very much except hit horrible things in the space between them trying to hit you. It also offers notable moments of lonely, loud footsteps rebounding off cold stone tiles in the seconds after felling some giant man-bastard - one of the subgenre’s greatest un-joys.

Who were these mysterious shufflers, flocking to the deserted, echoing halls of Valve’s disastrous flop like your mate who uses the word ‘liminal’ too much to a dead shopping center? Forbes, who first reported on the phenomena, don’t know. No one knows. Somebody might actually know but writing ‘no one knows’ makes it more dramatic. Let’s dig in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As New Year's Day dawns, the bells ring out from the steeples of old London town. The peals of celebration travel outward through our atmosphere, exiting the realm of Earthly sound and resonating with interstellar plasma and detritus to form a delicate ripple of comet flakes and stray photons, expanding far beyond our solar system. Where the ripple encounters larger masses, such as planets, suns and... other things, it rebounds, riding the weft of stardust back down to Earth. As it returns home, the signal is modified. Tinkered with. It acquires unsettling harmonics and a guttural undertow. By the time it re-enters our atmosphere, it has condensed to three words, which descend and shrink and spiral into your ear like an octopus entering a crevice: FEED THE MAW.

S úctou a upřímnou pokorou jsem přistoupil k aranžmá národní slovenské hymny "Nad Tatrou sa blýská" již v roce 2016. Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté "hradní" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…]]></summary>

Developers NetEase had recently doled out bans of up to 100 years to players they suspected of cheating, but in their eagerness, failed to distinguish between legitimate compatibility layers – the software that non-Windows operating systems, like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS, use to run native Windows games – and actual hacks. Per IGN, NetEase have now apologised to the affected players, and lifted the bans.

As a concept, at least, SpaceCraft seems both flavourless and oddly inclined to overplay its own familiarity. I mean, look at that title. Consider its chilly blend of functionality and punmanship. Look at that capital "C", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft. This you may do eternally, for there are thousands of planets in store.

I’m busy replaying The Suffering 2 for the sixth time to see a new 15 second cutscene that recognises which combination of morally aligned beginnings and endings I’ve picked. It reads your save from the first game and everything!". Say ‘memory card’ to a youthful, broccoli-maned Fortnite enjoyer nowadays. Go on, I dare you. You’ll be in a home before you know it.
Still, having new toys at regular intervals is one real upshot of our new live-service barrage of ephemeral novelty, perpetually flung at my dizzy eyeballs like gleaming carnival daggers at exhausted spinning wheels. Especially if they’re for the exquisite strategy of Mechabellum. Season 2 released yesterday alongside patch 1.2, bringing with it a new unit and specialist, some reworks, and lots of cosmetic bits I pretend not to care about but then get excited when I unlock a new one.

The concept for Judas is that you're trapped in a computer-run society housed aboard a colony ship, the Mayflower. The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. "Bioshock Infinite in space", we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.
In Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.

Indiana Jones And The Great Circle’s writers knew about having hands. They’d picked up a thing or two. Turned the odd key. Raised the occasional entire lemon to their lips and devoured it whole. Clicked a camera button. Placed an object upon a table. They had touched things, and beyond this, they had felt them. They knew that the player could never truly be Indiana Jones, but they could be allowed to make a pretend man who sounded at least 83% like Indiana Jones do things with his hands that very much resemble the sort of things Indiana Jones might do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brendan Greene, the modder-turned-millionaire who designed battle royale game PUBG: Battlegrounds, wants to make his studio's next game a "metaverse", although he says he's wary of using the term. The project is called "Artemis" (at least for now) and you won't be seeing it any time soon. That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. 
Greene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led "multiverse of worlds" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox. He is nonetheless "full of confidence".

The latest trailer is a series of sweeping yet intimate, colourful urban cross-sections, showing dozens of NPCs selling fish, shaking hands on balconies, shouldering barrels, dancing with fans, honing their feng shui, and various other pursuits that allegedly form part of full NPC life simulations. It's like scrutinising a Hitman level from above, except that all of these people have evolving relationships and sleeping patterns and they might hunt you down if you murder any of their relatives. Me, I just want to play Where's Wally.

The TV companies are now taking legal action against UK ISPs; they're unlikely to put up a fight, they may not even turn up in court.

The newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel "Seith" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven't updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as "Ghost Of A Tail" is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.

One I hadn't even played properly until after the vote, and the other? The other is a flawed pick, but one that I couldn't stop thinking about.
Anyway, hope you all have a restful Xmas folks and a cracking new year. I hope Santa bought you some nice warm socks or a chocolate orange so dense, you could tee it off at your local golf club.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm quite proud of the delights that we packed behind each door of the Advent Calendar this year, to be honest. All my major choices are in there, plus a few more that I haven't played but I'd watched other people play, and had a swell time doing so. Still, there are always a handful that don't quite make the cut, but still deserve a heaped Christmas plateful of praise at year's end. So here's my selection box, my bonus games of the year for 2024. It's an unusually diverse triad this time.

As long as I get to be immersed in an adventure. I think that's the big theme of my selection box: being grounded within my player character. I want to feel what it's like to hike through canyons with too much sellable loot in my backpack. I want to park my soul in the head of a scared Scotsman way out of his depth, hundreds of miles from shore. The closer I can comfortably fit in my character's shoes, the more I seem to buy into the world they inhabit. Even if that world is constantly glowing a magnificent crimson.

Supported by exactly zero evidence, the report claims that hundreds of internet users have already been identified.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. 


So! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.

To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

"Detective," she said, glaring at me with eyes like gorgeous tennis balls, "I want to open today's advent calendar door." I was confused. "Whaddya wanna do that for, missy?" She sat back, relaxed, and pulled a gun from her purse. "I need to stuff a body into it."

Due to the intervention of Dark Powers and also, half the Treehouse already being on holiday, we neglected to do a round-up of staff Xmas plays before signing off for the year. Well, I’m pretty sure nobody did one. I can’t see anything scheduled in the RPS Post-A-Tron, but the RPS Post-A-Tron is an unreliable beast, full of malice and deceit. If I publish this and it turns out we have two, please divide into rival factions and have a comments war over which is the real one. Apologies! Normal service will resume next year.

The only thing missing from his account of the game was the bread needed to make that rich, meaty concoction a tasty, nourishing sandwich.
And by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness.

Is usually intended to test out the new and the strange of gaming hardware. Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.
Recently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?

Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.
Taxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time. But even if you absolutely, utterly, and correctly loathe card-based systems, this game has none.

It begins as a "fireball of occult potentiality," dangling in the Great Hall of the Unseen University, which evolves into a ghostly "embryo universe." The embryo expands "lightly as a thought," with spectral continents "sleeting" through walls and people. It surges across the landscape until the entire population and geography of the Disc is exactly duplicated and enclosed by a shimmering shadow-self of "shining threads that followed every movement."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frostpunk developers 11 bit studios have cancelled a new, console-oriented game in response to both "shifting market trends" - in particular, declining player enthusiasm for "narrative-driven, story-rich games" - and specific problems during development. As a consequence, a number of 11 bit staff are going to lose their jobs, though at least half of the affected development team are being offered the chance to move to other projects, including a few unannounced ones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At any given moment I am in the center of a wonderful vortex of skeletons. Bones splash and rattle and burst out of the ground in sharp, horrible spurs. My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.
This is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. 


Speaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We are a people who honour democracy," said the dog, scratching himself. "Per our custom, you may drink of our fresh water." The dog was called Senator Umeshefaat, and he was very civil, even if he was shedding his black and white fur everywhere. We spoke in his home village at dawn. Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was "hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal." I suppose every politician has their enemies. 
That Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.

Sony and Kadokawa were reported to be in talks last month, fomenting all sorts of speculation about, say, the PC version of Bloodborne being ritually sacrificed to consecrate the PS6-exclusivity of Dark Souls 4. Now, the pair have emerged from the Cave of Haggling and announced... "a strategic capital and business alliance agreement". What does this mean? Is it safe to scream yet?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[They say hope is the first step on the road to disappointment, and reader, I’ve made a pretty damn big step. Previously, on my mission to survive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl with only wild mutants as my weapons, I’d discovered clues that someone else was attempting to tame the Zone’s beastly inhabitants. With one of their electronic tracking collars in hand and absolutely no preexisting knowledge of their location, I set out to find this kindred spirit, only for the Zone to once again slam a door in my face.
A cold, steel, very literal door to boot. It turns out that the scientist’s laboratory is locked up tight, and will remain so until I delve about twenty hours deeper into the faction war that’s bubbled up while I’ve been running around throwing irradiated rats at people in tracksuits. Fine. Fine! But I’m keeping the collar.

But this year a modder began work on an overhaul that would grant the game pretty cel-shaded visuals. Since then the modding team has grown to 40 people and the scope of the mod's features has ballooned. It's now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff 'em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday.

In October of this year, we got a look at some icky celestial faction and zero in the way of actual gameplay. And now? Now we finally get a look at how you do things.

In yet another hollow display of solidarity and "Liber-tea", they've teamed up with the loathsome fascists of Killzone, the elderly shooter series from Sony and Guerrilla Games.
From today, you'll be able to buy weapons, armour and cosmetics belonging to Killzone's despicable stormtroopers from the Helldivers Superstore, and there's the suggestion of an additional Killzone-themed reward depending on the fortunes of the so-called Galactic War, a xenocidal bloodbath couched as an exercise in bringing "freedom" to the upstanding socialist Automatons, the blameless wildlife of the Tyranids, and the Wellsian cosplayers of the recently added Illuminate faction.
We here at Rock Paper Shotgun stand against Super Earth and Arrowhead's wanton aggression, which absolutely isn't a big satirical joke based on some Verhoeven film or other. Anyway, those capes. Find an image and further details below.

Writing about a new city builder at Sin's suggestion is like being invited to budget the development of Londinium by Julius Caesar.
The terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences - has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months. Today I bite the bullet, and emerge from my lodgings to issue a hesitant speech to the masses, hoping like hell that Caesar is too preoccupied with the latest Gaul uprising to notice my errors.
