        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's your chance to get the latest Tomb Raider title for free
It's hard to keep up with all the awesome new releases in games, but sometimes, you just gotta throw it all to the wind and play an old favorite. If you're a fan of the Tomb Raider reboot series, and you're looking for a gritty adventure game to sink your teeth into, you're in luck, because Shadow of the Tomb Raider is the free game on the Epic Games Store for September.
Shadow of the Tomb Raider was originally released back in 2018 as the third game in the reboot trilogy and the twelfth mainline Tomb Raider game. The game's events take place a year after the events of its predecessor, Rise of the Tomb Raider, which came out in 2015, and finds Lara Croft racing against the clock to prevent the world from ending yet again. Arguably the darkest game in the series yet, it explores themes of descension, both through Lara's personality and the jungle itself.

The story is based on both Mayan and Aztec mythologies, and in creating the game, Square Enix devs consulted with historians to create the architecture and people of the legendary city Paititi. Fun fact: the game is still sitting at number seven on the list of most expensive games ever made, after adjusting for inflation.
Submerged: Hidden Depths is the other free-to-download title paired with Shadow of the Tomb Raider on the Epic Games Store. It's a relaxing exploration sim that has players uncovering the ruins of a beautiful, sunken world. If you want a more chill exploration-based gaming experience, it sounds like it's thematically fairly close to the Tomb Raider series, so it could be a fun one to try out.
The games are available for free download on the Epic Games Store starting September 1, so make sure to grab the roguelike "card crawler" Ring of Pain before it leaves the rotation next week.

The Nintendo Treehouse went live today with a special stream highlighting two upcoming Switch games. First up was Splatoon 3, which got a big showcase of not just its single-player campaign, but some of its new weapons.
The Treehouse team set about tackling some levels in Splatoon 3 that were largely spoiler-free, outside of general locale information. The first few segments are absolutely some familiar Splatoon multiplayer. Blast some ink, jet along the course, take out the bad guys, and reach the goal.
What caught my eye right away was some of the new Splatoon 3 weapons the team spotlighted. The Splatana, an ink-launching katana, looks really great in motion. It's got different fire modes for different situations, and feels like an interesting evolution of …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not that all the other wars were just a bit of goofing around, but World War One – a conflict remembered more for its bleak, arduous trench warfare than any great triumph over evil – seems like a particularly unusual source of inspiration for a strategy game that will, presumably, be played for fun. Nonetheless, The Great War: Western Front, a combination of macro planning and tactical RTS battling revealed this week at Gamescom, has elected to lean right into WW1’s complexities and difficulties rather than dance around them.

Developers Petroglyph have gone for historical accuracy in various ways, senior designer Chris Becker and audio director Frank Klepacki explain to me at a hands-off demo in Cologne. The soundtrack will even include licensed music from the era. But something they want to really hammer home is the brutality of the war: territory won’t be won in heroic pushes but slowly and bloodily, while collapsing morale is as much a danger as any advancing army.

Publisher MAGES has announced that the upcoming double pack of Tachyon shmups Bullet Soul and sequel Bullet Soul: Infinite Burst has been hit with a small delay and will now launch on Nintendo Switch September 29, a little over a fortnight later than its initially stated launch of September 9.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMiWfkUfxZw
Originally released on Xbox 360 in 2011 and 2014, the Bullet Soul titles espouse the frantic bullet hell action, pulse-pounding soundtrack, and goofy anime aesthetics that are so embedded in the modern shmup market. Several notable industry veterans were involved in the game's development, with music provided by composers Kenji Ito (Romancing SaGa) and Kohata Takahashi (Ridge Racer) and colorful character art daubed by Monogatari's Akio Watanabe
Available on PC since 2017, the new Nintendo Switch port of the two titles will be the Bullet Soul series' first international console release. In Japan, the Bullet Soul Double Pack will also receive a physical edition, which comes complete with an art book and soundtrack CD. Unfortunately, there are currently no plans to bring this edition of the game to western shores.
Bullet Soul and Bullet Soul: Infinite Burst will launch digitally on Nintendo Switch September 29.

The BioShock film adaptation has found its director and scriptwriter. Netflix confirms today that I Am Legend director Francis Lawrence will be the BioShock director, with a script written by Michael Green.
Lawrence has a pretty solid list of action-thrillers on his resume, including I Am Legend and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Meanwhile, Green has penned scripts for Logan, Blade Runner 2049, and American Gods.
https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1562864632708050945
These two will be tackling a live-action adaptation of the BioShock franchise. It's unclear which parts of that franchise will be adapted, but the Big Daddy is featured in Netflix's promos so far. It seems like an underwater venture seems like a safe bet.
 Would you kindly pass the remote?
Netflix also announced some more news for its ongoing video game adaptations, locking in The Umbrella Academy showrunner Steve Blackman for the development of its Horizon Zero Dawn series. Alongside Castlevania, Tekken, and more, that's a lot of adaptations for Netflix.

And there are even more if you take a look around the entertainment industry. Sony is heavily developing several different projects, including reports of Days Gone and Gravity Rush movies. Sonic the Hedgehog is doing well at the box office.
Basically, get ready for a lot of video game adaptations. It seems like the dam is open, and they're all going to flood in soon. At the very least for the BioShock film, this is a good pairing of writer and director. I've enjoyed a good chunk of their previous work, and they seem like a pairing that could tackle something like BioShock in an interesting way.
And hey, this news plus the recent 15th anniversary make for a good excuse to revisit BioShock. Here's hoping we get to see a Big Daddy on the screen soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The series will star Aloy too
The Horizon Zero Dawn series at Netflix has picked up a notable name. The Umbrella Academy showrunner Steve Blackman is developing the Horizon Netflix series.
In a Tudum interview, Blackman confirms he's developing the series, alongside upcoming space drama Orbital. He also says that the Netflix Horizon Zero Dawn series will star Aloy, the protagonist of the Horizon video games.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq594XmpPBg
"Horizon Zero Dawn is an exceptionally well-crafted game with wonderful characters not often seen in the rank-and-file of the gaming world," said Blackman. "Guerrilla Games has created an incredibly lush and vivid world of man and machine who find themselves on a collision course to oblivion. Their salvation comes in the form of a young female warrior named Aloy, who has no idea she's the key to saving the world. Suffice it to say, yes, Aloy will be a main character in our story. My writing partner on this, Michelle Lovretta, and I are thrilled to be able to expand this remarkable IP into a series for all types of viewers. "
An expanding roster of Sony adaptations
We first got an inkling that Sony was working on a Horizon Zero Dawn series in a recent business presentation. Horizon is also one of many, many franchises that Sony is adapting into other media.
Sony and PlayStation Productions have a number of projects in the works, headed towards both series and the silver screen. Last week, a report revealed that a Days Gone project is in the works. Gravity Rush also reportedly has a film in development.
Then there's HBO's The Last of Us, the already-released Uncharted movie, and several other reports of projects in the works. PlayStation Productions continues to surge ahead with adaptations, as it seems like there are few franchises that aren't getting their time on the screen.

Netflix revealed in a tweet made today that Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Slumberland) will direct this BioShock film adaptation and Michael Green (Loga, Blade Runner 2049, American Gods) will write the script.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atomic Heart reemerged during Gamescom with a new trailer devoted solely to showing off its impressive, Bioshock-esque combat. Over three minutes of gameplay footage shows off the carnage you'll unleash against adversaries, both artificial and organic. 
Players wield melee weapons or firearms in one hand and more, shall we say, unconventional abilities in the other. That includes electrifying targets with lightning bolts, tossing them around with a telekinesis-like power, freezing foes solid with an ice blast, or using wires to hijack machines. The action-packed video shows off how players can creatively combine their arsenal to dismantle and disembowel anything standing in their way. 


Atomic Heart was first announced in 2018 and takes place in an alternative futuristic version of the Soviet Union in 1955. Robotic technology flourished post World War 2, allowing humanity to create a high-tech utopia. Unfortunately, these mechanical helpers have started rebelling against their human creators. If that wasn’t enough, killer mutants born from secret experiments have also run amok. Players control private agent P-3, who embarks on a secret mission to get to the bottom of what’s caused this seemingly perfect society to collapse and clean up this mess. 
Atomic Heart launches this fall for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It’s also launching on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

As I made my way through the core campaign of Genshin impact 3.0, I came across a quest that had me questioning whether or not my game was bugged. But it wasn't! Here's how to quickly get through the Genshin Impact courtyard "far down the corridor" quest.
[There are no story spoilers present below outside of the puzzle solution.]

Walk up to the marked quest area, and line up the symbols to get through the Genshin Impact courtyard
A few hours into the Genshin Impact 3.0 Archon (main story) questline, you'll encounter a section that warps you away to another area. This is all part of the Through Mists of Smoke and Forests Dark portion of Chapter III, at which point you'll encounter the "Silent Seeker of Knowledge" step.
After jumping through a series of light platforming puzzles, you'll encounter the aforementioned "courtyard far down the corridor." The thing is you're not really investigating in the courtyard per se, but in the general area. You can't go over the ledge, so step into the spot in the above image, and position your camera so that the two symbols in the background line up. The screen will change hue and doors will open on your left, allowing you to continue the quest.

It seems so simple, but sometimes not everything works out as nicely as it should. When I arrived in this area, the light indicating where I should investigate the courtyard didn't show up. Subsequently, I tried to actually get into the courtyard and thought it was bugged. But I've been through enough action-platformers to eventually figure out the classic "line up the symbols with the camera" trick. And now you have too!

There's nothing quite like Chibi-Robo. The teeny, tiny little robot came out late in the GameCube's lifespan in the west and never really got the love he deserved. We never forgot about him at least, but it's been a quiet few years since developer Skip Ltd and Chibi-Robo have plugged into adventure, despite the game getting a few DS and 3DS follow-ups.
And it seems like there might be a reason for that. In an exclusive interview with our shiny new sister site Time Extension, Chibi-Robo's director Kenichi Nishi talks about how the game came to be on Nintendo's little purple box, and how Miyamoto managed to help keep the project alive. But, near the end of the interview, the director admits that many of the original staff who worked on the series are no longer at Skip:

An abstract, muddled trailer was followed by a frustratingly obscure conversation with developer Build a Rocket Boy, which left viewers oblivious as to what the ambitious title actually is.
However, given its clear status as "more than just a video game," it didn't take long for critics to speculate that the Everywhere platform might be tightly embedded with controversial NFT and/or blockchain technology. This speculation was further founded when it was revealed that numerous blockchain-based roles — including a coder, test engineer, and contract developer — had previously been advertised on the developer's website back in June (the va…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Personal space.
I Was a Teenage Exocolonist, the latest game from indie publisher Finji, developed by Northway Games, is a nice game. It looks nice, sounds nice, features nice characters being nice to one another, and is so nice to the player that you’ll breeze right through it – for better or worse. This is a game where the sheer word count and richness of presentation are a feat to behold, outstripping any text-based story game we’ve played in a long time. Nintendo Life’s interview with developer Sarah Northway following the release of the Steam demo gave a hint of the passion driving the game, and playing it on Switch certainly bears that out.
At its heart, Exocolonist is a piece of interactive fiction in the most traditional, choose-your-own-adventure, Twine-game style. The bulk of the story experience consists of reading concise flavour text, then picking an option for how your character acts. This is ornamented neatly with lightweight third-person exploration and an enjoyable card game mechanic, allowing a breather from the text and keeping momentum up.

It’s a game clearly designed to mimic the picture book imagination of childhood with its hand-drawn visuals and the innocent silent presence of its protagonist, a young boy named OU and his opossum friend. Even its music is reminiscent of some lost, unknown childhood as we’re lulled into the strange world of U-Chronia with the smooth instrumentation of a single guitar and its occasional percussion. Yet it’s clear with the presence of beasts that threaten your safety and a shadowy clone that this isn’t some peaceful retreat into childhood.

First-person action RPG Atomic Heart has a new trailer today, showcasing the upcoming game's combat. And from wild powers to melee weapons and guns, it looks like you'll have a pretty fun arsenal to play with in this game.
Developer Mundfish released this trailer today, spotlighting how the player can fight against hordes of mechanized combatants. They look pretty dangerous, from the regular automated grunts to giant bosses.

Atomic Heart is set in a future where a failure at a Soviet facility has led to a machine uprising. As Major P-3, you have to go in, minimize consequences, and prevent critical info from leaking.
You'll need weapons though, to deal with all the angry robots. And it looks like you get a pretty decent variety of them. Atomic Heart is absolutely giving me BioShock vibes, in a very good way. Freezing enemies and lifting them into the air with your power-charged glove, then battering them with a makeshift melee weapon looks like a blast.
Atomic punk
We've been seeing bits and pieces of Atomic Heart over the last few years, as Mundfish has continued to work away on the project. We've seen combat, exploration, story, and even one very unsettling clown enemy. Not looking forward to that fight in particular.
It's a game that's continued to impress me a little more each time I see new footage. And from what we saw today, it really does seem like Atomic Heart is coming together well.
The question at this point is, when will it launch? Mundfish published the trailer today, alongside a tweet that says it will launch on console and PC in late 2022.
It looks like this holiday season might see us freezing, smashing, and bashing robots in this retro-future universe.

It's back to our regularly scheduled Nintendo Switch Sports dominance in the Japanese charts. For the last few months, we've seen a handful of different games grab the number one spot in the weekly Famitsu charts, but last week saw Nintendo's family-friendly online sports game reclaim number one from Xenoblade Chronicles 3.
And Switch Sports remains proudly at the top this week, selling 18,668 copies in the week of 15th to 21st August. Xenoblade has slipped a further seven places down the charts, now placing in ninth ahead of Mario Party Superstars.

A video game sequel is hard to create, especially if the previous game was a commercial success. Why did the game resonate with fans? How many new features does the sequel need to justify another price tag? Should anything be changed at all? How do you make something fresh while retaining the identity established in the first release?
These are the questions developers constantly ask themselves while making a game. The road to publishing a project is full of pitfalls, and it’s easy to lose the path.

Fear Effect Reinvented, which was first announced way back in 2017, will tell the tale of ruthless mercenaries Hana Tsu-Vachel, Royce Glas, and Deke who are tasked with locating the kidnapped daughter of a prominent businessman.

Rather than holding a Treehouse Live presentation close to E3 or another Direct, Nintendo likes to keep up on our toes and will be holding one such showcase today.
In an announcement that went out on Tuesday, today's presentation will be a standalone feature focussing on the unlikely pairing of Splatoon 3 and Harvestella. This should provide us with all of the Splatsville content that we need until the game's release on September 9th, but we are also excited to hear a bit more about the very lovely looking agricultural RPG.

That means that you can zoom over Koelnmesse, which is where Gamescom’s happening right bloomin’ now. Nice bit of Inception-style weirdness there, Microsoft Flight Simulator devs. I’ll give it a go later and see if I can spot our roving reporter Ed.

Pac-Man World isn't what I'd call a polarizing game.

Pac-Man World Re-Pac is likely going to have the same impact.
But for those of you who do dive in, there's a fun little mascot platformer here.

As you've probably noticed, GoldenEye 007 is now 25 years old and can legally hire a car in a foreign country. The influence of Rare's seminal shooter on the FPS genre and console video gaming in general is enormous, and gamers have now been poring over it and picking apart its secrets for the last two-and-a-half decades. It stands as a monolith in the gaming landscape, an artifact that's spawned endless investigation, discussion, and debate. What is there left to say?
Well, while we're all on tenterhooks waiting for an official announcement of the long-rumoured remaster — an announcement that seems to have been rumoured at every major video gaming event for the past year — we thought we'd look back on the game's 25th anniversary with 25 facts you may or may not know, or at the very least might have forgotten! As we mentioned above, this is one of the most discussed video games ever made, with a bunker-full of retrospective articles, historical deep-dives, developer postmortems, and even documentary movies to its name, so forgive us if you're a veteran who does know some of the nuggets we've picked out below.

Matthew isn't here this week, which means we are very well behaved. I talk about BioWare games a normal amount, and Nate tries (and, in fairness, succeeds) to find a way to make moral choices a thing that you can apply to the sort of games he likes. Not Age Of Empires II this time, though. 
Because there's no Matthew, I change the Cavern Of Lies into a cavern of moral judgement for Nate, and make him run a gauntlet of some of the most important choices in Dragon Age Inquisition with no context. He turns out to be both authoritarian and kind of wholesome as an Inquisitor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Revealed at Gamescom Opening Night Live, Atlas Fallen is an upcoming action RPG being developed by Deck 13 Interactive, the folks behind The Surge games. It's eschewing the robotic antics of its predecessor in favour of a Middle Eastern-inspired semi-open world filled with towering blocks of sand, rolling dunes, and mahoosive beasties.
I managed to see a brief 30-minute presentation of the game here at Gamescom, which gave off the impression that it's shaping up to satisfy those craving a AA title to plonk on their shelf. I've got to say that in action that combat really looks good, too.

Last month, Nintendo and the US chain Cold Stone Creamery teamed up to make Kirby ice cream. This month, it's Baskin Robbins' turn to make Splatoon-themed ice cream ahead of the imminent release of Splatoon 3. And while the Kirby ice creams sounded delicious... these ones let you decorate the sweets with blue and yellow ink!
There are a number of different desserts that are on offer, from a small ice-cream cake with Splatoon characters on it to a limited-edition Splatoon flavour of ice cream: Ikasu Soda & Grape ("ika" is the Japanese for "squid", so it's a fun play on words). Even if you don't want the squid flavour, you can get Splatoon-themed cups (one of three designs) or a variety pack, which comes with eight flavours and a Splatoon box.

The official Steam Deck Twitter account shared the coy stats in a tweet but, as ever, neglected to go into detail about just how many are being snapped up. Good job they’re pumping out more Decks than even Valve expected, at least.

It's a Prime Gaming Origins kind of month — Assassin's Creed Origins, that is. Oh, and Shadows of Mordor. There's a few big ones coming for the Prime Gaming September lineup, and you can find the full list below.
Wait a minute: The Dig?! I remember playing this point-and-click classic when it came out in 1995 to the utter confusion of many of my friends, and thankfully it was able to live on in 2009 via Steam. And in 2022 as a free game that people are going to randomly click on! It's wild how some things just come back like that, and some are left to linger in a bygone era. Thankfully, LucasArts is still around in some capacity, even under new ownership.
All of this will go live on September 1. Remember to log in and just click everything to redeem it, even if you have no intention of playing anything below anytime soon.

Supermassive Games lifted the lid on The Devil in Me, the season one finale of The Dark Pictures Anthology. It's another standalone cinematic horror adventure game with tough choices to make, and with an intriguing trap-laying serial killer setup, it's the most promising one yet. In a preview presentation, game director Tom Heaton broke it all down.
The game was largely inspired by H.H. Holmes and the World's Fair Hotel, better known as the Murder Castle. It's also drawing from cinema, including the Saw movies, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, Psycho, Halloween, and Friday the 13th — look out for "hat tips."

Gamescom Opening Night Live 2022 officially revealed Sonic Frontiers' release date as November 8th (though many of us had seen this coming thanks to a leak earlier in the day). Since this announcement, Sega has been moving fast to release new info about the game, including what we can expect to see in the different pre-order packages.
Spotted by Eurogamer, the pre-order bonuses differ depending on region, and those who are buying the game in Japan have the opportunity to get Sonic decked out in some clothing inspired by hugely popular hololive V-Tuber Inugami Korone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["The thing we're doing with The Dark Pictures is exploring different sub genres of horror," explains game director Tom Heaton. The Dark Pictures Anthology is, well, a horror anthology, each a compact standalone scary game where you explore and deal with QTEs and hazardous choices, in the vein of Supermassive's smash hit Until Dawn. The idea, says Heaton, is that each one takes one or two horror sub-genres and mines them, maybe subverting the tropes here and there. Up next is The Devil In Me, inspired by the infamous Chicago serial killer H. H. Holmes. 
"What I think we decided with The Dark Pictures games early on was that the next game in the series would be very different from the last game, because we want to keep it fresh, we want to give the audience new," Heaton explains. So, after a zombie ghost ship in Man Of Medan, the psychological witch hauntings in Little Hope, and military squad vs. vampire aliens in House Of Ashes, Heaton pitches The Devil In Me as kind of Saw meets The Shining. It's a serial killer slasher in a weirdo hotel, and it has a true crime element. And I have to say, it's probably the most excited I've been for a Dark Pictures entry.

For fans of indie smash-success Unpacking, which was a game about taking things out of boxes and putting them on shelves (it's better than it sounds, promise), A Little To The Left should be on your radar, too. Except where Unpacking's villain was "not knowing whether items belong in the kitchen or bathroom", A Little to the Left's villain is... your own cat.
The game is all about tidying and organising things into neat, satisfying, colour-coded knolled piles, as well as peeling stickers off fruit, making sure the clock is set to the right time, and putting tiny screws back in the right place — but there's a threat looming overhead: The casual swipe of a cat paw that knocks everything out of place again. The cat is based on the developers' real kitty, Rookie, too!

Nintendo has launched an official Splatoon 3 tutorial on their YouTube channel — which they are dubbing a "Beginner's Guide."
Clocking in at nearly five minutes, it walks you through basically everything you need to know to play the game. Even the setup! Nintendo starts simple, giving folks background info for the "kid and squid" morphing mechanic, then inking/weaponry, then game modes. It's actually super useful, as the gameplay is simplistic enough to literally watch this video, then dive in. This is going to be especially useful for the upcoming Splatfest demo, as some folks may have not played the series up through this point.
Coincidentally, you'll also get a ton of new footage for Splatoon 3. None of it is revelatory per se, but people who are really looking at every single detail until release might want to check it out, as there's a lot of environmental showcasing going on. It also serves as a nice recap of most of the stuff the team has shown so far in various Nintendo Directs and showcases.
With Splatoon 3, I'm at the point that I'm typically at in the "post-Direct" lifecycle of first-party Nintendo games. I've seen enough, I just want to play it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["You're not being the ball, Danny".
Halloween might still be a couple months away, but Chuhai Labs has seen fit to kick off the spooky season early with its latest release, Cursed to Golf. Starring a person who basically escapes from hell using nothing but their god-tier golf skills, it’s certainly a memorable adventure and we’re happy to say that it’s actually a pretty solid golf game. There are some relatively minor flaws here and there, but the quality of its excellent gameplay means that Cursed to Golf generally shows itself to be up to par.
Cursed to Golf places you in the role of a professional golfer who, at the start of the narrative, is a very alive person about to claim victory in a world-renowned golf tournament. As you close in on the end of the round, a thunderstorm rolls in, but your character will not be deterred from seizing their destiny. Unfortunately, this turns out to be a poor decision, as you’re soon struck by lightning and subsequently killed. Your golfer’s soul is sent to a sort of golfing purgatory, where you’re then greeted by the ghost of a golfer Scotsman who says you need to clear 18 holes on a spooky, ever-shifting course to ascend back to the world. The problem is that nobody has actually done it before, but that isn’t going to stop you from trying as many times as it takes to get back to your body and finish your tournament.

Attackers "executed arbitrary code on a remote device, meaning they could take control of a player's PC." But thankfully, seven months later, the servers are back online. 
The official Dark Souls Twitter account initially confirmed servers would remain offline beyond the release of Elden Ring. However, the extensive deactivation period that ensued couldn't have been anticipated. The RCE hack affected all three Dark Souls games. And now that the third entry's multiplayer modes are available again, hopefully, the other games in the franchise will see the light of day, too.

Following news from Sony Interactive Entertainment earlier today that it has raised the price of the PlayStation 5 in multiple non-U.S. markets, Microsoft has revealed that it will not follow suit. 
A Microsoft spokesperson told Windows Central that the company has no plans to raise the price of the Xbox Series X/S consoles. 
"We are constantly evaluating our business to offer our fans great gaming options," the spokesperson told the publication. "Our Xbox Series S suggested retail price remains at $299 (£250, €300) [and] the Xbox Series X [remains] $499 (£450, €500).”

Sonic Frontiers' latest story trailer gave us a release date for Sonic's open-zone adventure, and it looked pretty darn good, too! The game is currently at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany, and fans can go hands-on with the game at the convention.
Our sister site Push Square has shared the footage from Twitter, and demos on the show floor allowed players to explore what looks like the first zone of the game, as well as experience Cyber Space, short levels that are made up of Sonic's memories. And, as you'd expect, many of these are based on older levels.

Now, after the internet noticed the studio is currently hiring for three positions to form a “blockchain team”, developer Build A Rocket Boy have responded to the claims on Reddit.

We think Cult of the Lamb is pretty darn good, but if there's one issue we highlighted with the cult-forming roguelike, it's the game's various performance bugs. Fortunately, we haven't had to wait long for a patch that will fix these issues, and the developer has shared what to expect in version 1.0.3.
Sharing details of the update on the game's official Discord channel (Thanks, Nintendo Everything!), Massive Monster has addressed a softlock problem, Portuguese-language localisation issues, drop rates, and optimisation. There's also one issue where you couldn't bring more than six followers into the temple, which meant some quests were difficult to complete.

Like the original game, Teslagrad 2 is all about using electromagnetic magic powers to traverse a steampunk world inhabited by strange otherworldly creatures, but this time there's a twist — you'll be travelling back in time to defeat ancient monsters and explore long-forgotten ruins in old world Scandinavia.

Gamescom's Future Games Show might have just revealed the most unexpected genre mashup of the year. God of Rock is a fighting game in which your success in combat is dependent on your ability to keep rhythm with a Guitar Hero-esque music tab at the bottom of the screen.
We have all felt the pressure of losing your groove on Guitar Hero — the crowd start booing and the band struggles to keep up — but God of Rock will up the stakes just a little as you watch your character get punched, kicked, and slapped each time you slip up. We know that mosh pits can get violent, but jeez.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA['Global economic environment' cited as cause
In something of an unprecedented move, Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced that it is officially raising the retail price of its PlayStation 5 (PS5) hardware. The consumer shelf cost for the powerful console will increase in select territories, including Europe, Japan, and Canada.
The news was announced in a new blog post by SIE's Jim Ryan, wherein the President & CEO cited the "Global economic environment" as the key reason behind the price rise.
"The global economic environment is a challenge that many of you around the world are no doubt experiencing," wrote Ryan. "We’re seeing high global inflation rates, as well as adverse currency trends, impacting consumers and creating pressure on many industries. Based on these challenging economic conditions, SIE has made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price of PlayStation 5 in select markets across Europe, Middle East, and Africa, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, as well as Canada. There will be no price increase in the United States."
The new PS5 console prices in these districts are as follows:
Europe: (around €50 rise)
UK: (around £30 GBP rise)
Japan: (around ¥5,000 rise)
China: (around 400RMB rise)
Australia: (around $50 AUD rise)
Mexico: (around 1,000 pesos rise)
Canada: (around $20 CAD rise)
Industry analysts have already shared their thoughts on SIE's decision, noting that, due to the general scarcity of hardware, slowed production cycle and the global cost of living crisis, it is unlikely that the price rise will have much of a negative effect on either the overall sales of PS5 hardware, or Sony's target sales for the remainder of the fiscal year. With its own new hardware, Xbox Series X/S, already retailing at a cheaper price than the PS5 platform, Microsoft's response to this move will be an interesting one.

A third entry in the Voice of Cards series has been spotted in the backend of the PS Store. Shared on Twitter by @PlayStationSize and seemingly titled Voice of Cards: The Beasts of Burden, this would make it the second game in the series in 2022 (if it releases this year), and the third game in a franchise that's not even a year old yet!
Of course, only the PlayStation file has been spotted, but since both previous entries came to Switch, there's no way these cards won't be laid out on our table. The series was created by Yoko Taro — of NieR and Draknegard fame — and debuted last year following The Isle Dragon Roars' announcement during a Nintendo Direct.

The bonus emotions? Surprise and... not being so surprised. Surprise that we'd accomplished such a feat, but not so much surprise in the game itself. It was, as expected, a good co-op FPS time! But a very familiar one.

If it actually reaches such speeds in the wild, once it launches in October, that would make it the fastest consumer PCIe 4.0 drive yet. And write speeds aren’t far behind either, at up to 6900MB/s.

Last week, we reported on fan speculation that Shiver, a member of the band Deep Cut in Splatoon 3 and one of a trio of new announcers in the game, could potentially be Nintendo's first major non-binary character. Compelling evidence from the recent Splatoon 3 Direct suggested that gender-specific language was deliberately avoided across multiple localised versions of trailers and clips for the upcoming game.
Many fans were pleased to see this small but significant step forward for inclusivity and representation in first-party Nintendo games, and it seemed unlikely to be a coincidence. However, Nintendo has now confirmed that Shiver identifies as female and will use she/her pronouns in the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[See the third-person gameplay in action.
We feel like we've been waiting forever for the original Fear Effect to make its return, ever since the remaster Fear Effect Reinvented was announced for the Nintendo Switch in 2017.
As you might recall, this version of the action-adventure title will capture the "same spirit and atmosphere" as the original PlayStation game from the year 2000 but will include "drastically improved" visuals, tweaked controls, and various other exciting extras.

Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 DLC is confirmed and Inti Creates is announcing it in a pretty big way today.
Here are the two main things coming on August 25. From there, Inti Creates promises "five big content updates," which will come "once a month over the next four months." Additional content teases include new boss fights, more modes, and "more story content," including "Epilogue ATEMS." The planned end date at this time for free update support is December 2022.

Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 DLC #1 - A playable Kirin XX character
Kirin XX is a souped-up version of the main character from Azure Striker Gunvolt 3.

Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 is a fabulous sequel that scratches that Mega Man Zero itch we've been craving, and after the man series' long absence, it's great to revisit Gunvolt and friends. And Inti Creates has revealed that we'll have plenty more reason to keep coming back to the game, as it will be bringing five big content updates to the game.
Once a month for the next five months, brand new content will be coming to the third mainline Gunvolt game for free. And better still, you won't have to wait very long for the first one, as it'll be available to download on 25th August! That could be today or tomorrow, wherever or whenever you're reading this!

The latest update for Final Fantasy XIV went live yesterday, bringing a host of new content. Part of the update is the Island Sanctuary, a cozy and deceptively deep island living simulator.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keep these highly specific animal games coming
Whether you think raccoons are adorable little scamps or an utter nuisance, Snaccoon is worth a look — it's a game about securing snacks as a raccoon. Relatable, right?
Game developer Christian Sparks shared a trailer for Snaccoon during today's Future Games Show live stream. With so many familiar-looking games, this stood out to me. The concept immediately clicked with me, and it's not one I'll forget about anytime soon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyLhxdL6918
Strolling through town, hopping on trash cans, sneaking through vents, and scurrying off with someone's phone while it captures the theft — it's light and cute so far. I chuckled.
Based on behind-the-scenes developer posts, expect a "guided platforming" system to keep traversal flowing while still giving you, the player, autonomy. Admittedly, the game's website is sparse right now (and there isn't a Steam page to point you to yet), but Sparks has some in-depth blogs to check out, including clips not shown in the trailer.
Expectations for video games built around animal antics are high in a post-Stray world.
That said, there's a lower-stakes sense of playfulness here that I really like. A memorable concept can take a game pretty far, particularly if it's released at the right time and at a reasonable price. No word on when Snaccoon will be out other than it's "coming soon."

Hundreds, if not thousands of great games have come out in the past fifteen years, but one that will always fall at the top of that list is BioShock, the classic FPS game set in the underwater city of Rapture. While to many it feels like the game didn't come out all that long ago, BioShock was actually released August 21, 2007 — exactly fifteen years ago from this past Sunday, and we're celebrating the anniversary.
The whole BioShock series got a remaster and rerelease as a collection back in 2016, and when I replayed the games on my PS4, I was shocked at how well they've aged. Sure, the graphics got a welcome update, but the game's design, story, and characters have aged like fine wine. Its iconography, from the Big Daddies to the Sp…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you enjoy over-the-top, stylish action games with plenty of silliness, Wanted: Dead should be on your radar. First announced last fall, the game comes from Soliel Ltd, developer of the upcoming Valkyrie Elysium, and consists of Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive alumni. With those credentials, it's little surprise that Wanted: Dead looks absolutely bonkers. 
The story centers on Hong Kong cop Lt. Hannah Stone, a member of the Zombie Unit. She and her squad must get to the bottom of a corporate conspiracy, but the game doesn’t appear to be nearly as serious as its premise lets on. Gameplay blends stylish swordplay with explosive gunplay as players slice and/or shoot through gang members, mercenaries, and other foes in an adventure that looks ridiculous. The release date trailer also shows off anime cutscenes, rhythm music gameplay, cute cats, and whatever else it manages to cram in. 


Wanted: Dead is launching on February 14 and is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie lays the groundwork for those who want to jump right in
A bunch of Destiny 2 news dropped yesterday, as part of the Destiny 2 showcase that revealed its new season and the coming Lightfall expansion. If you were interested by what you saw, Bungie has a new Destiny 2 lore video to help fill you in on the basics.
This video, dubbed "Destiny 2: The Light and Darkness Saga - Destiny Calls," is short and sweet. It essentially covers all the bases, from the origins of the Traveler to different enemy factions that Guardians fight against.
At just about five minutes and change, this video lays out the foundation of Destiny 2 lore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om28A9hTST0
While it doesn't go into too many specifics with regards to campaign stories, it's a nice summation of Destiny 2 lore for folks looking to hop in and play right away. There's the Light, the Darkness, a bunch of angry enemy armies, and a whole lot of loot to pick up.
The battle for the Light
It's extra helpful, seeing as Destiny 2 is making all of its campaigns free to play this week, as part of the showcase festivities. If you were waiting to see what all the fuss is about, this is a good start to catching up.
Bungie revealed Destiny 2: Lightfall yesterday, confirming that the Guardians are indeed heading to Neptune. The neon city of Neomuna looks very cyberpunk, and while there, Guardians will pick up the ability to swing around using Strand powers. I think that makes it a strand game?
Alongside some quality-of-life features that should make life easier, Bungie also confirmed a big plus for Destiny 2 newcomers. The studio says it won't sunset future Destiny 2 expansions like it did with the Forsaken campaign. This should hopefully make it even easier to hop on and catch up with the most recent Destiny 2 lore yourself.
Destiny 2: Lightfall goes live on February 28, 2023.

As a self-proclaimed former horse girl, getting to ride horses in games is something that I always look forward to. Titles like Breath of the Wild, Red Dead Redemption, and The Witcher definitely scratch that itch, but sometimes, all I want to do is ride around without other mechanics getting in the way. While my childhood favorite, Barbie Horse Adventures: Wild Horse Rescue, is outdated at this point, there's a new game releasing soon that brings equestrian to the forefront of its mechanics: Aesir Interactive's Horse Tales – Emerald Valley Ranch.
The gameplay trailer highlights a bunch of different features that players might expect from a horse-centric game, other than riding around the open world of course, like training and breeding horses…]]></summary>

Happily though, there are also now a range of much more affordable keyboards that still include the unusual colour schemes, high-quality components and brilliant typing experiences that make mechanical keyboards so fascinating to me. One of the best makers in this space is Akko, and today a range of their best full-size and compact keyboards are on sale at Amazon UK.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cozy up with this relaxing village-building game on Switch starting September 29
I don't associate my PC or office space in general with "cozy vibes" — not now, and probably not ever. So it's wonderful to hear that Dorfromantik, a minimalistic village-building game that's out now on Steam, is coming to Nintendo Switch on September 29. In terms of low-stakes, just-let-me-unwind gaming, I can't think of a better platform.
This news got buried in yesterday's Gamescom deluge, but it's worth highlighting today.
https://twitter.com/_Toukana/status/1562216676057354240
Dorfromantik is a game about building out a landscape by placing down randomly-drawn tiles — trees, houses, railroads, rivers — which connect in aesthetically pleasing ways. You'll start small, piece by piece, but end up with a pleasant-looking land that streches far.
While it's possible to play aimlessly, if you're looking for more concrete goals, there are scores to chase, and achievements to work toward. There is a way to play strategically rather than just going with the flow. Zoey's got a good breakdown in her PC review.
Speaking of which, PC players will be getting controller support in an update, presumably around the same time as the Nintendo Switch release of Dorfromantik.
Surprisingly, Dorfromantik is the first game from Toukana Interactive. With the way things seem to be going, I'm hoping the developers can take this success and run with it. In the shorter term, maybe that means more ports, potentially PlayStation, Xbox, iOS, and Android. Further out, though, I'd love to see where these game design concepts can go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Less Rumblin', More Squawkin'
Publisher 3goo has released a bewildering gameplay trailer for its upcoming re-release of obscure fighter The Rumble Fish 2. Currently in development for PC & consoles at its original studio Dimps, the 2D anime fighter is expected to arrive, (alongside its predecessor), at the tail-end of 2022.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-K_j6U_pCk
As you can see from the trailer, originally hosted by Japanese outlet 4gamer, The Rumble Fish 2 is hardly the most subtle of fighters, with bold, lurid visuals, over-the-top characters and movesets, and boasting a literal cacophony of vulgar, almost indistinct noise to soundtrack its hard-hitting action. Originally released to Japanese arcades in 2005, The Rumble Fish 2 would barely see light outside of its native Japan, which makes 3goo's incoming rereleases something of a special occasion for fighting game fans.
The two titles are set in a dystopian take on our own world, rendered asunder by corporate capitalism run amok. The series is typified by its goofy sense of humor, anarchic tone, and distinct "S.M.A." (Smooth Model Animation) visual style. In a post-Garou world, The Rumble Fish was the last hurrah for good-looking, technically proficient 2D fighting games, before developers would decide that 3D was the way forward for all of the major brawling-based IPs.
The Rumble Fish and The Rumble Fish 2 are currently in development for PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. They are both expected to launch on all of the aforementioned platforms this winter.

I love Minecraft and have been playing it on and off since it landed on Xbox Live Arcade in 2012, but I couldn’t care less about the series’ spin-off games like Dungeons or the Telltale-developed Story Mode. While those games were fine, they defeated the point of why I love Minecraft – building, and crafting. 
Developer Mojang Studios is shaking things up with its next spin-off, and after my behind-closed-doors demo at Gamescom, I’m interested.

Today marks the day of the debut of Genshin Impact 3.0, which ushers in the Sumeru region, as well as new storylines and characters. Its lush setting should serve as a great break from the purple hues and sometimes scary aesthetic of 2.0's Inazuma region.
Here's a look at some of the major tenets of the initial 3.0 launch, which will be iterated upon as more updates are released.

How to access Sumeru
If you're up to date on your Archon Quests (and many of you are, prepping for 3.0) and are done with the Chasm, just head to the waypoint in the southwest corner of the map, right near the Chasm. Head west and climb up the Chasm walls: you'll see Sumeru in all its glory at the apex (in the header image).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft’s chief executive officer of gaming and Xbox head Phil Spencer believes games exclusive to a single console will become something we see less of over time. 
This news comes from a new interview with Spencer from Bloomberg discussing Microsoft’s in-the-process acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the landscape of console exclusivity, and more. He believes that this is a good thing for the gaming industry in the long run. 
“[It] is something we’re just going to see less and less of,” when discussing the idea of specific games being exclusive to a single device. “Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox, and I buy a PlayStation, and our kids want to play together, and they can’t because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television.
“We really love being able to bring more players in reducing friction, making people feel safe, secure when they’re playing, allowing them to play with their friends, regardless of what device – I think in the long run that is good for this industry. And maybe in the short run, there’s some people in some companies that don’t love it. But I think as we get over the hump and see where this industry can continue to grow, it proves out to be true.”
Bloomberg also asked Spencer about the status of Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition, how the company will handle unions and ongoing unionization efforts happening within Activision Blizzard, and more, so be sure to check out the publication’s full story here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Suikoden successor will have more to share soon
While we already got a little bit of Eiyuden Chronicle earlier this year with the prequel game Rising, there are still the Hundred Heroes on the horizon. Rabbit & Bear Studios put out a new Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes trailer today, as part of Gamescom, and the RPG still looks fantastic.
Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes is the Kickstarter-backed successor to the Suikoden series, from members of the original Suikoden team. While we've seen some small slices of gameplay, we get a bit more in today's trailer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdnPIkvUigw
It's impressive how this does manage to look HD-2D, but still has a distinct style of it. The world of Hundred Heroes looks gorgeous, and I'm particularly keen on the battle animations. The camera pans and zooms are great, and I love seeing the big party lineup all on one screen.
An untold future
While we still haven't glimpsed any footage that contains straight-up fights with a UI and everything, hopefully we'll get some more soon. At the end of today's trailer, Rabbit & Bear confirms that more news is scheduled for Tokyo Game Show. TGS 2022 runs from September 15 through 18, just a few weeks from now.

The prequel action RPG Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising already left a good impression on those who played it. You can even spot a party member from Rising, a certain sword-wielding kangaroo, in the battle at one point. And a shark fighter too? Looks like we'll get some wild characters to recruit into our massive party.
Everything we've seen so far of Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes looks quite promising. Here's hoping the studio can deliver. Last time we heard about an estimated launch, the RPG was pushed into 2023. We'll see if we get a firm launch, or maybe even some more game info, at Tokyo Game Show in September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pentiment, Obsidian Entertainment's medieval narrative adventure title, is coming on November 15. We first learned of the project during the Xbox Games Showcase in June. 
The game's art direction emulates medieval manuscript illustrations and woodcut prints while the story unfolds in 16th-century Bavaria. You play as an illustrator who becomes wrapped up in a series of murders over 25 years. You'll engage in choice-driven conversations where your decisions steer the plot and create lasting consequences in a tale that expands into a larger conspiracy. Check out the original reveal trailer below to see it in action. 


Pentiment is made by a small team within Obsidian led by director Josh Sawyer. You can pick it up on Xbox consoles and PC (day one on Game Pass). It will be the second game that Obsidian ships this year, following the 1.0 release of Grounded in September.]]></summary>

Modern homages to classic video games often go one of two ways: They either stick close to the gameplay conventions to which they are paying tribute, or they expand the original games’ styles in meaningful and innovative ways. Blossom Tales II: The Minotaur Prince, like its 2017 predecessor, is more the former than the latter, adhering closely to the classic Legend of Zelda blueprint, most notably that of A Link to the Past. Despite this lack of innovation, Blossom Tales II still manages to capture many of the acclaimed elements of what many consider to be one of the greatest video …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Park Beyond, an upcoming theme park management sim in the vein of a juiced up Rollercoaster Tycoon, is trying to balance two slightly opposed teams in its target audience. There are people who love doing the management bits - the bean-counting, optimising the amount of salt on fries to make people thirsty and buy more drinks, paying close attention to demographics and average spends and that sort of kidney*. Then there are people who want to design a park full of cool-ass rides and different themed zones, a true magical wonderland. Inside this Park Beyond are two wolves, in other words, and each needs a different but equally robust set of tools to wrangle.
After some hands on with an early build of Park Beyond, I have a little more faith that Limbic Entertainment are going to be able to pull it off. The toolset for building a rollercoast is, in particular, impressive. It's never been so easy to make a ride that breaks both the laws of physics and the laws of health and saftey. The coasters in this game are an absolute menace. In a good way.

When the Splatoon 3-focused Nintendo Direct hit two weeks ago, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the information and how much content the Splatoon team was bringing at launch. As someone who very much enjoyed the first two Splatoon games (as well as Splatoon 2's Octo Expansion), that Nintendo Direct was all I needed to bring my excitement levels up a few notches. However, having the opportunity to get my hands on the soon-to-be-released Splatoon 3 only skyrocketed this game up the list of my most anticipated 2022 releases.
During my 75-minute hands-on session, I was able to check out the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morty Smith from the popular cartoon Rick & Morty is now a playable character in the free-to-play stage fighter, MultiVersus. 
This news comes from a new Morty-focused trailer for MultiVersus that showcases the fighter in action. It features a look at how he plays as a Bruiser class brawler, complete with a muscle-enhanced left arm "Armothy" and the "Plumbus" all-purpose alien device.
Check these moves out and more in the trailer below:


"Morty, the teenage grandson of a mega-genius scientist Rick Sanchez, arrives as part of MultiVersus Season 1 and is a Bruiser class character with more than a few tricks up his sleeve," a press release reads. "Morty's moveset, which is on display in a newly released gameplay trailer, features a mix of skills and attacks, from his muscle-enhanced left arm 'Armothy' and 'Plumbus' all-purpose alien device, to his ability to whip himself at opponents and use of various projectiles."
The trailer also reveals the President Morty character variant, which is available as an in-game purchase right now.
For more, check out every character nerf and buff from the big MultiVersus Season 1 update, and then read about how Black Adam and Stripe from Gremlins are coming to the game this season at some point. Check out our thoughts on the game in the Game Informer MultiVersus review after that, and then read about how MultiVersus was July's best-selling game in the U.S. thanks to its Founder's Pack.

Until now, most of their cloud ambitions have been neatly contained in the console space, but today Samsung have unveiled their latest cloud-enabled PC monitors, presumably in the hope that the combination of Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia's GeForce Now, Stadia, Utomik and Amazon Luna services inside their integrated Samsung Gaming Hubs will be enough to convince folks to part with their towers once and for all.

Think of all the dirt and clumps of dust you’d be grossed out by, and don't even get me started about being outside. Giant horrific insects? No thanks. I’m already emotionally scarred from the giant bug puppets in Honey, I Shrunk The Kids, and it’s the reason I won’t ever play Grounded (soz Obsidian).
Thankfully, Tinykin takes a more whimsical approach to this hellish situation. It’s a sci-fi adventure platformer where you and a tiny alien army explore a giant house and, as a bite-size summary, it’s excellent. Splashteam have made a fun, laid-back Pikmin-like bursting with humorous surprises and I played the game with a silly grin on my face the entire time.

Expansions will stick around forever, though seasonal content will still leave at the end of each expansion cycle—and Bungie don't say anything about bringing back all the old stuff.

The Indonesian team have now terminated their contract with PQube and delayed A Space For The Unbound until they can find another publisher.

That essence has made its way into Blossom Tales II, a charming light adventure game in the classic "going on an adventure" sense rather than the "rubbing every item on every other item until you're allowed to play again" genre sense.
You're playing out a story playfully told by your grandfather, who's cast you as the wee hero of a village out to rescue your brother from the sinister Minotaur King. Both of you occasionally interject, sometimes prompting a decision that changes the game a little as your granddad amends things to your liking. It doesn't go to the full meta-narrative lengths of a Juarez Gunslinger with it, but it's a cute touch and keeps the framing relevant.

It's only by four days, though, to October 21st, which is sort of baffling. Maybe Warner Bros. are about to announce a new DC-verse TV show coming out on the Knights' original release date of the 25th? Who knows. But along with this early-release sneak attack is a new trailer, giving us a closer look at the rogues gallery that the extended Bat-family are up against.

The RPG combines the story of Pinocchio with some major Bloodborne energy, as the puppet searches for a way to become a real human boy in a decimated city. This is far from the classic fairytale story though. With a dark-gothic backdrop and mechanical killer robots to contend with, Pinocchio has his work cut out for him.

Of course, they also work for desktop computers too - and are much more portable and space-saving than an average actual desktop monitor. 
You can even get OLED models now - and a coupon code on Amazon US brings one model down from Innocn from $350 to $200 when you tick the 'coupon' box on the product page. That's quite a bargain for a 15.6-in portable screen of this calibre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Samsung Odyssey G5 is a solid 1440p 165Hz monitor, and it has the benefit of being significantly cheaper than other options. It's normally around £299, but now it's been reduced to £209 - and that seemed like as reasonable a reason as any to write up a little blog about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most traditonally epic trailers from the Gamescom-themed Opening Night Live tonight was for Atlas Fallen. It's a new fantasy action RPG, with super powers, set in a semi-open world. In what is becoming something of a theme for me tonight, however, the trailer doesn't really give much away about the game aside from the topline selling points. There is a tiny, teeny smattering of gameplay at the end, though. Big swords, big monsters, big magic, big sand. In another continuing theme from games revealed tonight, Atlas Fallen is out next year.

But it's also a stylish 2D hack-and-slasher, and the perspective shift - and the odd, theatrical world that it reveals - is the most interesting thing about the 30 second announcement trailer. Watch it below.

I've not seen 1988 film Killer Klowns From Outer Space, but from the look of the game adaptation's trailer, I don't think I ever want to. Announced during Opening Night Live at this year's Gamescom, the cult classic horror flick is getting a multiplayer horror game release.
If you're not familiar with the film, the title kinda says it all. A group of aliens disguised as clowns invade earth and start killing people - simple! I'm told the trailer harkens back to some iconic moments from the film, so take a look below:

Park Beyond was revealed almost exactly a year ago, when the devs also talked a lot about the concept of "impossification", but it's been all quiet on the rollercoaster front since then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, the Dead Island 2: Day One Edition leaked on Amazon, showing a Lenny Kravitz-like warrior on the box cover. So, it’s only fitting that Gamescom 2022 ended with two trailers (cinematic and gameplay) for the long-overdue zombie-slaying sequel. 


We follow a chiseled survivor named Jacob as he leaves the safety of his (bloodied) condo and ventures into a Californian hellscape swarming with undead. He kills several adversaries with an empty rifle, jutting it through their rotten bodies and smashing their heads against the pavement with its wooden butt. 
The gameplay trailer shows scenic beaches, forsaken suburbs, cratered city streets, and still-lit carnivals. In what is one of the most graphic clips I’ve ever seen at a game show, we watch as the player-character clobbers zombies with blunt objects, jump-kicks adversaries off roofs (parkour mechanics?), and shoots gasoline tanks to engulf hordes in flames.


Dead Island 2 is a first-person action RPG with six playable characters. And according to a designer who appeared onstage, the gory romp has an irreverent, pulpy tone and gameplay that’s all about “experimenting with your preferred zombie-slaying methods.”
Dead Island 2 punches and kicks its way onto PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 3.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A product description for The Outlast Trials says players can expect "mind-numbing terror," and that's exactly what we see in the game's newest trailer. Plenty of blood is shed as humans are used as lab rats in Murkoff Corporation's Saw-like tests. In some cases, the tests just look like torture and flatout murder.
The game looks overly graphic, yet also brings about comparisons to BioShock's tone and storytelling conventions. It'll be interesting to see how the narrative sews all of these wild experiements together. The Outlast Trials is designed as both a single-player and cooperative experience. The player clearly is free to explore at certain points, and appears to rely on trap-like devices to fight back and escape. In one sequence, we see two players helping each other up to higher ground.
The footage concludes with news of a short closed beta running from October 28 to November 1. No other release date news was shared.]]></summary>

As XO Camina Drummer keeps tabs on her mutinous crew, she'll also be tasked to navigate the ruins of a downed vessel on the outskirts of an asteroid belt.
The trailer showed Drummer space walking, dodging debris, and working her way through the massive vessel. We also see her throw a punch and grapple with someone in zero gravity. To bring this beloved science-fiction universe to life, Telltale enlisted the development talents of Deck Nine (best known for the Life is Strange series). The first pre-alpha footage looks ambitious and dark, delivering a cinematic viewpoint into an investigation riddled with death. The facial animations on the characters also look like an evolution from Telltale's previous work, yet some of the same facial features look similar.
The Expanse is slated to release in summer 2023.]]></summary>

The trailer starts with a comical cinematic sequence – a teenage boy listens to loud music and plays the air guitar in his bedroom while the once-peaceful neighborhood beyond his window gets vaporized. When he notices the explosions and opens the front door, Killer Klowns with blasters reveal themselves from behind a stack of boxed pizza pies. 
Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game is “a crazy new take on multiplayer horror” from the executive director of Friday The 13th: The Game. Brief gameplay clips were shown, with Killer Klowns firing lasers at fleeing civilians in a carnival playspace. A band of teens plan a retaliatory attack from a nearby tower, and chaos ensues.
Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in early 2023.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-08-23T19:25:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something Wicked Games, a new studio made up of developers whose credits include Fallout 4 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, has revealed its first game, Wyrdsong, in a new trailer. 
The trailer was released as part of the Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley, and while it was short, it featured plenty of mystery and fantasy intrigue.
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, there's not too much to glean from it. However, we did note what was said by the narrator during it: "In the cracks of reality, there exists two lives, one before the shadow and one behind the eye." Sounds spooky. 
"Wyrdsong is an occult historical fantasy RPG set in a fictionalized Portugal in the middle ages," a press release reads. "Players will be challenged to question both their reality and the choices they make as Wyrdsong is set to expand, question, and re-define aspects of what makes up the current Role Playing Game genre." 
Shortly after the trailer's release, Jeff Gardiner, an ex-Bethesda Studios dev with credits in Fallout 76, Skyrim, Fallout 4, and more, posted a link on Twitter that leads to the newly-launched Something Wicked Games website. 
"Our goal with Something Wicked Games is to utilize our independent and creative autonomy to create the next evolution of open world RPGs," Gardiner, who is the founder and CEO of Something Wicked Games, writes in a press release. "Our first project, Wyrdsong, has been my dream game for some time now, and I'm thrilled to finally share it today." 
A press release also states the game is being developed in Unreal Engine 5.]]></summary>

Announced during Opening Night Live at Gamescom, The Lords Of The Fallen is an action Soulslike that looks to be in the same vein as the original - lots of knights, swords, and undead - but, interestingly, the reboot has a completely different story set thousands of years after the events of the original.
The cinematic trailer doesn’t showcase any gameplay, but it does spotlight what lies in store for fans. Feast your eyes on the lavish trailer below:

        <updated>2022-08-23T19:11:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Squanch Games has released a new trailer for its upcoming first-person shooter High On Life, and this time, we get to watch our protagonist take down a boss. 
This trailer, which aired during today's Gamescom Opening Night Live presentation, highlights a fight between our protagonist and their loud-mouthed weapons and 9-Torg, an alien boss. The boss fight features some standard point-and-shoot combat, but it also features some platforming too by way of a grapple hook-like knife tongue thing in your arsenal. Because the weapons have personalities and speak, you'll get to hear said knife tongue thing drop more f-bombs than ever heard before in a boss fight, too. 
Check out the High On Life 9-Torg boss fight trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, the boss fight looks like a great time, and it deserves some props for being more than just a who-shoots-who-more type of battle. High On Life hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) on Dec. 13. 
For more, watch the High On Life reveal trailer from earlier this summer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lies of P, a soulslike inspired by – of all things – the story of Pinnochio, got a new trailer today during Opening Night Live. 
The trailer was surprisingly substantive. On top of plenty of flavor text about the dark and gritty world, we saw several gameplay shots – including, but not limited to, destroying giant steampunk monsters in a victorian theater, massive open levels, and even lighting a marionette-inspired spider on fire. A Pinnochio-inspired soulslike might be a goofy sentence to type, but you know what? The game looks really neat. Check it out below: 


Lies of P doesn't yet have a release date. However, it'll be released on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC sometime next year. Better still, it's coming to Xbox's Game Pass on day one.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anakin Skywalker doesn't like sand, but developer Deck13 Interactive is hoping you will love it in Atlas Fallen, a new action/RPG experience that is all about the grainy substance. This Focus Entertainment-published title debuted at Gamecom Opening Night Live, and is slated to release in 2023 for PlayStation 5 Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
The game is set within the sands of a timeless land, and the protagonist can unleash sand-powered abilities and infuse sand into shape-shifting weapons. The sand arsenal is used to hunt legendary monsters in either a single-player or cooperative campaign. In the cinematic trailer, we see one hero use sand to repair a bridge, and another hero glide along the sand like she's on a hoverboard. Together, the heroes create various weapons with the sand, like a whip, to down a handful of alien dogs. We'll have to wait to see how closely the gameplay mimics the cinematics.
Deck13 Interactive is the studio behind Lords of the Fallen and The Surge series of games.]]></summary>

Beyond that, I'm not sure I can say anything. Developers Build A Rocket Boy describe it as "an original multi-world experience" that "will blend gameplay, adventure, creativity, and discovery in a space that blurs the line between reality and the digital world".
So it will probably be either like Roblox or like Second Life, then? Hopefully we'll get a greater sense of which by the time it's out, which will be in 2023. The teaser trailer is a montage of stuff happening quickly in the shape of the logo.

Built to emulate the collectability, customization, and tactical sophistication of the best tabletop miniature games, Moonbreaker aims to nail the magic and appeal of the real-life hobby, but with some of the approachability inherent to video games.

Just, your best guess, or the squid'll getcha with its weird alien ink. Ready? Go!.... Okay, well congratulations to anyone who said "a turn-based strategy game inspired by tabletop miniatures". Unlikely as it may seem you were right, and everyone else was wrong. It's called Moonbreaker and it's hitting early access on September 29. And Brandon Sanderson is at this party, too.
I admit it was a trick question, but look, I'm a genuinely big fan of devs doing a completely different project after a successful game. I also know a whole lotta people who love painting plastic fighters in cool colours, carefuly placing them on a tabletop, and slowly pushing them into other plastic fighters in different colours. I'm absolutely sure that Unknown Worlds will make a very good version of a digital tabletop strategy game. I must admit, though, that whenever a video game like this emerges, I sort of wonder why tabletop-thusiasts would buy it instead of more actual miniatures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We got a super in-depth look at Sonic Frontiers earlier this summer when I traveled to Sonic Team and played the game for more than three hours. Sonic Team was open about many parts of its upcoming open-zone adventure, but one part it has remained tight-lipped on is the Sonic Frontiers release date. Today, we not only got a new trailer for Sonic Frontiers but a release date for the game too.
Revealed today during Gamescom Opening Night Live, we now know that Sonic Frontiers launches on November 8. The trailer shown during the livestream gave us a look at a second island in the Starfall Islands: Ares Island. In stark contrast to the first island we saw – Kronos Island – Ares Island appears to be a desolate, sandy biome.


Sega and Sonic Team also revealed the pre-order bonuses and the two editions players can choose from. The standard edition of Sonic Frontiers includes the base game (physical or digital), with a pre-order bonus of the Adventurer's Treasure Box, which includes skill points, Red Seeds of Power, and Blue Seeds of Defense. The Digital Deluxe edition includes a digital copy of the game, the Explorer's Treasure Box, which includes Amy's Memory Tokens, a Portal Gear, Chaos Emerald Vault Keys, and additional shoes and gloves for Sonic, and the Digital Art Book with a 25-track digital mini soundtrack. If you pre-order the Digital Deluxe edition, you also get the Adventurer's Treasure Box. The standard edition is listed for $60, while the Digital Deluxe edition is listed for $70.
Sonic Frontiers launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 8. For more in-depth Sonic Frontiers coverage, head to our exclusive coverage hub here.]]></summary>

Glen Schofield, creative director of the new space horror adventure and one of the leading designers on the Dead Space franchise, made an appearance at Gamescom 2022. He thanked fans for the positive response and spoke about the gritty new gameplay trailer, “We’re gonna show combat and something new with a crazy ending.” 


Protagonist Jacob Lee pulls a health item with one of his abilities and proceeds to crouch-sneak his way through a group of prowling monsters. He downs one with a stab to the back and fires at another creature, stumbling toward him with tentacles squirming around its exposed belly. To top things off, he brawls with a regenerating creature adorned with cysts and sends it flying into a chainsaw-like structure in the environment. 
In the next scene, Lee slides down a sewage drain while dodging deadly pillars along the dimly-lit channel. And in a shocking ending, reminiscent of the death scenes from Dead Space, the leading man hits a massive propeller obstructing the tunnel and gets ripped in half (I’ll spare you the gory details). Schofield warned the trailer’s ending would be wild, and it did not disappoint.
The Callisto Protocol launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on December 2.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Gearbox Software and publisher 2K revealed that the spiritual successor to Telltale's Tales from the Borderlands is called New Tales from the Borderlands and, it's out this October. 
More specifically, it will be out October 21, 2022, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. This news comes by way of the official reveal trailer for Tales from the Borderlands, which showcases the game's setting, its cast, and more. Perhaps most importantly, it also highlights just how similar this is to Telltale's beloved Borderlands narrative-driven adventure game. Sure, there's a new cast and story happening, but the game seems to be very much like its beloved predecessor. Your choices and how they affect the overarching story…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Avalanche has released a new Hogwarts Legacy trailer detailing unforgivable curses, the dark arts, and the choice to use them or not in the game. 
The trailer was revealed during today's Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley and while it didn't feature much by way of gameplay, it did give us plenty of new glimpses of magic. In particular, it showed us that we might have access to unforgivable curses such as the Cruciatus Curse in the game. Crucio is essentially a curse that allows you to torture whomever or whatever you use it on – it's very much of the Dark Arts side of magic and as the name suggests, hard to forget and even harder to forgive in the world of Harry Potter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dune: Awakening was announced today during Gamescom's Opening Night Live event. While details on the game are scant, the trailer revealed it's an open-world MMO, and a beta sign-up is available now. 
The trailer tells us little to nothing about the game. It shows a character staring down onto a vast desert while narration waxes poetic about overcoming fear. Then, a giant sandworm comes forth from the ground below, and our character jumps down to face the gigantic beast. Check out the trailer below:


While the trailer didn't reveal much, a press release distributed after the fact did. Here's what it had to say:

Dune: Awakening isn't the only game coming out on the heels of last year's mega-blockbuster Dune adaptation. Back in April, Dune: Spice Wars, a real-time strategy game, was released in early access.  
Awakening is expected on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With over three million copies sold, 2014's Lords of the Fallen was destined for a sequel. Publisher CI Games has long desired to bring a follow-up to market, but those plans haven't gone as planned, and the sequel bounced between several development studios before landing at Hexworks. During today's Opening Night Live festivities for Gamescom, we were treated to our first look at Hexworks' The Lords of the Fallen through a violent three-minute cinematic trailer that highlights the differences between the realms of the living and dead.
Set one thousand years after the original, The Lords of the Fallen is designed with cooperative play in mind, allowing two players to experience uninterrupted online play. A press release describes the game as an "expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative." The world is also said to be five times larger and interconnected. The focus is once again on soulslike combat, said to be faster than the precursor game with a touch of "devastating magic."
While we hear the voice of Stranger Things actor Joseph Quinn in the trailer, players will be creating their own identities. It's unknown if Quinn will be featured in the game or if he just narrated the trailer. The Lords of the Fallen doesn't have a release date yet, but will release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
The world of soulslike games has evolved significantly since Lords of the Fallen hit the market. What are you hoping to see from the sequel? Let us know in the comments section below!]]></summary>

Everywhere’s reveal trailer showed a montage of disparate gameplay and art styles, from more cartoony racing to sci-fi to realistic human characters. As its name implies, Everywhere hopes to offer a variety of experiences both user-created and otherwise. Its newly launched website offers this description:
“Everywhere seamlessly blends gameplay, adventure, creativity and discovery in an all-new multi-world gaming experience that redefines how players connect with one another and with the digital world around them.”
“Our intent has always been to push the boundaries of what a videogame can be while still delivering an innovative player-first experience,” said Benzies. “The team we’ve built and the partners we’ve made since our founding are coalescing around the unique vision we’re bringing to life. It’s exciting to be a part of, and we can’t wait to reveal more about Everywhere in coming months.”
Everywhere is slated to arrive in 2023, though no platforms were specified.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel a bit deceived by Saints Row at the moment. Although I spent the latter half of last week playing and performance testing it, the worst I saw in terms of bugs, glitches and unintentional chicanery was one temporarily floating pedestrian and a few de-synced execution animations. Only after I committed this clean(ish) bill of health to writing did the game’s wider playerbase discover that it is, in fact, riddled with issues: some benign and hilarious, others irritating and game-breaking. Well fine then, game.
Some of these bug reports have come from inside the house, namely Liam and Rebecca, whose respective characters have a) involuntarily shot out their own windscreen immediately upon entering every single car and b) fallen through the world when attempting to mount a motorcycle. Then there’s former vid bud Colm (RPS in peace), who has found his feet pinned to a car roof before fading away like Marty McFly if his parents split up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on a recent Instagram post on the official PlayStation account, we can finally pin down a launch period for the highly-anticipated PSVR2: "Coming early 2023." You can see the corresponding tweet below.
Coming early 2023. #PSVR2 pic.twitter.com/R3MwWVPyNt
August 22, 2022
While the announcement is relatively brief, we do know PSVR2 will release with over 20 major first-party and third-party games, including new titles like Horizon: Call of the Mountain and ports of Resident Evil Village, No Man's Sky, and The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners Ch. 2. Additionally, the system boasts new orb-like controllers with haptic feedback and adaptive triggers (like the DualSense), a single cord setup with PlayStation 5 consoles for ease-of-access, a see-through view, and better resolution/tracking – we're talking two different modes of visual fidelity. 
According to our very own Marcus Stewart, "VR mode displays VR content in a 360-degree view in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) and 90Hz/120Hz frame rate. Cinematic Mode lets players view non-VR media and the PS5 interface in 1920×1080 HDR video format with 24/60Hz and 120Hz frame rate."
PSVR2 drops in early 2023, with a specific date to be announced at some point in the future.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To call the current state of the world today ‘tumultuous’ would be a bit of an understatement. For LGBTQ+ people - and trans people in particular - the increasingly extreme rhetoric and legislation being weaponised against these communities can feel all-consuming. Yet it comes at a time when diverse representation in media, including games, is improving. As the number of characters stated to LGBTQ+ grows, what is more effective representation: making it possible to see your own experiences on screen, or make those experiences understandable to someone who isn't LGBTQ+?


People who know of it would perhaps cite the work of developer and translator npckc, who I recently spoke with at the recent Japanese indie gaming event Bitsummit. They were there to showcase their latest game A Pet Shop After Dark, a departure from visual novels like A Year Of Springs trilogy into horror storytelling ("more spooky than outright horror," as they later clarified) that's set to release later this month. Beyond the trilogy and their newest work, they’ve translated the works of other developers and worked on other smaller games and game jam projects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last year or so of Elite Dangerous has been the most dramatic since the game launched in 2014. The most recent update to Frontier Developments' epic space sim, Update 13, saw the conclusion of the story's Azimuth Saga, culminating in a disastrous attempt to stop the incursion of the Thargoids – Elite's hostile race of insectoid aliens. It's an event that has already had a major impact on Elite's universe, and Frontier are excited to discuss the studio's plans for the game and its narrative as it pushes into a new phase for the galaxy, simply known as "Aftermath".
But the drama surrounding Elite Dangerous isn't limited to the game's overarching story. As I gear up to chat with lead game designer Luke Betterton and senior producer Samantha Marsh, the Thargoid in the room is Elite Dangerous: Odyssey. Launched in May last year, Elite's second expansion was, to put it lightly, not well received by Elite's community. Complaints ranged from extensive bugs and performance issues to more fundamental criticisms about the implementation of the expansion's on-foot exploration and FPS combat. Over a year on from release, the expansion still carries a "Mostly Negative" rating on Steam, standing in stark contrast to reviews for vanilla Elite Dangerous (now bundled with its Horizons expansion), which remain firmly positive.

You can spend an endless number of (very satisfied) hours tweaking your road network to try to fix traffic jams. The next Cities: Skylines expansion might offer an alternative, however. The Plazas & Promenades DLC, announced today, will allow you to create pedestrian streets and zones where cars dare not tread. Find the first trailer below.

In Madden NFL 23, developer EA Tiburon focused on the fundamentals: authentic 11v11 football and cleaning up many of the bugs that plagued previous Madden iterations. The result is a small step forward for the franchise and a strong foundation to build on.
The most significant changes in Madden NFL 23 are under the surface. The team at EA calls it FieldSense, a shift to more physics-based interactions on the field. In practice, it’s a mostly positive change. Running the ball between bodies is chaotic and violent, true to the real-world g…]]></summary>

Ubisoft making a game based on Marvel's sword-wielding vampire Blade was one of them, and because the internet is the internet, everyone went wild. Today, though, Ubisoft have already killed the rumour dead in a single tweet.

While Deep Silver Volition’s “what if millennials, but crime” reboot is colourful and often quite pretty, you can tell it’s not nearly as interested in cutting edge visuals or contemporary PC tech trappings as the Spidey remaster is. Ray tracing? Yes but only for ambient occlusion. Upscaling? Never heard of it, officer.
The upside - besides Santo Ileso being a generally nice place to visit, as Alice Bee found in her Saints Row review - is that it's playable on low-end and luxury hardware alike. And, to its credit, there's a healthy list of customisable graphics options too. I’ve therefore embraced the past, and spent hours in testing to find out how you can tweak Saints Row’s settings for the best possible performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a long-standing theory among the Warhammer community that the chaos wastes at the globe’s south pole house a peculiar breed of beastmen in the form of evil, monstrous penguins. The theory is based on a world with similar geography to our own, and the tendency of the ruinous powers to morph local fauna into mockeries of their previous forms. No ping-gors show themselves as I trawl the southern wastes as stealthy chameleon-skink Oxyotl, but I find myself thinking about them all the same. Noot for the noot god, the blasted crags seem to whisper. Fish for the fish throne.
Evil penguins or not, all things seem possible with Immortal Empires, the combined landmass of the Total War: Warhammer trilogy into a single sandbox map, vast and varied in its climates, landmarks, and inhabitants. Creative Assembly have already dug deep into dusty stacks of White Dwarf to flesh out footnotes into full factions, and as the list of obvious additions dwindle, things can only get wilder and more creative. For now, we have one very big map stuffed with each faction and lord from three massive strategy games, creaking and occasionally buckling under the weight of its own promise. But it works. There’s a breadth of technical and balance issues still to solve, but the Immortal Empires beta is substantially more stable, playable, and enjoyable than I dared to hope it would be for at least another six months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Saints Row series started off as a sort of rival to Grand Theft Auto, an action-adventure crime sim about working your way up the ranks of a street gang to become the boss. It quickly diverged to become less realistic and more impossibly bombastic, and niched down into giant dildo bats, aliens, reincarnation, and so on. The series has gone to outer space and to hell, so if you're rebooting the series that doesn't leave you many places to go except... backwards.
Saints Row (2022 edition) is back to being a sort of Saints Row again, but also still trying to appeal to people who loved the characters and dick jokes and cartoon carnage of the Saints Row of 2013. If I was being reductive, I'd say it's Saints Row by way of Watch Dogs 2. It isn't bad. It's fun, in fact, but it isn't really doing anything new, either, and I think that's a shame.

The Saints Row reboot features a new cast of characters and a different location to explore, but its heart and soul haven’t changed: Players can once again expect an exciting crime fest, giggle-worthy humor, purple splattered everywhere, and an open-world chock full of things to do and secrets to unearth. The game also has a knack for blowing everything up. In other words, it is great fun in that traditional Saints Row way and even better when experienced with a friend.

        <updated>2022-08-22T12:22:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have released a new trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, and it showcases a new pocket monster and a few new moves targeted at the competitive play community. 
Released as the finale to the Pokémon World Championship held in London (watch our vlog of it here) over the past few days, the trailer is focused on battles, which makes sense given the nature of the event. In it, we get a look at a new Pokémon, Cyclizar, which looks very reminiscent of the two primary legendaries of this generation, Koraidon and Miraidon. Koraidon is the Scarlet legendary, and it seems rooted in the past whereas Miraidon, the Violet legendary, seems very futuristic. Perhaps Cyclizar represents the present. Only time will tell. 
Check out the trailer for yourself below: 


Beyond Cyclizar, the trailer also reveals a few new moves and items: 
Move: Shed Tail – Create a substitute, then swap places with a party Pokémon in waiting. 
Move: Tera Blast – Changes type when the user has Terastalized.
Item: Loaded Dice – Makes multistrike moves more likely to hit more times. 
Item: Mirror Herb  – Copies an opponent's stat increases when consumed. 

For more about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, check out this preview detailing everything we recently learned about the Paldea region, new pocket monsters, and Terastalizing. Watch this trailer that welcomes trainers to the Paldea region of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and then check out all the new Pokémon we spotted in that trailer. 
Are you excited about these new moves or do you think they're too disruptive to the meta of competitive play? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HBO dropped the first glimpse of footage from its upcoming series, The Last of Us, in a surprise promotional trailer yesterday. 
The trailer runs roughly two minutes and it features new looks at shows like Succession, The White Lotus, House of the Dragon, and more. But then, at the 1:40-min mark, the trailer transitions its hype to The Last of Us. It's clear HBO is aware how excited people are for this series as it's given its own extended spotlight in the trailer. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, not only do we get our first glimpse of footage from The Last of Us, but we also get to hear Bella Ramsey's Ellie for the first time as well as Pedro Pascal's Joel (and both are saying some pretty iconic lines from the game). What's more, we get a look at Nick Offerman's Bill and a quick shot of a clicker (well, a dead one that's grown to become part of a wall). 
Here are some screenshots from the trailer if you're after a closer look:

If you're rearing to jump back into the world of The Last of Us, good news: The Last of Us Part 1, a remake of the game this HBO series is based on, hits PlayStation 5 and PC this September. Check out this new trailer that compares The Last of Us Part 1 with the original game after that.

The issue was first spotted in the early hours of this morning, which prevented players from participating in a time-limited event known as Rebirth Of Clemency and rolling for new items and characters. Hotta Studio have assured players it should all be sorted now, though, and that they can expect to receive their next bundle of freebies in the coming hours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. Today we examine the franchise's boldest, most divisive, but arguably strongest entry yet in DmC Devil May Cry. 
Desiring to shake up the series, Capcom turned to British studio Ninja Theory to reboot and reimagine Devil May Cry. Encouraged by the publisher to be as wildly creative as possible, the team behind Heavenly Sword and Enslaved: Odyssey to the West dreamed up a grittier version of Dante who inhabits Limbo City, a world existing in parallel with the demonic realm. This relationship spectacularly manifests in the city itself coming to life, shifting its buildings and roads to hinder and assault the demon slayer. 
Sporting jet black hair and the ability to tap into angelic and demonic powers, this new vision of Dante garnered heaps of vitriol from fans who saw DmC as too drastic of a departure, despite the game launching to rave reviews. In this episode, we'll examine how DmC came to be, the role Capcom played in the game's wildest ideas, Hideaki Itsuno's reaction to the project, the backlash Ninja Theory endured, and give our overall impressions of the narrative and gameplay. 
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), former GI editor John Carson (@John_Carson), and with special guest Bob Buel (@bobbbackwards) of the 99 Questions podcast as we unpack and pay respects to Ninja Theory's memorable stab at Devil May Cry.

I usually see a load of shows but most my favourite performers aren't up this year and I've not heard much about the sort of weird performance art I relish. Plus the crowds are the absolute worst, especially under covid. Residents should receive legal dispensation to throw one (1) oblivious cluster of path-blocking lollygaggers into a wall each week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know what it's like at the beginning of a new year. You're all excited about the many tens and hundreds of new video games coming out over the next 12 months, and you go and make a big list of all the ones you're really looking forward to. We did exactly that back in January of this year, coming up with a list of our 43 most anticipated games of 2022. Lately, though, it seems we can't go a single day without word of yet another game being delayed, whether it's just by a couple of months, or that it's been taken off the calendar entirely.
It got me thinking. How many of those 43 games are even still on the table this year? And, more importantly, what does that mean for RPS as we head into the back-end of 2022? Well, I went back and counted, folks, and it's not great reading. At time of writing, just over half that number - 27 in total - are still slated for a 2022 release right now, although with many still listed as a very vague '2022' or 'Coming Soon' on their Steam pages, I wouldn't be surprised if that number fell further. Needless to say, I'm not sure 2022 will go down as one of the great gaming years... 2023, on the other hand? Wow, that's looking rad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Galactic alliances aren’t built in a day, a month or even a year, to warp a comfortingly familiar phrase from 90s telly. Interplanetary 4X Stellaris has been evolving for more than six years now, having first released on May 9th 2016. Unusually, I remember exactly when I bought the game, because it was in the days just before my partner and I welcomed our first child. Being a ginormous sci-fi nerd, I enthusiastically downloaded it thinking I’d have all the space-time in the universe to invest in building my own interstellar superpower.
I did dip my toes in back then, and have many, many times since, but rather naively didn’t foresee the inevitable. The structure of my life altered dramatically with the arrival of our baby. It didn’t stop there either, and still hasn’t, taking on some unfamiliar but just about recognisable form every few months. I suspect the developers of Stellaris had a similar feeling following the game’s release into the wider universe, like Kubrick’s giant cosmic infant at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey. I know I’ve felt like my furniture’s been rearranged whenever I’ve started a new game of Stellaris with a different civilisation over the intervening years.

Immediately, internet sleuths deduced that the landscape in question looked suspiciously like Death Stranding, leading many to believe it was a teaser for Kojima's hiking postal sim appearing on the subscription service. And yep, they were right on the money, with confirmation arriving today that the BB Boys will be pulling into Game Pass next week, on August 23rd.

Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn't find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obsidian, the first supported game of the mTropolis engine, is ready for public testing!
Created in 1996 by Rocket Science Games and published in early 1997, this ambitious 3D-rendered first-person adventure has you journey through 4 surreal, dream-like worlds in search of your lost colleague.
ScummVM currently supports the English and German versions.  It features a widescreen mode, improved cinematic quality, and a few bug fixes. A Japanese version also exists, but we need more information about it to support it. Please contact us if you have a copy of the Japanese version or some other language version that we haven't discovered yet.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. You can also download a demo here.  If you encounter any issues, please submit them to the issue tracker!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Free your mind for yet another ScummVM release!
Nine newly supported games on 6 engines will plunge you into a variety of different settings. Are you able to escape from an alien-infested planet? What about challenging the Lord of the Dead in the Underworld? And have you ever explored the deepest depth of your psyche to see if you really know yourself?
Find out in one of the following titles:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry's Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides adding new games, we are always focused on improving already supported games. Once again, we managed to squash quite a few bugs from various engines. It is always impressive to see bugs getting fixed in engines that are more than 20 years old!
One of the main new features of ScummVM 2.6.0 is a completely new way to view your games in an amazing icon grid overview via our launcher. Accompanied by some very shiny artwork provided by our graphics artists, you are now able to show off your collection like never before. It almost looks and feels like a virtual shelf!
Check out the full Release Notes for a comprehensive summary of how our developers managed to make ScummVM even more amazing!
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS or the Ubuntu Snap package, the autoupdater will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.0.
As always, thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!
