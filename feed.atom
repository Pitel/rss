        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Where there's Smoke...
A fan-favorite is confirmed to be returning to the Mortal Kombat grinder. Today's new trailer for Mortal Kombat 1 reveals both Rain and Smoke will appear in the new entry.
Smoke is a well-liked member of the Lin Kuei, who finally gets a human re-debut in Liu Kang's new era. Here, Smoke is a fellow member of the Lin Kuei who joins with Scorpion and Sub-Zero to defend Earthrealm.
Also arriving is Rain, a High Mage of Outworld who wields water magic. He's looking a bit more robed and wizard-like, compared to his original palette-swapped appearance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66opZ1Go_ZA
Some Kameo fighters also make an appearance here, too. Scorpion pops up, of course. But the cyborg side of the Lin Kuei appears, too; Sektor and Cyrax are in as Kameos, as well as a human version of Frost.
For our two main roster fighters, both look pretty excellent. Smoke is obviously a highlight. His teleportation and quick jabs look fantastic, and that knife looks devastating in the X-ray attacks. Rain, meanwhile, is like a Waterbender that gets to actually do some damage with their aquatic magic. I really dig the big lightning ball attack that he can call down from a raincloud.
Kombat history
The Kameo fighters bring their own flavor too, and it's nice to see the cyborgs appear. I was curious about whether they would. With a new era and re-envisioned versions of characters, having the robo-fighters reappear or not felt up in the air.
After playing it at SGF 2023, though, it definitely seemed like Kameos are NetherRealm's way of including more fan-favorites from its ever-expanding universe without having to make them fully fledged fighters right away. If it keeps up the nostalgia and klassic references, I could see this being a really enjoyable experience for long-time MK fans.
Mortal Kombat 1 arrives on September 19, 2023.

A new post and a new trailer from developers Arrowhead explaining how Helldivers 2's combat and co-op works is, at least, an opportunity to differentiate itself.

IO Interactive has announced that they’ve got new digs. They’ve opened a studio in Brighton, United Kingdom to assist with their titles, Project 007, Project Fantasy, and HITMAN.
According to the press release, the IO Interactive Brighton team is “already in place” and “located in the heart of Brighton on the beautiful south coast of England.” Most notably, they point out that having a studio actually in the UK is very appropriate when it comes to helping with Project 007.
IO Interactive Brighton joins the current studios located in Copenhagen, Malmö, Barcelona, and Istanbul.
“We are extremely proud and excited to open our next studio in Brighton, where we see enormous potential to expand our incredible team and attract the very best talent from the exciting UK development scene,” said Hakan Abrak, CEO of IO Interactive. ”We’re eager to expand our operations to new shores and believe that IOI Brighton is an extremely appealing destination for developers of all crafts.”
The press release also mentions one of their previous titles, Freedom Fighters, and refers to it as a “franchise.” It’s probably worth noting that there was only one game in the Freedom Fighters series, and that was released back in 2003. But since IO Interactive split with Square-Enix, they’ve hinted at wanting to return to it. We can only hope.

It took a bit longer than I expected, but the Diablo 4 hardcore contest has come to an end. Blizzard revealed on Twitter that 1000 qualifying players have hit level 100 on hardcore mode and will have their names carved into history. Unfortunately, the contest has been plagued by drama before it even began, and then some. Shortly after revealing the list of 1000 winners, the tweet became flooded by players claiming they should be on the list but aren't.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2020, we learned that Keiichiro Toyama, the creator of Silent Hill, had opened Bokeh Game Studio to develop a new horror game. The following year, at The Game Awards 2021, Bokeh revealed Slitterhead. Thanks to a new development diary released today, we can peek at more early-development gameplay in action. 
Most of the video focuses on the developers working on Slitterhead, with a particular look at user tests and gameplay feedback. However, sprinkled throughout the diary are new clips of Slitterhead, ranging from training room-esque encounters, some clips of a neon-lit Chinese city, and even a dog that appears to be playable. 
Check it out for yourself: 


As you can see in the small and often blurred snippets of Slitterhead gameplay, the studio's debut game continues to look grotesque. We see a character attack enemies using Wolverine-like claws, guns, and more. Oh, and below is that playable dog: 
In 2020, the studio said its debut horror game would be released in 2023. But there's no word on whether the team still anticipates releasing it this year. And given how early in development today's gameplay looks, it's looking more like a 2024 or beyond game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetherRealm has revealed two more playable fighters joining the Mortal Kombat 1 roster: Smoke and Rain. 
These two returning characters were revealed as actual fighters on the roster – they still could be part of the Kameo roster, however – in a new gameplay trailer released today focused on the Lin Kuei faction. In it, we witness Scorpion and Sub-Zero's further attempts to establish this faction in Liu Kang's newly rebooted Mortal Kombat universe (hence the Mortal Kombat 1 title), where Smoke and Rain come into play. 
Check these two fighters out in the Lin Kuei gameplay trailer below: 


"With deep ties to Scorpion and Sub-Zero, Smoke has made the clan's mission his own and joins his Lin Kuei brethren in defense of Earthrealm," a press release reads. "The trailer also provides a first look at Rain, the High Mage of Outworld who has honed his craft of water magic into a fierce weapon and now hopes to learn the realm's darkest and most powerful sorcery." 
Elsewhere in the trailer, you might have spotted Sektor, Cyrax, Frost, and Scorpion as Kameo fighters. 

Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store on September 19, 2023.

It is with a heavy heart that we share the sudden passing of our friend and colleague Emile Morel. We send our deepest condolences to his family, friends, and teammates all over the world.
We would like to take a moment to acknowledge the significant impact he made over the years on different games that make up the rich history of our studio.
For us, Emile was a close friend and a boundless source of positive energy. We all valued his passion and the way he told stories.
We will never forget Emile and his immense contribution to the BGE2 universe will forever endure.
True Freedom Lies Beyond.

Beyond good and evil
Morel had worked at Ubisoft for some time, with 14 years of experience at the company working on several notable titles. Morel served as a senior designer on Rayman Legends, as well as working on Test Drive Unlimited 2, 2008's Alone in the Dark, and Rayman Fiesta Run.
After the departure of several leads from Beyond Good & Evil 2, Morel took over as creative director on the project. The sequel was revealed at E3 2017 and has been in development for some time since.
We extend our thoughts and condolences to Morel's loved ones and colleagues.

What's more important — saving the world from impending doom, or rescuing the cat that's stuck at the top of a tree? Depending on who you ask, they might give you an answer you won't expect.
I'm not saying that we should ignore the kitty cats at all, but when you're presented with the dilemma of missing a quest that's simply about rescuing a tiny creature or venturing into the unknown to save the entire world, well, one of them is a more urgent and tempting prospect. Common in RPGs, open-world games, and adventure titles, sidequests offer up a plethora of activities that see you doing everything from collecting seashells to defeating dragons. Think of a random activity, — delivering a takeaway, doing the laundry, getting a haircut — and it's probably been a sidequest before.

Square-Enix released a patch today for their newest, hottest hit, Final Fantasy XVI. Patch 1.03 is largely just a quality-of-life update with some small tweaks, but it notably allows you to reduce the intensity of motion blur or turn it off entirely. Thank the Gods of Visual Clarity for that.
Motion blur is one of those modern visual effects that some people don’t like. For example, I don’t like motion blur. In racing games, maybe, but essentially not any other time. Along with chromatic aberration and depth-of-field blur, it’s one of those things that developers really should allow you to turn off. It can be stylish, but it can also just look smudgy and ugly.
Also, when I need to take screenshots, if I’m playing a game that uses an intense motion blur, m…]]></summary>

Today's episode is the first of three, and together, the series will focus on Omnic robots and how they went from human-made creations to what they are in the world of Overwatch 2. In Episode 1, Omnica Corp Scientists finally reveal the next generation of Omnics and it doesn't take long for them to ponder whether what they have done is good for society or the start of a new crisis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite having pretty enjoyable gameplay, AEW: Fight Forever is woefully light on features and modes. That gets remedied a bit with the announcement that Stadium Stampede is hitting the game in an upcoming free update. 
Stadium Stampede sees up to 30 wrestlers compete in a free-for-all inside a giant empty stadium. Like the real-life version, insanity is the name of the game, as players can assault each other using whatever is around them, whether it's chairs, tee shirt guns, Molotovs, golf carts, or even ride atop a horse. The last competitor standing wins, and the reveal trailer sells how much of a goofy mess it’s going to be (in a good way, hopefully). 


Unfortunately, there's no release date for this update other than that it's coming soon. AEW: Fight Forever has other DLC heading its way in the form of downloadable wrestler packs. FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler) were added last month, and a pack containing Keith Lee and The Bunny becomes available on July 25. The final announced pack arrives on August 22 and adds Hook and Danhausen. Each of these packs also includes two new minigames. Each pack costs $11.99 and is included with the season pass.

A mod that lets you slay hollowed enemies as Tony Hawk is a good guess, but Dark Souls Pro Skater is almost the reverse. A clip went viral over the weekend showing praise-the-sun-guy Solaire shredding around the game’s opening Firelink Shrine. And yes, it looks as cool as it sounds. 


You can watch the clip on Twitter, but if that cursed site’s not working, you can find it on YouTube. There’s also a version that has Shrek shredding but badly, for some reason. Firelink’s ancient, mysterious ruins are transformed into a fun skatepark. Who cares where the skaters came from? Just grind, Gwyndammnit.

You might remember it as the one where we finally heard that Pokémon Sleep was a real thing and would be coming our way this year. Well, after the ensuing four months of relative silence on the matter, The Pokémon Company has today shared more details about the upcoming sleep tracker app.
Revealed in the above video titled "How To Play Pokémon Sleep" (spoiler: you go to sleep), we got a better look at what the lifestyle app is all about, showcasing some of its features and explaining your main objectives by taking part. What's more, Serebii.net has reported that the app is scheduled for release in late July, so there's not long to go now before you can finally... sleep..?

It's been nearly five years since the last mainline Mega Man game (and nearly two decades since the last mainline Mega Man X game - no big deal), so it's understandable at this point that fans of the franchise are eager to hear about where the franchise might be heading next.
Capcom is clearly rather fond of the Blue Bomber itself, having released a number of comprehensive collections over the years on Switch, including this year's Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection. At its latest General Meeting of Shareholders, however, the publisher was asked about its plans for the series going forwards.

I want nothing more than to play it with an auto-attack feature popped on, where all of the blood novas and axe spins are handled for me by a satisfying toggle in a menu. In a game about as engaging as mowing the lawn, I feel like it makes sense to embrace the tedium and let me play as if I'm barely present.

According to a recent Nikkei report, last month's Switch sales in Japan were the highest June figures that the console has ever received.
The article cites Famitsu, stating that the Nintendo Switch sold 380,000 units in Japan during the month, which is said to be a 68% rise from the same time last year. When you consider the fact that this is a console which is entering its seventh year on the market, these numbers are huge.

If you haven't checked out one of 2023's best Xbox games, you're missing out. Hi-Fi Rush came out of nowhere and left a lot of people impressed by its slick, comic-style action, cartoony visuals, and rhythm mechanics. It represented something a little different, made even more special by the fact that it was developed by Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo studio Tango Gameworks.
Now, the latest update has arrived, which brings two new game modes which can be accessed by an arcade cabinet in the Hideout. For starters, you can now take on a challenge that really tests your reflexes. Known as BPM Rush, this mode lets you take on endless enemies with things getting faster and faster until you eventually hit 200 BPM. That should sort the wheat from the chaff.

Look, I'll admit it. I'm a sucker for innovative MMORPG's, especially those that can successfully pull off sandbox-style gameplay. A few months ago Finland studio Mainframe Industries revealed their own medieval sandbox MMORPG Pax Dei.
While MMORPG gamers are very familiar with the medieval era, Pax Dei looks to immerse players in an open-world playground where you choose the role you want to play. Everything in the world is produced by other players including clothes, buildings, food, flowers, weapons, armor, and more.
As you explore the Heartlands you can find the perfect plot of land to call home. Hunker down and build your own house, and before you know it you may have neighbors. Before you know it you could be livi…]]></summary>

This month's game has been chosen by yours truly and I'm very much in the mood to revisit a comfy, cosy puzzle game so I've chosen Unpacking. Cue the confetti!
Unpacking is a puzzle game that's all about pulling your homewares and personal items out of cardboard moving boxes and placing them in a new home. It's best described as a relaxing house moving sim but it's also a sort of block-fitting puzzle game. Finding the perfect spot for each item is largely down to your own personal taste, but there are some loose 'room rules' (no, you cannot put your toaster in the bedroom for some midnight cheese toastie action). If you like organising games - A Little To The Left, Sticky Business, Wilmot's Warehouse and the like - then Unpacking is the game for you.

Rashid hits the game on July 24, so there are still a few weeks to go until he's playable. All owners of the game's Deluxe Edition, Ultimate Edition, and Year 1 Character Pass can play as him. You can also play Rashid for up to one hour for free using a Rental Fighter ticket, which is obtainable in the in-game Fighting Pass. 
Check out the Street Fighter 6 Rashid gameplay trailer below for a look at what to expect: 


Rashid will be playable in all three of Street Fighter 6's modes: World Tour, where he'll be added to the story mode with unique moves for your custom avatar, the Fighting Ground as the 19th playable character; and the Battle Hub, where you can earn Rashid-related gear, emotes, and more. Moves to look out for include Arabian Cyclone, Arabian Skyhigh, Super Rashid Kick, Ysaar, and Altair.
Rashid hits Street Fighter 6 on July 24. He'll be joined by upcoming fighters like A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma this year. 
While waiting for Rashid to join the roster, read Game Informer's Street Fighter 6 review to find out why we love the game so much, and then check out this upcoming Street Fighter 6 collaboration coming to Exoprimal.

If you've seen mention of a game called NightmareScape coming to the Switch and are thinking "Oooh, this looks like a brand new game!", well it's not. A brand new game, that is.
It's actually a port of an existing title on PC and PlayStation called In Nightmare that's been renamed for the Switch. Why? Well, we don't know for sure, but our best guess is because the existing game didn't receive the most positive reception. At the time of writing, the Metacritic score for the PlayStation 5 version is sitting at 53.

Gimmick! is one of the most valuable after-market titles for the Famicom, and even more so for the NES, where it only received a limited release in Scandinavia as Mr. Gimmick. Sunsoft, the publisher, was an unsung hero of the 8 and 16-bit gaming eras, with titles like Batman, Gremlins 2, Panorama Cotton, and Waku Waku 7 to its name.
Gimmick was director Tomomi Sakai's labour of love, appearing late in the NES’s life cycle. A lot of effort was put into its graphical quality and soundtrack as a response to the Super Nintendo’s emerging dominance. You play as Yumetaro, a small green creature who is accidentally gifted to a young girl as a toy. When she finds herself kidnapped to another dimension, Yumetaro decides to rescue her.

With all of the Mario-themed news that came out of June's Nintendo Direct, it is easy to forget about some of the smaller titles that will be making their way to Switch this year. One such game is Silent Hope, a dungeon-crawling action RPG from Marvelous Europe which has today caught our eye again after the publisher revealed the game's opening anime movie.
The footage shows our seven silent protagonists working together at base camp before venturing into the Abyss to fight the creatures that live below the surface. There's also an original theme song accompanying the video from rock band KAMI WA SAIKORO WO FURANAI, just to really hammer home the anime vibes.

Remember the days when consoles took humungous cartridges and it became almost tradition to blow into them occasionally to ensure their ongoing health and happiness? Well, it turns out that Nintendo doesn't want you to do that anymore.
As posted by Nintendo's Twitter support page (and spotted by the folks over at Automaton), it's been advised that you shouldn't blow into the Switch's cartridge slot, as doing so may cause saliva to stick to the terminals and therefore eventually cause rust. Crikey.

8BitDo, the purveyor of fine third-party controllers, has revealed the design for their next controller. This one is more than just a slight nod to the Neo Geo CD’s legendary mash-up between arcade stick and joypad.
By “more than just a slight nod,” I mean it’s pretty much exact. In fact, the company themselves say it is “a perfect recreation of the original SNK NEOGEO controller.” That’s sort of inaccurate since they added shoulder and extra function buttons, but I think they’re referring more to the design of the stick. NEOGEO gamepads had a special digital stick that had a unique “click” to it as you hit all the directional inputs. This was first used with the NEOGEO CD console, but the click wheel would also make its way to the NEOGEO pocket.

I consider myself a pretty big fan of action-RPG games. Therefore, like many others, I have been cautiously optimistic about the longevity Diablo 4 can provide with its content releases. And right now, Season 1 of Diablo 4 has the potential to bring ARPG fans together, or drive them even further apart.
When D4 finally got announced, it didn't take long to start hearing two claims from ARPG fans. It was common to hear either "Diablo 4 will kill Path of Exile!" or "Diablo 4 won't have good enough content to compete with Path of Exile!". With over 100 hours in D4 so far, and almost 1,500 hours in PoE over the years, let me tell you: the two games can certainly co-exist in the ARPG genre. While both games are ARPGs, their end-game systems—and there…]]></summary>

The clip shows fan-favorite Solaire of Astora showing off his high skating stats as he performs all sorts of sick tricks in a skate park-ified version of Firelink Shrine. You don't need me to tell you which 1997 ska-punk track accompanies the footage.
The good news is that Dark Souls Pro Skater isn't some pre-alpha mod someone just began in their garage. It's a combination of Tony Hawk's Underground 2 mods that anyone can get for free. If you want to try this out, acquire a copy of THUG 2 and install the THUGPro mod. Then you can get the Firelink Skate park here, and Solaire's skin here. THUGPro is a whole world, so dive into its content and find other cool stuff that you'll like.
Maybe the positive response to this clip will inspire some clever map designers out there to turn areas such as Anor Londo into skate parks as well. Like, who knows if even the widely despised Lost Izalith area could find new life and even some love as a skating ground?

If you love Souls games but skateboarding isn't your thing, then perhaps consider waiting for Bloodborne Kart to come out to give it a go. Yes, that's also real and won't even require you to own the original Bloodborne.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Murderer still at large
Ninjaconor has casually dropped their DOS-adventure-inspired RPG, Sergeant Squidley: Space Cop, on PCs everywhere.
Ninjaconor says that Sergeant Squidley is inspired by text-based DOS games, and I totally see the aesthetic. It has big crunchy pixels and lots of text boxes. However, looking at all the media for it – it looks like a dating sim.
https://youtu.be/vz8yPQ_yxzo
It might be partially due to the eponymous police-thing browsing a dating site, but that’s not what I’m talking about. We’re told that there are seven days for the former traffic cop to solve the crime, and you do so by choosing how you spend your days. You can upgrade your skills, look after your core stats, and the outcome is based entirely on how you spend your time. Almost like a true dating sim. This is Tokimeki Memorial but with more crime. And probably a lot less dating.
Regardless of its classification, Sergeant Squidley: Space Cop is aiming to be an open-ended experience. Through your choices, Mr. Squidley might reconnect with his estranged son, follow his sax dreams, or maybe become a super-cop of some sort. What’s important here? Sax dreams or catching a murderer. I think the choice is obvious.
Sergeant Squidley: Space Cop is now available for PC via Steam.

It's that time again: The list of games being added to Xbox Game Pass for July has been revealed. There are only a few new titles being added to the game pass this time around, but it includes a couple of day one releases. As is tradition with Xbox Game Pass, this list focuses on the first half of the month. The second wave of games for July will probably be revealed in a couple of weeks.
According to the post, the highlight for July is the return of Grand Theft Auto V. Unfortunately only the console version is being added to the pass, but it does include both Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S versions. Grand Theft Auto V is a big open-world game so it's always nice to have access to a game with so much content.

Those who recall the old days of Lionhead Studios and (going back even further) Bullfrog will know the name Peter Molyneux. Responsible for the Fable series, the veteran designer and programmer has certainly made a name for himself. Unfortunately, not always in a good way.
Typically known for overhyping his upcoming releases (not to mention his brush with NFT games), Molyneux seems to be uncharacteristically doing something un-Molyneux-like. In an interview with Game Reactor, he was asked whether he could divulge a few details about his next project, which is being developed via his company 22Cans.

Prior to the June 2023 Nintendo Direct, 2023 was looking decidedly quiet for Switch. In March, the system entered its seventh year on store shelves and with sales numbers slowing, it seems that the long-rumoured appearance of new Nintendo hardware may finally be on the horizon in the next 12 months or so.
It is, after all, a natural progression. The lifecycle of successful consoles may well span a decade or more, but that doesn't preclude the launch of a successor long before the retirement of the outgoing device. Remember how long 3DS was on its 'deathbed'?

As the name implies, you'll be able to take on a number of vocations in order to make ends meet. Such examples include being a mail man, chauffeur, or ranch hand. If you don't feel ready to give the tough life up just yet, you can take on wagon protection. This is actually an updated version of a previous mod, originally made by user Bolmin. Additionally, this recent upload claims to be a complete makeover, which includes "new mechanics and new jobs."
It's not always about the rootin' 'n' tootin'
With such stunning beauty and character development, the second installment in Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption series is often held aloft as an example of great game design. It's worth diving into this Wild West adventure again, for the vistas alone if nothing else.
Rockstar is no longer supporting it, but at least the developer can dedicate more time to GTA 6, whenever that's coming. We can't tell if Red Dead Redemption 2 will recieve a followup at this stage. But at the very least, PC users have a metric ton of mods to keep the game going.

We're baffled that Pikmin terrarium toys haven't been a thing before, but that's about to change on 6th November when Japanese toy maker Re-Ment releases its range of Pikmin Terrarium toy blind boxes.
Shared by Game Watch (via Tokyo Game Life) Re-Ment, which has previously released Pokémon and Kirby-themed terrarium toys, has revealed all six of the upcoming plastic figures. Inside each bottle — which varies from a little ship in a bottle to a lightbulb — you'll see Pikmin, creatures, and even Olimar, acting out different scenes that you might carry out in any one of the Pikmin games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the day of our interview, Exo Rally Championship programmer and composer Rhys Lindsay was preparing for a race on a hostile alien planet, and feeling pretty good about his chances. He spent a full three minutes surveying the pockmarked, potentially lethal landscape from above with a drone, marking the most dangerous terrain in advance and picking out a relatively safe route between the checkpoints. “Alright,” he thought. “I’m going to smash this stage.”


Of course, it’s just as they say: no plan survives contact with unroaded planets wracked by extreme temperatures, meteor showers and atmospheric pressure unlike anything ever experienced on Earth. On the corner of the first checkpoint, Lindsay flipped his rover, snagging the vehicle on a rock that immediately broke his scanning systems and left him driving blind. By the time of our chat, though, he’s laughing. Exo Rally Championship is a racer for those who like to roll with the punches, quite literally - an anecdote generator for players who adore the challenge of preparing for the worst, and then adapting to changing circumstances on the fly.

The findings consist of dozens of boxes filled with video tapes. Why tapes? Because the internet was very slow back in the day. Even in the early '00s, most video game reporting took place on TV, and only a select number of big tech and gaming websites ever got to do such coverage. Thus, most of the good stuff like trailers, gameplay captures, and interviews showed up on TV once and then disappeared forever. The few things t…]]></summary>

If you're simply itching for the latest edition of EA's FIFA franchise, then... well, you're not going to get it. Yes, as previously revealed, the FIFA franchise is no more and will effectively be replaced by EA Sports FC (at least until FIFA finds an alternative developer/publisher).
Still, it's likely that EA Sports FC 24 will be very much "more of the same" from EA, albeit without the FIFA license or branding. It's even aiming for a similar release date to past entries; at least according to known leaker billbil-kun (thanks, VGC). The football title will reportedly launch on September 29th, 2023. For comparison, FIFA 23 launched on September 27th, 2022.

It doesn’t tickle the atrophied humor muscle in my brain.
Except for butts. Butts are forever funny.
However, the NES is part of my domain. So when Garbage Pail Kids: Mad Mike and the Quest for Stale Gum arrived, I couldn’t turn down the opportunity to pick up a physical copy of it for NES.

For all of you who prefer your browsing ad-free, there could be trouble brewing. It turns out that YouTube does not like people using ad-blocking software on its website, and it's getting to the point where the company is looking to enforce some rule changes on that front.
In a post on Reddit, user Reddit_n_Me uploaded a screenshot of a message from YouTube warning that the "video player will be blocked after three videos." The reasons behind this, according to the message, are down to the use of an ad blocker, before insisting that ads are beneficial to YouTube and how users are free to sign up to the official Premium account if they do not wish to be exposed to advertisements while watching content.

Players will be able to go head to head with two of the game's four factions - the golden fantasy knights of the Stormcast Eternals and the sneaky green stink lads of the Orruk Kruleboyz - giving us our first taste of how they'll handle in battle, and the kinds of powerplays we'll be making with their respective (and rather handsome) tabletop miniature recreations. 
And having played four rounds of its 1v1 matches already at a press event last week, it's quite the thrill - and I say that as someone with no real attachment to Warhammer or Age Of Sigmar's specific lore legacy. The Stormcast Eternals and their flying hammer brutes are just as devastating as you'd imagine, while the lads lads lads and their Killaboss Kruleboyz are challenging late-game bloomers that will give even hardened strategy game veterans plenty to sink their teeth into. Both factions are great fun, and I'm very much looking forward to jumping back in this weekend.

The latest patch for Tears of the Kingdom (v.1.2.0) fixes a few minor issues with the game, but it also removes a couple of get-rich-quick glitches. Players hoping still hoping to beat the system will have to either avoid updating their game or find a new way to farm Rupees fast.

We all remember the start-up animations from the Wii home menu, right? You'd select a game, see the icon fill the screen and then watch a short animation (accompanied by music, of course) while you chose whether to start the title or head back to the home page. We miss them.
For many of us, these menu animations are deeply ingrained in our heads for the likes of Smash Bros. Brawl, Skyward Sword and Super Mario Galaxy, but what would things be like if some of the Switch's finest titles got the same treatment? That is the very question that YouTube channel Pineapple Puppy has attempted to answer, as they built Wii-style menu animations for a whole bunch of Switch games and now we're feeling all kinds of nostalgic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’d be fairly weird if Sony didn’t announce a PlayStation 5 Slim in the coming months. The console will be three years old by then, and that’s generally the pattern. But it’d definitely be very weird if instead, Microsoft were the company to reveal it. Which might be what just happened.

A few weeks ago, Seth Sturgill, a podcast acquaintance of mine, put out some feelers on Twitter for games to cover on his Keep Nintendo Weird podcast. I’ve been on the show twice before, talking about Pocket Card Jockey and Part Time UFO. If you know anything about me, you know I hold both those games close to my heart. So I was happy to give them just a little bit more coverage on his podcast, even if I stumbled over my words more than Joe Biden stumbles up the stairs. With Seth’s latest call for titles to talk about, there was only one that came to mind. It’s this weird Nintendo exclusive designed by Martin Hollis, arguably best known for his work with Rare on Killer Instinct, Perfect Dark, and GoldenEye 007.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thrilling as it may be to swing a lightsaber or shoot a headcrab in stereoscopic 3D, the VR experiences I crave most are those which use the tech to fold my brain into entirely new shapes. 2019's A Fisherman's Tale was one of those. An unassuming first-person puzzler about a puppet fisherman living in a lighthouse, it dazzled with its incredible deployment of VR's unique sense of perspective and scale. It's the kind of game that, if it featured a psychotic AI and some cake memes instead of a beard in a yellow anorak, would have been heralded as a revolution in play.


It would have been easy to follow-up A Fisherman's Tale in the same way, make a bigger game with a few new gimmicks and a comedy lobster voiced by Stephen Merchant. But that isn't what developer InnerspaceVR has done. Instead, Another Fisherman's Tale bends your neural pathways in entirely new forms, offering a completely different kind of puzzling. The results are equally innovative and almost as interactively satisfying - although a lack of refinement in the latter category is a deflating puncture in the game's dinghy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chugging along
Altfuture has dropped the biggest update yet for their train simulator, Derail Valley. It's been a while since the last update, but considering the size of this one, it's reason for celebration. It's titled Derail Valley: Simulator. That sounds horrifying.
Remember Derail Valley? I've heard of it, but it’s hard to pick something out among the many train simulators on PC. It started out as a very VR-focused title before offering non-VR options. It's been an Early Access title for a while now. Overhauled was its last big update in 2020, while Simulator is the next step in its evolution as it makes its way to meeting Altfuture's vision for it.
https://youtu.be/Htm2HD91Lmk
Why should you pay attention? Derail Valley isn’t just a train simulator. Whereas your typical train sim will cast you as the train itself, Derail Valley has you play as a person driving a train. So, you can get in and out, which is necessary to actually do tasks outside the locomotive itself. There’s a lot of tactile gameplay mixed in, possibly as a result of its original VR focus.
The Simulator update brings with it a complete redo of the UI, mouse cursor driving, new camera angles, a sandbox mode, more trains, steam simulation, weather effects, and… Just, a lot. Here are the patch notes to get a better idea.
Now I just need to know if I can play it with my Densha De Go 64 controller.
Derail Valley is currently in Steam Early Access for PC. The Simulator update is available now.

Fortnite has shown that it will collaborate with just about any major IP. From Marvel to DC, to even Dragon Ball, Fortnite has become the Who's Who? Of Battle Royales. Their latest IP they've managed to snag is none other than Transformers, and they're making sure they can get in on the fun.
The Fortnite Battle Bus gets the Autobots Treatment in Latest Physical Pack
Fortnite's Latest Physical Pack, which includes three new skins, three new back blings, 1,000 v-bucks, two emotes, and three new pickaxes is coming soon. Entitled the "Transformers Pack" this bundle will cost about $25 USD without taxes, and includes Bumblebee, Megatron, and a new Transformer based on the Fortnite Battle Bus.

Bumblebee comes with a back bling based on his car-door wings, as well as a Stinger Sword Pickaxe. The pickaxe also comes with a built-in "Battle Ready" emote.

Megatron's portion of the pack comes with a Decepticon logo back bling, and the Energon Mace Pickaxe. The built-in emote for this Pickaxe turns it into his iconic Fusion Cannon.

Last, but not least, Fortnite's own battle bus becomes a Transformer as well, complete with the "Bot Air Balloon" back bling, and the Pick Axle Pickaxe.
The physical pack will be sold in retail stores on October 13th, with digital versions of the pack being available on October 21st. There's still time to work through Chapter 4: Season 3's battle pass, to complete the Transformers collection with Optimus Prime before he leaves at the end of the season!

The Steam hardware survey is a chance for both Valve and the general public to see exactly what PC gamers are playing at that particular time. It can reveal some pretty interesting results. For example, in the latest survey, it looks like Nvidia and AMD's new generation of graphical hardware are barely getting a look in.
You can check out June's results over on Steam (via PC Gamer). The GPU section in particular is intriguing, showing that over 90% of gamers are using DirectX 12 hardware. However, if you were curious to see where Nvidia's RTX 4000 series or AMD's RX 7000 cards are, you'd think no one was buying any of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flock is the next game from the makers of Wilmot's Warehouse, Hohokum and I Am Dead, but ever since it was announced last year, I've been wondering about exactly what kind of game it is. The first trailer revealed lots of strange, whimsical environments, equally whimsical-looking beasties and a little person flying around on the back of a giant bird herding them around in delightful swoops and swirls. We also saw some sheep grazing in a meadow before they, too, started to fly alongside your wilder, more abstract animal pals. But the question of what you do in Flock remained unanswered - until last week, when developers Hollow Ponds showed us a little bit more of their creature collecting game during the Annapurna Interactive Showcase stream.
There, they revealed that we'll need to collect and charm these creatures to get them to join our respective flocks, and that we'll be able to do so in co-op with a pal. It looks intensely charming, but it still left me with lots of unanswered questions. So I spoke to devs Ricky Haggett and Richard Hogg to find out more. Naturally, there are some things they're not ready to reveal about Flock just yet, but they did tell me that you'll start on top of a mountain and will be wending your way down it with your flock of sheep.

Studios and publishers would generally agree that video games having their source code leaked is a pretty bad thing. But what if it's an old game that people probably aren't buying these days anyway? That's the case for the original Far Cry from 2004, whose source code cropped up online recently.
The story emerged after Twitter user and Duke Nukem modder Vinícius Medeiros posted a bunch of screenshots showing the complete code for the first Far Cry game. When asked by another user, a link to archive.org was then posted, leading to a download page for anyone interested in checking it out. The files were uploaded by user Llaetha.ro in June and are said to be 1.34 version of the game.

The main thing marking it out, apart from its style, is that instead of stabbing monsters, you attack by hovering the cursor (actually the shimmery face of the sword's spirit) over them and clicking, which launches your little globby shadow man directly at them. You can probably already imagine that this is also a means of getting around the world.

“The head was vacuum-formed, but Yoshi’s whole body was solid foam,” adds Kathy Lawrence, the costume designer responsible for creating the mascots for dozens of Nintendo’s TV spots in the ʼ90s and 2000s.
“It went from a costume that weighed about 35 pounds to over 200 pounds,” Fireball says. “The foam, like a sponge, just absorbed the water, and I just started to sink.” Mistaking his outreached hand for a thumbs up, Kathy and the crew were excited as they watched her husband fight for his life underwater.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If Ubisoft's summer showcase was any indication, it's going all-in on Assassin's Creed. But a recent report from Kotaku suggests that the company's commitment to the franchise might be going even deeper than we thought; Ubisoft has recently begun the process of remaking Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. 
The remake is currently in "its earliest stages," Kotaku reports, so details are scarce, and we won't be seeing it officially for a few years. A team at Ubisoft Singapore, a branch that has contributed to almost every mainline Assassin's Creed game, is said to be heavily involved. Most notably, Ubisoft Singapore worked on the creation of naval combat for Assassin's Creed III and IV, a success that would place it at the head of development for Ubisoft's naval-focused game, Skull and Bones. Of course, Skull and Bones is now notorious for its years of repeated delays – fans of Black Flag will just have to hope the seas will be calmer for the studio's next project.


Black Flag was released in 2013 on the eve of a new console generation, coming to PS3 and 360, but also to PS4, Xbox One, and Wii U. The game follows Edward Kenway – the pirate grandfather of the protagonist Connor from Assassin's Creed III – as he plunders the Caribbean and stumbles into the Assassin Brotherhood. Combining the series' classic stealth gameplay with naval exploration and combat, it's widely regarded as one of the franchise's best entries. Check out our review here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Studio Wildcard have once again revised plans for Ark: Survival Ascended, the remastered version of dino survival sim Ark: Survival Evolved. The Unreal Engine 5 edition has now slightly adjusted its price, changed plans for the remastered expansions, and is now launching into early access sometime this October, slipping past its previous late summer window. Those still playing the orignal Survival Evolved have a small reprise, though, as the game's planned shutdown has moved from August to September 30th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exoprimal is built using Capcom’s proprietary RE Engine, which is surprising considering the other Capcom games that have used the engine are quite different. The first game to publicly use it was Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, which caused many to dub the engine the Resident Evil engine, which is not what the ‘RE’ stands for. Instead, the acronym is confusingly shorthand for Reach for the Moon. In Japan, the Resident Evil series is called Biohazard, which is why Exoprimal technical director Kazuki Abe is surprised that anyone ever thought the engine was named after the survivor horror series . “It’s really just a matter of coincidence that Resident Evil games are also developed using this engine.”

You get my point. The future, but via a second-hand retro clothes store full of dungarees and big print. I'd hesitate to say Return To Grace, a gentle adventure about exploring an ancient complex that houses a long-dormant god-like AI, entirely meets the strict definition of "retrofuturist", but it's definitely "space but the 60s", and it looks bloody lovely.

Apparently 10 years is the answer, since a remake of Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag (aka the best one) is reportedly in the early stages of development at Ubisoft, at least a0ccording to a report from Kotaku. If true, this means it's joining The Last Of Us Part 1 as 2013’s other maybe-too-soon remake.

The post includes a message from Valve saying that developers "own the rights to all of the IP used in the data set that trained the AI to create assets." Valve have now cleared up their thought process on the subject, saying they don’t want to discourage developers from experimenting with AI tech, though they need to make sure developers have “sufficient rights” before publishing anything on Steam.

Come prepared to talk about your favourite puzzles, the ones that stumped you, and the weird horror themes you liked best. I've thoroughly enjoyed making the team play a tough puzzle game, especially one that's intentionally retro and a bit spooky without being scary. So why not come and join in the discussion? Haha, that's a joke: you don't have a choice. As I said, you're locked in here unless you can find the Resident Evil-ass key I have hidden in here somewhere. See you at 4pm, when we'll be back to see how you're getting on.

I had mentally labelled coming sequel Homeworld 3 as "more of the same, but better looking", without thinking much more about it.

A new development update from developers Blackbird Interactive doesn't so much prove me wrong as go into great detail about what "better looking" really means - while also making me excited about the new "flavor layer" of ship-to-ship communication.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a move I pull in most gunfights in Trepang2: slidekick into an enemy, grab them out of mid-air, briefly hold them in front of me as a human shield, only to pull the pin on their vest's grenade and hurl them into a group of their pals, who do try to scatter before this meaty bomb bursts but sadly forget that they also need to avoid me and my shotgun. Often this is all in slow-motion. Trepang2 is unashamedly aiming to be a new F.E.A.R. and does a pretty great job of it for a game made by a core team of only four people (plus external artists and such). Give me a shotgun, a slidekick, and slo-mo, and I'm happy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Replay returns, and we're checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts! Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scorn was one of the most enigmatic and polarizing games when it crept to Xbox and PC last fall. Some love it, some despise it, and PlayStation fans will get to see which side of the fence they fall on when it hits PlayStation 5 this fall.
Despite appearing like a shooter on its surface, Scorn is an atmospheric puzzle-focused experience. As a strange humanoid creature, you’ll explore a labyrinthian H.R. Giger-inspired alien world to unravel its mysteries. While combat is present, it’s very much secondary to deciphering the abstract story and riddles, and even those revelations will primarily be up to your interpretation. 
The PlayStation 5 version features DualSense haptic feedback support and 4K/60 fps gameplay. Check out the game’s new trailer below.]]></summary>

The Pegasus Expedition is one of my favourite kinds of game. I'm not sure if it quite comes together enough, but it's trying something so original that even its partial success is worth celebrating. You're leading a 4X-ish effort to establish a power base in an unfamiliar galaxy. But you're not doing it to conquer everyone or win victory points. You're doing it so you can go back home and save Earth from annihilation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ruinarch is based on a concept many of you have thought of at some point. What if, instead of building up villages and hunting down hostile monsters and evil overlords, you were playing as the Dark Lord?
It's been done most famously in Dungeon Keeper or Overlord, but those were quite conventional structurally. Sure, you were playing as the baddies, but still doing mostly the same things as in other games, twirling your moustache the whole time. Ruinarch feels not like one of those thematic remixes of an established structure, but an attempt to build a new subgenre. Now that it's reached a full release, it also, sadly, feels like a demonstration of how difficult that really is.

What I can tell you is that the SpongeBob Squarepants DLC for PowerWash Simulator confirms that PowerWash DLC is now the only way I will consume content about pop culture I do not understand. The most elaborate Spiderverse-themed skins for Fortnite, with all the custom dances they can muster, are as shadows and dust next to methodically cleaning an orange submarine car while a fictional octopus sends you sad texts. I'm convinced PowerWash Sim could do a crossover with literally any intellectual property and make it work. Lego. Mad Men. The filmography of Nicolas Cage. Clean them all.

Off the back of the trip, I've finally decided to get my act together and pursue a long, arduous road to some degree of fluency. It's always going to be a work-in-progress, but I think I've settled into a language learning routine which leaves me with plenty of time for Love Island in the evening. DuoLingo's owl has been punted to the curb, too, because the bird is awful.
Naturally, I've turned to a textbook: Genki I. At first I thought there was no getting past it being a bit dry - I mean they aren't meant to be thrillers, are they? Until, that was, I discovered Game Gengo, a YouTuber who takes each lesson from the textbook, breaks them down into manageable chunks, all complete with loads of examples from video games. I spend most of my evenings with the guy, and what a treat it is.

The Xbox ANZ account tweeted an image of a noughts and crosses board that spelled out Psycho with three Xs. It was a rather confusing tease to say the least, and lo and behold, there was no Psychonauts 3 announcement during the showcase. Now Double Fine boss Tim Schafer has confirmed that he’s not working on it either.

In this smart murder mystery detective game from the creator of Ace Attorney, you play the recently deceased amnesiac Sissel as he attempts to piece together his own demise. Who killed him? And why? And what's the deal with these newfound powers he has to turn back time and manipulate inanimate objects in his vicinity? That definitely wasn't in the ghostbusting 101 manual. Alas, he doesn't have long to find out, as he'll cross over to the afterlife in the morning. Thus begins a frantic night of whodunnit puzzling at its finest, with director Shu Takumi showing us exactly what he's made of outside the courtroom dramas he built his name on.

In an email sent to staff by CEO John Hanke (which you can read here), he explains that the pandemic-era surge of recruitment and expanding pipeline of projects ballooned to the point that, once the pandemic ended, the resulting expenses outpaced its revenue.

But rest assured, Flock is still very much a game you can play on your own, without the need to have a pal along for the ride, the devs tell me.

While most of the announcements were updates on games we already knew about, there are a couple of cool new things in there that I'm personally quite pumped for, including a new Blade Runner game being developed internally at Annapurna Interactive, a new Keita Takahashi joint about a kid stuck in a T-pose of all things, and a new ghostly biking game from the team behind Nidhogg. I'd highly recommend watching the showcase in full if you can, but in case you need a quick refresher of what happened, or are just short on time, we've rounded up every announcement in order below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive has revealed Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, a new game set in the same world as the Blade Runner film series, and it's the first game developed in-house. 
Annapurna has published plenty of great games, but it announced last year that it had created a new internal studio to actually develop one. And now we know that game is Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth. As the name suggests, it takes place in 2033, which puts it between the original film and its sequel, Blade Runner 2049. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles like its cinematic predecessors, and the game's events occur after the Blackout hits. 
Not much else was revealed about the game, but you can check out its moody cinematic trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, this game looks very Blade Runner, and we can't wait to learn more about it. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth's development is led by game director Chelsea Hash, who previously served as the director of Solar Ash and technical art lead on What Remains of Edith Finch. 
Annapurna Interactive says Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth is the first new Blade Runner game for consoles and PC in development in 25 years. It's due out sometime in the future on consoles and PC, but there's no word on when to expect it. However, Annapurna Interactive says it will share more details about the game soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thirsty Suitors will be released on PlayStation, Xbox (including Xbox Game Pass), Switch, and PC on November 2, it's been revealed. 
This news comes by way of today's Annapurna Interactive Showcase, where developer Outerloop Games released a new trailer showing off more of what to expect in this RPG that's one part a skateboarding game, another part a cooking game, and always a game about confronting your exes and parents. It looks great – we quite enjoyed playing it recently during Summer Game Fest 2023 – and you can check it out for yourself below in the newest Thirsty Suitors trailer: 


As you can see, players take on the role of protagonist Jala, who, after a bad breakup, returns to her hometown. There, she must confront her exes and try to reconcile with them, please her tough-to-please parents, and mend broken friendships in time for her sister's wedding. To do all that, Jala will skateboard, take part in turn-based combat seemingly inspired by Persona and Pokémon, cook meals with her parents, and more. 
Thirsty Suitors hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam on November 2.

Among the new additions: car crashes, much improved pathfinding, and car parks. I find all of these as exciting as each other.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Later this year, Sports Interactive will show and release Football Manager 2024, the latest in their long-running sports simulation series. In a blog post earlier today, studio head Miles Jacobsen described FM2024 as "the most complete version in the series' history", but also "the last of its kind."

That's because next year's Football Manager 2025 will apparently be, "for the first time in decades, a true sequel," and introduce a new graphics engine, new user interface, "advanced" animations, and women's football, among other changes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 21st century, fans of the NFL have had minimal choices when it comes to their officially licensed football games. Ever since 2004, EA Sports' annualized Madden NFL series has been the exclusive franchise for the NFL, its teams, stadiums, and players. The result was the closure of other franchises, such as the competitive NFL 2K series, as well as the arcade-focused NFL Blitz franchise (which was later acquired by EA in 2011). The recently announced Wild Card Football from Saber Interactive, part of the Playgrounds franchise, hopes to smash through the established line to give players a fresh 7-on-7 arcade-facing take on the sport starring their favorite players.
Wild Card Football doesn't possess the NFL license, but rather the NFLPA license. This means the teams and stadiums of the…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-29T15:55:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While game delays have become commonplace, the opposite is extremely rare. Today, we learned Baldur's Gate 3 is somehow doing both at the same time. Initially planned for August 31, developer Larian Studios is advancing the PC release date to August 3 while delaying the PS5 version to September 6. According to the most recent community update, the change was done to prioritize release in order of platform readiness. More specifically, the team needed a little more time to get the PS5 version up to 60 frames per second.
"The PlayStation 5 version will be released roughly a week later than its originally scheduled date of August 31st," the community update reads. "Baldur’s Gate 3 is targeting 60 frames-per-second and we’re close to achieving that on the platform but need a bit more extra time. We don’t want to compromise on quality, and feel it would be a shame to downscale to 30fps or make other compromises to hit an arbitrary date."
Meanwhile, the PC version has moved up a whopping four weeks. Larian says, "This means the PC version of Baldur’s Gate 3 will be released at a time where you’ll have more time to play it," likely in reference to the release of Starfield, Bethesda's massive upcoming open-world RPG. By releasing their game over a month earlier, it's a little less likely that gamers would have to choose one or the other to devote their time to.
The community update also casts a light cantrip on some of the features coming to the full game, including new spells, the addition of feats, the Half-Orc and Dragonborn races, the monk class, and a huge line-up of new subclasses, which you can see listed below.

The game is a real platter of genres, mixing flavours of RPG, management sim, visual novel and more to create a unique kind of experience that made a real splash while it was in early access. Dave's quite popular tenure in early access had three chapters to its name, but the full release takes that number up to seven alongside new weapons, areas, and features for the deep-sea-explorathon. Take a look at the new release trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Illusion Island is an upcoming “Mickeyvania” exclusive to Switch and after being revealed over a year ago, it’s finally out next month. Dlala Studios and Disney have released a new story trailer to prepare potential players for what’s in store on the island. 
Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy mysteriously arrive on the island of Monoth and soon after find that its people need their help. This kickstarts their journey as players must platform through the various obstacles, challenges, and biomes of Monoth. Each character has the same abilities (although animated quite differently), so players can select whichever hero they want to save the day. 
Check out the latest Disney Illusion Island story trailer for yourself below: 


For more about Disney Illusion Island, watch the reveal trailer from last summer and then check out this gameplay trailer from February. After that, read about the game’s lack of combat and a Metroid-style map.
Disney Illusion Island hits Switch on July 28.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI hit PlayStation 5 exclusively last week on June 23, and less than a week later, Square Enix has announced it has shipped and digitally sold 3 million copies. 
It’s a somewhat odd metric to parse out because copies shipped and sold aren’t the same. For example, a shipped copy might still be sitting on a game store shelf, while a digital copy sold is money made. Nonetheless, between physical shipped copies of FFXVI and digital versions purchased by players, Square Enix says it has reached 3 million copies sold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indiescovery is recorded a week before we release it, and never has this small time delay been more apparant than in our latest episode. Last week the temperature in the UK was (pardon my french) bonkers boiling. As we are professionals we recorded this episode with all of our windows closed and our fans turned off in order to avoid any unwanted background noise. Choosing to do this while sat in a British house during a heatwave actually violates several human rights laws, and we've all since been arrested for crimes against ourselves.
Oh, we also talk about our favourite indies from this year's Not-E3, which probably highlights the slight time delay more than the heat thing because in video game industry terms Not-E3 may as well have taken place 30 years ago. But listen, indie games are always relevant, aren't they? Plus I got to do a bit where I pretended to be a games executive in the intro so as far as I'm concerned it all worked out well in the end.

While the team has publicly talked about Project Loki (not the official title), today’s new trailer marks the first time the studio has shown it in action.

Remakes and remasters are more common than ever in 2023. What's most interesting is seeing how these new versions handle the issue of completely rebuilding versus simply making modern visual improvements. Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life is a remake of Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life that straddles the line between these two philosophies fairly evenly but still delivers an outdated experience in various aspects.
Releasing on modern consoles, Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life initially looks like nothing more…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been excited to play Final Fantasy XVI for ages, but after hearing about Game of Thrones' influence on the game, I was afraid I'd be overwhelmed by dense fantasy lore. While worldbuilding can be as simple as creating fictional characters and cities, some creators dive in deeply, crafting pantheons of gods, hundreds of years of wars and conflict, and even entire languages. While it makes the world more believable, it can be incredibly disorienting for an audience to be thrust headfirst into a sea of unfamiliar proper nouns, especially before they have a chance to get to know the world's characters. Lucky for me, the developers behind Final Fantasy XVI completely anticipated this and introduced a solution: the Active Time Lore mechanic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the ambitious follow-up to 2017’s Breath of the Wild, finally hit Switch last month. We’ve now learned, thanks to video game analyst group Circana, that it was, unsurprisingly, the best selling game of the month. However, it’s also already the second best selling game of 2023, behind Hogwarts Legacy. 
What’s even more impressive is that Circana’s Tears of the Kingdom numbers do not include digital sales for the game – only physical, according to Circana executive director Mat Piscatella. That it’s the second best selling game of 2023 on just its physical numbers alone means this game sold exceptionally well. And there’s a good chance it might be the year’s best selling game if digital numbers are one day added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Dear Villagers and developer Fallen Leaf Studios have released a new trailer on IGN for Fort Solis, the upcoming sci-fi horror game starring Roger Clark and Troy Baker. 
This trailer starts with Baker discussing how he came to be involved with Fort Solis and why he’s excited about the game before he reveals it hits PlayStation 5 and PC on August 22. The trailer then cuts to new footage of the game, which you can check out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Baker says he joined Fort Solis because it allowed him to work alongside Clark (whom you might recognize as Arthur Morgan from Red Dead Redemption 2) and because he liked the story as well. As for the new Fort Solis footage, it shows more of the spooky Martian horror featured in the game. In it, Clark’s character, Jack Leary, tries to survive “through one long and terrifying night on Mars.” Leary appears to be guided, in some way, by Baker’s Wyatt Taylor and Julia Brown’s character, Jessica Appleton. 
Fort Solis hits PlayStation 5 and PC on August 22.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Humble Games and developer Crema have revealed Temtem Showdown, a new standalone battle-focused game, and it's out right now. 
This surprise reveal comes less than a year after the full 1.0 release of Temtem, the game that Showdown is based on. Similar to Pokemon Showdown, Temtem Showdown is all about battling. It's also free to everyone. 
"Temtem Showdown takes the best Temtem competitive action and places it within immediate reach for everyone," a press release reads. "Get to know the colorful critters from the massively multiplayer creature-collection adventure, build your team in seconds, and dash into battle to test it out against other players and their teams – or carefully curate a plan of action to overpower your opponents." 
Unlike Temtem, which is a multiplayer Pokemon-like game where you catch and train Temtem to use in 2 vs. 2 battles, Showdown will let players build a team from scratch right from the jump. And then you can hop right into a battle, without needing to worry about their level like you might in the base game. You can play against other players both casually and competitively, and the latter will feature a ranked system and a ladder to climb up as you play. 
Crema says Showdown will receive regular balance patches to keep the meta fair, and new Seasons will bring additional content and changes as well.

The cookies feature 16 unique embossments starring characters like Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Goomba, and Bowser Jr., as well as power-ups like Super Stars and Fire Flowers. Packs will be filled at random. Oreo is also holding a social media event where they're asking those who buy the cookies to stack as many of the hero-embossed cookies on the rim of a glass of milk without the cookies falling into the milk and share the video on social media in a concerted effort to save Princess Peach from Bowser's Castle.
"We hope to unite cookie lovers and Super Mario enthusiasts alike with this playful mission, inspired by a storyline fans know all too well," Oreo senior brand manager Vishnu Nair said in a press release. "We may even reveal a surprise as a thank you to those who successfully defeat Bowser and save the kingdom... Fans will have to wait and see!"
You can check out a fun musical trailer for the collaboration below.


The Oreo x Super Mario cookies will begin rolling out to retailers nationwide starting July 10, but will only be available for a limited time.

However, not every update lives up to expectations, and while it's still the better version of this bundle, Sonic Origins Plus' main attraction doesn't quite stick the landing.
For the uninitiated, Sonic Origins launched one year ago today, letting players speed through Sonic the Hedgehog 1, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and Sonic 3 & Knuckles from the Sega Genesis, as well as Sonic CD from Sega CD with the option to play as Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles in all of them (except Knuckles in Sonic CD, for some reason). You can play through them in Classic Mode, which retains the original aspect ratio and lives system of the games, or in Anniversary Mode, which adds n…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox corporate vice president Sarah Bond has claimed that Activision Blizzard demanded Microsoft provide a larger revenue share to put new Call of Duty games on the platform, according to a new report from IGN. 
This news comes from yesterday's court trial between Xbox (and Activision Blizzard) and the Federal Trade Commission over Microsoft's attempted acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Bond claimed in court that, in the leadup to the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S generation of hardware in 2020, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said his company did not intend to put Call of Duty – presumably new, upcoming ones – on the Xbox platform unless Microsoft shared more revenue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Sonic Central stream to celebrate the anniversary of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, Sonic Team announced that the second free content update on Sonic Frontiers' 2023 roadmap, titled Sonic's Birthday Bash, is available today. The update was announced in November 2022 as part of the game's 2023 roadmap.
The Sonic's Birthday Bash update adds new challenges, moves, and a new kind of collectible Koco for Sonic. The update also promises free birthday decorations for our hero, as well as the addition of New Game Plus. As is standard with most New Game Plus modes, you can begin the adventure from the start with all of your skill tree and power-up levels carried over into the new file.
Sonic's Birthday Bash arrives free to download beginning today at 5 p.m. PT / 8 p.m. ET. The first of three content updates arrived in March, adding a photo mode, Cyber Space Challenges, and Battle Rush mode, plus a jukebox featuring collectible songs from Sonic's past. The third update, which promises to be the most substantial, adds new playable characters and a new story and is set to arrive later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic Superstars received prime placement in both the Summer Game Fest 2023 stream and this week's Nintendo Direct. As you might imagine, today's Sonic Central also shined a spotlight on the highly anticipated 2D Sonic game. We received a new trailer that showed off some new DLC coming to Sonic Superstars that features a collaboration with the Lego brand.
Players will be able to download a free Lego Sonic DLC skin to give the Blue Blur a new, bricky look. In addition, those who preorder Sonic Superstars will receive a Lego Eggman skin as well. You can see the new trailer below.


While Sonic is a recent addition to the Lego stable of characters, he appeared in the 2015 toys-to-life game Lego Dimensions, where he received specialized stages geared towards the speedy playstyle. However, it wasn't until 2021 that Lego officially greenlit a fan creation featuring Green Hill Zone from Sonic Mania. Then, earlier this year, Lego announced four new Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets, which will be available in August.
Sonic Superstars arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year. For more, check out our hands-on preview right here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A stalwart party exploring the unknown, seeking the fabled Inner Sanctum. But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...
The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:
The original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)
A ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive "Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.
Both modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.
Help us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!
