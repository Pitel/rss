This Kickstarter project by solo developer Aaron McDevitt has launched today on PC (via Steam Early Access) and is described as an anti-gravity racer channelling F-Zero X and F-Zero GX. A few other Nintendo inspirations include Wave Race 64 for the "uplifting, arcade-like summer vibe" and Kirby Air Ride, for its "simple-to-pick-up nature".

Digital Eclipse might not necessarily be a household name like certain other game studios but the retro specialist has made a name for itself in more recent years with compilations like the Mega Man Legacy Collection, Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration and TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection.
The company has teamed up with Japanese companies previously, so could we see it work on something related to Nintendo's first-party releases in the future? According to Digital Eclipse's Chris Kohler, although "nothing is in development" the door on a possible partnership hasn't closed, and historically speaking there are already some links. Here's his response to VGC:

How to get Super Helldive in Helldivers 2


To unlock Super Helldive in Helldivers 2, you have to complete a level 9– Helldive operation. This means that you simply have to complete an entire mission set, consisting of three levels, to unlock the difficulty.


This could be a lot tougher now with the recent nerfs to some of the best weapons in the game, but also, the inclusion of new enemy variants to both the Terminids and Automatons. Even with the new patch, you’re still better off completing a Terminid operation ove…]]></summary>

One note, though: it seems like at least a few would really, really like to date Olric.


Some context: I've yet to actually play Fields of Mistria myself. As one of the editors here, I was doing some digging through Google Trends, looking at what the several thousands of people playing the game were looking for online. Lo and behold, in the "breakout" category, Olric.

The Major Order in question tasked the Helldivers 2 community with killing a total of 1.5 billion enemies. If they succeeded, Super Earth wouldn't give them the new mines because the old ones obviously worked. Failing the Major Order meant unlocking the Anti-Tank Mines Stratagem, and that's exactly what happened.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Water Chestnuts, a key resource in the early stages of Fields of Mistria, offer significant benefits. They are not only part of Requests but also provide valuable stamina boosts. This guide will demonstrate how to obtain Water Chestnuts in Fields of Mistria and detail their versatile uses.


Where to find Water Chestnuts in Fields of Mistria


You can get Water Chestnuts in Fields of Mistria by the edge of the water at the Narrows. The Narrows are to the left of the main Mistria location, on the same pathway as the Museum and Mines. The Water Chestnuts primarily spawn in the river at the bottom.

To harvest Water Chestnuts, look for small green sprouts in the water and approach them closely. Alternatively, you can jump into the river and swim around to collect them more efficiently.


Screenshot by Destructoid


You'll find a plentiful supply of Water Chestnuts in the river, making it easy to complete missions like Request for Water Chestnuts. Additionally, this ingredient can be combined with Wild Berries to make the Trail Mix recipe, a meal that's perfect for newcomers. It replenishes health and stamina by 12, which will undoubtedly be helpful when you're stuck in the mines. Fortunately, the Wild Berries are much easier to find, as they can be picked from bushes throughout the map.


To collect more Water Chestnuts in Fields of Mistria, you'll need to wait for them to respawn near the bridge. The chestnuts should be replenished daily, so keep checking on them in the Narrows.

How to find Impalers in Helldivers 2


To find an Impaler in Helldivers 2, you’re more likely to encounter them at level 7– Suicide Mission– and higher. While they may be encountered at lower levels, they are a lot less frequent to come by.  


They look like a larger variant of the standard Charger, but blue and spiky. Impalers also have darker orange underbellies, so you have to be careful when encountering them in hordes.


These tend to come out on main objectives or when the mission timer gets closer to 0. Much like the rest of the Terminids yo…]]></summary>

Crash isn't hopping onto the ol' Pass on his lonesome. In the announcement post made today over at Xbox Wire, the Game Pass team confirms that Mafia: Definitive Edition and Creatures of Ava are also on the way. The latter, in fact, will arrive on the service tomorrow as a day-one launch game. Naturally, this means that subscribers will only be able to play Creatures of Ava if they have the more expensive Game Pass Ultimate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA and Respawn have set a September 17, 2024 launch date for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. If you've been holding out for the day Cal Kestis once again graces the previous generation of consoles, your wait is almost over.


Digital pre-orders are live for the PS4 and Xbox One versions, which clock in a little cheaper than their current-gen counterparts. This one has been optimized specifically for the capabilities of the respective platforms, and it's priced at $49.99. Those who pre-order will get a Combustion Blaster and an Obi-Wan-inspired robe. 




Star Wars Jedi: Survivor first launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and EA App on April 28, 2023. It essentially took what 2019's Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order offered and gave us way more of the good stuff. 


Speaking of good stuff, Respawn is hoping to inject more of it into the PC port. When it initially launched, it was buggy and messed up enough to warrant an apology. Improvements have been made since, and the latest press release says more enhancements are on the way "in the coming weeks."


The upcoming patch promises updates to technical performance, controls, and other features. Players can also look forward to "a variety of quality-of-life improvements" when the fixes go live. Here's hoping everything goes smoothly both for the PC version and the previous-gen consoles, which have a pretty beefy game on their hands with this one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've begun the Shards Request mission, you'll likely be puzzled by the resource's mysterious locations. They aren't exactly out in the open like other items, given that they must be unearthed with specific tools. So, if you want to complete the quest and earn crafting materials, here's how to get Shards in Fields of Mistria.


Where to find Shards and Dig Sites in Fields of Mistria


Use your shovel on a Dig Site to get Shards in the Fields of Mistria. If you haven't obtained this tool yet, the General Store sells a Worn Shovel for 500 Tesserae. I've had the most luck finding the Shards at the Western Ruins site, located to the left of the Narrows.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Go to the south side of the Western Ruins to find an archeology area. You should see a dig spot where you'll need to use your shovel. However, keep in mind that Shards don't always drop, and you may end up with another item instead.


Screenshot by Destructoid


One Dig Site will spawn at the Western Ruins daily, so check back on this destination for more Shards. If you want to increase the digging spots there, speak to Caldarus (the dragon statue) and unlock the Western Ruins Scholar perk. It will spawn an additional spot to farm more resources. 


Shards may appear in other areas, like the mines, whenever there's a Dig Site to uncover. I haven't had much luck outside of the Western Ruins, but it could still be possible. The material can also be used for crafting, along with the Shards Request. I suggest saving some for yourself for a future build in case it's needed again.

The major focus of the 1.4 patch is to bring in additional resources and production. The marquee feature here is fishing, which is done at ponds. These are resource nodes, much like many of the others that already exist within the game world. These are exploited using fishing huts.


There are also new buildings, resources, needs, and orders. With the addition of new resources and blueprints, Eremite Games acknowledges that this could result in bloat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After two open beta tests in recent weeks, the upcoming football video game UFL has an official release date and is available for pre-order on consoles.


The game has been in development for several years and finally looks set for the official launch. While all game modes will be available for free, you can pre-order starter bundles, which have several benefits and early access.


When will UFL release?


If there are no delays, the game will go live worldwide on September 12 on all available platforms. The developers have announced the official date on the game's X/Twitter account. Do note that this date could be pushed back (in that case, this article will be duly updated with the correct launch date).




All UFL platforms


Like the last two open beta tests, the game will be released on PS5, the Xbox Series S, and the Xbox Series X. It's not known if the older-gen consoles will get a release. There are also some question marks over the game's release on PC. For now, there's no official information about whether PC players will be able to play UFL in the near future.


All UFL pre-order bundles


While this will be a free-to-play title, you can have up to seven days of early access by purchasing the Starter Pack. Here are the other benefits you will get from your purchase:



Exclusive customization items: Lovorika shirt, Zlato boots, and Lavalampe Gloves


Stadium "Estádio do Redentor"


СP 20,000,000 in-game currency



The starter bundle, priced at $14.99 on both the Xbox and PSN stores, allows you to start playing on September 5. It will be interesting to observe the kind of reception UFL could have among football fans. The release date is set one week before the early access of EA FC 25, which would be a direct competitor.

The Dawntrail OST releases as a 66-track blu-ray media disk, including all of the main themes as well as those glorious battle tunes for the Arcadion: Light-heavyweight raids. Each track will be accompanied by visuals, so I’m assuming that Honey B. Lovely will be making an appearance there somewhere. 


If you purchase the Dawntrail OST, you’ll not only get the album, but you’ll get a code to claim your own in-game Wind-up Zero minion, so you can bring her with you on your adventures.

If you can’t wait to get the full album, certain tracks will be available from certain digital retailers, including Apple Music, ahead of the full release in October. The three EPs will be as follows, including the tracks listed below. I’ve noted where each track appears in-game to the best of my knowledge:

Sure, he's insane, but that's just one of the many reasons why we love him. Though we haven't seen much of him for quite a while, Richtofen has finally made his mark again in the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies Terminus Cinematic trailer.


The trailer begins with the Black Ops 6 crew, including Grigori Weaver and Dr. Elizabeth Grey, who have been imprisoned after the Black Ops Cold War events. Weaver stares ominously at a writing on the wall, showcasing the name "Richtofen." Dr. William Peck arrives shortly after to bust them out, explaining how Edward is the mastermind behind their capture. Here, we learn that Richtofen will be the primary target of the BO6 Zombies storylin…]]></summary>

Escalation of Freedom is all about going bigger in Helldivers 2 in every way that feels right for the game. Developer Arrowhead Game Studios has taken great care to craft this update with player feedback in mind, meaning the new difficulty level will provide the kind of challenge players have been asking for on the game's subreddit for months. It's the difficulty and new biomes that I think will make the biggest splash with players.

Starry Studio has not released a specific date for when this will happen. However, if it’s on their stated schedule, it will be sometime in the third week of August. The most likely date will be August 20, 2024 for servers that started on the day of launch. This is not confirmed, so we’ll be on the lookout for a more specific announcement.


What gets carried over from Once Human server wipes?


While the server wipe resets quite a bit, you’re not back to square one afterward. Thankfully, Starry Studio is a lot more specific about what you get to keep.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Dreamlight Valley dropped an update today featuring a new roadmap and other features coming to the game very soon, including some frankly long overdue quality of life updates and long awaited new characters. 


When the blog post was shared via the official Disney Dreamlight Valley Discord server, the number of people trying to gain access to the website rendered it completely broken. For a while, trying to visit the site would provide you with nothing more than a Bad Gateway error, but this thankfully seems to be fixed now.

        <link href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/one-piece-odyssey"/>
        <updated>2024-08-06T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here be dragons.
A couple of years ago, it was notable when the Switch remakes of Pokemon Diamond and Pearl were developed not in-house by Game Freak, but by a smaller Japanese support studio called ILCA. That remake project was actually ILCA’s first crack at being the lead developer on a game, and it soon followed this up early last year with One Piece Odyssey, an original JRPG based on the long-running franchise about wacky pirates. Now this release has finally made its way over to the Switch, and we’re happy to report that it’s made the jump almost entirely intact. Though it’s taken a bit of a visual hit, One Piece Odyssey still proves to be an enjoyable and accessible release that's a welcome addition to the Switch’s considerable RPG library.
The narrative in One Piece Odyssey is a sort of ‘bottle episode’ that follows the adventures of the Straw Hat Pirates crew after they shipwreck upon a mysterious island called Waford. Shortly after arriving, a mysterious figure takes away their power (cutely represented by everyone dropping from level 40 down to 1) and locks it away in various magical cubes scattered across the island. Even when they recover some of the cubes, the only way they can unlock the power contained within is through diving into illusory worlds crafted from their memories and reconquering trials they once faced, although events play out a little differently this time around because of how ‘fuzzy’ memory can be. The crew thus sets out through worlds based on the memories of some of their greatest struggles to reclaim their power and get to the bottom of what’s going on with this strange island.

I'm pretty sure not having eight gigs of RAM is heretical, but never fear, you can probably compensate by taking a leaf from the God-Emperor's book and arrange for a host of dying psykers to pour their brain energy into your motherboard.

We had Deviator last week - now, it's time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of Perennial Order. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a "plant horror" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable "Instinct" abilities and one-hit deaths.
In a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it "Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those "painterly" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as "rotted" and "unhallowed" and "manky". It's out on 6th September. Find a trailer nested below this paragraph like a venus flytrap poised to clamp around your fingers.

Došlo k úspěšnému startu a vypuštění sond z rakety Ariane 6, Boeing vyslal Starliner na oběžnou dráhu, kde nyní jeho pasažéři neplánovaně už druhý měsíc setrvávají. KiCAD má novou verzi a blíží se konference k jeho dalšímu vývoji. Objevil se nový čip kombinující RP2040 s ethernetem a povedlo se na čipu vytvořit pulzní safírové lasery. Jsou vám tyto novinky málo? Pak jsou na Virtuální Bastlírnu připravená i obecnější hardwarová témata!

Za HW lze probrat zajímavé nově objevené parazitní jevy v SiC MOSFETech, jak se dá operační zesilovač "zaseknout" nebo k čemu jsou dobré ztrátové koaxiální kabely a kde je sehnat. Samozřejmě bastlíři narazili i na kuriozity, například doutnavkovou logiku nebo plošňák, jehož součástí je ohýbačka na THT součástky.

Software ani tentokrát nezůstane stranou - kromě již zmíněné nové verze KiCADu se dá podívat na stavbu linuxového managovaného switche, NanoKVM, převod videa z DisplayPortu na eink nebo emulátor NESu na Picopadu.

Jak je zvykem, s postupem večera se jistě přejde i k lehce bizarním tématům - kupříkladu, co provedl CrowdStrike, jak zprovoznit Doom na erotických hračkách pro pány, jak vypadá nestandardní 12V USB nebo jak se ztrácí některé části audio záznamů z CD, protože je většina SW neumí správně přečíst.

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 7. srpna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

Cat Quest has been a beloved series for close to a decade now. From offering a unique world in the first game to adding co-op in the second, it has always tried to shake things up for the action-RPG genre. Cat Quest III feels like another switch-up for the series, taking what felt great about previous games and seeking to tell a charming pirate adventure that keeps you surprised. After sinking 15 hours into The Gentlebros' latest adventure, it is safe to say everything about Cat Quest III is fantastic.
The adventure began with us choosing our feline Purrivateer and arriving in the Purribean, an archipelago filled with Pi-rats to defeat who are on the hunt for the North Star Treasure. With our spirit companion, who is also searching for the North Star Treasure, we piloted our ship and ventured across land and sea to find the mythical treasure, defeating Pirate Lords in a variety of dungeons and uncovering a myriad of secrets along the way.

Those familiar with Nintendo hardware and its development codenames will know that the GameCube was once known as the 'Dolphin'. In fact, this is probably one of the more well-known codenames in console history, aside from maybe the 'Revolution' for the Wii and the 'NX' for the Switch.
A prototype of the GameCube had been known to exist, but the only photo of the fabled device was so blurry it could have potentially passed as a UFO or Bigfoot sighting. Now, however, we've got a fresh new look at the 'Nintendo Dolphin' courtesy of ConsoleVariations on social media. The account posted an image of the console with a clear view of the logo and disc tray.

My feelings about the series have settled back from self-righteous fury over its Pentagon-sponsored war-fellating to a quieter, regretful sense that there have maybe been enough Call Of Duty games now, and that it would be nice if we could fill that infamous late October/early November release slot with, I don't know, games about witches instead, or maybe just turn it into a public holiday and spend the week lying on a mattress regarding the ceiling. Still: I've skinned and filleted enough COD in my time to know that Black Ops 6's new "omnimovement" system is going to ruffle as many feathers as it smooths.

I think about this quite often, actually, as someone whose largely offline friends (or Fortnite/FIFA pals) ask me to recommend them a game that's good or interesting. Show them something popular like Elden Ring and, despite its grandeur, it might prove too much in all facets. But Vampire Survivors? It's an easy sell: simple, digestible, ridiculous value.
All of this is to say, One BTN Bosses is from the same school of the easy sell. You can fight bosses with one hand in a packet of pickled onion Space Raiders, after all.

Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is early adoption a chump’s game? I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.
The only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: "Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article." My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cinematic platformer Bionic Bay opens on a scene of a very large egg doing very bad things - easily my third favourite genre of speculative fiction. You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.
It doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.

I randomly watched one of Stay/Night's many anime spin-offs, Fate Zero, during the pandemic lockdowns. It triggered a short-lived obsession with the Fate series - I even dipped a toe in the long-lived mobile gacha game Fate/Grand Order. As such, I think I'm the nearest thing RPS has to a Fate "expert". Join me for a brief and sporadically informed tour of a universe that has Shaped The Culture like few others.

After an initial announcement back in 2020, Bandai Namco has fully revealed Fate/Extra Record, a full remake of the 2010 PSP title Fate/Extra.
Slated for 2025 on Nintendo Switch, Fate/Extra Record is currently only confirmed for Japan, but Bandai Namco's involvement in the Type-Moon-developed dungeon crawler makes a Western release fairly likely. The remake will boast overhauled visuals and a new combat system, both of which can be glimpsed in the new trailer alongside the usual visual novel mechanics and explorative segments.

When the Switch arrived on the scene in 2017, one of the launch titles included 1-2-Switch - a multiplayer party game utilising the many features of the Joy-Con controllers. Somehow, this title got a sequel in 2023 called Everybody 1-2-Switch and while it dropped out of sight pretty quickly, it has now made a surprising comeback.
As highlighted by Vooks.net, more than a year after its release, the sequel has returned to the top spot in Australia as the best-selling video game. Yes, between 22nd - 28th July 2024, it managed to beat heavy hitters like Grand Theft Auto V and outperformed sports titles like NBA 2K24 and EA Sports College Football 25.

The Italian Competition and Market Authority recently launched an antitrust investigation against Google, so the meeting in September will take place under dark clouds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the neat things about Norland's fantasy medievalism is that specialist knowledge is tied to characters. So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having "wise conversations". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like "manners" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They'll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.

It seems just yesterday I was getting very jealous at Matthew Castle (RPS in peace) for getting to preview the sequel to my beloved Shadows Of Amn. Fast forward several turns, Larian’s RPG banger is officially one year old since release, and there’s now a much higher chance that strangers at pubs will understand why my failed romance with Jaheira as a youth was such a deeply heartbreaking experience. Baldur’s Gate 3 itself looks to be done and dusted following the upcoming patch, but Larian now seem to be gearing up for their next charm offensive with a new “community focused” YouTube channel, as well as further teasing their two games currently in development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never learned to drive, but every so often a well-meaning friend tells me I'd be good at it, because 'look, Edwin, you play all those driving games, surely they've taught you the basics'. Friend, here is what driving games have taught me: traffic lights are there for regional flavour; drifting is the same thing as cornering; other cars exist to serve as bumper cushions when overshooting a turn. Certainly, nobody wants a guy whose ideas about automobiles come from 2018's Wreckfest to be involved in the school run. On which note: THQ Nordic have just announced Wreckfest 2 - a fresh helping of destruction derby with fancified visuals and newly animate drivers who flinch and gesticulate when other drivers smash into them. Witness the carnage in the announcement trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a hell of a thing to showcase a remake weeks after kiboshing the developers of the original game. In early July, Gothic creators Piranha Bytes were reportedly shuttered as part of Embracer Group's mad race to trim costs, following their decade-long acquisition binge. Watching THQ Nordic's new Gothic Remake trailer, below, feels a little like watching a vivisectionist parade about in somebody else's skin. Still, the remake's developers Alkimia Interactive aren't to blame for Embracer's fuck-ups, and I am selfishly happy to see Gothic return as an Unreal Engine 5 production - even if I didn't play the original back in 2001.


Sin did play the original game, and in her 2016 retrospective, she paints an absorbing picture of a dark fantasy "microsociety" in which every community "has a reason to exist, a means of providing for itself, a social order, and a long term goal". It's a setup that reminds me of my beloved Roadwarden, even as the sight of grumpy lizards slinking through undergrowth has me silently mouthing "fus roh dah".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Titan Quest 2! Now there's a name you can set your watch by. No colons, no bespoke jargon, no tortuous subtitles like "Gaia's B.O.U.N.T.Y." or "Hyperion's Wild Rumpus" - just the steadying prospect of a titanic quest that, who knows, may involve actual titans. The action-RPG beneath the moniker appears similarly straightforward: it's about following a plot thread through a mythological world in top-down view, smashing Ancient Greek giga-crabs and the like to obtain shinier, pointier varieties of gear. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that there's an endgame in which you farm monsters for crafting materials.


Like Pandora opening her box, but without the accompanying tidal wave of sickness, curses and death, THQ Nordic have released a new trailer that talks you though all of this in detail. Here it is...

Both Noseworthy and Smith appear to have lost their jobs in the course of Bungie's brutal cost-cutting this week, but Payback's cancellation pre-dates the layoffs. Envisaged as a Destiny spin-off, rather than Destiny 3, it was apparently dropped "a while ago".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first World Of Goo was a cheerful parade of goopy engineering with a sense of never-ending novelty (well, never-ending for about four hours). Every level would introduce a new goo type or a twist on the basic bridge-building puzzle that challenged you to get a gaggle of gurgling balls to the nearest pipe. World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes. That pursuit doesn't always result in pleasing new levels, though. There is a "hit and miss" feeling to things this time around. But those hits are hits. For anyone who has spent the last 16 years yearning for more sticky structure-building: I hope you like comically unpredictable fluids.

The Cuphead influence runneth so overly that it feels trite to even point it out, and I do think maybe opting for different music would have served it far better in this case, but you can’t deny that Ghosts n’ Goblins lance throw.

Now Mountaintop Studios, a new studio whose ranks include ex-Bungie and Respawn devs, have chucked themselves into the tactical FPS gauntlet with Spectre Divide. Made with input from former CS pro and streamer Shroud, it looks a bit like a mix of CS and Valorant, but has a big gimmick that sets it apart from the two: you can swap between two bodies.

The latest cuts were necessary to prevent continued losses, says the report, after Bungie missed Sony’s targets following the release of last year’s Lightfall.

Suno and Udio are welcoming discovery, noting that the law has always permitted comparable uses of copyrighted works.

Well, I got up this morning and made a small suburban village with a hospital, school, police station and a cafe in the space of 20 minutes. This is the backwater burg of Edwitherington. Population: 8 - one for every non-residential building in town. Major imports: ornamental lampposts, because I like to cultivate an old-timey mood. Major exports: traffic jams, because I've laid out my village in the form of a small crescent leading back to the freeway, which means that there are two traffic light junctions about 100 metres apart.

It got shut down last year as Activision focused their efforts elsewhere, making the map unplayable. But you can now revisit those bullet-strewn beaches. In theory, anyway. Activision have released it as a 4GB open-source project that can be explored in a 3D model-viewing tool. That's cool. But among their reasons for doing so, there lies a predictably grubby logic: they want people to use the data to train AI.

In my brief time with massive Fallout 4 mod Fallout London, I’ve read a delightful terminal entry about a scientist who named his favourite radiated shrew “Big Dave,” thwacked several of said Radshrews with a walking stick, gulped down some expired pink wafers, and been informed of train delays due to “leaves on the track.”
“A British transport joke!” I said to myself, marinating in the sufficient amount of crown-mandated mild amusement. “Our organ-floggingly expensive yet vital public services are crap!” I was having a good time. Then the game public transported me straight to my desktop, and continued to do so at regular intervals over the next few hours, ranging from “just as this conversation was getting good” to “just as my save was about to load.” My upper lip almost quivered, I tell you.

Bungie are also transferring a further 155 roles to parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment, and are spinning out an untitled incubation project - an "action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe" - to form a new PlayStation studio.

The developers have just released a nine-minute explainer video, which teems with scenes of gimp suits, winged vans, rocket-propelled pinkies, vicious card battles against small excited dogs, and a surprisingly in-depth management component. There are bits that make me think of Batman: Arkham City, and bits that make me think of Pathologic, and bits that make me think of Yakuza - a combination fit to burst the brain. Quick, before your brain bursts, watch the video for yourself below.

Don't laugh: I know you do this too. Kletka isn't helping: created by in404, it's a horror scavenging game reminiscent of Lethal Company and Golden Light, in which you ponderously plummet through the layers of an "endless" post-Soviet Gigastructure, scrounging fuel, parts and provender for an elevator that wants to eat you.

This has less to do with GTA in itself, Vermeij says, than with the fact that changes in computing capacity today simply aren't as dramatic as in the days of the very first PlayStation. It's becoming rare, he suggests, that you see a "jump" akin to GTA going 3D.

We're talking about new guild assignments, new gadgets, better world generation, a new world, new monsters. The list is enormous and designed expressly around improved replayability - take that, Las Vegas Dome.

Additional screenshots suggest this frog later acquires wings. Like a captive Generation Game host, I am helpless but to shout out more incredible sights as they flutter past on the conveyor belt of pure flippin' videogame before me. It’s got dance parties with horrible gorilla aliens. It’s got building, namely the Statue Of Liberty out of goop, just as George Washington’s goop clone intended. It’s also got just sitting on a bench, enjoying some lovely serene space scenery.  Feast your famished face on the trailer.

As such I spend most train journeys these days lurking between carriages, trolling the door sensors and scowling furiously at anybody who visits the loo. But now, thanks to the obscene magic of video games, I can get my fill of authorial locomotivation once again.

Since releasing in 2022, Torn Banner have lavished the player base with free horses, angry peasants, and most recently, the Regicide update - hosting a climatic tete-a-tete between two angry crownmen. With work on No More Room In Hell 2 well underway though, Torn Banner have decided to call it on Chiv 2, which they now consider “feature complete.”

Original story:
Earlier this month it was reported that Skibidi Toilet, the YouTube phenomenon, may be heading to film and television via director Michael Bay. Now Invisible Narratives, a production company co-owned by Bay, has apparently sent a DMCA takedown notice to Garry Newman, citing the large number of Skibidi Toilet games and assets advertised within Garry's Mod.

Skibidi Toilet uses assets derived from Half-Life 2, however, and owes a lot to the Garry's Mod machinima scene. And the animation's original creator, best known as DaFuqBoom, is claiming innocence over the DMCA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you miss Myst, but feel only vertigo and disgust for its recent 3D reinventions, you might find yourself salivating over first-person point-and-clicker Neyyah - a Mystalike or more precisely, Rivenalike from Defy Reality Entertainment and MicroProse, which has just been dated for early access release on 27th August. Real-time movement and exploration? Rotatable polygons? Pfff. These are firmly pre-rendered worlds, just like Grandpappy Atrus used to bake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a new version of AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF) available to try, and good news for Radeon GPU owners: it is drastically, almost comically better than the original version. Whereas AMD’s first take on driver-level frame generation – the same kind of framerate-roiding image generation trickery that FSR 3 and DLSS 3 are based around – came yoked to a barrel of jittering, stuttering, and visual artefacting issues, Fluid Motion Frames 2 is as smooth and you’d like. Without compromising on the ability to deploy it in theoretically any DirectX 11- or 12-based game, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British comedy is too often defined by its relationship to America: either as merely irony and sarcasm, which we're told Americans don't understand, or as a sprightly ideas factory for works such as The Office, which Americans can bless by re-making at scale.

Peel back the curtains of American cultural hegemony however and you may find the true pulsing core of British comedy that lies beneath: innuendo. No American network is in a bidding war to import Vic and Bob or remake Bottom, and Carry On and Benny Hill are assumed to be anachronisms in our modern times, but Thank Goodness You're Here! enters the conversation with a nudge and a wink. It's a cheeky 2-3 hour adventure through a small northern town, and it's here to educate the entire world of our nation's obsession with sausages and bare bottoms.

It's being developed by Rotoscope Studios and it's a low-poly, 90s-inspired mix of dystopian RPG, survival, third and first-person shooter, with some roguelike bits slapped in there, as well. Whew, that's a lot. Potentially too much. But hey, I am here for something ambitious and interesting, of which it ticks both boxes.

Well, funnel all that anticipation into your mouse-clicking finger, because developers Square Enix have just put up a playable demo of the bright JRPG on Steam. I'm not sure how much the demo offers, as we're only told it includes "a section of the story, battles and exploration." But that's better than nothing, and with a full month before release, you have plenty of time to scope it out.

A Roomba capable of tunnelling through miles of procedurally generated, monster-infested crust so as to reorganise the Earth's core and bring about its ultimate objective - a sparkling living room. I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation. There are sprawling underground ecosystems to discover, yes, weird plants to harvest, fractious clumps of tentacles to appraise, avoid or slaughter. But all of these things are contemptible details to be swept up and bagged and thrown in the dumpster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller has posted a lengthy blog on Steam about the transition from 6v6 player matches in the first Overwatch to 5v5 in the poorly received free-to-play sequel. It's a juicy read for armchair designers and lapsed Overwatchers like myself, packing in analysis of class roles and the shift from the free choice of heroes to single hero picks and enforced team compositions.
In broad strokes, Keller summarises how the Overwatch experience has drifted away from "player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players". It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now "exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl, the beautifully grotty sci-fi shooter sequel from Ukrainian studio GSC Game World, has been delayed once again. It’s a relatively good-spirited delay, though: first off, it’s not that long, with the previously planned September 5th launch pushed back just a few weeks to November 20th. There’s also clever little in-universe announcement video (one which gives the fourth wall a study kick on its way out), and an accompanying promise of a meaty "developer deep dive video", set to reveal much more of the game’s radioactive hellscape on August 12th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The immersive sim has seen a revival in recent years. Not only from larger studios like Arkane, keeping the faith alive with their time loops and space stations, but also from a bunch of smaller developers bravely exploring a typically ambitious genre. RPS has always had an affinity for these systemically luxuriant simulations, historically lauding the likes of the original Deus Ex as the best game ever made. But given everything that has come since, is that still the case? Only one way to find out: make a big list.

Let me start again. Animal caretaking horror game Zoochosis is about being a stressed-out zookeeper in a hideous zoo where the giraffes have tendrils coming out of their chests and the kangaroos have rows of chattering teeth in their marsupial pouch. There, got it right in the end. We've known about the development of this terror-heavy tourist attraction since its announcement early this year. But now the upcoming horror sim has been given an autumn release date in a new trailer.

That’s thanks to initial production units not being up to standards, an AMD executive admitted, and comes shortly after rivals Intel copped to a potentially chip-killing fault in their latest Core processors. Ah well, there’s always – oh, wait. No. Those are the only two.

But, despite all appearances, this one isn’t actually turn-based at all. A tiley, tiny real time strategy then? Aye, and one that’s actually pretty frantic as it happens. Missions are snappy, intense skirmishes. You’ll fight off waves while trying to protect your useless, freeloading command vehicle. This threat, combined with on-the-fly tactical consider-me-do's like utilising cover and keeping rock-paper-scissors matchups in your favour ends up spawning something quite distinct. Please, do stomp on, preferably with less hypens for all our sakes.

And for some, it'll deliver what's needed: a fairly good time. A time marked by a loop that does hack 'n slash, management, and a dash of base repairs to an average degree. For me, though, and possibly many others, I simply don't think this mix ever truly captures what makes even the simplest of tower defence games so captivating.

The series was more satirical than King's Quest, less preachy than Police Quest, and not quite as adult as Leisure Suit Larry. Spearheaded by Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe - a pair of devs who called themselves "Two Guys from Andromeda" - Space Quest was renowned for its humour, and there was a nice sense of progression throughout most of the series, with Roger Wilco leveling up from working class spaceman to the head of his own Star Trek ship.

Even if the fallen culture you’ll defend against waves of gribblies offers fascinatingly few concrete details on its origins, there’s a lithe and impressionistic otherworldliness and use of colour in Cataclismo’s art that evokes unearthed layers of history. Also, everyone is just so gosh darn likeable, with their foppish hats plopped atop stretched bodies, and dialogue that remains resolute, chirpy, and eager, even when you’re click-marching these poor folk straight to their deaths.
Still, none of this will stop me will sacrificing every last man, woman, and child of these beleaguered warriors if it means preserving a single one of my immaculately crafted staircases.
