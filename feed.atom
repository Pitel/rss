        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearly two years after the project was teased, Skydance New Media and Marvel have fully unveiled its upcoming game starring Black Panther and Captain America. Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra was revealed in a story trailer, along with its release year. 


Coming from Amy Hennig's studio, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra follows the Captain and Black Panther in an adventure set during World War II. 


The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5. And if the trailer itself is any indication, it'll look quite fabulous indeed. We witness an occupied Paris in the winter as snow gently falls on the rooftops that Azzuri, the WWII-era Black Panther, scampers over. The game art suggests we may visit Wakanda as well. There are hints of action and stealth in the video, but let's not gloss over the storytelling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the new things added into Stardew Valley with the 1.6 update is the Mastery System, which sees you using your EXP to unlock special items. Each category has its own items, but through the Foraging Mastery you can get the recipe for a Mystic Tree Seed.


The Mystic Tree Seed can be planted to grow a ‘special tree’ that can be tapped, using the Tapper, to get Mystic Syrup. The Syrup sells for 1000 Gold, so it’s worth getting if you want to make some money. 


How to get the Mystic Tree Seed recipe

You’ll need to fill up your exp bar in order to purchase a Mastery and each Mastery costs 5,000 more exp than the one before it, so if you’re aiming to unlock the Mystic Tree Seed recipe then I’d recommend choosing Foraging as your first Mastery. As well as the Seed recipe, you also get a Treasure Totem recipe and the ability to find Golden treasure boxes, so it’s well worth it.


To increase your exp, simply play the game; everything provides exp, from planting to battling within the Miines, so you’ll soon get enough exp to purchase a Mastery. 


How to craft the Mystic Tree Seed

To craft a Mystic Tree Seed, you’ll need some other tree seeds:



5 Acorn Seeds


5 Maple Seeds


5 Pine Cones


5 Mahogany Seeds



Once you’ve combined these Seeds, you can plant your tree and wait for it to mature, then use the Tapper to get that liquid gold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stardew Valley 1.6 added four new seed types and vegetables for you to farm, with Summer Squash being the Summer season's variant. However, while you can easily purchase crops like parsnips and potatoes for Pierre's shop, the same can't be said for these four new ones. Here's how to find Summer Squash in Stardew Valley.


Where to find Summer Squash seeds in Stardew Valley


You can find Summer Squash seeds by digging grass and artifact spots during Summer. While regular dig spots have higher odds of dropping artifacts and books, grass tufts frequently drop seeds. You can harvest artifact and grass spots using a hoe to obtain one or two seeds.


Screenshot by Destructoid


While artifact spots appear as worms coming out of the ground, grass spots look like blades of green grass flowing in the wind. They can appear anywhere on the map, including all terrain types, but I've had the best luck spotting them in the Secret Forest. Nonetheless, you can encounter them anywhere, particularly along the paths leading to the mountains and through the bus stop route.


After obtaining your Summer Squash seeds, you can grow them after tending to the crop for six in-game days. Since it's a Summer crop, you'll have to plant it during this season, or else the plant will die. Unlike crops like Powdermelon, Summer Squash continues to produce after its first harvest, so your best bet is farming for seeds within the first few days of the season to get the most out of your plants. 


After growing your first Summer Squash, you can use the seed maker to gain more seeds. That way, you don't have to return to the forest or mountains to search for more grass spots. Alternatively, you can sell them to make money, stick the squash in a preserves jar, or eat them raw to regain energy.

On another, slightly ominous note, if you talk to the Wizard on a green rain day, he will tell you he has ‘special matters to attend to’.


Green rain might look bizarre, but don’t worry, it’s not acid or slime falling from the sky. In fact, green rain can be particularly helpful when you’re searc…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are four new crops in Stardew Valley as of the 1.6 update and one of them, Carrots, might seem elusive at first but they’re pretty easy to find once you know where to look. There’s a couple of ways to get Carrot Seeds, so let’s look into it.


Carrots aren’t worth much, selling for between 35 and 70 Gold depending on their quality level, but they are good for keeping your energy up, especially early into a new playthrough. Carrots provide 75 energy at a base level, increasing at higher quality levels. Carrots are a Spring crop, take three days to grow, and provide one Carrot per seed.


The best and easiest way to get Carrot Seeds is from the Raccoon’s wife, once she arrives. She sells all four of the new crops in exchange for the kind of thing you’d expect Racoons to love. Unfortuna…]]></summary>

A 2D platformer from Nautilus Games, Everdeep Aurora begins on the surface, where a ruptured crimson moon fills the sky with blazing meteors. That menacing moon is the first hint of Bloodborne, obviously. The second is the lamp-lit, locked-up house to one side, whose unseen occupant tells you to get lost, adding that they don’t believe all this crazy talk about the apocalypse. 


I thought at once of the wealthier residents of Yharnam, feasting and laughing hysterically behind the shutters of their fancy townhouses on the night of the Hunt. There are no pitchfork-wielding mobs or werewolves stalking the vicinity, however. But there is a frog by a campfire, who tells you that everybody else has sought shelter underground, and hands you a drill so you can follow them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skydance New Media’s mysterious World War 2 Marvel game has a title: Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra. It also has its first trailer and a release window.
First announced in 2022, the game stars Captain America and Black Panther Azzuri, who is the grandfather of T’Challa. The trailer shows them pursuing the mutual goal of taking down the Nazis/Hydra, though for their own personal reasons. Hailing from different worlds, neither is particularly fond of the other's methods, which draws them into conflict. The game also stars Gabriel Jones of the Howling Commandos and Wakanda spy leader Nanali. First revealed at GDC, check out its first cinematic trailer below. 


Marvel 1943 is a linear single-player experience where you’ll occupy the roles of all four characters at various points, providing different perspectives on the narrative and the war. The project is led by Skydance president Amy Hennig, best known as the principle writer of the Uncharted franchise. 
Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is coming in 2025, though platforms are currently unknown. You can learn more about how Skydance is approaching the game’s storytelling by reading our 2022 interview feature with Amy Hennig and Skydance's story consultant, Marc Bernardin.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While exploring the Mines in Stardew Valley, you might come across something called a Trinket. There are a number of new Trinkets that have been added with the 1.6 update, including some very useful ones to aid you during combat. One of them is the Fairy Box. 


Trinkets are akin to having Summoning powers, calling useful beings to your side who will aid you during battle within the Mines. This particular Trinket, the Fairy Box, will heal you if your health begins to drop and that can be incredibly useful, particularly at deeper levels of the Mines. 


How to get the Fairy Box


Screenshot by Destructoid


The Fairy Box, along with other Trinkets, is obtained by defeating enemies within the Mines. It doesn’t seem to matter which mobs you are taking down, I’ve received Trinkets by defeating everything from Slimes to Shadow Brutes. Each Trinket has a unique ability, but the Fairy Box’s healing ability makes it the best for diving deep into the Mines. 


How to equip the Fairy Box


Screenshot by Destructoid


As with all Trinkets, you equip a Fairy Box simply by placing it into the star slot within your inventory (the top one on the Right side of your character portrait). Once you’ve equipped it, you’ll find a Fairy following you, boosting your health if it starts to dip. 


I would recommend not relying on the Fairy Box to sustain you alone — you should still take food and medicines with you if you want to survive against large mobs.

Utilising a roguelike structure in which you can gain upgrades by purchasing various beverages, you'll be gunning down foes left and right with gameplay that isn't too dissimilar from Hotline Miami itself.

Here is how to update Stardew Valley mods easily so you do not disrupt your game in any way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 is a treasure trove of live-service goodness, ranging from a player-friendly "battle pass" to an ever-evolving storyline that continues from the original game, albeit 100 years in the future. Hotfixes come part and parcel here, and the latest one may be a huge boon for mech users.


Notably, even though Helldivers 2's exosuit mechs were a hotly anticipated addition ahead of their bombastic release, they proved to be fairly fragile in the grand scheme of things. Things have been so bad that despite the mechs' extremely destructive capabilities, players have been mocking their cardboard-tier defenses. This problem was exacerbated further by an issue with the mechs' rocket pods, wherein turning too quickly and firing a missile off would insta-gib the mech and the poor Helldiver c…]]></summary>

People play games for a variety of reasons. It could be that you want to experience a few thrills, get lost in a world beyond your imagination, or simply relax and wind down after the stresses of day-to-day life. Some games, however, are designed to test the very limits of your patience, inducing a level of anxiety that many would rather avoid at all costs. If you’re someone who thrives on tension and welcomes relentless challenges like a warm hug, then Krimson might just be the game for you.
Everything about developer CryingPsycho's platformer, from its visual design to its audio, has been designed to be a total assault on the senses, and for good reason. It takes place in a rather abstract depiction of hell, and your job is to simply make it through each level in one piece. We say “simply”, but nothing about Krimson is particularly simple. It’s an exceptionally tough game that, like Super Meat Boy and Celeste, utilises death as a means to educate the player on how to overcome its myriad challenges.

It incentivizes you to fish, farm, or forage even after maxing your skills. Here's a complete Stardew Valley Mastery guide, including how to use and redeem your points.


How to get Mastery Points in Stardew Valley


Unlocking Mastery points requires maxing all five of your skills to level ten. Once you reach level ten in all five skills and claim your last few perk points, you'll find the Mastery level bar with a hefty experience requirement in your skills menu. You'll gain Mastery progress by gaining experience through your skills and reading skill books for experience points.

According to a report from IGN, Bungie's shakeup goes further into more than just Destiny. In a leadership change, Marathon's creative leadership, specifically game director Christopher Barret, is being replaced by former Valorant director Joe Ziegler. This has been corroborated further by Ziegler's subsequent Twitter announcement, where he confirmed that he has been the head of Marathon for the past nine months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma 2 is an RPG of many admirable qualities. I’m especially attached to my Arisen’s current pair of Pawns, one of whom speaks with the wonderfully stretched intonations of a pitch-shifted Matt Berry. Sadly, none of its achievements pertain to technical fidelity. While decent-looking, Dragon’s Dogma 2 takes some serious hardware to maintain consistently smooth performance, with lowered quality settings lending only the most limp-wristed of helping hands.
DLSS and FSR 3 upscaling are more effective, but this is one game where powering through the worst of its stuttering and framerate drops will take more than a musclebound graphics card. Not for the first time with an RE Engine game, Dragon’s Dogma 2 appears severely CPU-limited, so it really does demand a fully-upgraded rig to ward off sluggishness – especially at higher resolutions.
Improving performance isn’t a completely hopeless endeavour, but besides the FPS wobbles, there are some settings oddities that need navigating as well. I’ll cover all that and more in this guide; even if we can’t fix Dragon’s Dogma 2 ourselves, at least we can better understand its strangeness.

The Dragon's Dogma 2 experience is, essentially, how I remember its predecessor Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. To me, DD2 feels like a remaster of the first, except it looks nicer, is more expansive, and features some rejigs to things like your AI pals.
Not that any of this is a bad thing! In fact, DD2's closeness to the original makes it just as much of a joy as the first, where your grand adventure isn't only grander, it's still at the whims of a world governed by chaotic physics and the passage of time. Quirks remain, for good and bad, but ultimately this is an RPG where you make travel plans and the game does it best to dash them. It never gets old.

Creating a sequel to a 12-year-old game is never an easy task.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball Sparking Zero had a big coming out party in the form of a 13-minute gameplay presentation that gave fans a nice look at its moment-to-moment combat. Bandai Namco showed off what's new, what's staying the same, and even revealed more characters joining the roster. 
Naturally, Goku and Vegeta square off to show off Sparking Zero’s combat. The 3D fighter retains the familiar behind-the-back style of its predecessors, but graphically speaking, the flashy ki blasts and transformations look better than ever. 


The presentation introduces four new mechanics. First up is Skill Count, a number that rises as you execute moves during the battle and is then spent to trigger special abilities. Revenge Counter lets players retaliate with a big attack in the midst of absorbing damage. Super Perception is a parry-type move that lets players deflect an attack at the last moment (such as Goku smacking away Vegeta’s Galick Gun), but doing this spends Skill Count points. Lastly, Vanishing Assaults are teleport-based attacks designed to close the gap at mid-range to keep the pressure on your opponent.
Dragon Ball Sparking Zero looks to have a massive roster of fighters (many of them variations of Goku and Vegeta), and the following characters are joining the line-up:
Broly (Super Saiyan Full Power)
Burter
Dyspo
Hit
Jeice
Kakunsa
Kale (Super Saiyan Berserk)
Master Roshi (Max Power)
Nappa
Super Trunks
Toppo

Dragon Ball Sparking Zero still doesn’t have a release window, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's deeply frustrating and disappointing when games get pulled from store shelves due to licenses expiring, and too few ever return. So it's great news that almost four years after Sega stopped selling Obsidian's fascinating spy thriller RPG Alpha Protocol on Steam due to music rights expiring, it has returned to sale on GOG. I'm always surprised that Alpha Protocol hasn't reached serious cult classic status because, as much as parts are distinctly wonky, the globetrotting sneak-o-shooter fizzes with ideas for intense dialogue, branching plot, and reputation systems with consequences. You do feel like a spy going up against the world, backed up only by shifty allies and a ridiculous pair of giant sunglasses.

Alpha Protocol was first released in 2010, where it gained a cult following. Reception by the press was less warm, however. Writing for Destructoid at the time, James Stephanie Sterling went as far as giving the game a 2. Ouch. Despite this, I played it, and while it has its issues, I still look back at it fondly.


It definitely has a myriad of problems. Like many of the era’s Obsidian games, it had more bugs than bones. The narrative, while simple at its core, was heavily choice-driven and would branch in all directions. In that way, it was over-ambitious and tied its own …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a variety of different eggs that can be obtained in Stardew Valley and each of them hatches a bird to match its color. One egg is obtained through a random event involving a flying visit from a witch, yes you read that right. Here’s how to get a Void Egg. 


There are two Villagers who count Void Eggs among their loved gifts:



Sebastian 


Krobus



So it's worth knowing how to get them. Unfortunately, they cannot be purchased, and, for the most part, getting your first one is purely up to chance. 


How to get a Void Egg

For a chance at getting a Void Egg, you need to make sure you have a Big or Deluxe Chicken Coop and that there is at least one empty space in the building, fit for a Chicken. If you’ve ticked these boxes, you just have to wait for a Witch to pay her very literal flying visit. This event has a 1% chance of occurring, so don’t be discouraged if she doesn’t show up immediately.


This Witch is the one who leaves a Void Egg in your Coop. If you see a cutscene of a Witch flying over once you end a day, run to your Coop in the morning and you’ll find a Void Egg waiting for you.


Once you’ve got a Void Egg, it’ll need to be incubated. To do this, you’ll need to put it inside the Hatchery in a level 2 coop. Once it’s hatched, simply take it out of the Hatchery and you’ll have a shiny new Void Chicken who will lay more Void Eggs. 


What is a Void Egg used for in Stardew Valley

Other than giving them as a gift, you can also make Void Mayonnaise which, after the 1.6 update, you can now drink. I wouldn’t recommend it though, as it actually removes 75 Energy. Your best bet is to farm for Void Mayonnaise, as it sells for 275 Gold each.

However, aging it within a Cask can increase its worth to 600 Gold.

Casks are automatically available once you upgrade your Farmhouse to level three and unlock the Cellar. The Cellar comes with 33 Casks already in place, though you can place as many as 189 down there. The recipe for additional Casks also unlocks automatically upon unlocking the Cellar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even those of you who don't play Stardew Valley will almost certainly be aware that the big 1.6 update went live yesterday. It adds a ton of new content to the game, seemingly well worth the wait. As such, it will surprise exactly zero people to learn that this has resulted in a massive boost in the game's popularity.


As noted by SteamDB, Stardew Valley's new patch has led to a jump in concurrent players on Steam. The screenshot from the Twitter/X post below shows it peaked at 102,774 players, setting a new record for the game. However, even this is outdated, as that figure has since risen to 146,159, according to the most recent data.




It's also jumped a pretty hefty 90 places on Steam, where it's currently sitting at number nine on the Top Sellers list. This will most likely change as time goes on, but one can imagine Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone will be waking up today as a rather happy developer.


Console and mobile patches coming soon


As for what version 1.6 actually contains, it's a seriously humongous list of changes, new editions, bug fixes, quality-of-life improvements, and the lot. You're honestly best off checking out the changelog on the Stardew Valley website, but be prepared to get a bit of soreness from all that scrolling. It's a huge update, is what I'm saying.


Examples of some of the new features include (but are definitely not limited to): a new festival, a new farm type, the ability to add multiple pets, winter outfits for NPCs, a bookseller who "comes to town twice a season," and a shed load more.


Unfortunately, the update is only available on PC for now. Barone has said Xbox is "incoming soon," so those of us who play on console and iOS/Android will need to wait a little bit longer.

There are no newbies in the top 40 this time around. Last week's surprise Switch hit Unicorn Overlord has seen a pretty substantial fall from 7th to 25th, while the previous gold medallist, WWE 2K24, has dropped to third. Of course, this means that EA Sports FC 24 and Hogwarts Legacy take the top two spots again — that didn't last long, eh?

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they've been chewing over. Today, to celebrate Super Metroid's 30th anniversary, Ollie sings the praises of the game's enduring foreboding atmosphere...

The Metroid series is perhaps best known for its wonderful atmosphere and keen sense of isolation. In addition to its consistently strong structure, interconnected locations, and formidable antagonists, its oppressive yet irresistibly intriguing atmosphere is one of the reasons why the games gained such a loyal following, and why it continues to become more successful as time goes on (albeit more slowly compared to other Nintendo franchises).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's highly publicized acquisition of Blizzard has had wide-reaching effects, and while some of them have been quite awful, this month showcases one of the upsides. Diablo IV, one of Blizzard's big 2023 releases, comes to Xbox Game Pass late next week, on March 28. We enjoyed the game quite a bit at launch, calling it a "massive and deeply engrossing action RPG," so if you've been waiting to check it out, now is a good time to do so.
This month also includes a trio of games built around cars, though the three are each very different. F1 23 simulates the realism and intensity of Formula 1 racing, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 is an arcade racer full of child-like wonder, and Open Roads (which will launch on Game Pass) is a quieter, narrative-driven game about a mother and her daughter going on a road trip. Maybe they'll help me on my journey of learning how to drive.
Here's the rest of the line-up:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just when I thought I was past being surprised by games adding battle royale modes, Blizzard today announced one for World Of Warcraft. Plunderstorm will drop 60 pirates onto the Arathi Highlands to fight monsters, loot chests, level up, acquire abilities, and beat the hell out of each other as a storm closes in. It's initially due to run only for several weeks and will use wholly separate characters, though you can unlock cosmetics for your main wizards.

The classic Dreamcast shooter Rainbow Cotton is getting a full remake on the Nintendo Switch, and it's launching soon on 9th May, 2024.
Boasting revamped visuals, improved game mechanics, and a new 2-player local multiplayer mode, the remake is said to be a faithful recreation of the original while bringing it in line with modern standards. To demonstrate this, ININ has released a debut trailer to make sure you're clued up on the definitions of emulation, remaster, and remake. It's always nice to get a reminder, eh?

Nintendo's Princess Peach: Showtime! is just around the corner, launching on the Switch on 22nd March, 2024.
While our own review isn't too far off, the folks over at Famitsu have posted their thoughts on the upcoming action-adventure (thanks, Gematsu and Ryokutya2089). The good news is that it seems to have proven a hit with critics, though it doesn't reach the heights of some of Nintendo's most prestigious Switch games, gaining a total score of 33/40. The split for this one is relatively even at 8 / 8 / 9 / 8.

As the name implies, it's a bigger, bolder and more ambitious take on their still very popular sandbox game TerraTech, but according to Payload's founder and CEO Russ Clarke, they're viewing this new version as more of a successor to TerraTech than a full-bodied sequel. "The overall quality of experience is really a huge leap forward," Clarke told me during a press presentation last week. "We're not calling it a sequel because we felt that making it a sequel would be a bit too constraining." Rather, it's "more of a reimagining" of the original game, says Clarke, with a change in engine and fresh investment from Tencent allowing them to reach the full potential of their original vision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, after months of rumors and speculation, LEGO (in partnership with Wizards of the Coast) revealed the first full look at the new Dungeons & Dragons-themed building set entitled Red Dragon’s Tale. The large 3,745-piece set is set to release on April 1 in LEGO stores and to those in the LEGO Insiders program. Everyone else can roll for initiative on snagging a set on April 4, for the price of $359.99.
Produced through the popular LEGO Ideas platform, where fans are able to submit their own build concepts that are then refined and produced as official sets, the final set includes a full dungeon and tower, a tavern, and six minifigures (including an Orc Rogue, Gnome Fighter, Elf Wizard, and Dwarf Cleric). Builders also get several iconic D&D monsters, including an owlbear, beholder, displacer beast, and, of course, the red dragon Cinderhowl, who acts as the centerpiece of the set.

Interestingly, LEGO is offering an actual D&D adventure book to LEGO Insiders as a free digital download or as a paperback book that can be purchased with 2,7000 Insider points. That same book will show up on D&D Beyond (Wizards of the Coast’s digital hub for D&D) complete with characters sheets and digital dice. Presumably, the idea is that you could play out the adventure with the included LEGO minifigs and monsters as the miniatures used on the table, which is a pretty slick way for dedicated players to capitalize on the completed build.
In addition to the larger set, LEGO also revealed plans for a full line of D&D-themed minifigures, launching in September 2024.

In this sequel to 2016's alternately wistful and frenzied action-RPG, you are a debonair-looking sod with a hoverboard, paraglider, blades and guns, sent out into the procedurally generated realms of the Overgrowth to kill Abyss Kings, eat stat boosts and extract with loot.
The aforesaid hoverboard and glider, together with the streaking neon visual direction, suggest a game of fluid acrobatics, akin to the studio's last release Solar Ash, which, to quote Ed's review, "has you rollerblade around shattered worlds like a post apocalyptic gazelle on wheels". Perhaps that game exists deeper within Hyper Light Breaker, but during my 20 minutes with the game at GDC, I found myself stopping and starting and struggling to build momentum using a combat system that felt both deliberately challenging and stilted.

Developed by Cyan Worlds, a team led by the masterminds of the original game, Riven is being remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. First announced in 2022, the game is promised to be a faithful homage that leverages modern tech to allow for immersive visuals, free movement, expanded storytelling, and new puzzles. Check out its latest teaser trailer below. 


Riven: The Sequel to Myst was first released in 1997 and has been hailed as a PC classic of the era. It's so beloved that an existing fan-driven remake, The Starry Expanse Project, was already in the works when Cyan Worlds announced this remake. Recognizing their efforts, Cyan Worlds worked with The Starry Expanse to incorporate their efforts into this official remake. 
Outside of PC, it's unclear which platforms, VR or otherwise, Riven will target. To keep up with similar projects, check out our Big List of Upcoming Video Game Remakes.]]></summary>

Eight years after its official launch, Stardew Valley remains one of the most popular games on the market right now, which is no surprise; whether you're marrying a neighbor, farming crops, or toiling away in the mines, it's a game with something for everyone. Its creator, solo developer ConcernedApe, has updated it with plenty of free patches over the years, adding multiplayer, new farm types, and more, but when he moved on to work on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier, the Stardew updates came to an end. That is, until today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Balatro, the hit poker-inspired roguelike deckbuilder, has hit 1 million sales within its first month of release. Publisher Playstack also revealed a mobile version is in development.
Created by solo developer LocalThunk, Balatro is a roguelike tasking players to play poker hands to fulfill score criteria and advance a series of rounds. Along the way, they’ll spend money to augment their deck with new cards with special effects while collecting powerful Jokers that bestow a wide range of passive and trigger abilities.  
The game has earned widespread acclaim and popularity since launching on February 20. I awarded it a 9.5 out of 10, writing in my review, “Balatro is an ingenious and entertaining roguelike and one of my favorite games of the year. Playing it has become a near-obsession; everything feels perfectly designed to encourage you to keep trying because that next run could be the run of your life. Even after hours of play, I still can’t overcome Balatro’s biggest challenge: putting it down.”


In a press release announcing the 1 million milestone, LocalThunk writes, 
“I'm so grateful to all the players and people that have made this happen. I still can't grasp the response to this game, and I am overjoyed that so many people have been able to have fun with my silly creation. I'm so fortunate that I can continue working on my passion as a career. Thank you!”
Balatro is currently available for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. There’s no release window for the impending mobile versions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyan Worlds today announced plans to launch their fancy real-time 3D remake of Riven later this year, coming with support for both VR cybergoggles and standard meatspace screens. Riven: The Sequel To Myst was the 1997 sequel to Myst, the 1993 pre-rendered adventure game which sold a million CD-ROM drives and launched a thousand specks of spittle from John Walker's mouth. The remake previously had a longwinded name of its own, Riven: New Discoveries Of The Lost D'ni Empire, but now is simply named Riven. They should rebrand again and call it Riven: The Sequel To The Myst Remake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detective Edward Carnby looks very different these days, and not only because he’s made of a lot more polygons. Gone are the professorial waistcoat and bow tie of his angular 1992 incarnation, replaced instead by the grubby suit of a life-bruised 1930s noir PI, complete with hipflask of brandy for when the stress of being unaccompanied with the lights out gets too much.
Carnby isn’t the only one who’s transformed in this reboot of Alone in the Dark, the classic survival horror avant la lettre, either. Veterans will find plenty of callbacks and familiar names as they poke around its Louisiana manor house – talk of the Pregzt Shipping Company might raise an eyebrow, for instance, as may the gnarled tree filling much of the conservatory. But like these, everything here is remixed, rewritten, relocated. Indeed, Decerto house is no longer empty but a ‘home for the mentally fatigued’, while player characters Carnby and Emily Hartwood now arrive together, since she’s hired him to help check on her uncle, a long-term resident who may be in danger.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's always room for one more good one.
About five years ago, solo developer Evan Tor set out to make a new game in the crowded Metroidvania genre called Rebel Transmute. Tor launched a Kickstarter in 2022 to secure the funding to get the game over the line, and after a successful campaign and development period, the title has finally made it to consoles and PC. Rebel Transmute may not be a particularly innovative new entry in the genre, but what it lacks in novel ideas it more than makes up for in polish and quality. Rebel Transmute is great comfort food for the dedicated Metroidvania fan, and we’d suggest you pay attention to it.
Rebel Transmute places you in the role of Moon Mikono, a “space scrapper” in search of her mother who’s gone missing in action. Her search brings her to the isolated planet of Terra 6, which was once home to an extensive research facility helmed by the mysterious Foray corporation that her mother worked for. An EMP causes Moon’s ship to crash on Terra 6, and she wakes up twelve years later in a hostile and decrepit environment where something has since clearly gone wrong. Moon’s mother appears to be alive and somewhere on the planet, so our unlikely heroine sets out on a journey to find her and figure out what happened to the facility.

If you cast your mind back to the April 2023 Indie World showcase, you might remember the reveal of Animal Well — a pretty but punishing pixel art platformer being published by YouTubers videogamedunkey and Leahbee's Bigmode. Well, that very game has now got a release date, and it's coming to Switch on 9th May.
Animal Well is one of those games that brings vibes by the bucketload. You play as a little blob, making your way through a gorgeous pixel art labyrinth and collecting items to help you along your way. The only catch is that this labyrinth is filled with animals. And a lot of them are going to want to eat you.

Clearly, it was also a question on the minds on Japanese indie developers ThinkGames Inc, who have just announced their debut game Valiant Tactics EX. The 38-second long reveal trailer paints quite an enticing picture ahead of its Steam launch on March 29th, and that's not even the half of it either. For Valiant Tactics EX isn't just an anime Total War-like. It's also a whopping great deckbuilding game.

We love a good retro-style puzzler here at Nintendo Life, and the upcoming Isles of Sea and Sky looks like it could be a doozy. The only downside right now is that it's not confirmed for the Switch.. yet.
With a release on Steam coming at some point in 2024, developer Cicada Games has a console release in its sights, stating "We are interested in launching on other platforms including the Nintendo Switch" in the official press kit. We certainly hope it does make its way to the Switch, because it looks like a lovely litle puzzler in which you explore an open world and complete a variety of puzzles in whichever order you see fit.

One common response to the arrival of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown on the Switch was to wait until a sale. And now, just months after its release, this slick and stylish "must-play" has received a 40% price cut on the eShop in the US and Canada.
As highlighted by Nintendo of America, this reduces the digital price of the 2.5D platformer from $49.99 to just $29.99. You can also save some money on the digital deluxe edition (featuring some in-game content and more), which is now $35.99 instead of $59.99. This sale runs until 1st April. If we hear anything about a sale in other regions, we'll let you know.

Before last week's troubled launch, Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection was already making headlines for "mistakenly" featuring footage of a community-made mod in an official trailer.
At the time, developer Aspyr said the game did not include "any code or content" from "uncredited sources", but now traces of the same Asajj Ventress mod by 'iamshaymin' have been discovered in the release build of the game.

When Nintendo confirmed the release dates of some upcoming Switch games recently, certain eagle-eyed fans noted how as of the next financial year, the company would seemingly be shifting release dates from Friday to Thursday in the US.
So far, this includes the launch dates for Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (23 May 2024) and Luigi's Mansion 2 HD (27 June 2024), and also Endless Ocean: Luminous (2 May 2024). Before now, games like Another Code: Recollection, Mario vs. Donkey Kong, and this week's upcoming release Princess Peach: Showtime! have all been scheduled for Friday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has announced Steam Families, a revamped program that allows players to create a group to share and play games with close family members. The program launches today in the Steam Beta Client and it replaces the Steam Family Sharing and Steam Family View features. 
Steam Families can have up to six members, and joining gives you access to any sharable games in each member's library. “Sharable games” is an important distinction, as Family Sharing is a feature that any developer can choose to opt out of for any reason at any time. Some games are also ineligible for sharing due to technical reasons. 
Noteworthy games currently eligible for Family Sharing include Helldivers 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Balatro, Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, and Hogwarts Legacy. You can read the full list here.

An entire generation of fighting game fans have been born, hit puberty, graduated college, found a career, and possibly started a family in the time between the last Fatal Fury game and the upcoming City of the Wolves. The most recent entry, Garou: Mark of the Wolves, was released in 1999 for arcades (and 2001 for Dreamcast in the West), meaning the series has been dormant for over 25 years. Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves sees the series make its long-awaited return, and it already feels ready to stand alongside the big boys of the genre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No matter the industry – sports, television, movies, or games – the debate of "the greatest of all time" inevitably comes up. These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.
Though we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.
Will this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. 
While this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet. Be sure to bookmark this page or follow us on social media to be alerted when a new round starts!

Update: Oops! Nintendo has since removed the previous music video and instead replaced it with a new one, Color Pulse '24, an updated version of Off the Hook's original song.
It seems like We're So Back is another tune that we'll be hearing later on down the line, but Nintendo uploaded it early by mistake. A number of prominent Splatoon leakers and players noticed the error on Twitter earlier.

Why are people angry that this character has seven fingers? Why does Nvidia want me to talk to a robot about ramen? Why is everyone saying AI is smart when it still can’t manage its Classical Era luxury resource economy in Civilization properly? In this new series, we’re going to explore what 'generative AI' is, why it’s arrived now in the games industry, and what it might mean for people who make, write about and play games in the future.

Remember when Marvel's Midnight Suns was coming to Switch? Us neither. The game was announced as "no longer planned" for the Nintendo hybrid in May of last year, but now a new hero has risen to fill the void in the superhero turn-based realm.
Capes will be soaring onto Switch this May, and while it might not pack in quite as many recognisable faces as the aforementioned 2K project (there's no Spidey or Wolverine to be seen here) it's nice to see that the Switch is at least included in this superhero team-up.

        <updated>2024-03-18T13:22:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Animal Well, the gorgeous indie metroidvania that will also be the first game published by Videogamedunkey's Bigmode, will hit PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC this May. More specifically, developer Shared Memory, which is just solo dev Billy Basso, revealed in a new gameplay trailer the game will launch on May 9. 
Dunkey revealed Big Mode, his own publishing arm, back in 2022, later announcing that Shared Memory's Animal Well would be the first game it publishes. Now, just shy of two years later, Animal Well will finally be in the hands of players in just a couple of months. 
Check out the Animal Well release date trailer for yourself below: 


"After nearly 7 years of development, Animal Well is finally almost ready to be released out into the world," Basso writes on X (formerly Twitter). "I have made this trailer to commemorate the occasion. I hope you like it. I don't really know what else to say." 
As you can see in the trailer above, Animal Well continues to look hauntingly gorgeous, and even kind of cute if you're a fan of spooky animals. We also get new glimpses of the game's metroidvania exploration, too, by way of a special yo-yo with a light that lures animals forward and more. Plus, there's a dog, which rules. 
Animal Well hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on May 9.

In it, you'll explore a vast labyrinth of tunnels, solve puzzles and escape its many mammalian-based horrors, all of whom  are out to gobble you up in one fell swoop - though as a strange, tiny little blob creature the size of a chicken nugget, it's unclear both what you are, and why exactly you're so appetising to them. Well, it probably has something to do with looking like a sentient chicken nugget, I suppose. Come and watch the release date trailer below.

Maybe because there’s so many of them: this flowery festival of buying stuff begins on Wednesday March 20th and runs all the way through Monday March 25th. And I thought Prime Day was getting too long, sheesh.
On the upside, this should mean more chances topick up some quality PC gaming hardware on the cheap. Been putting off that new SSD or graphics card upgrade? Spring Deal Days is likely your best opportunity to exploit mass discounts until Summer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SNK has released a new gameplay trailer for its upcoming fighter, Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, revealing it's due out in "early 2025" as well. This trailer arrives roughly half a year after SNK formally revealed Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in a trailer similar to today's, featuring Terry Bogard facing off against Rock Howard. 
That duo returns for another fight in the latest trailer, spotlighting the game's new "REV" system that features Rev Guard, Rev Blow, Rev Accel, and presumably more we'll learn about when the game is released next year. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves gameplay trailer below: 


Unfortunately, the trailer doesn't reveal anything else about the game, including platforms. Presumably, it will come to PlayStation and Xbox (possibly Switch), and PC. 
SNK will release Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in early 2025.
In the meantime, check out SNK's original tease for the game from 2022, and then watch the Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves reveal trailer from last year. 
After that, catch up on Game Informer's thoughts on the latest fighting game releases:

Variety has more details about these crewmembers, including quick descriptions of each: 
Red – Captain of The Skeld
People-pleaser, blowhard

Fun fact: failed upwards
Purple  – Chief of Security
Safety, suspicion, sarcasm
Task: wet blanket
Fun fact: trust issues
Orange – HR
Spineless corporate shill
Task: eliminate redundancy, redundantly

"Members of your crew have been replaced by an alien shapeshifter intent on causing confusion, sabotaging the ship, and killing everyone," the CBS series logline reads, according to Variety. "Root out the 'Impostor' or fall victim to its murderous designs." 
Variety reports that there is no network or streamer attached to the show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Combat is such a routine activity in video games that it often doesn't feel much like conflict at all. It's just something done to move the simulation along - a propulsive chore stripped of drama or significance or lasting emotion beyond a vague desire to see what lies beyond whatever it is you're trying to kill. In Death Of A Wish, combat has substance: it's a form of redemptive self-expression. The game's fights are a means of asserting and cherishing yourself in the face of a world that regards you as a deviant, a world whose poison you carry on the inside.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma 2 is right around the corner, launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next week on March 22. Ahead of the game's launch, Capcom has released a new gameplay overview trailer with more than seven minutes of new footage; and perhaps strangely, it's narrated by actor Ian McShane (Deadwood, John Wick, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides). 
Broken up into three sections in the video, McShane discusses "The Hero" of Dragon's Dogma 2, the "Two Nations," and, of course, "The Monsters" that players will be killing plenty of during their journey. 
Check it out for yourself in the Dragon's Dogma 2 gameplay overview trailer below: 


Dragon's Dogma 2 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 22, 2024. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's hands-on Dragon's Dogma 2 preview, and then check out this story about how Dragon's Dogma 2's main story campaign is about the same length as the first game. After that, read about how Dragon's Dogma 2 has an uncapped framerate but no visual presets or modes on consoles, and then check out this story about why Dragon's Dogma 2 has just one save file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is right around the corner, hitting Xbox Series X/S exclusively on May 21, and ahead of the game's release, Ninja Theory has revealed it will have a dedicated photo mode. Plus, the studio released four new images of Hellblade II taken using the game's photo mode. 
While in-game photo modes are becoming the norm more and more with each new release, there are still some games that launch without one. With how good Hellblade II continues to look in trailers and screenshots, it's great to hear the game will feature this mode. 
Check out the four new Hellblade II images taken using the game's photo mode for yourself below: 

Based on the tweet revealing the photo mode, it sounds like players can expect it to launch with the game. 
"Photo mode returns in Senua's Saga: Hellblade II," a Ninja Theory tweet reads. "Here are some shot we took purely using photo mode in-game this week." 
Senua's Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S on May 21, 2024. 
For more about the game, watch the latest Senua's Saga: Hellblade II trailer, and then check out this gameplay trailer from December. After that, watch this other gameplay trailer for another look at the game's action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Port-o-remaster publishers Aspyr yesterday launched the Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection, bundling together the two 'What if Battlefield but Star Wars?' shooters originally released by Pandemic Studios and LucasArts in 2004 and 2005 (not to be confused with Dice and EA's uncolonic Star Wars Battlefront games from the mid-tensies). It's one of those rereleases that exists mostly for modern consoles, made a bit useless on PC by the fact that you can still buy and fully play the originals for half the price. It's made even less useful by launching in a right wonky technical state, with bad lag, crashes, and reportedly only three 64-player servers online at first.

Well, While Waiting is a game that delves into precisely this fundamental human question: what is the best thing to do while waiting for something else to happen? It's from the makers of the very good puzzle game Moncage, and its newly released Steam demo is a pure, fidgety brilliance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My day in Lightyear Frontier starts out with a bit of farming. On a good day, it’s raining, so I don’t need to water the crops. On a bad day, there are weeds spontaneously spawning from the sky and I need to catch them before they land right on top of my precious plants. Either way, when I’m done, I’ll put the day’s harvest into the processing machines to work while I’m away, and then go exploring for minerals.
My goals are clear. I need to build a new machine, or upgrade my mech so that I can clean up a new area of the map and get new resources in return. Those will – you guessed it – let me build new machines or upgrade my mech again. There might be a few steps to juggle on the way, but nothing that needs me to hold long recipe flowcharts in my head. When I get back I’ll have everything I need to take the next step. It always feels like I’m making forward progress.

Mainly because it’s not so simple: for all its chaotic spectacle, the meleeing in Darktide (this month’s RPS Game Club star) works because it’s secretly been a rhythm game.

Last month, we learned that Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal, was reportedly set to sell Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake developer Saber Interactive. The deal apparently carried with it a $500 million price tag, according to a Bloomberg report. 
Now, it's official: Embracer has sold off Saber Interactive to a group of private investors under Beacon Interactive, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. Beacon Interactive is controlled by Saber Interactive co-founder Matthew Karch, the publication reports.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/14/disney-dreamlight-valley-dev-gameloft-making-dungeons-dragons-survival-sim-game"/>
        <updated>2024-03-14T18:43:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gameloft, the studio behind Disney Dreamlight Valley, has revealed it is partnering with Wizards of the Coast to create a new Dungeons & Dragons game. It's being developed for both consoles and PC and Gameloft describes it as an "innovative hybrid of survival, life simulation, and action RPG."
Disney Dreamlight Valley is popular in the life sim genre, mixing fun gameplay, unique customization, and Disney together into a package that players seem to really enjoy. It launched into Early Access back in 2022 before the full release debuted in December. All of this is to say: if you're a fan of Disney Dreamlight Valley and Dungeons & Dragons, there's a new game to keep an eye on. 
Currently untitled, Gameloft says in its announcement on Instagram that the game is set in the mythical Forgotten Realms, which is also the D&D setting Baldur's Gate 3 takes place in. The game, which will mix survival, life simulation, and action RPG elements into one, will feature "unique cooperative gameplay," the studio says. 
"Players can expect an adventure where the rich lore of this legendary franchise meets real-time strategy in a unique campaign of resilience, camaraderie, and danger at nearly every turn," the announcement reads." 
There's no name for the project and no release window either. Gameloft is currently hiring for the project. 
News of this D&D game arrives roughly a year after Wizards of the Coast, which owns the D&D IP and is a division within Hasbro, reportedly canceled five unannounced games. The last D&D game released was Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance back in 2021 – read Game Informer's review of it here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2's Cutting Edge Premium warbond, aka DLC battle pass, is now available to buy in-game, and it is chock-full of oddball gadgetry such as lightning shotguns, burst-fire laser rifles and experimental armour. As with the Arc Thrower stratagem, the lightning shotgun fires arcs of electricity that conduct between players and enemies alike, but there's a fresh armour perk, Electrical Conduit, which reduces arc damage by 95%, allowing close-knit teams of Helldivers to roll around the battlefield frazzling themselves without much penalty. 
Still, I think the real star pick here is surely the Localization Confusion booster, which extends the time between enemy spawns, allowing weirdo solo players such as myself to disentangle from a dragged-out gunfight a little more gracefully.

That changed today, as Sega and Rovio announced a multi-game crossover event between Sonic and Angry Birds on mobile devices.
The crossover event even comes with its own storyline, which includes a plot to steal the Angry Birds' eggs that accidentally creates a portal between the world of Angry Birds and Sonic's world.

They don't have much more to share about the game, not even a name, so presumably it won't be out for some time. Whatever it might be, it's headed to PC and consoles.

While Embracer have yet to actually state this out loud, it sounds like the KOTOR remake will be a "joint project" between Saber and Embracer. It also probably won't be out in the next 12 months. Given the project's repeated disruptions and delays, I suspect many of us will settle for the game coming out at all.

However, online play will remain available after the game's delisting, and purchased copies of the collection will remain available for re-download from the Steam store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crow Country and its spooky, mutant-stuffed theme park will be opening its gates on Steam on May 9th, developers SFB Games have announced. It's the first of two games from the Tangle Tower micro-studio coming to PC this year, the other one being The Mermaid's Tongue, which will be picking up the adventures of their Tangle Tower detective duo on a marginally less spooky-looking submarine later this year. Crow Country, however, is a very different kettle of fish, combining chunky, PS1-style Final Fantasy 7 character models with early Resident Evil tank controls and panicked monster shooting.

        <updated>2024-03-14T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your eye over the original Outcast from 1999 today, and you'll find a world that's more abstract than alien. Hazy, almost block colour textures are stretched to breaking point over terrain that looks like it's been pulled and poked by a child sculpting in putty slime, while its cast of beige, three-fingered Talans are so rigid that they'd all be reigning champions at the local robot dance-off. Understandable, given the era in which is was made, but even so - what a difference 25 years make. Even after 2017's remake glow-up with Outcast: Second Contact, A New Beginning's version of Adelpha is a lush and verdant paradise, with treetops soaring over your head, and mountains requiring several triple or quadruple jetpack jumps to traverse. It's no Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, admittedly, but it leans in very much the same direction, punching your eyeballs with such bright, primary colours that you'll feel enticed to explore every inch of it.
A shame, then, that all its visual splendour amounts to is little more than an empty husk filled with open world busy work that already felt tired and done ten years ago. Its non-linear approach to storytelling remains intact, letting you tackle the quests and problems of its numerous village settlements in any order you wish, but even this has been boiled down to tedious checklists of fetch quests, escort missions and shooting up the same identikit facility one after another. Topping off this fatal combo is returning protagonist Cutter Slade, whose macho army dude dial is still set firmly to cringey wise-cracking and patronising stereotypes. A new beginning this ain't.

        <updated>2024-03-14T13:31:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The creators of RuneScape, Andrew and Paul Gower, have revealed Brighter Shores, a new point-and-click fantasy adventure MMORPG. And if you're a fan of RuneScape, Brightet Shores looks like a game you'll want to keep an eye on. 
After starting Jagex in 1999, the Gower brothers focused their efforts on the studio's first big release: RuneScape. The rest is history. RuneScape is still a very popular game today, both in its modern form and as Old School RuneScape. The Gowers left Jagex in 2010 and little was known about what they were up to until now. It turns out Andrew Gower was working as the lead designer on their new game, while Paul Gower was working as the narrative designer for it.

Not to mention new armour, weapons, and quality of life improvements like the ability to pause your single player sessions.

The company has just shut down around 30 GitHub repos offering circumvention tools with attempts to evade liability given short shrift. One Nintendo takedown notice makes it clear that, even when people link to a third-party site that hosts tools available via different links, it still amounts to trafficking in circumvention devices under the DMCA.

        <updated>2024-03-13T17:27:28.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Ubisoft Montpellier's excellent metroidvania, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, hit consoles and PC in January, and it's still one of Game Informer's top scoring reviews of the year. You can read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review here to find out why we love it so much. Now, Ubisoft is giving players another reason to jump back in with a new post-launch content roadmap. 
What's more, all of the new content coming to the game is set to release throughout the year, starting with new Speedrun and Permadeath modes this month as well as new outfits for Sargon. In spring, a Boss Rush will be released alongside even more outfits for Sargon, and in summer, the Divine Trials update brings new combat, platform, and puzzle challenges as well as new amulets, outfits, and more. All of this will be free, too. 
However, later in 2024, new paid story DLC will hit Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, although Ubisoft offers no teases about what to expect. 
It's an exciting roadmap, doubly so considering the majority of the new content is free. 
For more, read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review, and then check out our breakdown of the four ways Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown gets the metroidvania genre right. After that, check out this guide about how to beat Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's hardest platforming challenge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In some respects, Helldivers 2 did come as a bit of surprise. Not a huge amount of marketing, no betas, and review codes didn't go out until it basically launched. Before it landed on my PC, there was a small part of me that thought it was going to be a rocky ride with severe performance issues or the like. Nope! It's easily slid into one of my favourite games of the year without question, and presumably, for the hundreds of thousands of others who've also opted into preserving democracy.
But there seems to be this sentiment that Helldivers 2's roaring success has come as a shock, so much of a shock that top execs and investors are doing YouTube thumbnail faces in boardrooms with mini-nuke explosions erupting from their heads. Should its success come as that much of a surprise, though? No, probably not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After writing about the upcoming visual novel-ish game Vampire Therapist (in which you are a vampire, acting as a therapist to other vampires) back in the middle of January, developer Cyrus Nemati reached out asking if I'd like to ask him more questions about it. This was surprising, because while I'd been broadly positive about the vibes of Vampire Therapist, I was reasonably concerned about the specifics of how it would all shake down. But it turned out that the critical perspective was something Nemati appreciated, and so we had a chat that dug down into the meat of it all. Although I was initially interested in how he'd come up with the idea of a vampire therapist, it turns out all roads lead back to Twilight's Edward Cullen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios quietly snuck flying Terminid bugs into the game in the latest update, it seems. Windows Central noticed flying Shrieker bugs are enemies that appear on planets plagued with Terminids and while official accounts for the game play coy, more and more players are running into them. 
It seems the Shriekers were added with Patch 1.000.102, which went live yesterday. Coincidentally, that patch was centered on Terminids and nerfing spawn rates for Bile Titans and Chargers on the harder difficulties of Helldivers 2. Windows Central reports Shriekers only appear when a "Shrieker Lair" is one of the side objectives on a planet, noting they look like "smaller versions of the mushroom-like Spore Towers that perpetually keep a large area around them covered in a thick haze." 


Shrieker Lairs, like the Spore Towers and Terminid egg nests can be destroyed up close and from afar with a well-placed rocket, grenade, or strategem. 
Keep your eyes on the skies, Helldivers and remember...DEMOCRACY.
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about a recent patch that introduced meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the game. After that, check out the Cutting Edge Warbond coming to the game tomorrow.

Project Awakening is a single-shard affair - that is, one in which all players inhabit the same world, rather than being split up across servers or instances. It's "built upon the principles of freedom, consequence, and mastery within a living universe", and "represents the next step in CCP Games' journey to create virtual worlds more meaningful than real life", which, you know, wind your neck in.

The trailer for Nobody Wants To Die seems like it's self-seriousness is actually self-awareness. I mean, I kind of refuse to believe that hard-boiled future crime detective James Karra saying "I'm in the business of secrets... But it's more of an addiction... And I like 'em straight... No chaser..." while sipping from a glass of amber liquor isn't indulging in some amount of winking and nudging.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sabotage Studio has teased a new three-player co-op mode for its 2023 RPG Sea of Stars alongside news the game has surpassed 5 million players in less than a year. This new mode, dubbed Single Player+, lets three players journey together through the story of Sea of Stars, and it will feature new traversal and combat mechanics to accommodate playing with friends. 
Sabotage announced this news today with a special teaser trailer you can watch below. In it, you'll get a glimpse of what Sea of Stars' Single Player+ mode looks like, how it works, and what to expect. Check it out: 


"Staying true to the game's core turn-based roots, each player will engage in traversal and combat with a new 'co-op timed hits' mechanic as they embark with friends on Sea of Stars' grand adventure," a press release reads. "The new mode is currently in development and more details are set to be released soon." 
As you can see, Sabotage isn't quite ready to reveal when this new mode will hit the game. After all, the team is still working on Throes of the Watchmaker, a new DLC coming to the game sometime in the future. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Sea of Stars review, and then read Game Informer's Sea of Stars cover story for behind-the-scenes details about the game's development.

        <updated>2024-03-13T12:30:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation is rolling out a new update for the PlayStation 5 that enhances audio on the DualSense controller, adds new Share Screen features, and more. This update was in beta last month but rolls out for everyone starting today. 
The biggest features are coming to the PS5's DualSense controller. The built-in speakers can now produce higher volume sound, which PlayStation says will allow players to hear in-game sounds and voice chat audio more clearly. Plus, the noise cancellation on the controller's built-in mic has been improved. 


"The mic input quality on these controllers has been improved, courtesy of a new A.I. machine learning model," a PlayStation Blog post reads. "Background noise from button presses and game audio are suppressed, resulting in a better voice chat experience."
Share Screen is also getting some new features with today's update. Namely, viewers can move a pointer around and send a ping or draw a line on a shared screen, allowing them to highlight objects in-game or guide a player. Plus, viewers can now send emoji-based reactions to the host's screen – these features are turned off by default and the host and viewer must turn them on. PlayStation says these Share Screen features will hit the PS App, which also allows Share Screen, later this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stealth games in which you can become "one with the shadows" cover a wide range, though I guess spectrum is the more appropriate word here. You've got sober infiltration games like Thief, which metes out gradations of light and dark with the care of somebody calculating their tax expenses, and stylised affairs such as Mark Of The Ninja, in which stepping into shadow desaturates you and sort of makes your character far too fancy for enemies to notice.
There are games such as Splinter Cell, in which hiding in shadows rests on a gentleman's agreement with NPCs not to perceive the big green torches attached to Sam Fisher's head. And then you have games like Ereban: Shadow Legacy, which has just been given a release date - 10th April. In this mystical third-person stealth-platformer, your character can literally disintegrate and travel through shadows as a ripple of dark energy - a transformation that puts me in mind less of Thief than of squid-mode in Nintendo's Splatoon.

If you've already bagged all the available Pals and are hungry for more, you might be interested in Palworld mod Breed Unreleased Pals, created by ShameIHaveNoFriends, which grants access to three animals who exist in the game's files but are not, strictly speaking, available to players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who is Jeff Minter? Unless you’re a long-term fan of his work, you might have asked that upon hearing about Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story, the latest interactive documentary from Digital Eclipse (following on from The Making Of Karateka and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration). You might have heard Minter’s name in connection with the remake of the unreleased Atari arcade game Akka Arrh in 2023. Maybe you played his mind-warping shooter Polybius in VR. You might remember as far back as the Atari Jaguar and Minter’s phenomenal Tempest 2000, the unexpected highlight of the console’s library. Or perhaps you recall his work from the 8-bit glory days. You could just know him from the daily videos of him feeding his sheep on YouTube.


The point is that Jeff Minter has been making games for a phenomenally long time – more than 40 years, in fact. And in all that time, he has stayed true to what he believes in. “One of the things we say in the game itself is the idea of him being the last indie developer,” says Chris Kohler, editorial director at Digital Eclipse in California. “The last of the people from the early 80s who very consciously never sold out, never took the money, never looked to expand or do anything other than [be] just Jeff at his computer, making the sorts of video games that he wants to make.”

Draw from enough unique inspirations, and eventually, a game begins to feel entirely novel. That’s the sensation that emerges as you play Unicorn Overlord, Vanillaware’s vast fantasy adventure of tactics, strategy, and storytelling. I was consistently reminded of other systems and mechanics from prior genre releases, but the resulting combination felt consistently original and entertaining, even after many hours of battle and exploration.

A court in Barcelona has indeed authorized LaLiga to obtain the identities of subscribers at five major ISPs, but if our reading of court documents is accurate, LaLiga hasn't identified any, even by their IP addresses. As unlikely as it may sound, LaLiga may have no evidence that any subscriber did anything wrong, so ISPs have been instructed to find some.

Originally released on PC on May 30, 2023, Night Dive and publisher Prime Matter revealed today that System Shock hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on May 21, just shy of the game's one-year anniversary. 
This reveal comes by way of a new trailer over at IGN, which teases some of the sci-fi horror and first-person shooting players can expect in the game. Check it out for yourself below in the System Shock consoles release date trailer: 


The remake today is in great shape on PC, and players should expect a well-made retread of the classic game. This remake had been in the works for years before its PC release last year – check out the game in a pre-alpha state in 2016 here.

        <updated>2024-03-12T16:25:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you ask any Final Fantasy fan what their top five favorite songs in the franchise are, there's a 99 percent chance one of them is "To Zanarkand" from Final Fantasy X. However, it turns out, it wasn't originally intended for the game. 
This news comes from Audrey (aitaikimochi on X, formerly Twitter), a mega Final Fantasy fan, Twitch streamer, and CEO of Aitai Japan Inc., who translated a recent interview between Weekly Ochiai and Final Fantasy X composer Nobuo Uematsu, whose credits also include One-Winged Angel and Aerith's Theme from Final Fantasy VII and so much more. In that interview, Uematsu revealed "To Zanarkand" originally began as a piece for a French flute player, meant to be played during a recital. 


"'To Zanarkand' was actually not meant to be the theme for Final Fantasy X," Uematsu tells Weekly Ochiai, as translated by Audrey on X. "There was a flute player from France who originally asked me to write a song for them to play during a recital. When I wrote the piece, I thought perhaps this sounded a bit too sad for a recital. So I set it aside for the time being. 
"Sometime after, when I was making the score of Final Fantasy X, I was falling behind all the while the producers were hounding me. So since that flute piece was unused, I just kind of meekly handed it to them. They listened to it and said, 'Yes! This is brilliant!'" 
In retrospect, it's wild "To Zanarkand" wasn't originally composed by Uematsu for Final Fantasy X because it fits the game's themes so well, nailing the somber and sad tone present throughout Tidus and Yuna's journey in Spira. 
For more about Final Fantasy music, read Game Informer's exclusive four-part series on composer Masayoshi Soken's score for last year's Final Fantasy XVI:
Part 1: Creating The Prelude
Part 2: The Victory Fanfare
Part 3: Finding A Main Theme
Part 4: The Sound

It is indeed a strange, dream-like experience where you leap floaty leaps onto thin, spindly crags of rock in a sage-grey void. Rather than finding it soothing, I found it it extremely stress-making.

While Starbreeze's messaging around Sjögren's leave isn't super clear – the team simply says it is bidding farewell to the former CEO – today's news arrives after Payday 3 failed to meet expectations, according to GameDeveloper. 


"On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to thank Tobias Sjögren for his achievements during the past three years," board chairman Torgny Hellström writes in the notice to investors. "Tobias took over the helm of Starbreeze in a challenging phase of its journey and we wish him well in his future endeavors."
Goeldner, the new interim CEO, adds, "Starbreeze has a strong history of developing and publishing games globally. After launching Payday 3, the company is well-positioned to leverage the strengths of the organization to monetize and develop the IP portfolio. I am looking forward to assuming an operative position and, together with the management, ensure the execution of this strategy."
Goeldner has 40 years of experience in the games industry, including several executive positions, according to the notice. His last executive position was as CEO of Focus Home Interactive. He has been a member of Starbreeze's board of directors since last year. Starbreeze has initiated a recruitment process for a permanent CEO. 


Payday 3 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 21. We enjoyed the game around launch, giving it an 8 out of 10 in the Game Informer Payday 3 review. More than 3 million people played Payday 3 in its first month, but the game still failed to meet the expectations of the studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moon Studios co-founder and tech and production director Gennadiy Korol has revealed the team's upcoming action-RPG, No Rest for the Wicked, which is also the game on Game Informer's cover this month, will not require an online connection to play single-player. Although, if you've read our cover story about the game, you already know this, and you also know you can play the game with up to three friends on a shared living server.
What's more, Korol says the game will feature "a rich Offline Mode" for those not interested in the game's multiplayer elements.


Korol announced this today on X (formerly Twitter), expanding on Moon's thoughts about No Rest for the Wicked as both a single-player and multiplayer game. 
"Even though Wicked was built from the ground up with multiplayer in mind, we did not want offline-play to feel like a second thought and we want people to be able to play on the go when connection quality is not always ideal," Korol writes. "Our April 18th [Early Access launch on PC] will focus on the single player experience and we will be sharing more details about the Multiplayer aspect of the game later in our Early Access campaign." 


Game Informer has played hours of No Rest for the Wicked, so far only in single-player, and it's been a blast. You can read our preview thoughts on the game's opening hours here, and you can watch it for yourself in our No Rest for the Wicked New Gameplay Today.
Read about No Rest for the Wicked's early access roadmap and Cerim's Crucible endgame content after that, and for even more exclusive content, head to Game Informer's No Rest for the Wicked coverage hub.

The developers have also lowered the health of the Charger’s head, allowing for instant takedowns with a Recoilless Rifle or EAT-17, without (in theory) entirely doing away with the community’s treasured "leg meta", which sees players blasting the juggernaut’s limbs to sabotage it.

In the early 2000s, tennis video games were everywhere. Whether you were talking mass-appeal titles like Virtua Tennis and Mario Tennis or more niche, lower-budget games like Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament and Hard Hitter Tennis, the market was absolutely flooded with choices. One of the most beloved of this era was 2003's Top Spin, which started as an Xbox exclusive before making the leap to PS2 and PC in subsequent years. Since that inaugural game, Top Spin has seen three more numbered entries, all receiving high review scores.

The developers have weighed in on this front, commenting that strictly speaking, Helldivers 2 doesn't support stealth at all. It's just designed in an "agnostic", systems-first way and this in itself makes stealth a possibility. It's also a quiet attempt to capture something of the intricacy of a full-blown military simulator, while still being a very "arcadey" game at heart, which owes a little to Arrowhead's own collective time in the military.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn't really know anything about Moomins going into adventure game Snufkin: Melody Of Moominvalley, besides that their heads always looked palatable to me - like bleached kidney beans. Plus the Moomin merch I'd seen over the years in official Moomin shops or the odd gift store was delightful, so if someone had rocked up with a pencil case adorned with Moomin heads back in school, you bet I would've been jealous.
And having finished the game, I'm unsure whether I've truly learned any more about the Moomins and their friends. But then again, I've come away thinking that it's a pleasant universe to spend a few hours in, where the wild is celebrated with rebellious song. If you're after the video game equivalent of a walk through the woods on a warm afternoon, Moominvalley is the place to wander.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI exclusively hit PlayStation 5 last June, and as its one-year anniversary approaches in just a few months, with a second DLC out this spring centered around the Leviathan Eikon called The Rising Tide, I spoke to producer Naoki Yoshida and DLC director Takeo Kujiraoka about the game's reception, Clive Rosfield as a protagonist, loose ends, and more. 
You can read my exclusive preview of The Rising Tide DLC here, and I've got a story about how you shouldn't expect more DLC here and another about the lastest update to the PC version's development here, too. Below, however, is my retrospective discussion about Final Fantasy XVI with Yoshida and Kujiraoka.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MultiVersus, the Warner Bros. free-to-play crossover platform fighter, makes its big comeback on May 28. The game has been rebuilt and returns almost a year after its open beta was taken offline.
Player First Games game director Tony Huynh explains in a developer diary that MultiVersus has been remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, meaning it sports improved visuals and lighting. It also has a totally revamped netcode to provide what Huynh promises will be consistent online performance regardless of platform.
Every existing fighter sports new attacks and combat mechanics, and Huynh promises that new fighters are on the way. Additionally, new stages were teased with concept art depicting arenas based on The Powerpuff Girls’ Townsville and Dexter’s Laboratory.
Lastly, Huynh reveals a brand-new PvE mode is coming to the game. He doesn’t go into detail, only teasing it will offer “additional ways of playing with unique rewards.” 


MultiVersus was first launched in open beta last May and pits characters across Warner Bros. stable of IPs, such as DC, Looney Tunes, and even Game of Thrones, in a tag-team-focused twist of Super Smash Bros. inspired combat. The game was initially quite popular and generally well-liked. Writer Bryan Vore gave the game’s beta incarnation an 8 out of 10 in our review, writing that “Living games have the potential to go in frustrating directions, but MultiVersus has a strong foundation. If it can meaningfully roll out content and smooth out its rough edges, this could become a new crossover obsession for years to come.” 
Unfortunately, months of infrequent updates and lack of communication following the game’s second season saw engagement decline. Player First Games pulled MultiVersus from stores to address these criticisms. When the game returns, it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
Are you looking forward to jumping back into the new and improved MultiVersus? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

When I spoke to producer Naoki Yoshida about it in Square Enix's Tokyo, Japan, offices for Game Informer's FFXVI cover story last year, he said players shouldn't expect the PC version anytime soon. 
With FFXVI's first DLC, Echoes of the Fallen, already out, and its second DLC, The Rising Tide, due out this spring, I spoke to Yoshida once more about the PC version. I also talked to him and DLC director Takeo Kujiraoka about The Rising Tide and what players can expect, and you can read Game Informer's exclusive preview here.

The games join the Game Boy library, which is included with the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription ($20 a year).
Dr. Mario from Game Boy, Mario Golf from Game Boy Color, and Mario Tennis from Game Boy Color join the Switch Online Game Boy catalog. The collection already includes the likes of Super Mario Land 2 – 6 Golden Coins, Kirby's Dream Land 2, The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX, Tetris, The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages, The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons, and Metroid II – Return of Samus. Oddly enough, the library is missing all of the Pokémon titles, as well as the original Super Mario Land.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.
The program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.
Like last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.
ScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.
We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.
Based on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.
Looking forward to hearing from you!

Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.]]></summary>
