Gameloft's free-to-play racing game Disney Speedstorm has already been compared to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe numerous times. With its character-focused racing and themed tracks, it was inevitable — especially on the Switch! But, in an interview with Nintendo Everything, the developer is keen to set out what makes this title stand out from Nintendo's juggernaut kart racer.
While Mario Kart 8 has different types of karts, stats, and even racer weights, Disney Speedstorm will have four different classes. When asked about what makes this game "stand out", Gameloft Barcelona's game manager — Aska Suzuki — put forward this unique element first:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kill the Wabbit
This past weekend saw fight fans lock horns in Warner Bros' brand new scrapper MultiVersus, the crossover fighter having just launched its open access beta on PC and console platforms — And while the fur has only been flying for a few days, already characters are queued up to have their wings clipped by developer Player First Games.
In something of an obscure tweet posted this weekend, MultiVersus director Tony Huynh noted that "Nerfs Inc." would be headed to the title post-EVO (which takes place in Las Vegas this weekend). While no specific characters were announced for the chopping block, Huynh added that "Bugs Bunny will always be fun."
https://twitter.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1552517058918682624?s=20&t=unq02SbgfNGQK4ddQ-VM9A
No doubt Huynh is pointing toward the fact that the carrot-chomping smart arse is already proving to be something of a dominant player within MultiVersus' crossover world. Bugs has seemingly overshot Taz as somebody singled out as something of a problem character for players, after the latter had his devastating Tornado Spin attack scaled right down scant hours into the beta's launch.
In a chaotic platform fighter such as MultiVersus, it can be difficult to accurately ascertain who may have a leg-up on the competition. Add to that the way ALL fighting game players call for nerfs within minutes of a title's launch, and it takes a sharp developer to truly ascertain which characters are actually broken and which characters players are simply "losing to" as they aren't bothering to learn the matchup.
Either way, MultiVersus has had an immensely healthy beta launch, with over 144,000 players logging into Steam at its peak period. We shall see how the title retains its audience over the coming weeks and months. MultiVersus is now in open beta on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's also been renamed for its Steam launch.
Massage Freaks, the raunchy rthythm game from publisher qureate, has been quietly released on Steam. Not only that, but it's also received a complete name change and is now called 'beat refle', which sounds like a bit of a play on the term 'Reflexology'. It's certainly a more "neutral" title, that's for sure.
The release follows a storm of controversy following the initial reveal of Massage Freaks. Its depiction of women and the scenarios in which they find themselves caused many to draw comparisons to real-life sex crimes in Japan. In addition, the forenames of the in-game characters were identical to some of the members of Japanese idol group 'Hinatazaka46' before qureate swifly made moves to alter them. Indeed, the Steam page for beat refle contains a few choice statements to potentially avoid any future controversy:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rock, Rock, Rockin' Rollergames...
It's time to get your skates on, quite literally, (well, digitally), as the retro fun fans over at Hamster have added Nichibutsu's whirling derby dervish Roller Jammer to PS4 and Nintendo Switch — the latest addition to its record-breaking Arcade Archives range.
Release to arcades way back in 1984, Roller Jammer is a very loose take on the world's most complicated sport: Roller Derby. Instead of being packed out with screaming, tattoed gals sporting cool names like "Anna Geddon", this digital take on hard-hitting wheeled warfare features a bunch of boring 8-bit dudes. We were still a good six years away from the debut of the outrageous, WWE-like show Rollergames, and thus Roller Jammer boasts a less glamorous, simplistic take on the sport.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Old Classic Retro Gaming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqW8NZ3bQ_8
Perhaps understanding that it does not have tech available to recreate the ins and outs of roller derby proper, Nichibutsu chooses to play a little fast and loose with its adaptation of the sport, tasking playing with gunning through thin slaloms of flags before eventually engaging in an every-man-for-themselves race, complete with a hilarious "double lariat" maneuver. While Roller Jammer's relative obscurity makes this Arcade Archives release a little notable, ultimately it's pretty difficult to recommend this title.
Roller Jammer is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

We've seen countless game-to-TV or film adaptations announced over the past few months, and while it's exciting to see some really great properties getting even more love, part of me wishes we could see more pre-existing properties be turned into licensed games. Take one of the most beloved game franchises of all time: The Witcher. Those were books before they were games, and CD Projekt Red's take on the adventures of Geralt brought a fresh take to the series, just like the Netflix series that came after it.
What got me thinking about all of this in the first place is that I finally got around to watching Season 4 of Stranger Things, and I was reminded of the Telltale series adaptation of the show that never saw the light of day.

The second wave of the new Booster Course tracks for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe will be here next week, and we're feeling hyped to try out some new races (and a little disappointed that some of them look more like Mario Kart Tour tracks than Mario Kart 8 tracks).
In the spirit of hype, we're trying to gauge how people are feeling about this new wave, and the DLC in general. Is it everything you'd hoped for? A cool bonus to the Nintendo Switch Online subscription? A bit disappointing? Or are you just totally bummed that Nintendo is pumping time and money into an old Mario Kart game instead of something else — like a new Mario Kart game?

Hello folks, and welcome to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
In last week's edition, Metroid Prime - one of the greatest console games of all time - entered the ring. As we'd predicted, it was a pretty close battle, but Japan's more action-packed (if you can call it that) design just managed to beat out North America and Europe's more restrained approach with 53% of the vote. It just goes to show that even the most iconic box art design is not necessarily the best one.

For some, these purchases may have even been due to the delays associated with the fancier collector's versions. According to the eShop charts in the US, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is now out in front of Minecraft.

According to the source, "just about every aspect of this version is different from the final retail release". One of the highlights is the boot up screen. Instead of featuring the Nintendo DS logo, it appears to be a GBA placeholder screen and a sound file of children shouting "Nintendo" (you can have a listen below).

Putting the cat in catastrophe
The second I saw the announcement trailer for Stray, I knew it was a game I was going to play on release day, no questions asked. I am a cat mom, after all, so anything with a cat, let alone as a playable character, is a big win in my book. While it was pretty easy to get me on board with the premise of Stray alone, one thing I wasn't expecting was just how rich and compelling the story was going to be in this game. I mean, it was published by Annapurna so that should have been my first clue, but even so, it slipped my mind.
To start, the worldbuilding was incredibly detailed and made talking to NPCs, a pretty important mechanic when you'…]]></summary>

That seems like a good thing on the its face, but many Minecraft players aren't happy that it extends to private servers. 

Naturally, because this is Minecraft, players have changed what they don't like. There are now mods which strip messages of information tieing them to your player profile.

It's nice to see a cool off-the-radar indie game resurface with a release window after years of wondering. This is my first time seeing The Siege and the Sandfox, but as a stealth-based metroidvania with detailed pixel art, it quickly left a good impression.
The developers at Cardboard Sword have teamed up with publisher Koch Media to launch their debut game. Along with a new trailer this week (which helps reintroduce the "stealthvania" concept), they've set their sights on a 2023 release on PC.

If you're curious about the game's name, here's the deal: a desert kingdom is under siege, and you'll sneak around as a legendary figure, the Sandfox, to save the kingdom.

It's so easy to love the shrunken-kids-versus-oversized-insects premise of Grounded, especially with Obsidian Entertainment's sense of humor, but no matter how good this base-building survival game looks, many players are going to hold off until early access wraps up. The studio previously quoted September, and has since narrowed it down to a September 27 release for Grounded 1.0 on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.
In case you missed the 1.0 trailer during the summer gaming showcases, here it is again.

Ghostwire: Tokyo has begun regularly popping up in PlayStation Store and Steam sales, and given the less-than-stellar reception it got at launch, plenty of people are only now cracking into this supernatural action-adventure game. I'm one of them! I recently finished the story, but try as I might, I cannot shake this game off. I refuse to delete Ghostwire: Tokyo from my PS5 until I finish out my 100% completionist goal, and there's one annoying issue standing in my way: slow-spawning parades, known in-game as Hyakki Yako.
Consider this a friendly heads-up that may or may not come in handy one day.

For gamers old enough to remember the turn of the century, the console landscape looked very different from how it does today. Everyone was excited for the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo was getting the GameCube ready to succeed the Nintendo 64. Microsoft's Xbox was also in development but much of the focus was on Sega and its continuing demise following poor sales of the Dreamcast after its famous launch on 9/9/99. It seemed the game was up when, in January 2001, Sega announced it would be abandoning the console market to concentrate on third-party software development.
Many predicted that Sega would collapse under the financial pressures and be consigned to gaming history. However, something remarkable happened and the once giant of console gaming quickly reinvented itself to become a successful third-party software developer.

This has been a pretty hectic week for me, with some frustrating health drama and general ongoing malaise, but the beat goes on and so do I. As is always the case, July has been a slow month for the good ship Destructoid, with the annual news drought in full swing. Though Gamescom is just around the corner, to be followed up by the fall schedule, this year is definitely something of an anomaly, given that the biggest and most anticipated games are already on the market.

As we reach the end of yet another week in the year 2022, we also sit at the cusp of the eighth month of the year! In the news this week, Nintendo finally unveiled Wave 2 of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's Booster Course Pass. Bandai Namco has asked Digimon Survive fans on social media to not spoil the game. And, according to Monolith Soft, designing the cast of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was pretty difficult!
Speaking of, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is out now, and in our review, we tell you why we think it's pretty darn special. And we also took a look back at all of the unique gimmicks throughout the Pokémon series' history. And, from the wider Hookshot Media family, we've recently welcomed Time Extension to the gang! This new site is focused on retro games, hidden gems, and classics, so you should go and check it out!

Well, after a long wait it's finally here - no, we're not talking about Xenoblade Chronicles 3, the focus here is instead on Bandai Namco's new Digimon Survive game.
After a lengthy development cycle and multiple delays, the game has now been released across multiple systems including the Nintendo Switch. At this point in time, there doesn't really seem to be any reviews for the game online - with a lot of outlets only receiving codes now.

I've had a cracking gaming year, and I thinnnk that's down to lots of new games? Maybe? This type of question has always brushed over the fact that people play games for years and start 'old' games all the time, and maybe it's less useful than ever now every other game is a live service.

Hey guys! Got some hot days ahead, huh? I’m sweltering without AC through this heatwave and my tech has felt it too; tonight I may have to run without a camera as it overheats and freezes nearly immediately. I know, it feels weird. I thought tonight we could fullscreen the rest of Stray, the atmospheric kitty game taking the internet by storm, and then focus on doing some more wildly difficult puzzles in Baba Is You or The Witness. See you tonight!

I’ll need your brainpower. Be sure to drink plenty of water and stay cool.

I once described the SNES version of Rampart as not “the most faithful” but “the version that best fits on consoles.” I maybe stand by that, but I have a contender for the least faithful. While the NES got a decent version of Rampart, the Famicom, for whatever reason, got a completely different one. This isn’t the only time this has happened. The case of the NES/Famicom disparity of Maniac Mansion is another one. An equally confusing one.
Rampart on Famicom was developed by Konami by most of the team that would go on to create games like Lagrange Point and Batman Returns. A talented team to be sure. It’s clear that the development team played Rampart, but they didn’t seem that interested in replicating the gameplay.

Final Fantasy XIV has no shortage of content. Raids, dungeons, trials, mount farming, or just good ol' fishing, there's always something to do. But between every activity, I find the one thing I keep on doing in Final Fantasy XIV is messing around with the interface.
Since starting the game back in December, I've managed to go from A Realm Reborn all the way to Endwalker, the most recent expansion. (Yes, that pace was pretty fast, though sadly not on par with Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi.)
In the time since, I've learned a lot of lessons: eat food to buff your stats, use retainers to sell unwanted items, and know which ledges are not safe to Dragoon-backflip next to. But in all of it, I keep on messing with my hotbars.

It was during IndieCade 2014 that the team behind indie hit Before Your Eyes knew they had something. They were showing a student project, titled Close Your at the time. And even in its earliest state, it was emotionally resonating with people who played it.
"People were crying, you know, after sitting down with it for 15 minutes," remembers Graham Parkes, creative director and lead writer at GoodbyeWorld Games. 
The group had brought a student project to show off, next to up-and-coming experiences like Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. They didn't know at the time that it would kick off a seven-year journey, eventually leading to a published release under Skybound and a BAFTA.

Hollywood has already taken two different shots at the Tomb Raider franchise, starring Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander respectively, but it looks like there's a chance another actress will get a chance to helm the series, as TheWrap reports. The film rights to Tomb Raider are up for grabs yet again after MGM failed to make a sequel after the 2018 film, which would have allowed them to keep the rights — although there were plans to make another film in the series at one point.
The most likely factor in plans for the sequel fizzling out is Amazon's acquisition of MGM back in March of this year. There's a good chance that with the merger going on, any projects in the works were put on pause, which is unfortunate when there's a ticking clock for maintaining your IPs. Fans had a lukewarm reaction regarding the 2018 movie, but it did fairly well at the box office internationally, so it's kind of a shame that they're not getting a second chance with Vikander's version of Croft.

Tomb Raider's treasure-hunting counterpart Uncharted (also sometimes called Dude Raider by fans) did quite well in the box office this year, raking in just over $400 million, and securing its spot as the fourth most profitable video game movie to date. It's hard to say whether this had to do with its star-studded cast, which included Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg, or if fans just liked the movie more, but either way, I think it shows that fans are still down for an Indiana Jones-inspired action adventure.
There's a good chance that we'll be getting another reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise from whoever picks up the rights, so here's hoping that the third time's a charm for the franchise. Until then, there's always the Tomb Raider anime that Netflix still has in the works.

Things have escalated to a point that Valve isn't comfortable with, and the company has solidified its guidelines — and announced new rules that'll go into effect in September — regarding artwork on Steam.
As explained in a Steamworks Development post, Valve wants to "make it as clear and straightforward as possible for customers to find games to buy and play on Steam."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You'll carry over most of your stuff
Yes, there is a Xenoblade Chronicles 3 New Game+ mode.
Since a lot of people like a heads-up about how the end of the game works, you can read all about it here. Note that there are no spoilers at all, but the guide will talk about continuation options at the end of the game (hence the question at the very bottom). So come back later if you only want to know near the end.
Can you continue exploring your original Xenoblade Chronicles 3 file after your save?
Yes. After you finish the game, you'll have the opportunity to make a clear save file. Loading it up will bring you back to the area you were at before you finished the game. Clear save files will be denoted by a gold medallion in the top left corner of the file.
Just in case, you may want to save that clear file in a slot you aren't using (it doesn't really matter, but it might matter to you).
Xenoblade Chronicles 3 New Game+ carries over most of your progression
You can also opt to just play a completely new file and start the game over again. A new option will appear on the main menu right next to "New Game," for "New Game+."
Here is exactly what carries over, in the words of the game's own tutorial for NG+:
You'll retain your character growth.
All the tutorials you've read thus far will not come up again (but you can access them via the in-game menu).
All of your inventory outside of key items stay (but you will keep shards and nopon coins).
Unique monster kills will be reset (graves will revive, but if you clear them again you can see your original kill record).
Here is what doesn't carry over (and will need to be unlocked):
Chain [super] attacks
Interlinking [Ouroboros]
Key items

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We need a Bedman scent
If you ever wanted to give off the lascivious odor of the pack of fucking maniacs that make up the Guilty Gear Strive roster, then fragrance company Fairytail Parfum has you covered, from head to toe, in fact.
The cologne and perfume company has released a new line of eau de parfum products based upon the sexy, sexy stars of the Arc System Works fighter. The range launches with four specific characters: the regal and handsome Ky Kiske, the mysterious world-eater Ramlethal Valentine, super-cute Halloweenie Jack-O Valentine, and hard-edged merc Sol Badguy, who looks like he hasn't seen a shower in a year.

While the men's fragrances are seeing a relaunch, (now in larger 50ml bottles) the two ladies are seeing their respective debuts in the world of fragrance. These are not even Fairytail Parfum's first dalliance with the world of Guilty Gear, as the company has previously released perfumes based on Dizzy and Elphelt Valentine — two beloved characters who are yet to make their roster appearance in Guilty Gear Strive (which may be why they have been replaced by Ram and Jack-O in this range).
These are the new fragrance builds, as reported by the fine folk of Siliconera.
Ramlethal: Red thyme, jasmine, and peony at the top; powder, white freesia, and lily of the valley in the middle; white musk, suede, and spice at the bottom.
Jack-O: Fragrant olive, yuzu, and jasmine at the top; iris, apricot, and magnolia in the middle; musk and cedarwood at the bottom.
You can check out the full range of fragrances over on the official Fairytail Parfum website. Given the company's Japanese origins, GG fans will likely have to go the import route if they wish to pick up the new perfumes. Each bottle retails for ¥3,520, or roughly $27 USD, not including shipping.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms.

Everyone plays games differently. Some of us buy nothing but digital games, preferring to be able to play whatever we want, wherever we want; others meticulously collect every single physical release they can get their mitts on, before prices skyrocket for a second-hand copy on eBay.
But one thing most of us have in common, especially those of us who gamed before digital-only games were a thing, is a collection of things that represent our gaming career. Sometimes, that's the pristine shrink-wrapped copy of Ocarina of Time that we bought in 199whatever from a garage sale that didn't know what they had; sometimes, our gaming pride and joy is one of those clear bouncy balls with a plastic Pikachu inside it, because it has sentimental meaning to us.

Blogger Supper Mario Broth has worked out that this incredible SNES platformer, and console launch title, will have existed in its completed form, out in the public, for one billion seconds. 1,000,000,000 seconds. So if you're also 32 this year, then you'll also be about that old in seconds. Makes us feel very old.

Valve has a new update on Steam Deck production, and it's some good news. The company announced today that it's fulfilling demand sooner than estimated, and so it's bumping up reservation spots for those in the queue.
The supply chain shortfalls that initially affected Steam Deck production have been gradually clearing up, and Valve says it is continuing to ramp up its output. According to Valve, the company is able to produce Decks faster than ever before.
Everyone who is currently in the reservation queue will get their Steam Deck email this year. And many customers who were previously in the Q4 or later window have been bumped up to Q3. That window ranges from July to September. Everyone else will fall in the Q4, or October to December, range.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWgZhMtlWo
Right now, any new observations will be put in the Q4 bucket. If those fill up, reservations will continue to spill over into the following quarter. Those who have a Deck locked in can check their reservation window on the site.
Much more on Deck
With more of the Steam Decks rolling off the line, this is good news for those still waiting on their portable PC. The company had previously said it was looking to up its production and distribution, and it looks like those efforts bore out well.
The official Steam Deck dock is a bit of a different story, as the official hardware was indefinitely delayed a few months ago. For those getting their Steam Decks in, third-party seems like it will be the way to go for a while. I wound up grabbing a powered hub online, and it's been working pretty well while I wait for the real deal to be available.
Also, for those getting a Steam Deck in, be sure to be careful with any hardware mods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the age of years-long development cycles, it seems miraculous that Wolfenstein 3D, a game that spawned the modern-day FPS as we know it, was developed by six people in just six months. The story of Wolfenstein 3D’s development makes for a fascinating time capsule of those early days of game development - a milestone in gaming history that underlines just how much the industry has grown over the decades since.
But that’s getting ahead of ourselves a bit. The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.

Some of my fondest Nintendo Switch memories were formed with multiplayer (and especially co-op) games, and if you're looking for a group activity, the Nintendo Multiplayer Sale is worth a run-through. There are about 50 discounted games on the eShop, as well as some DLC, and the deals will stick around through August 7.
You can see the full list of featured games over here, and I've got recommendations. That said, this is a digital Nintendo sale — the games are often great, but rarely cheap.
10 games to consider
Borderlands: The Handsome Collection ($15.99) runs fine on Nintendo Switch.
Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics ($27.99) is a good bang for your buck if you enjoy board and card games — and the AI puts up a fight in solo play.

Several third-party developers have been provided with early access to openFPGA, but users will be able to sample the feature right now with a playable version of SpaceWar!, one of the earliest video games in existence.

Head to every canteen you can
This is something you should start making a habit of early on. When you visit a canteen anywhere (mostly in colonies, which are like small outposts/towns so to speak), buy the one meal available. It'll "unlock" it for use at regular campsites as your team cook (Manana) can now wield the recipe. Canteens can be identified on the map with a handshake symbol (which is also shared by campsites): but it'll say the words "canteen" on the screen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the last stage of my Tour De Jeux gave me a flat tyre on my real bike, I started daydreaming about a bike repair game. A grubby game with fuzzy deductive puzzles as you rule out the many possible causes of similar symptoms. As far as I can find, no such game exists. But I did see two upcoming games with similar names: Bicycle Mechanic Simulator and Bike Mechanic Simulator 2023. Alas, I fear they might be PlayWay-style sims where you just click stuff in order then it all works tickety-boo. That is not the bike repair I know and begrudgingly enjoy.

The great mystery of a secret church in one Nier: Automata player's copy of the game is over. And, as it turns out, it's not some grand marketing scheme for a new Nier or a long-hidden secret. It is a mod. But the end result is pretty impressive nonetheless.
To backtrack for those who missed it the first time around, a player by the name of "sadfutago" was conspicuously seeking help in advancing through a church they found in Nier: Automata. The thing is, this particular part of the Copied City had never been seen before, and no one was able to replicate it.
As a potential new discovery in a well-loved series like Nier, it obviously caused a stir. Cue several days of fevered speculation, memes, and new users flooding into the Nier modding Discord.

It will come as no surprise to find out that here at Nintendo Life we love Pokémon, but like many part-time trainers, we also love a good book. It's often difficult to bridge between these two worlds, but these Pokémon bookmarks from Moko's Makery on Etsy manage to do just that.
As flagged on Twitter by @PokemonBeWillin, seeing your favourite Pokémon taking a little nibble of your page is everything that an avid reader/Nintendo fan can dream of! With examples ranging from Charizard to Gyarados, we are seriously impressed by the creativity that has gone into these designs.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 classes are highly customizable, as you can mix and match abilities from other classes into one synergized player-crafted build. That said, you need to unlock the ability to use a class with everyone in your party. Here's how to make sense of the system.
[No major story spoilers will be discussed in this article.]

After meeting a new party member, you'll inherently unlock a new class
So this is actually important to understand. Typically, party members join up as part of the main storyline, or through optional quests. To find every possible party member (and thus, unlock all the classes), you'll want to head toward ? icons on the map, which generally denote points of interest like new quests: something meatier than a pickup or i…]]></summary>

      <p>Our brief first look at NBA 2K23's on-court action shows off the fluidity of play and attention to detail that unfolds even after the whistle is blown. For years, this series has been lauded as a graphical powerhouse, and this teaser sizzles in this way.</p>

<p>We'll have to see how the footage shown breaks down as far as new gameplay features, but it would appear perimeter play is getting some of the spotlight this year. The realism in the superstars is also on display, both on the court and in how they celebrate and interact with fans.</p>

<p>NBA 2K23 will have three different looks on retail stands with NBA Legend Michael Jordan on one cover, Phoenix's Devin Booker on another, and the WNBA's Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi on the third. Michael Jordan's return unfolds through 15 different Jordan Challenge scenarios that recreate key moments from his career.</p>

<p>More details should be coming soon, as 2K Sports aims to ship NBA 2K23 on September 9 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.</p>]]></summary>

Since then, the team have been keeping game details under wraps, but now thanks to the Annapurna Interactive showcase, Outerloop have released a free Steam demo, meaning now we can all have a go at beating the pulp out of our exes - a dream come true. 
You play as Jala, a young woman who just got booted out of her shared apartment after having a fight with her, now, ex-partner. With nowhere else to go, she’s decided to take the bus back to her hometown of Timber Hills to move back in with her parents (hopefully, temporarily). While she's killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life. Is she really a lost cause in love?

A Xenoblade Chronicles 3 canteen is useful for multiple reasons. It serves as a rest stop, which you can use to do all sorts of rest-stoppy things like add bonus XP and talk things over with your party for a chance at extra XP and more questlines. But the real thing that sets canteens apart from camps is the ability to learn new recipes for party member Manana. So make sure you make a point to hit every canteen you can!
Here's a very early game (like first-few-hours-early) example!

Canteens are typically found in colonies
Colonies are by and large the "cities/towns" of Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Here you'll find opportunities to gather up new quests, as well as some hidden caches (barrels full of useful items and equipment), and...canteens.

Honestly, my thoughts remain largely unchanged – which is a good thing! It's a fun free-to-play fighter that iterates on the Smash formula but can't quite emulate its predecessor's polish.

I've wanted to quote that for years but had yet to play a game using them that grabbed me enough to warrant an article. Let us be thankful, then, for ADACA, an angry playmobil FPS.
It's actually two games, and I'm not sure which to call the main event. I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who's inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you're swarmed by creepy mutants. It was good enough to tempt me this week, despite a few minor niggles, but its other half, Zone Patrol, is a Stalker-esque sandbox where it really shines.

Adorable spider-platformer Webbed came out earlier this year, and won over arachnophiles and arachnophobes alike thanks to its adorable eight-legged protagonist (and its arachnophobia mode, which you can see below, that turns the spider into a featureless blob).

      <p>"A new chapter is about to begin amidst a tangled web of factions." This line accompanies the latest teaser trailer for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/genshin-impact/genshin-impact-review-into-the-great-wide-open">Genshin Impact</a>, the incredible free-to-play RPG from miHoYo. The trailer dives into the game's fourth region,&nbsp;Sumeru, which is home to people who can't dream and worship the God of Wisdom.</p>

<p>Suermu looks lush in foliage, with mushroom creatures scurrying about the trunks of sizable trees. It also contains a desert area and looks to be just as sizable as the game's other areas.</p>

<p>The trailer also introduces a host of companion characters that players will meet as quests are completed. The first new character is Tighnari, a forest watcher who we see holding a magical firefly. In Port Ormos, players will run into Alhaitham from the Haravatat in the Akademiya. Further into the game, players meet Dehya of the Desertfolk, who is also a mercenary for the&nbsp;Emerites. There are also Nilou, a character who is pursuing art and dance, Nahida, a mysterious being, and Cyno, the General Mahamatra.</p>

<p>All of this content is a part of Genshin Impact's 03 update, which doesn't have a release date yet, but appears to be close, given how much miHoYo has revealed. Genshin Impact is currently available on PlayStation consoles and PC, and works just as well on Android, and iOS.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has dated them for September 9
It's not often you get amiibo news anymore, but Nintendo did just that, and gave us a date for the Steve and Alex Minecraft amiibo figures: September 9. Note that this is the same day Splatoon 3 is out!
As a reminder, the duo is actually coming out as a result of their appearance in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as fighters, and will function as normal as characters that can be trained as CPUs with the figures themselves. While the jury is still out on US orders, they've been available to pre-order for nearly a year now on some Japanese marketplaces as a two-pack, including Amazon Japan (where I secured a pre-order in October). The date for some of those markets still lists "December 31, 2022" as a placeholder release, which we expect to shift soon given this news. While amiibo do not strictly follow a "global release date" system, it's typically close enough barring regional delays.
Production on amiibo has slowed down in recent years, and 2022 has only hosted the Min Min figure thus far. Soon it'll have Steve and Alex, as well as three Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak figures. As for what's left, we don't know for sure what the future holds on random and third-party tie-ins, but we do have the rest of the Smash Ultimate DLC cast to go: Sephiroth, Pyra/Mythra, Kazuya, and Sora.
As always, we have a full up-to-date list of amiibo that's been updated since 2015.

Bungie has been proactively dialing back its interaction with social media and public forums in the wake of constant harassment, abuse, and threats leveled at the studio and its employees.
Speaking in a conversation on the Destiny Reddit, community manager Dylan "dmg04" Gafner confirmed that steady streams of abuse from community members — many of which went beyond "rude replies on Twitter or vague comments" and into the realm of "real threats" directed toward both individual employees and the company as a whole — has led to the studio putting up a new wall, so to speak, in order to prevent the physical and mental welfare of its staff.

Was it a secret area? An unfinished area? A hoax? Viral marketing? A mod? If it was a mod, it was far more complex than any so far. Turns out, that's because a group of fans have secretly been making their own mod tools, and plan to release them soon. In the meantime, I've enjoyed pranksters memeing on the mystery by creating secret churches in other games, including Half-Life 2 and Super Mario 64.

Sony has released its financial results for the fiscal year ending June 31, 2022 (Q1 2022), and while the PlayStation 5 platform continues to gather slight momentum on a global scale, overall the brand is seeing a general decline in customer expenditure, particularly in the realm of software and subscriptions.
The mighty PS5 has now hit an impressive 21.7 million global shipments since its launch in the fall of 2020, with around 2.4 million consoles shipped in Q1. While this number is certainly nothing to be sniffed at, it reflects an increasingly granular sales growth when compared to that of the company's previous PlayStation hardware launches. Still, the numbers are moving in the right direction, if a little more slowly than Sony had perhaps hoped.

Then, halfway through, said it would be a best-of-five and pulled the pin on what was looking like an incredible comeback. That, understandably, did not go down well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alien: Isolation is the kind of game you play and then just can’t stop thinking about. From its unique design to its fully-realised world to its moments of sheer terror, it’s a game like no other, and despite coming out in 2014, there really hasn’t been anything like it since, either.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Switch is coming later this year
I'm always looking for the next title to scratch my cozy game addiction, and it looks like the management sim Bear and Breakfast is the newest release to make that list. While I first heard about the game during the Summer Game Fest stream this year with the gameplay trailer, it was initially announced back in 2020. Players take on the role of a bear named Hank who builds and runs his own bed and breakfast in the woods, and will encounter all kinds of human and animal friends along the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USaiP4ACTB4
The developers at Gumycat said that they "grew up on management sims," and that games like Theme Hospital were a huge inspiration for them. In addition to the "usual management stuff," they also wanted to create a game that tells a story.
The premise is that humans are coming back for some unknown reason, and they need a place to stay, so Hank and his friends decide to fix up old buildings around town for them. Players will advance through Bear and Breakfast's story by completing quests that entail the aforementioned management stuff like gathering materials, crafting, building, decorating, and so on. There's even a kind of puzzle element to booking guests, making sure they have food they like, as well as some kind of creepy subplot going on, too.
The game's art style reminds me of Saturday morning cartoons in an adorably nostalgic way, and the game's comedic writing is already being praised in the Steam reviews. With an ever-growing list of games to play these days, Bear and Breakfast has managed (see what I did there?) to find a place at the very top of it. In the past, I've found some management games to lack the depth to have staying power, but this title promises a rich, worthwhile experience that I can't wait to play.
Bear and Breakfast is out now on Steam and a Nintendo Switch version is slated for release in "2022."

      <p>Annapurna Interactive concluded its showcase today by debuting The Lost Wild, Great Ape Games dinosaur-laden survival game.</p>

<p>The Lost Wild was first announced last October with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjpWlBwHwek" target="_blank">pre-alpha trailer</a>&nbsp;and is described as a first-person survival horror game. Players control an investigative reporter guided by a mysterious voice over the radio to explore abandoned Japanese facilities nestled within an island forest teeming with prehistoric wildlife. These dinos are highly intelligent and realistically behave like animals, featuring what Great Ape describes as self-preservation and reactive systemic AI behaviors.&nbsp;</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6310134087112"></iframe>

<p>Players can use stealth to avoid detection while exploring, create distractions, or repel dinos using items like flares and makeshift, non-lethal weaponry. You’ll spend much of the game scrounging for materials as you traverse ruins for clues about the island’s history and how you ended up in this dire situation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the game’s <a href="https://thelostwild.com/faq/" target="_blank">FAQ</a>, The Lost Wild won’t be arriving until late 2024 or early 2025. It has been confirmed for PC via Steam but will also come to unspecified consoles.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Keita Takahashi, the creator of the Katamari series, has a new game in the works. Unfortunately, it’s tough to know exactly what it is.</p>

<p>A teaser trailer premiered during today’s Annapurna Showcase showed a few seconds of close-up footage of an animated child snoring in his sleep. What does it mean? Your guess is as good as ours, but we fully expect it to be weird given Takahashi’s history.</p>

      <p>Annapurna Interactive revealed an eye-brow-raising&nbsp;new shooter called Bounty Star: The Morose Tale of Graveyard Clem. The title blends mech gameplay and farming&nbsp;with a wild west aesthetic, and it’s coming next year.&nbsp;</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6310132198112"></iframe>

<p>Players control Clementine McKinny, a&nbsp;bounty hunter and former soldier looking to atone for her past by keeping the peace in the Red Expanse, a post-apocalyptic version of the American Southwest. She uses her trust mech suit to keep the bad guys at bay, which players can customize with various offensive and defensive components. These include various guns, a laser sword, missile launchers, riot shields, boosters, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you're not blasting apart enemies, you'll take care of your homestead. This rundown garage can be upgraded with new supply and water lines, and you can grow food, raise animals, and manufacture ammo for your mech.</p>

<p>Bounty Star will arrive on PlayStation and Xbox platforms (launching day one on Game Pass), Switch, and PC and launches&nbsp;in 2023.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Kentucky Route Zero has become one of the last decade's most celebrated narrative adventure games. As such, fans will be happy to know that developer Cardboard Computer is hard at work on its next title.</p>

<p>A dev diary during today's Annapurna Showcase doesn't reveal much about the game, including its title. We get shots of the team members animating a dog's face, with the designers saying the next game will feature fully-animated characters. It also explains the project has a faster tempo and sports funnier writing&nbsp;than KRZ but will ultimately be a tragedy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whatever this game is, it has no release window or announced platforms. You can read our review of Kentucky Route Zero <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/kentucky-route-zero/kentucky-route-zero-review-a-surreal-road-trip" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SATA SSDs are getting increasingly affordable, with even capacious 2TB models going down in price rapidly as NVMe drives approach parity with the slower SATA drives. This makes it a good time to pick up a SATA drive for desktops or laptops that can't accommodate another M.2 drive, especially for media or game storage where the speed difference between SATA and NVMe is minimal. 
Today, Teamgroup's imaginatively-named T-Force Vulcan Z drive is down to $128 for a 2TB model, the lowest price we can find for this size at present. 
Note that to get this price, you do need to be an Amazon Prime member - normal folk you like and me will see a price of $160 instead, alongside a reminder to 'join Prime to save $32 on this item'. You should be able to join Prime under a free trial, order the item and then cancel your Prime status to avoid a charge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dell's G15 is one of the most affordable gaming laptops on the market, thanks to modest specs and Dell's willingness for aggressive discounts, but today we're seeing an RTX 3050 model go for an astoundingly low £441. 
To get this price, select the Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS operating system and use VOUCHERCODES8 at checkout. Linux is a completely free operating system, unlike Windows, so you can knock £50 off the purchase price just by ticking this box - and of course, you're free to install Windows 10 or 11 afterwards. Keys for Windows 7/8/10 work on Windows 11 too, so you probably already have a key lying around - or you can pick up a new one for less than £50 online. The whole process, from using the Windows 11 Media Creation Tool to prepare a USB install drive to reaching the desktop, only takes around 20 to 30 minutes - well worth it!

The winners in this week's edition of The Electronic Wireless Show, however, are numerous.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been excited to play Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer dino shooter, ever since it used the phrase “unstoppable raptor horde” in one of its trailers. It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.


Admittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.

While the patch's release coincides with the High School Years expansion and supports a number of its features, it also added several new elements to the ever-evolving base game. These include long-time fan requests like sexual orientation customisation, body hair options, and the return of a wants and fears system in the style of The Sims 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really appreciate when games don't hold your hand. They don't waste time insulting your intelligence, they just set you loose in their playground. They let you strike out on your own, figure things out for yourself, and create something valuable with your own two paws.

And in replacement of his partner John Watson, there was instead a plump hippo in a dapper suit who is constantly quaffing tea. No, you've not accidentally picked up the famous detective’s opium huffing habit, these two curious characters are Sherlock and Watson’s animal counterparts in zoological adventure Lord Winklebottom Investigates.
The plucky duo, gentleman giraffe Lord Winklebottom and Doctor Frumple the hippo, have been invited to a mysterious island to sit in on a special announcement only to arrive and, by George! There’s been a bleeding murder!

      <p>In these trying times, the only thing keeping me going is knowing I will play <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/07/13/bayonetta-3-release-date-announced-with-over-the-top-trailer" target="_blank">a new Bayonetta game</a> in just a few short months. But hey, let's not forget the classics, either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today on Game Informer Live, we're revisiting the original Bayonetta, which most intelligent and attractive&nbsp;people <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/02/10/bayonetta-is-the-best-playing-game-ever-made" target="_blank">will say is one of the best</a>&nbsp;games of all time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But that's not all! A couple of weeks ago, we started building a Real Grade Wing Gundam Gunpla kit. You can check out the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1542555508" target="_blank">first</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1538692939" target="_blank">second</a> archives right here. I recommend getting caught up because today is the day we're finally finishing our build. Come Hell or high water; we are piecing this robot together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We're going live on our <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gameinformer" target="_blank">Twitch page</a> at&nbsp;3:30 PM Central Time (4:30 PM Eastern Time/1:30 PM Pacific). Hope to see you there!</p>]]></summary>

Since I've been playing Monster Hunter Rise, which is largely a succession of ever escalating boss fights with big lizards, I've begun comparing these scuffles with Elden Ring's boss battles. And I reckon much of their differences come down to the simple health bar, or lack of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strategy games are the go-to option when you're looking for something to really get your brain working. But they can seem unreachable when your synapses are being melted from without rather than through overuse. Happily, we found an excellent solution last summer, and being a wily fox, I had a plan ready for this year. 2022's now-traditional Low-Intensity Strategy Game For When Burny Light Make Think Hard is, of course, The Battle For Polytopia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I sat down to talk to Wadjet Eye founder Dave Gilbert last week, he was in the middle of trying to sum up The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow, a new point and click adventure from Cloak And Dagger Games that his studio will be publishing later this year. "Usually, by the time a game comes out, I've compressed it to one sexy sound bite. I haven't done that with Hob's Barrow yet," he says. "Basically, Victorian gothic horror story. That's the best way to describe it."
Originally announced as Incantamentum (Gilbert jokes that one of the reasons behind the name change is because he could never pronounce "Incantamentum" correctly), Wadjet Eye got involved after Gilbert played the Steam demo last year and emailed the developer. "I said, 'Hey, I played the demo. I really liked it. Please tell me you're going to be adding voice acting to this because it's screaming for it'," Gilbert tells me. "And he said, 'Well, we will if we can find a publisher who'll do it for us.'" So now Wadjet Eye are publishing, and Gilbert is overseeing the voice recording.

Staff at the company spoke about how the cultural changes that have been taking place since former head Dan Houser’s infamous 100-hour working week comments in 2018 have affected the game’s development, with sources saying GTA 6 will apparently have a playable female protagonist for the first time in the series' history.

Sources from Aspyr told Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier that the game had been intended for a 2022 release, but that 2025 was more "realistic".

The twist is that there's no money fuelling your construction. Instead, your city flourishes or not based on your ability to fulfil each building's resource requirements, which quickly turns progress into more of a puzzle than a management game.

It's out on Steam now, and you can find a trailer of its pretty voxel world below.

Whether you're up to no good in Red Dead Redemption 2 or stealing from the rich to (sort of) give to the poor in the original Desperados, these temples of cash have long been the scenes of messy shootouts, upturned tables, and big, golden pay-outs. At least when your heist strategy's going according to plan, that is. In an exclusive demo for one of the later levels in Hard West 2, the upcoming sequel to the 2015 turn-based tactics original, Ice Code Games' chief technology officer Mateusz Pilski is starting to feel the heat a bit. The bank is well guarded, with at least half a dozen gunslingers staking out the doors at the front, and untold numbers waiting in hidden nooks and crannies further back. He takes a moment to consider his approach, but he begins his assault with confidence.  
"In any XCOM-like, when you see that many enemies and that much firepower, in that good a position, you think, okay, I'm fucked up," he tells me. "In just a second, I will show you how you can use Bravado to totally overturn the situation."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta are increasing the price of all versions of the Meta Quest 2, their flagship wireless VR headset, by $100. They announced the decision in a post on the Oculus blog, saying that the increase in price would help them "continue to invest for the long term and keep driving the VR industry forward." Basically, Meta would like to lose less money now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTX 2060 is the most affordable RTX graphics card, making it your best shout for gaining the hardware to do real-time ray tracing and frame-rate-boosting DLSS without overpaying. This model debuted at £330, got more expensive over time as the worst of the GPU supply shortage hit, and was impossible to find below RRP even after its next-generation successor, the RTX 3060 launched two years later. 
Now the RTX 2060 has finally dipped in price, making it an ideal time to pick up what is still a powerful and feature-complete graphics card for 1080p or even 1440p gaming. You can pick up a compact EVGA RTX 2060 SC model for just £212 on Amazon right now, a 52% drop from its peak price and a fair deal for the level of performance on offer.

Reason being? You get fewer cores than those processors, and slower clock speeds, but dramatically increased cache - a trade-off that often provides a massive performance improvement for gaming. 
The 5800X3D was extremely hard to find at launch, with AMD's limited inventory being claimed as soon as the first reviews rolled in, but now we're starting to see better availability - and today, the first proper discounts. You can pick up the 5800X3D for £384 from CCL, thanks to a £15 off discount code: AFF15.

      <p>Skull and Bones was first revealed in 2017. As a major fan of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, I was thrilled to see Ubisoft dive back into piracy, this time with a new IP. At that point, Skull and Bones was a 5v5 multiplayer arena battler where you played solely as the ship. It wasn't exactly the Black Flag follow-up many, including myself, had anticipated, but with Ubisoft Singapore, the studio behind the Assassin's Creed franchise's excellent naval combat, at the helm, I wanted to see more. </p>

      <p>WWE’s SummerSlam event takes place this Saturday, and Epic is getting in the mood&nbsp;by announcing that 16-time world champion John Cena will five-knuckle shuffle his way into Fortnite.</p>

<p>Cena arrives on July 28 and comes outfitted in his full-on entrance gear as well as his shirtless in-ring gear. You can pick up a set that includes a “you can’t see me” emote, WWE Championship Title Back Bling, and Five Digit Slapper pickaxe. Personally, I’m chuckling at the idea of the PG-friendly Cena adjusting attitudes with guns instead of bodyslams.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Cena isn’t the first wrestler to appear in Fornite – <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/02/03/the-foundation-played-by-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-now-unlockable-in-fortnite" target="_blank">Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson</a> has him beat there – it’s cool to see regardless, and, as a wrestling fan, I hope this&nbsp;trend continues. Fortnite already acts as the ultimate&nbsp;“forbidden door” for various media properties, so let's throw&nbsp;more sports entertainment into the mix&nbsp;by adding stars from WWE, AEW, Impact, New Japan, and other promotions. That would certainly entice me to dive back into action.&nbsp;</p>

To get the reduced price, you'll need to use code HOT10 at the checkout to knock 10% off the price. 
Higher-end Ryzen processors have also seen discounts in recent weeks. We spotted deals on the Ryzen 7 5800X and Ryzen 9 5900X using the same Ebay HOT10 code.

      <p>Hey, I don't want to go to work today. I want to stay home and play all my video games<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTrd7m5mRso" target="_blank">.</a> Luckily, I can do just that. Care to join?</p>

<p>Today at 2:30 PM Central Time (3:30 PM Eastern/12:30 PM Pacific), I'll be playing Ben Esposito and Angel Matrix's fantastic Neon White on our <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gameinformer" target="_blank">Twitch channel</a>. I reviewed the game a while back – and gave it my <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/neon-white/holy-hell" target="_blank">highest&nbsp;score</a> ever, if you're wondering – but I'm starting a fresh save today, so spoilers should be minimal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After that, I'll be picking up where I left off on our ongoing Gunpla build <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1538692939" target="_blank">from last week</a>. We're building the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=real+grade+wing+gundam&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1012US1012&amp;sxsrf=ALiCzsYT6uNhKTWkike_2hPW_dISb43zpA:1658771717524&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjB5fGXzpT5AhVUJX0KHYrSAgMQ_AUoAnoECAIQBA&amp;biw=2560&amp;bih=1321&amp;dpr=1#imgrc=GZQzn5xo5nRRFM" target="_blank">Real Grade Wing Gundam</a>, and there's still lots to work on.

Good job that a Naughty Dog artist has said that The Last Of Us Part 1 remake will be launching on our beige box of choice “very soon” after coming to PS5 on September 2nd then. Senior Environment Texture Artist Jonathan Benainous made the comment to a The Last Of Us fan who tweeted at him about the PC version.

      <p>A flying wyvern known as the&nbsp;Lucent Nargacuga will soon nest within a ruined society in Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. This creature arrives on August 1 within a free title update for players on Switch and PC.</p>

<p>Capcom released a minute-long trailer that shows a battle against the Lucent Nargacuga within the Forlorn Arena, backed by beautiful moonlight. The wyvern can cloak to evade its attackers and spin within the blink of an eye to knock them back.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak/harrowing-hunts">review for Sunbreak</a>, John Carson said the game needs more threats. "The lack of new monsters plagues the early hours, but there’s plenty to love if you keep at it," he wrote. "The added flexibility of the Switch Skill Swap system is a freeing and fun expansion to combat for hardcore hunters and the new creatures in the Master Rank quests – when you get to them – breathe life into the experience. For someone already invested in Monster Hunter, there’s <a>plenty</a>&nbsp;to love in Sunbreak."</p>

<p>This title update brings at least one new beast to hunt. Here's hoping players stumble upon more as the world opens up and the new content is unearthed.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><iframe frameborder='0' width='560' height='315' src='https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6309983891112'/></iframe></p>
      

      <p>Funko, the collectibles manufacturer behind the wildly popular Pop line of toys, is partnering with 10:10 games to create a "AAA action platformer" for console and PC. The game is slated to release in 2023 and is spearheaded by video game developer veterans&nbsp; Jon Burton and Arthur Parsons, who worked together on several Lego games at Traveller's Tales and are now at 10:10 Games.</p>

<p>“Creating iconic products that emotionally connect fans to their favorite fandoms is critical to each product portfolio decision,” said Andrew Perlmutter, CEO of Funko. “By partnering with 10:10 Games and utilizing the best creators in the business, we will have the talent to deliver games that reflect Funko’s unique look and feel across its lines and varied products.”</p>

<p>This quote implies Funko's stylistic characters with large heads and black eyes could be used for the game. Given the developers' track record of making games that feature hundreds of playable characters, it's not unreasonable to think this title may unite many popular brands that have gotten the Funko treatment. For now, all we have is a teaser trailer, which you can view above.</p>]]></summary>

In a lengthy development update, they say the switch should make it easier to patch and maintain the game after release, among other benefits. They also show off some fancy creator tools, and say Hytale won't release in 2023.

      <p>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is the highly anticipated sequel to Fallen Order that brings back Cal Kestis likely in a Jedi Knight role. The game doesn't have a release date yet and was only shown once in a <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/05/27/star-wars-jedi-survivor-continues-cal-kestis-quest-in-2023">trailer</a>, but will soon get its first action figure. Hasbro just revealed a six-inch Black Series action figure for the KX Security Droid, which will make its debut in the sequel game.</p>

      <p>Stray has been out in the wild for a couple of days now, which means players have had plenty of time to answer one burning question: what did you name the cat?</p>

<p>The game’s furry protagonist lacks an official name. As you explore the post-apocalyptic world, have you given it one yourself? If so, what name have you settled on?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Admittedly, I’m still figuring that out myself. I still have a good ways to go in Stray, and I’ve batted around a few options as I hopped across rooftops and meowed at robots. Some are more elaborate, like "Chester A. Tabby II" (the successor to my Palico’s name in Monster Hunter: World); others are more simple, like “Creamsicle," which has been growing on me.&nbsp;I’m hoping your responses inspire&nbsp;me to concoct the purr-fect moniker. I'm sorry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So let’s hear it: what do you call the cat in Stray? There are no wrong answers. Well, unless you named it “Dog.” Then we’ll have to snitch on you to the Cat Police. The Cats-apo? I'm going to stop now. Share your responses below!</p>]]></summary>

      <p>A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy&nbsp;we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by <em>Shameless</em> star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66.

I also like one where you get to be a bit creative and build according to your whims as much as to necessity. The Final Earth 2 is an ant farm kind of game that places very few limits on what you can build where, and lets you cheaply restructure as needed even if you mess it up.
The idea is you build vertically, with each building taking up a block, and your people freely travelling through all of them to get to work or home or the pub. Everyone else who plays it seems to build enormous, elaborate, impressively well organised structures that are even kind of beautiful. I build a random pile of crap. I am absolutely rubbish at it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new indie horror game released today has challenged players to beat it within Steam's two-hour window to claim a refund. Creatively styled Refund Me If You Can, the game puts you in the unenviable shoes of Sarah as she tries to evade monsters in her nightmare and escape a darkened maze. If you did take up the challenge like RPS vid-bud Liam did then you’d have two hours to beat the game, and two weeks from purchase to claim your refund. It didn't go well for Liam, as you can see in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s kind of remarkable how little we really know about Nvidia’s next gaming graphics cards, the RTX 40 series. AMD are openly working on next-gen, RDNA 3-based Radeon GPUs, and Intel are gearing up for the full launch of their Arc Alchemist cards before the end of summer – yet there’s not been so much as a single presentation slide on Nvidia’s wares. Not the kind of hype-building you’d expect, given how many of the current generation’s best graphics cards have GeForce badges.


Arriving to fill that info void are, inevitably, leaks. If you don’t regularly hang out in PC hardware circles, know that there’s a veritable cottage industry of in-the-know insiders: anonymous but widely known tipsters like Greymon55 and kopite7kimi, who’ve shared enough accurate details on previous GPU and CPU launches that at least some of their sources are solid. Recently, unannounced Nvidia cards like the RTX 4070, RTX 4080 and especially the RTX 4090 have become this industry’s hottest commodities, meaning leakers are also the primary source of GeForce details for the gaming tech world at large.

That’s why it’s awesome to see someone using the power of publicly accessible AI to generate fantasy mugshots for classic examples of the genre such as Baldur’s Gate. Indie app dev and documentary editor Alex Hay has created some great examples, which he’s shared on Twitter with Baldur’s Gate: Enhanced Edition devs Beamdog and their CEO Trent Oster.

      <p>Warner Bros. Montreal's character spotlights have given us detailed looks at <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/summer-game-fest/2022/06/09/new-gotham-knights-trailer-shows-off-a-variant-nightwing-suit-and">Nightwing</a> and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/06/28/robins-gotham-knights-toolkit-includes-teleportation-and-slingshots">Robin</a>, and now we get a good look at Batgirl's combat prowess in Gotham Knights. In the trailer above, we see her acrobatic maneuvers make short work of a gang. The footage also shows what appears to be a boss fight and a couple of alternate skins that players can unlock for Barbara Gordon.</p>

<p>Slated to release on October 25 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, Gotham Knights tells the story of a Batman-less superhero world and shows how his wards rise to take his place. The playable characters are Robin, Nightwing, Red Hood, and Batgirl. You can play whoever you want, and it won't disrupt the game's cooperative play. Warner Bros. allows two Batgirls to run together, should players wish to attain an Elseworlds vibe.</p>

<p>The skins shown in the video will likely need to be unlocked by finding blueprints and acquiring the proper crafting materials to build them.</p>

<p>Following the success of Rocksteady's Arkham series and Warner Bros. Montreal's contribution, Gotham Knights has enormous shoes to fill. Here's hoping it's every bit as good as the titles mentioned. We need another great Arkham-like game.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>In a lengthy behind-the-scenes video, Naughty Dog's development team walks through the changes players can expect from The Last of Us Part I, a high-end PlayStation 5 remake that should look just as good as its sequel. While the story beats will be mostly the same, Naughty Dog has reworked most of the gameplay and visuals.</p>

<p>Along with increased realism in the character models, players can expect seamless transitions between sequences, enhanced enemy and buddy A.I., more breakable objects in combat, accessibility features galore, and even a few new ways to play the game.</p>

<p>If you want to see how far you make it before dying, you can play a new permadeath mode. Naughty Dog has also added a speed run mode to see how quickly players get through the story.</p>

<p>Your time revisiting this amazing game is rewarded with new unlockables, like outfits for Ellie and Joel and a model viewer. The Last of Us Part 1 is slated to release on PlayStation 5 and PC on September 2.</p>

<p>Are you excited to revisit this classic? If so, will you play The Last of Us Part II right after you finish it?</p>]]></summary>

According to <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/21/23272848/ubisoft-delays-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora" target="_blank">The Verge</a></em>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot explained in the earnings call that the company plans to make the Avatar franchise a larger gaming brand and that, in regards to Frontiers of Pandora, “It is important for us that we come with something that is perfect.”</p>

<p>Ubisoft had been quiet&nbsp;on Frontiers of Pandora since its big reveal during E3 2021, but it was assumed the game would launch sometime this holiday to coincide with the December 16 theatrical premiere of <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em>. The first-person action game is built in the Snowdrop Engine, and&nbsp;players control a Na’vi in a new area of Pandora called the Western Frontier. Frontiers of Pandora is being developed by Massive Entertainment, the team behind The Divison. You can watch the E3 reveal trailer below.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>If you've spent any time on Twitter, you might've seen Stray was released. And you know what? It's <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/stray/furry-friends" target="_blank">pretty good</a>! So good, in fact, that <a href="https://twitter.com/CatsWatchStray" target="_blank">cats seem to love it</a>. But what do dogs (the superior pet, if we're being honest with ourselves) think about this feline adventure?&nbsp;</p>

<p>We've enlisted Regan, my real-life chihuahua, to help us play Stray. Watch as she almost certainly immediately falls asleep in my&nbsp;lap while I&nbsp;play&nbsp;the first hour or so. If you have any questions, feel free to jump in chat and ask!&nbsp;</p>

<p>But that's not all. I recently convinced Editor-in-Chief Andrew Reiner to let me&nbsp;use&nbsp;my corporate credit card to buy a Gundam model. So, legally, I&nbsp;now have&nbsp;to do something work-related with it. Let's build it on stream. That's right, it's a double feature tonight, folks! Cats and Mecha. What a time to be alive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's all going down on our <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gameinformer" target="_blank">Twitch channel</a> at&nbsp;3:30 PM Central Time (4:30 PM Eastern / 1:30 PM Pacific). See you there!</p>]]></summary>

<p>Every road trip has bumps along the way - unexpected potholes, constant traffic, and extra pit stops. There are stretches of nothingness, and your numb mind tries to pass the time until you reach the destination. Sometimes the open road instills a sense of freedom; other times, you feel trapped. However, the memories that help us power through the tedium often stick – singing along to a classic, having a heart-to-heart conversation, or observing a surprising sight.</p>

      <p>The future of Destiny 2 will be revealed in a livestream showcase set to air on August 23.</p>

<p>Bungie tweeted a&nbsp;cryptic video, posted below,&nbsp;and sent an equally vague press release that simply says&nbsp;to expect “exciting details about what’s next for Destiny 2.” The most likely announcement is an update on the Lightfall expansion, which is technically still scheduled to arrive this year despite <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/destiny-2-the-witch-queen/putting-all-the-pieces-together">The Witch Queen</a> launching only a few months ago (due to a delay). Perhaps Bungie will narrow down that release window, but beyond Lightfall, your guess is as good as ours.&nbsp;</p>


<blockquote class="tw-align-center twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Witness what's next.<br />

<p>You’ll have to watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bungie" target="_blank">Bungie’s Twitch channel</a> that day to find out, though the developer has not revealed a&nbsp;start time or disclosed how long it will be.

As some of you might know, I'm that badminton guy. That guy who always mentions he's away at a tournament sweating and eating bananas. That guy who believes Gears Of War and badminton have more in common than you might think, and reckon Gears is the closest thing we'll get to a proper badminton game.
Badminton aside, running is another pastime that's become dearer to me over the last few years. And that's a universally understood form of exercise, right? Especially when compared to the likes of badminton. So, why are there no proper games about running? I'd like one.
