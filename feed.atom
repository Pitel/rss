I admire that so many developers and publishers out there are still chasing that kart racing checkered flag. Because there is one clear winner in this category, every other racer we get is just lucky to finish as a runner-up. Over the past few years, we’ve seen several new games in the genre come and go with little fanfare. I don’t know if the same fate will befall LEGO 2K Drive, but what I do know is the racing in this game is legitimately fun.
It’s just, well, a good chunk of everything around that racing is rather lackluster.

The first time I went down into the Depths in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, I figured it would be a fairly straightforward experience. I had seen the glimpses of it in pre-release footage, with some lights staving off ever-present darkness, and figured it would be a neat side venture. A curiosity to explore, when my interest fell away from the overworld of sky islands.
Boy, was I wrong. The Depths aren't just another location in Tears of the Kingdom. They are a massive addition, a second-half rounding out the world above. And the Depths bring a new, fascinating, terrifying kind of horror to the Zelda series.
Note: Mild location spoilers for the Depths will follow, but I'll try to avoid any story-related spoile…]]></summary>

The recent Street Fighter 6 demo might be fairly limited in terms of its characters and modes, but that hasn't stopped the highly dedicated Fighting Game Community from already delving into its secrets and mechanics — Case in point: This Drive Parry shortcut, that could prove very useful in Versus play.
Street Fighter 6's Parry mechanic allows players to perform essentially Perfect Defense against any incoming attacks, by holding MP + MK together. However, once in Parry state, the player can then instigate a dash cancel ("Drive Rush") by tapping forward twice while in the Parry state. This allows for a fast turnaround and advance after blocking long-distance moves such as projectiles and supers.
However, some players have discovered an alternate way to activate Driv…]]></summary>

It's Saturday, and that means it's time to take a look at this week's Arcade Archives offering — Once again, publisher Hamster is looking to the stars to save it, with the arrival of another galaxy-blasting shmup from yesteryear: Ark Area, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Developed by UPL and released to the coin-op market in 1987, Ark Area is a multidirectional shmup that chooses not to follow any strict horizontal/vertical plane to provide full 360, alien-zapping action. A loose sequel to UPL's own Nova 2001, Ark Area puts one or two players in the pilot seats of cute lil' ships, which must fend off extensive waves of enemies, which can attack from all directions. In typical shmup fashion, power-ups can be acquired to increase firepower, and meaty boss battles are peppered throughout the game's 23 stages.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber SBH Gameplays.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJqDE7pAJpE
Following a fairly standard run on the arcade market, Ark Area simply faded into the annals of time, only to be resurrected by this here Arcade Archives release. It's a fun, formative little trip into shmupland, but even on release,  Ark Area was already being eclipsed by some of its flashier and more exciting contemporaries. Still, for completionists, you now have another finger-mashing zapper to add to your collection, no doubt bursting at the seams by this point.
Ark Area is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at $8. Next week's Arcade Archives release will be Namco's excellent run 'n' gunner, Rolling Thunder 2.

If you think one playthrough of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is impressive, series producer Eiji Aonuma recently revealed he has already completed the game "about 20 times".
In part five of Nintendo's latest 'Ask the Developer' series, Aonuma mentioned how there were times when he had to rush ahead and clear the main story from "start to finish" when testing the game. His advice though is to take your time and don't just rush straight to the ending.

The most considerable game industry development in the last decade has been the rise of live-service games. When MMOs first launched, the idea of an always-online game was considered a novelty, but today most AAA studios are making live-service titles, and most non-live-service games from those companies have online features.
The modern live-service genre has several hallmarks, with temporary, short-term events being the most known and infamous. However, many forget that this style of ephemeral limited-time storytelling isn't a new invention. In fact, Nintendo's forgotten Satellaview pioneered the concept in 1995 with a fascinating but forgotten Zelda game.

Crazy Taxi is like a wonderful time capsule. It captures the best part of the ‘00s in perfect stasis: the part that was basically still the late ‘90s. It was a time when we celebrated the identity of being an asshole. Consumerism was both rampant and celebrated. Wait, that all makes it sound awful. Maybe it was, but in kind of a funny way. And although the developers probably didn’t intend it to be, Crazy Taxi encapsulates all of it.
My first experience with the series was Crazy Taxi on the GameCube. Acclaim ported the Sega arcade title right when Nintendo’s first disc-based console was fresh on the shelves. There wasn’t a lot to play at the time, so I wound up playing everything. I have some great memories of playing Crazy Taxi with my mother. One of my favorite arcade experienc…]]></summary>

Behaviour Interactive has announced two new spin-off games for asymmetrical horror game Dead by Daylight. Supermassive Games and Midwinter Entertainment are both working on spin-off projects within the Dead by Daylight universe.
Announced today during the Dead by Daylight 7th Anniversary stream, we've got a few details about what each team is working on. Here's the relevant section of today's stream, via Gematsu:

Supermassive Games, well-known for titles like Until Dawn and The Quarry, is making what you'd expect: an "intense, narrative" game with life-or-death choices, set in the omniverse of Dead by Daylight. It will have a new cast of characters, too. It seems like a pretty natural fit, as …]]></summary>

He's the ultimate evil that necessitates the perpetual rebirth of the legendary hero. Since Ganon takes several incarnations over the course of the games, we decided to rank his various appearances in the Legend of Zelda franchise.
Before you proceed, be warned: This list contains spoilers for all the games listed, though we did try to be appropriately vague for the Tears of the Kingdom entry for now.
For this list, we excluded Demise from Skyward Sword, as that isn't Ganon, as much as it is the evil force that will eventually create Ganon. We also left Hyrule Warriors Ganon off, as that version exi…]]></summary>

Dating sims have proven to be pretty resilient over the years. As genres have come and gone, virtual romance has certainly waxed and waned too; but it’s never fully disappeared, and in 2023, feels stronger than ever.
Appealing art, compelling narrative, and social gameplay elements are all compelling aspects of a game in their own right, so it should be little surprise that developers would eventually think to mash all of them together into a collage of electronic love. From early halcyon days at Tokimeki Memorial to Dream Daddy and Boyfriend Dungeon, developers have created a variety of romance stories in virtual landscapes over the years.

In recent years, the beat-'em-up, (or brawler, if you would prefer), genre has gone through a major renaissance. What was once confined to the golden coin-op age of the late '80s and early '90s — before falling short of expectations come the '00s — has found itself spraining fingers and cracking wrists once again — led by some bold new IPs and the return of some very familiar faces from the past.
In order to change with the times, these modern titles have been forced to add depth, variety, and longevity to what has mostly been a short-lived, quick-to-fatigue genre. In addition, the characters, worlds, and stories have been fleshed out to offer more context to the knuckle-dustin' action. And so, whether you're welcoming back franchises such as Streets o…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a change in the wind.
Given the sheer amount of time that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom had been in development, it was obvious that the game would make a number of quality-of-life improvements over its predecessor, Breath of the Wild.
We won't lie, there were moments in the run-up to its release in which we wondered just how different Tears of the Kingdom would wind up being. After all, we knew that the game would take place within the same world as Breath of the Wild and utilise the same visual style and general gameplay mechanics. But this is Nintendo we're talking about here. If something like Super Mario Galaxy 2 is anything to go by, we would have been perfectly happy with 'just' more of the same.

All those themes suggest a heavy, self-serious game. But Kujlevka's great strength is its levity. While not particularly funny, its consistent wry humour perfectly counterbalances all the talk of political chaos, existential futility, and petty greed. Its opening should have been a clue, really, considering you hang out with skeletons while drinking and commenting on the food on a train in outer space.

With a full suite of Super Mario Game Boy Advance titles hitting the Nintendo Switch, it's really easy to perk up and go "but what about that [X] other GBA thing I liked?" That system had so many bangers it's nearly impossible to keep track of them all, but one that really wormed its way into my heart forevermore is The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Four Swords: emphasis on the Four Swords bit.
This little sub-franchise ended up having a relatively long (albeit niche) lifespan, as it was brought back in anniversary form on the DS and the 3DS for a limited time. But what about the still-trapped-on-GameCube classic Zelda: Four Swords Adventures? Well, we might be waiting a bit longer for that one, which is a shame.
Watch our video on why Zelda: Four Swords Adventures is so special
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so5uRnRrS4Q
So what's the impetus for all this Four Swords talk (besides, I don't know, a massive Zelda release)?
Well, the Destructoid video team has cooked up a wonderful little retrospective on Four Swords Adventures, and it's definitely worth a watch. I have a lot of personal experience with this oddball project, complete with the full setup of the GameCube hub + Game Boy Advance controllers. At launch, I spent the entire weekend at my friend's house playing it, hosting various other people who dropped in and dropped out as we continued to forge onward. Years later we reunited for Four Swords Anniversary on the DS, and it felt so good.
Given that Four Swords Adventures came out in 2004 and has never seen the light of day on another system; it makes sense that a lot of people likely wouldn't have played it, or only heard its name in whispers. If you can't get a copy of it, at least you can relive those glory days by proxy with the video above!

The definitive edition of the dark fantasy action game Bleak Sword DX is coming to PC and Switch and it's...on the horizon! In a new trailer, Devolver Digital confirmed the Bleak Sword DX release date for June 8th on both platforms.
Originally released on Apple Arcade back in 2019, the enhanced version will include the original nine chapters in the Bleak Sword campaign and all three DLC chapters.  The gist is that you'll be taking down horrifying monsters across a variety of cursed battlefields with a variety of fierce weaponry and powerful magic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArQ5jZDHCSI
It apparently improves the original in every way
The improved version of the game will include a streamlined control system built specifically for PC and Switch. Utilizing the new controls you will be able to execute new attacks, parries, and counters against an enhanced enemy AI. Graphically the game has received graphical enhancements in every aspect. There are new post-processing effects, unique filters, an adaptive depth of field, and more. Particle effects, foliage, and even the weather have seen some improvements as well.
Additionally, Bleak Sword DX features three all-new game modes as well. First is a brand new randomizer campaign modifier that creates a remixed version of the original game. Next is a Boss Run gauntlet where you will face all 12 in-game bosses in a row with only one health bar. Last is an endless arena mode throwing increasingly difficult enemies at you until you suffer defeat. This is all accompanied by the epic score from award-winning composer Jim Guthrie and sound designer Joonas Turner. If you are looking for a challenging but rewarding action romp in a dark fantasy setting, be sure to check out the game when it releases early next month.
A demo for Bleak Sword DX is currently available on Steam!

If you're currently knee-deep in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, then chances are you're utterly obsessed with getting as many heart containers as possible.
These are a traditional goal in all Zelda games, and with good reason – the more you have, the more punishment Link can take. In both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, they have another layer of importance, with the games expecting you to obtain a certain amount before you can reach some areas or acquire powerful items.

But my affection for George Lucas' brain-baby is less about the stories and characters, and more about the general vibe of the galaxy itself. I love its retro-futurist junkpunk style, the rusty spaceships, dusty planets, and fusty aliens. That's why I've more fondness for games like Dark Forces and KotOR than any of the films or TV shows, as they let me poke around locations like Tatooine and Ord Mantell at my own pace.


Hence, the idea of being properly, immerse in Star Wars, to be physically surrounded by it and able to touch it, is probably my ultimate VR fantasy. Sod the imaginatively inert virtual spaces of Horizon Worlds, if Mark Zuckerberg really wanted to sell the Metaverse to me, he'd build the whole thing out in Mos Eisely chic, and let me run my own virtual cantina selling NFT space-drinks to legless bounty hunters and idiot Web3 prospectors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Walk on over
Epic Games has revealed the latest freebie for the EGS, and it's none other than the oddball cross-country adventure Death Stranding. Note that this is a full week of freebie availability (through May 25 at 11AM ET), which is a massive step up from the prior "24-hour use it or lose it" promotion that ran in December of 2022. All you need to do is follow the link here (or get it directly through the Epic Games launcher) and you're good to go.
When playing through Death Stranding pre-launch in complete isolation, I had no clue how the general public would respond to it. It was such a bizarre big swing, and perfectly on-brand for Kojima. But even without the Metal Gear name attached, it did fairly well for itself; spreading to multiple platforms beyond its PS4 launch, and a sequel is fully confirmed, amid other multimedia opportunities.
If you haven't played it yet, give it a go! I mean it's free for a week, so even if it's ultra-low on your priority list, you'll probably get around to clicking "forget password" on your lapsed Epic Games account at some point...right?!
What's next for Epic Games Store freebies?
Next up is another "mystery game" that Epic has been hyping for some time now, due out in five days. If you haven't already, bookmark this page and periodically go back to it and redeem whatever is there.

On May 26, Super Mario Advance, Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2, and Yoshi’s Island: Super Mario Advance 3 hit the service. First released throughout the early 2000s, these games are enhanced portable remakes of Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario World, and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island, respectively. 


Although the original versions of each game are already available in the NES/SNES libraries, the Advance series features several tweaks, such as Advance 2 giving Luigi his Super Mario Bros. 2 jump. These join Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3, which was in the initial batch of GBA titles, to complete the series. As a reminder, the GBA library is part of the Expansion Pack tier, the pricier upgraded version of Nintendo Switch Online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has been out for about a week, but yesterday marked the launch of its first post-release patch. Version 1.1.1 of the game fixes one very specific problem, but also ambiguously addresses issues to improve the gameplay experience. You find the patch notes below, as well as on Nintendo's website.
Fixed issue where, sometimes, the player could not clear main quest “The Closed Door,” even if they fulfilled the conditions to advance the quest.
	
If you have already encountered this issue, you will be able to clear the quest by downloading this update data.
Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.
Despite both Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild being incredibly solid games out of the gate, even Zelda is not immune to patches, but Nintendo tends to keep the changes vague. Many of Breath of the Wild's patch notes simply pointed to the updates making the game a more pleasant experience. It seems the trajectory of Tears of the Kingdom's patch notes might receive the same ambiguous details if the second bullet point is an indication of what's to come.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ten years after its initial release - and about three years after it came to PC - former Wii U exclusive The Wonderful 101: Remastered is getting some much deserved love. Platinum Games bought their mini superhero game to PC through crowdfunding, where backers blew past several stretch goals including one that promised a future DLC drop. Today, the game received its first bit of free new content in the form of a side-scrolling shoot ‘em up called The Wonderful One: After School Hero.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yahoooooo?
So, how about those May 2023 Switch Online offerings? With Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom taking the world by storm, it would make sense if Nintendo completely forgot about them, but late last night we did indeed get an update: and we're getting not one, not two, but three Mario GBA games for the Switch Online + Expansion Pack catalog.
This isn't much of a surprise, as Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3 was released in February for Expansion Pack subscribers, so this is just completing the set. According to Nintendo, all three games are due out on May 26, and it seems like this is what we're getting for the month.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRyFVwRqUKI
Are these Mario GBA games worth playing?
As someone who owned all three on the GBA when they came out: kinda!
Mario Advance 1 is likely going to be one of the more popular picks, as it transforms Super Mario Bros. 2 quite a bit: remixing the game's layouts in clever ways while adding challenges. But the art and audio styles are polarizing, and ultimately, as the game goes on, you notice less and less of those stark changes: to the point where some people just prefer to play the original (which is on Switch via the NES app).
That sentiment also applies to Super Mario World and Yoshi's Island, which are both on the SNES Switch app, but there are plenty of GBA-version fans out there who might sway you on those.
Yeah but can we get any version of Four Swords on Switch though?
This is a perfect opportunity for Nintendo to re-release Four Swords on the Switch: which arrived back in 2002 thanks to the "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Four Swords" GBA release. We'll also settle for the Four Swords Anniversary edition that came to the DS in 2011 (and the 3DS in 2013), and if they can spare the time; a remaster/remake of Four Swords Adventures from the GameCube, which would play nice with the multi-system local play nature of the Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you think they'll follow through?
In case you missed it, Take-Two's newest financial report had a lot of bullish claims, championed by current CEO Strauss Zelnick. In addition to targeting an unprecedented amount of revenue in FY2025, some concerns were raised over specific platforms: most notably, the Switch, and a potential shift to updated current-gen consoles.
Speaking to Gamesindustry.biz, Zelnick notes that they're putting a lot on the line when it comes to their "immersive core" games, which currently consist of WWE 2K24, NBA 2K24...and an "eagerly-anticipated new IP from one of [their] premiere studios." But what about the Switch? Well, that's TBD.
There is...something there, at least. LEGO 2K Drive does indeed launch today on Switch, with the dubious Star Wars Hunters coming later this year following a delay. When asked about future support in FY2025, Zelnick gave a rather muted response, noting: "Yes, I think we'll continue to support it." When pressed about a potential "console refresh" (read: a boosted/souped-up theoretical Xbox Series X or PS5 "Pro"), Zelnick said that "we probably will" see it happen, and that "they [console refreshes] did not affect the business very much," referring to the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. The Zynga acquisition and faith in the mobile market are also a heavy focus for Take-Two going into the next few fiscal years.
Well, with all that info, it seems like we know where 2K stands going forward. They're taking a "wait and see" approach with Switch, they're focusing on PC, mobile, and Sony/Microsoft consoles, and they won't change much strategically if there's another "half-generation bump." So mostly business as usual.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Does that pommel horse have a grenade launcher?" is one of many bizarre questions I found myself asking while playing HROT. This Slavic shooter revels in the strange, straddling the line between hyper-bleak Soviet satire and goofy memetic joke factory. This isn't the best thing about HROT, we'll get to that in a couple of paragraphs. But the balancing of these two personality strands is what defines HROT's quality. At the outset, they exist in perfect symbiosis, but the relationship becomes less stable as the game goes on.
The year is 1986, and something is seriously wrong in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. What that might be isn't explicitly stated, but given the year, the ambient chatter of Geiger counters, and the soldiers vomiting through their gasmasks as they prowl the abandoned streets, a nuclear disaster at an infamous Ukrainian power plant isn't a vast stretch of the imagination. In any case, anyone who wasn't killed by the fallout is now being hunted by an army of (presumably Russian, but again, it isn't explicated) soldiers. Emerging from a bomb shelter beneath Prague's Kosmonautů Metro Station (now named Háje), you take it upon yourself to defend your glorious homeland from these invaders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you were having issues with The Closed Door, update your game
Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is out, and it's wowing people with its relatively stable performance, despite its massive additions to the core world map of Hyrule. That said there are still some lingering issues to address, and thankfully, they've been minor thus far.
Version 1.1.1 was released late on May 18, and it fixes a progress-blocking issue with the main story quest The Closed Door. Apparently, some folks were having problems with it "even if they fulfilled the conditions to advance the quest," but now that's fixed, among the classic vague "several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience" line from Nintendo.
Without spoiling anything, The Closed Door is a very early game quest, so if it's bugged, it's super annoying. At the very least it's easy to just do a clean wipe and restart, but simply updating your game to version 1.1.1 is the ideal situation.
You can find the full patch notes below!
Ver. 1.1.1 (Released May 18, 2023) [Full patch notes]
General Updates
Fixed issue where, sometimes, the player could not clear main quest “The Closed Door,” even if they fulfilled the conditions to advance the quest.

If you have already encountered this issue, you will be able to clear the quest by downloading this update data.
Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Positively shocking.
Confusion abounds with this one. This isn’t the same Shockman that was originally released for the TurboGrafx-16 back in 1991, which was a localisation of Japan's Shubibinman 2. This, Cyber Citizen Shockman, is a new 2023 translation of the original Shubibinman game from 1989; and frankly, that’s the most special thing about it.
Here, a map overworld offers a choice of multiple paths, each leading to a very brief platforming stage scattered with enemies and pitfalls to leap over and avoid. Each has a boss, ranging from nice-looking mecha-styled things or well-rendered monsters, requiring little except rapid spamming early-on, and more concerted strategy later, depending on your health. Visiting the map screen offers up brief dialogue exchanges and the option to heal yourself or buy weapon upgrades with gold acquired during the stage. Deaths will slightly penalise your gold bounty, but hostages you save with each boss defeat also offer transient bonuses, health-ups, and occasionally become permanent map fixtures, like the dedicated healing nurse. Boosting weapon power is your modus operandi, eventually acquiring the chargeable Shockbeam - an addition that makes things much more enjoyable and shifts your approach to enemy negotiations.

I know you’ve all been waiting for your favourite PC gaming-focused website to offer their take on it so there you go. It’s properly, properly good. The best open-world adventure since Elden Ring, except arguably better because it doesn’t pull your trousers down and point out the colour of your underwear every time you dare to explore a forest or watch a sunset.


As you’ve probably seen, the game’s biggest new draw is “Ultrahand”, which allows Link to pick up loose objects and glue them together. Three logs make a raft. A plank and four wheels make a car. Two stones and a log make a... Ahem. You get the idea. In addition to this are “Zonai Devices”, components that give life and movement to your doohickeys. A fan pushes your raft across the lake. A steering stick lets you manoeuvre your little car. It’s a marvellous construction system that leverages the pre-existing physics engine seen in the game’s predecessor, Breath Of The Wild, to startling results. Does this all sound familiar?

Today though one of these arms is even better value than usual, as there's a ridiculous 40% off voucher available on Amazon's take on the Ergotron LX, dropping this high-end monitor arm from £81 to just £49.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even more wizards and legends
The spellcasting roguelite Wizard of Legend is getting a sequel. Wizard of Legend II is a follow-up to 2018's Wizard of Legend, and it's shifting from 2D to 3D.
Announced during today's Humble Games Showcase 2023, Wizard of Legend II is being published by Humble and developed by Dead Mage, the studio behind Children of Morta. The publisher confirmed during today's showcase that Wizard of Legend is now a Humble-owned IP. Original Wizard of Legend developer Contingent99 is "on board" and consulting on the project, according to Humble.
One big difference between Wizard of Legend II and its predecessor is in their style. While you still have the robed rogue mage look, the sequel is opting for an overhead 3D view rather than the pixel 2D style from the first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdnI5FGQ2Sg
It sounds like other elements remain similar, though. Up to four players can hop in, maintaining the co-op appeal of the first Wizard of Legend. It's a roguelite adventure, with plenty of spell combinations to explore and interactions to discover. The adventure seems to evolve each time, so it's once again aiming for a run-based dungeon dive.
Becoming legend
There's no planned release date at this point in time, just a confirmation that it's in development and a Steam page. I did like the original Wizard of Legend, so I'm curious to see what Dead Mages makes with the franchise.
I'm also curious to see what Contingent99 could get up to, as well. As much as I like a new take on the Wizard of Legend, Contingent99's action and art were a solid mix. I'm hopeful that team's got something in the works, too.
You can follow and wishlist Wizard of Legend II here.

PowerWash Simulator is heading to an interesting place to be power washing: an underwater locale. A SpongeBob SquarePants Special Pack will arrive this summer for PowerWash Simulator, bringing the serene cleaning simulation to Bikini Bottom.
The pack was created in collaboration with Nickelodeon, and will include a character model makeover to make the player fit in a bit more with the ocean-floor setting. No exact date has been set yet, but PowerWash Simulator's SpongeBob pack will arrive sometime this summer for $7.99.
Six new maps will arrive as part of the pack. They'll spotlight Conch Street, the Bikini Bottom Bus, the Krusty Krab, the Mermalair, and more. There will also be ten achievements to hunt, and it seems like there's some story behind all the muck that's appeared in Bikini Bottom.

If nautical clean-up be something you wish
Developer FuturLab says we'll hear more about a release date sometime in the coming weeks, so we'll hopefully know soon when the cleaning crew can head underwater. Still, washing-underwater situation aside, this is a pretty interesting crossover.
Honestly, PowerWash Simulator has really been landing some wild crossovers. It wasn't that long ago that the Final Fantasy VII Remake pack went live. Now, we're going from Midgar to Bikini Bottom. And I've heard fairly good things about the crossovers thus far, too.
PowerWash Simulator really became a surprise hit, finding a chill vibe in a slow, methodical simulator. It's nice to see the team continue adding wild new reasons to keep going back to it.
The SpongeBob SquarePants Special Pack for PowerWash Simulator will arrive for PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Switch sometime this summer.

Some good news for fans of the fun and suitably silly animated series, Sonic Prime — Netflix has confirmed that a new season of episodes will be premiering on the streaming service this July.
Premiering back in December of last year, Sonic Prime sees Sonic the Hedgehog thrust into a multiverse known as the "Shatterverse" whereupon he embarks on a series of adventures with various alt-reality versions of his dopey friends, including Tails, Knuckles, Amy Rose, and Rogue.
The first season of dimension-hopping escapades saw The Blue Blur visiting a futureworld, the prehistoric era, a pirate world, and more. Also featured in the series was an entire cavalcade of Dr. Robotnik variants, which had all formed a council with to take over the entire Shatterverse.
https://twitter.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/1658852487854473217?s=20
Running for eight episodes, the show was considered a hit by the Sonic the Hedgehog community, with critics and fans praising the style, animation, scripting. and voice acting on offer, even if the writing was criticized for being a little trite and repetitive. A co-production of Netflix Animation, WildBrain Studios, and Man of Action Entertainment, a total of 24 episodes were commissioned in all, which suggests the new season will feature a further eight adventures, with the remain eight to be screened later this year.
Sonic Prime Season 2 premieres exclusively on Netflix on July 13. Season One is available to watch now.

We're back on for a hoppin' eShop week everyone! Following Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and...pretty much nothing else, two marquee games are featured this week, including LEGO 2K Drive (which we'll have a review of shortly!), plus Convergence: A League of Legends Story.
Of course, some of these game titles just beg to be followed up on, and this week it's "911 Cannibal." Here's the elevator pitch: "In this horror game you are a kidnapped teenager. Maniac - cannibal keeps you in his creepy house. Hide and search items that can help you find a way out of the scary place and survive the nightmare. Solve puzzles to get to inaccessible places. And do not forget about attentiveness - you need to carefully cover up your tracks so that the maniac does n…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The game is afoot
Playstack and Color Gray Games' The Case of the Golden Idol is heading to Nintendo Switch. The detective game will arrive on Nintendo's handheld console next week on May 25, 2023.
Both the base game and the recently released DLC, Golden Idol Mysteries: The Spider of Lanka, will be coming to the Switch eShop. The Case of the Golden Idol will go for $17.99, while The Spider of Lanka DLC will cost $5.99.
Publisher Playstack has put up a trailer, showing a little bit about what the game's about and how the Switch version will handle Golden Idol.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shlRIGFUfYc
The Case of the Golden Idol is a detective game where the player is taken through a series of vignettes. Each one centers around a gruesome death, as well as a golden idol that seems to be causing quite a ruckus. The player has to observe the scene, pulling keywords from text and other sources to then fill in answers about what's happened.
Whodunnit?
Color Gray Games' mystery has some clear similarities to games like Return of the Obra Dinn. It's pretty open in terms of letting the player try, fail, and try again to solve the mystery, but having a definite set of options and clear framework might help less investigatively-inclined folks solve their way through it.
I played The Case of the Golden Idol last year in a Discord server with friends, and I can't recommend that format enough. It's an enjoyable game to think through and solve together, and the revelations you uncover case-over-case are pretty great. The art style of Golden Idol is also unlike most other games out there; initially, I was a bit hesitant about it. But over time, the look of Golden Idol grew on me. I haven't played the Spider of Lanka DLC yet, but it's good to see this team is still exploring the world and structures it built for Golden Idol.
The Case of the Golden Idol hits Nintendo Switch on May 25.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's difficult not to start out by namedropping Dwarf Fortress. Songs Of Syx will compare to probably every colony sim you've played, in fact, but it feels like a fundamentally different game conceptually.
The usual parts are there. Chop some trees, chip some stones, and chep some crops to get your pioneers' basic needs met, then get to expanding. But Syx isn't interested in testing you or manufacturing drama. It's not about surviving, not about building a happy little colony. It's about how growth changes not just the scale, but the nature of a settlement. Despite similarities with its influences, it defines itself with a different dynamic, a whole different ethos to its peers. And it's one that even playing it my own awkward way hasn't broken.

We (attempt to) talk about our favourite Zelda games of the past, our favourite Zelda-likes on PC, and I explain how Tears Of The Kingdom works to Nate and James. Honestly though, we don't make it very far, because it turns out the lads haven't ever played a Zelda game before. At least, Nate might have. We're not entirely sure. 


We do also talk about what we've been playing this week as well - which include some old favourites, some new secrets, and Gaben's tiny hands - and give some great new recommendations. Nate also delivers a very involved mini-game involving beans and aliens, and James doesn't talk about the Asus ROG Ally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Case of the Golden Idol was one of 2022’s best hidden gems that only PC players have been able to enjoy. Fortunately, Switch owners can put on their thinking hats when the dark mystery game heads to the platform next week.
On May 25, The Case of the Golden Idol lands on Switch alongside its recently released expansion, The Spider of Lanka. Both titles can be purchased separately or together in a bundle. The award-winning game takes place in the 18th century and tasks you with solving a mystery spanning decades over 11 bizarre, interconnected deaths. Each scenario is presented as static scenes where players must carefully observe the environment to find clues revealing who each character is, how the person died, and the chronological order of events. The Spider of Lanka serves as a prequel that adds three additional cases. 
The Switch version sports a redesigned UI to better accommodate a controller-based experience. If this is the first you've heard of the game, the trailer below provides a good idea of what to expect.


As a fan of The Case of the Golden Idol, it's great to see it come to more platforms, and Switch should be an especially good fit. Will you be giving the game a shot on Switch? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sexy both on AND offline
No More Robots has announced that the FPS spin-off of Hypnospace Outlaw has a release date. Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is dropping on June 1st.
Hypnospace Outlaw was an extremely special game. While it took place in a fantasy reality, it created a loving time capsule of Web 1.0. The developers created various fictional characters to present a very accurate depiction of the internet in its awkward adolescence. It was rather spot on, and I know this because I lived Web 1.0.
One of the characters was this edgy teenager called Zane Lofton. Like many teenagers, Zane lived in a self-centered fantasy land where he was the king of cool. Slayers X is a further exploration of that character, this time through an FPS that he and his friend developed. It looks to drag us by the hair right back to 1998 when teenagers tinkered with Doom and Duke Nukem 3D modding tools.
I also did that, but I wasn’t a teenager yet, so nothing ever came of it aside from a few poorly textured rooms.
https://youtu.be/-bZRPUTNJBc
Zane Rocks
We’ve had plenty of shooters try to recapture the ‘90s to varying degrees of success, but Slayers X might be the first one to try to present itself through the lens of a character living at the time. As such, it’s packed with everything edgy teenagers found cool back then: bad guys, real-world environments, and poop. It’s trite and tacky, and that’s exactly how it should be.
As a fan of everything jank-pop, Slayers X absolutely sings to me. Hypnospace Outlaw still lives in a corner of my brain, and I’ve been excited to see more from the concept. The spin-off was announced a while back, and I was recently wondering if I had somehow missed it. I’m glad that’s not the case, and I can resume being excited.
Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer releases on PC June 1. It will also be on Xbox Game Pass the same day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lords of the Fallen is coming this October, and despite the good news it lands on the unluckiest day of the year. Thankfully, a lengthy trailer gives us the good fortune of enjoying some action-packed gameplay footage. 
This reimagining/reboot of its 2014 predecessor is coming on Friday, October 13. A big new trailer set to Iron Maiden packs in a ton of metal-infused action that shows off the game's Unreal Engine 5-rendered graphics. 


It's been a long road for Lords of the Fallen, which began life as Lords of the Fallen 2 years ago before development restarted from scratch. It was re-announced as The Lords of the Fallen last year before reverting back to its original name. The Souls-inspired game's open world is five times larger than the original's and supports online co-op. The combat has also been retuned to be faster and more fluid, and developer Hexworks promises the game to be an overall expansive action RPG experience. 
We're looking forward to seeing the result of this overhaul when the game comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

I think it's because the game is an open world kart racer, a combination of words that sing to my nostalgic love for old-school racers, where as a kid I'd worshipped the majesty of Muppets Race Mania and Mario Kart (this is the only time I mention Mario Kart). In all respects, 2K Drive nails Lego's historically strong presentation, with slick courses and a genuinely lovely combo of grassy hills and dusty plains which certainly seem like a chip off Forza Horizon's shiny paint job. Building is upheld too, as a mighty garage lets anyone create an interesting set of wheels. The wheels start spinning, though, as the live service gates start closing. I don't think the gates totally shut off what's meant to be a fun time, but it certainly tries. Even an innocent kart racer can't escape the perils of live service, it seems.

Following up on the conclusions of both Mortal Kombat 11 and its Aftermath expansion, Liu Kang is now an all-powerful fire god that rules over the reset timeline he created. Despite creating a peaceful new era, danger still looms its ugly head. The extremely violent cinematic trailer gives us glimpses of familiar (mostly masked) faces, though expect new twists on classic rivalries. 


Per an official press release, the following fighters are confirmed so far:

In case you missed it, Niantic made another decision that's been unpopular with the Pokemon Go community, which has been a trend since the game came into being. The team is up-charging for remote raids, and will limit the amount of times you can partake in them. It's one of a series of reversals that gave folks hope that Pokemon Go would improve before a core feature was rug-pulled.
That was weeks ago. Speaking to Dot Esports, several team members have finally responded to the backlash. Michael Steranka, Pokemon Go director, started off by saying that they've "taken note" of the backlash and that it's "hard to ignore." Steranka is personally tagged in some of these tweets, and like Destiny developer Bungie often says before they immediately…]]></summary>

NetherRealm Studios has revealed the next title in its legendary fighting game series, Mortal Kombat — As teased in recent weeks, the now officially titled Mortal Kombat 1 will launch September 19, 2023.
A reveal trailer, which follows on from the events of Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath, sees the newly designated Fire God Liu Kang reshaping the universe in a time of glory, peace, and prosperity. But, as we all know, the best-laid plans of mice and men do not always come to pass — And the interdimensional return of the nefarious sorcerer, Shang Tsung, brings about the chaos of war to this seemingly pleasant, and hugely prosperous new era.

There's...a lot to parse in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, when it comes to the Ultrahand/creation aspect of the game. Now you can basically ignore it entirely, and just beat the game cleanly, like Breath of the Wild. But if you want, there's a ton of tools at your disposal to craft all sorts of helpful vehicles and contraptions that can nudge you along. Hmm, it sure would be helpful if someone could create a database to track them all: well, Twitter user AKREW Daniel Luu did just that!
The site is called ZeldaBuilds.gg, and allows users to sign up and share their own creations, or peruse others for inspiration. It also has a fantastic "materials" section to help break down all of the game's Zonai Devices, in case you're getting overwhelmed. Not every creation uses every possible part; so it's a great way to take stock. And if you get really into it and want to amass a pile of devices to bust out and start creating stuff at any time, there's a handy list of all of the Zonai dispensers right here. Make sure you do not click the "uses" link unless you want a few boss spoilers though!
Orbital Strike Laser Cannon
u/0KdQ6 in tearsofthekingdom


There are some real gems on there
One of the most impressive builds shared around is the "Satellite Laser Cannon," also called the orbital strike laser cannon in some places, which you can see in action above. The gist is that it literally creates an autonomous robot that flies around and lasers enemies mercilessly, essentially as an additional party member. The creator in question above has a ton of battery power to pull it off, so they earned it!
Other handy creations include skateboards, bikes, a combat buggy, planes, and tanks. Oh, and of course, devices for messing with Koroks.

Arc System Works has finally lifted the lid on the final Season 2 DLC character headed to the gorgeous scrapper Guilty Gear Strive — And, of no surprise to anybody whatsoever, next week will see the coming of the powerful central figure in the current GG timeline, Asuka R#, more commonly known as "That Man".
The powerful warrior-sorcerer, whose aim to bring peace and pleasance to Earth led to globe-shattering events of biblical proportions, will bring his ethereal skills to the battlefield on May 25. A new trailer showcases what appears to be one of the most complex and technical fighters in franchise history, (and with GG, that's really saying something), who is armed with over 20 spells with which to confuse their opponent, control space, defend against attack and, of course, kick a lotta ass.
You can see That Man in action in the preview below. Yikes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpxOjoBDJBY&t=1s
In addition to Asuka R#'s arrival, Guilty Gear Strive Season Pass owners will also receive the new stage Tir Na N0g, as well as two special 25th-anniversary color packs, bringing additional palettes that can be applied to the entire roster of characters. These include a pink-and-white scheme, a neon green-and-white scheme, and finally an orange-and-white scheme. The pink-and-white look will be available to download to all players free of charge.
Finally, Arc System Works confirmed that a third season of content for Guilty Gear Strive is in the works, bringing even more characters, stages, and colors to the hit release. Players can also expect the arrival of the long-long-long awaited update that hopes to bring myriad fixes to the title's frustrating lobby and online issues.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher targeting an unprecedented $8 billion in revenue
Take-Two Interactive, the parent publisher behind Rockstar Games and the Grand Theft Auto franchise, has announced that it is preparing for what it believed will be a record-shattering fiscal year 2025. The comments were made by CEO Strauss Zelnick in the company's newest financial report.
"Fiscal 2025 is a highly anticipated year for our company. For the last several years, we have been preparing our business to release an incredibly robust pipeline of projects that we believe will take our company to even greater levels of success," said Zelnick.
"In fiscal 2025, we expect to enter this new era by launching several groundbreaking titles that we believe will set new standards in our industry and enable us to achieve over $8 billion in net bookings and over $1 billion in adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow. We expect to sustain this momentum by delivering additional growth in our operating results in fiscal 2026 and beyond."
Considering the obscene amount of money referenced, as well as the supreme confidence delivered in the statement, one can only assume that the fiscal year 2024, (This period denotes the calendar year running from April 2024 to March 2025), will see the studio launch Grand Theft Auto VI, the latest release in a franchise that leaves almost every other gaming franchise in existence kicking in the dust when in comes to both immediate and long term revenue.
When pressed as to whether this number essentially guaranteed the release window for GTA VI, Zelnick was non-commital, but it seems almost impossible for the "industry standard setting" revenue of $8 billion to be reached without some sort of major, and that's major, release. Grand Theft Auto V, a title that is now a decade old, continues to move copies, and currently sits at the 180 million sales mark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New episodes will arrive every other week
Telltale Games is premiering the first episode of The Expanse: A Telltale Series this summer. The first installment will go live on July 27, with more episodes to follow in the weeks after.
The Expanse series will be episodic, with five episodes in total. After the first drops on July 27, each episode will follow two weeks after each other, putting the targeted end date in September.
There's a standard edition for $39.99, or a Deluxe Edition for $44.99 that will give 24-hour early access on PlayStation or Epic, and also future DLC. Yes, Telltale confirms DLC is on the way, though it doesn't clarify what shape that will take.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzG5WI5ak1g
All part of the churn
This new Expanse series arrives from the revived Telltale Games, under LCG Entertainment. While it's rolled out games like the Shadow Edition of the Batman Telltale series, The Expanse is one the studio has been building up to for a while, in collaboration with Life is Strange: True Colors developer Deck Nine.
Telltale also confirmed that The Wolf Among Us 2, its follow-up to the previous Fable adventure, is delayed into 2024. The shift is to avoid crunch, and move from Unreal 4 to 5, according to an IGN interview at the time.
This will be an interesting one to watch, to see what the new Telltale is putting out. Deck Nine's involvement certainly has me intrigued, as True Colors was a really solid entry in the Life is Strange series, and I'm a fan of The Expanse too. Opting for an episodic structure similar to what old Telltale popularized has me curious about its reception, though. At the very least, it will be weeks between episodes rather than months.
We'll see if the sci-fi drama's gradual rollout works. The Expanse: A Telltale Series premieres on July 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Epic.

Bumpy Grumpy had a regional test back in 1983, but never saw the light of day beyond that. Occidental Design then faced bankruptcy multiple times before giving up in the face of horrible poverty in the early ‘90s.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After co-creator Ed Boon teased Mortal Kombat 12 news last week, we have confirmation that a formal reveal will happen tomorrow, May 18.
A new tweet from the official Mortal Kombat Twitter account reads, "Tomorrow is a new dawn" and contains a teaser styled after the previous video, featuring a clock hand that skips past 12 and strikes 1, followed by the text “It Is Time” with a start time of 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET.

May 17, 2023
Fans have speculated that the clock landing on "1" may signify the next game is a reboot of sorts. Although 2011’s MK 9 already did that, the wild ending of MK 11 (and its Aftermath expansion) certainly paved the runway for Netherrealm to essentially start fresh and do whatever it wants with the fiction going forward. As such, this 12th entry has the potential to be pretty nuts, even by MK standards. 
We learned a new Mortal Kombat was coming this year when Warner Bros. CEO told investors that Mortal Kombat 12 was launching this year. Whether this new game is actually called MK 12 or something else entirely is unclear, but we’re looking forward to waking up bright and early tomorrow morning to see what’s next for our favorite spine-ripping kombatants.]]></summary>

Developer Behaviour Interactive released a teaser for an announcement on July 5 regarding the massively talented actor's mysterious involvement. As for what Cage's role entails, an in-game version of the Renfield star only offers this nugget:
“There’s nothing more powerful than imagination. One can shape the fabric of reality, transforming everything you think you may know.”


Who knows what that means, but it looks like Cage is joining the game in some capacity. Is he a killer? Will he appear in one of his many, many film roles? Or is it scary enough to just have Nicolas Cage as himself running around trying to murder players? We’ll get our answers in July.

Ten years ago, I’d hear schoolmates chatting about the games’ ghosts, purple people, and dismembered heads stuck in animatronics. Now, we’re old enough to buy R-rated cinema tickets, and Hollywood’s ready to capitalise on some teen nostalgia - essentially the film industry’s version of min-maxing.

        <updated>2023-05-17T15:20:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embark Studios has shifted the scope of its upcoming shooter, Arc Raiders. The game was first announced in 2021 as a co-op PvE-focused experience about working together to battle invading alien machines. Now, the game will have a PvP element thrown into the mix.
In an update, Embark reveals that since delaying Arc Raiders to focus on finishing its other upcoming title, The Finals, it’s added competitive play as well as an extraction element. The game still unfolds on a far future Earth ravaged by sentient machines, but now teams must compete with other human players in addition to the in-game enemies. Furthermore, the game adopts extraction-based objectives by tasking players to locate and retrieve resources scattered across the world for their squad. Here’s Embark's pitch for what Arc Raiders now entails:
Embark plans on launching a closed alpha test, giving players who sign up on their website the first opportunity to go hands-on with Arc Raiders. The game still has no release date, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
What do you think of this new premise for Arc Raiders? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A PlayStation Showcase will air next week, ostensibly serving as the publisher’s big summer showcase.
It airs on Wednesday, May 24, at 1 p.m. Pacific/4 p.m. Eastern. A PlayStation Blog post states the event will run a little over an hour and will feature new titles for PS5 and PS VR2. In addition to showcasing first-party PlayStation Studios titles, the event will also highlight third-party and indie games. 
This means it's time to put on our speculation hats. It’s likely we’ll see Insomniac’s Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 at the show given it’s releasing this fall and we’ve yet to see gameplay of it. There’s also the slim chance that Wolverine could make an appearance. Naughty Dog could also provide an update on its The Last of Us multiplayer title. Personally, we’re hoping to see something about that mysterious adventure title from a recent PlayStation ad that has rumored ties to Uncharted. As for third-party, it would be nice to see more of the PS5-exclusive Silent Hill 2 remake. 
So what do you expect/hope to see at Sony’s big event? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Believe it or not, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is off to a fantastic start. In addition to garnering an overwhelmingly positive critical reception, over 10 million copies of the hotly anticipated sequel have already been sold within its first three days of release.
That number makes Tears of the Kingdom the fastest-selling entry in franchise history. A press release states that 4 million of those sales have been in the Americas, which not only makes it the fastest-selling Switch game in this territory but the fastest-selling Nintendo game period. This achievement is even more impressive when you consider that Tears of the Kingdom is also the first $70 Nintendo first-party title, showing fans are willing to shell out the extra dough for a tentpole Switch release.

Instead, they'll be gradually releasing co-op story missions and integrating them into their ongoing seasons, similar to how PvE operated in the first Overwatch.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/05/16/blizzard-details-overwatch-2-2023-roadmap"/>
        <updated>2023-05-16T19:24:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During a developer livestream today, Blizzard revealed its roadmap for the coming months. The roadmap, which was presented by game director Aaron Keller and executive producer Jared Neuss, details what is coming during Season 5, 6, 7, and beyond. In addition to PvP updates, the Overwatch 2 developers also gave us an idea of when to expect the long-awaited PvE experience that was announced alongside the game in 2019.
Season 5, which has the theme of "Mischief and Magic," is currently set to kick off on June 13. This fifth season of the live-service shooter brings events and modes, including a new limited-time event called Questwatch, as well as the return of the Summer Games event. The roadmap also promises a cinematic reveal, a 5v5 mini comp season, the Creator Workshop mode, and the return of the On Fire mechanic that was present in Overwatch.
Season 6, which is set for later this summer, is heralded by Blizzard as the single largest drop of new gameplay released at one time since Overwatch 2 launched in October of last year. Season 6 promises a new support hero, Flashpoint, Hero Mastery, a Firing Range, a player progression system, and the annual Overwatch anniversary event. Perhaps most importantly, Season 6 gives players the PvE content that was announced back in 2019, as Story Missions arrive as part of Season 6. Unfortunately, the Hero Missions PvE mode has been cut from the team's plans.
Finally, we learned what players can expect from Season 7 and beyond, which includes a new tank hero, reworks of longtime heroes Roadhog and Sombra, a new Control map, a new winter event, new Hero Mastery missions in multiplayer, cinematic debuts, the return of fan-favorite modes and Competitive Mastery heroes, a new limited-time collaboration event mode, and a new lore codex.
Overwatch 2 launched on October 4, 2022. While the initial response was positive (read our review here), the approach to supporting the game and the season pass structure has deterred many players from keeping up with the title.]]></summary>

French internet users made roughly 10 million visits to Uptobox last month and are unlikely to give up easily. Meanwhile, blundering efforts to block other content led to the entire Telegram platform being blocked in France last weekend. French visitors were diverted to a government website where code linked their visit to serious crime.

They're also hugely expensive, normally costing close to $1000, but a deep discount on their Z690 model over at Newegg brings it to $400. That's still pricey, but a reasonable pickup given the feature list for anyone designing a top-end gaming rig around Intel's 12th-gen or 13th-gen Core processors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been meaning to write about Veiled Experts for over a month now, since playing it religiously during the Final Beta Test. I've been putting it off mostly because I've been busy, but also because I'm trying to find a way of saying "actually it's really good" without people laughing and throwing garbage at me. It's very hard to describe Veiled Experts to someone in a way that doesn't prompt an instant dismissal. That was my reaction too. I saw it on Twitch, my mind said "third person Counter-Strike", and sent an automatic signal down to my lips to proclaim the words: "sounds awful".
Thank goodness for boredom. Later that day I was at a loose end and saw that Veiled Experts was free, so I downloaded it and tried it out. And here we are, a month and a bit later. The game is about to release into Early Access, and I'm desperately trying to get everyone I know to play it with me, because it's bloody phenomenal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After playing a bunch of the demos at LudoNarraCon earlier this month, the best one I played, with zero hesitation, was Cryptmaster. Its smart text-based puzzle design fused with stylish dungeon crawling had me completely spellbound, to the point where it's now become one of my most anticipated indie games for 2024. It’s honestly unlike anything I’ve played.
Developed by Paul Hart and Lee Williams, Cryptmaster is a dark fantasy dungeon crawler where you need to type (or speak) commands to help get your undead amnesiac party members out of a strange underground kingdom. Your band of forgetful adventurers aren't completely at the mercy of the dungeon, as a devilish-looking necromancer is there to give a helping hand. An ominous figure who acts as both guide and a quest giver, the horned necromancer helps you navigate the strange rules of this underground world where words and letters are a resource for survival.

The game previously changed its name earlier in the year, dropping the pluralisation of Layers Of Fears. Presumably, it'll still explore more than one fear, though. You can see for yourself as the game released a new demo today, available on Steam until May 22nd.

I've enjoyed the pop platforming of Sayonara Wild Hearts, the DIY DJ-ing in Fuser, the grungy game-meets-album Teenage Blob, and the recently released fist-pumping robot-thrashing Hi-Fi Rush just to name some from the top of my noggin'.
Music is a definitely big part of these games, but Stray Gods: A Roleplaying Musical has set itself on a different kind of musical path, in that it’s actually a musical. I'm talking like a full-on ballad-belter, curtain-caller, exit-stage-left-er musical. And get this: it’s also a modern retelling of the mythos behind the Greek Gods. It feels like my inner theatre kid has chugged ten Red Bulls and is waiting for her cue to burst out.

Announced last night by developers and publishers 505 Games, the free-to-play Hawken Reborn will launch into early access tomorrow. This time, it's a PvE game, with story missions plus open patrol zones to explore and complete jobs. I was enamoured with the jetdashing scrappy mechs and greeble-covered apartment blocks of the first game but always wished it had a singleplayer or co-op campaign, so I'm certainly curious about this.

Roughly summarized, here are the conclusions the European Commission came to as a result of their investigations:

Roleplaying a god is rarely something I feel while playing puzzle games, but Humanity provides it in new and surprising ways. The unique style of puzzle solving uses directional signs and commands to guide droves of miniature people to an endpoint. The puzzles start simple, but Humanity builds on this core system throughout its 100-plus stages in exciting and challenging ways, push…]]></summary>

There are some buck wild concepts in Square Enix’s game, including fourth wall breaks to manipulate characters' actions and literally muting someone by turning voices off in the options menu, to name just two of the wackier features (and a big plot twist is discussed in this article, so beware if you're planning on playing Paranormasight soon). 


At the outset, though, Paranormasight loks like it is your average visual novel, with the player working away to prevent curses from claiming the lives of Tokyo citizens. Writer and director Takaya Ishiyama explains this was actually the starting point for Paranormasight’s inception. “I first decided what the final goal of the game would be, and from there I began to plot out the broad elements I needed to include, such as the Seven Mysteries,” he explains.

The newest, last week’s Patch 4, sounded particularly enthusiastic about tackling Jedi: Survivor’s technical troubles, so now would be a fine time to check in on the progress of this fixing-upping campaign.


A few droid decapitatin’ benchmark runs later, I can say that Patch 4 (and its predecessors) have made meaningful improvements to ray tracing performance, and that there's a lot less stuttering than there was at launch - even if this hasn’t been smoothed out entirely. General performance, however, remains deeply underwhelming, with powerful GPUs still unable to achieve a bulletproof 60fps even at 1080p.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a huge game that is particularly skilled at providing you with distractions. I crossed the 90-hour mark recently, and my in-game percentage tracker still shows less than 50% completion. Sometimes, however, you may run into a situation where you're not sure where you want to go. When that happens, I suggest talking to Patricia.
Patricia is not a human character in Tears of the Kingdom. She's a sand seal, and Riju's personal sand seal at that. After cleaning up the main quest in Gerudo, you will find her in the southern corner of Gerudo town.
Patricia loves to eat and will share bits of ambiguous wisdom, translated by her handler Padda, when you give Patricia food. Her favorite food, however, is Splash Fruit.
If you give her some splash fruit, her caretaker will let you know that she has spoken a string of strange numbers.
Those numbers are, of course, coordinates, which you can find on the map or on the bottom of the minimap as you are exploring.
In the example I took screenshots of for this guide, it sent me to a person out in the middle of nowhere who happened to have a sidequest for me. I've done this a few times with Patricia, and she has always pointed me toward something I have not yet discovered.
Running out of things to do in Tears of the Kingdom is something that many players (myself included) won't run into for many hours, but it's nice to know there is an in-game database of distractions built into the game when you run out of activities.

        <updated>2023-05-15T14:41:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ranked Play is coming to Fortnite, and it's coming soon. According to a blog post from last Saturday, the team behind Fortnite will implement the new mode in the 24.40 update, introducing eight main ranks players can progress through. If Epic keeps to their usual schedule, the mode is expected to come this week, but a date has yet to be formally announced.
Once Ranked Play is added to the game, players will be able to toggle it on or off from the main menu. Other than the fact that it's generally more competitive, there aren't any major gameplay differences between Ranked and unranked play, though that's subject to change. In fact, most details about Ranked Play are not concrete, as Epic says this mode is going to be the start of Ranked Season Zero, so they can "make any adjustments to issues and concerns that arise, while also working on additional features and overall improvements for when Ranked starts following the normal Battle Royale Season schedule."
Ranked Play will be available for both Battle Royale and its popular alternative, Zero Build. You'll have separate ranks for each mode. However, since Ranked Play is still in development, only certain party sizes will be available. In Battle Royale, you can play Solos, Duos, and Party (this excludes trios), and in Zero Build, you can only play duos. Ranked Play's Season Zero is set to end when the main season ends (early June), so hopefully, more party options will open up by then.
Ranked Play will also replace Fortnite's existing Arena mode. Other than the Console Champions Cup, the rest of the tournaments this season won't have any Ranked requirements. Eligibility for future tournaments will now rely on your rank and "other factors" Epic has yet to specify.
Will you be playing Ranked Mode once it drops? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

This owl can’t sleep at night, mainly because it’s nocturnal, but also because the planet’s impending environmental doom has affected their shoddy sleep schedule. That’s where the Green New Deal Simulator comes in, a micro deck-builder about transitioning the USA into a post-carbon economy, all while keeping employment rates stable. The results are simultaneously funny, educational, intense, and they help that damn owl get a good night's rest.

        <updated>2023-05-15T14:09:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of first-person shooters and old-timey cartoons should keep an eye on Mouse. The recently announced game slaps the classic animation of yesteryear over a retro shooter template to create an experience that's old-school in more ways than one. 
Mouse comes from Polish indie developer Fumi Games and is billed as a noir story-driven shooter about murder and deception set in a corrupt city. Players control a private detective wielding vintage firearms like a Tommy Gun, revolver, and Carcano rifle to blast the rather adorable rodent enemies.
The game’s Steam page describes Mouse as a play-your-way type of experience, emphasized by a power-up system in which players can collect special abilities and weapon upgrades that cater to a chosen playstyle. The trailer shows the game is very much a work-in-progress, but it’s already an eye-catcher. 


Mouse is rendered in the classic rubber hose animation style that defined early 20th-century animation, which has found new life in video games such as Cuphead and Bendy and the Ink Machine. The game has no release window but will come to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

The game is a prehistoric take on Stardew Valley’s crop-growing, dungeon-exploring, people-romancing formula. Its PAX East demo caught our eye earlier this year, and the full release late last month charmed many fans on Steam for the short time it was available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While working on an automated opt-in survey (about which I write in a bit), it was noticed that our privacy policy and cookie policy is rather out-of-date. Mostly, we used to store a lot more personal information when you created an account, like email addresses, passwords, etc. As we now use GitHub to handle all that, we can slim down our privacy policy, as we store very little personal information. For the cookie policy, for years now we only use cookies for the authenticated part of our websites and nothing else. OpenTTD’s privacy policy has always been: we want to know as little personal information about you as possible. And although these changes were rolled out years ago, the policies did not reflect that yet. They do now! In short: we removed statements from the policy about information we track, as we haven’t done that for years now. So, what about this automated opt-in survey you are talking about?]]></summary>

While performance is good, at up to 550MB/s for reads and a little less for writes, the real benefit here is having up to 8TB of silent, reliable and low latency storage. 
You can currently pick up this RPS-recommended gaming SSD in its ultimate 8TB form for less than £415 from two places in the UK: Tech Next Day, where you can use code TND-10 to get it for £414, and Amazon, where you can get the drive for £412. I've included both options in case you have a preference, and in the event the drive goes out of stock at this reduced price by the time you come to click the links below! 
Tech Next Day - Get the Samsung 870 Qvo 8TB for £414 w/ code TND-10 (RRP £452)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's RX 6950 XT has been enjoying a surprising revival as of late, as precipitous price drops have positioned it as a cheaper competitor to Nvidia's new RTX 4070 GPU that offers better performance in rasterised titles - by a significant ~20% margin, too. 


Today, the RX 6950 XT has dropped below the £600 mark for the first time we're aware of, with a chunky triple-fan ASRock model costing just £598 at Overclockers in the UK. That's significantly cheaper than the £999 that these cards originally debuted at, bringing it into contention with newer-gen cards.

You can really imagine Link reaching into a grocery store freezer to grab his favorite obscure ice cream flavor hidden behind all the unsold cartons of strawberry. But what if the new Amiibo was a more accurate reflection of players' time with the game?
Sometimes you are on the side of a mountain and you accidentally shoot a bomb arrow in the wall two feet from your face, fall to your death, and then snap a screenshot right after the moment where the UI disappears, but before the Game Over screen appears. I think the flames licking Link's dead body would look great in translucent red plastic.

Artsy games making a point (that seldom grab me, I shouldn't admit) are another. But Mech Punk is something else altogether, and an incredibly rare game that actually earns the "punk" in its title.
Does that mean it's good? Well, umm. Yes, it's good at what I think it sets out to do. Being an irreverent mess is a valid artistic approach, but still means your game is exactly that. It's not a good game in the traditional sense, though. Do I recommend you buy it? If you can spare £20 to pat an artist on the back, maybe. What kind of artist? Put it this way: on release, its developer changed all their Steam page credits to "Alan Smithee". I don’t think they’re disowning it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tunic developer Andrew Shouldice has made no secret about his love of The Legend Of Zelda over the years. He's not only spoken at length about how playing the original pair of Zelda games on the NES provided ample inspiration for his crafty hack and slasher, but you can also see it right there in the game itself, from your fox hero's bright green outfit to the beautifully illustrated in-game manual you piece together to unravel the world's mysteries. 
But speaking with Shouldice at GDC this year, I wanted to talk to him another other potential source of inspiration. Before he struck out on his own to make Tunic, Shouldice cut his teeth making hidden object games, ranging from globe-trotting mystery adventures to Atlantean-themed detective stories. On paper, this earlier work would appear to provide the perfect proving ground for Tunic, as we all know by now that it holds plenty of secrets of its own. For Shouldice, though, it was more of a reaction against his earlier work that fuelled his approach to Tunic, as he gradually came to realise his hidden object games "weren't tapping into this very specific type of mystery and discovery and player agency and true exploration that I was interested in," he says.

But while we may never get to play a mainline Zelda game on PC, there's no denying it's inspired countless other developers to have a stab at it themselves, hence why we've put together this list of the best PC games like Zelda you can play right now. Whether you're looking to scratch that Tears Of The Kingdom itch or get stuck into something more retro-facing like A Link To The Past, we've got you covered.

From verifying customer identities to clarified ISP liability, through content blocking, takedown tools and the ability to unmask infringers, a government decree appears to offer rightsholders a smorgasbord of opportunities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early access shooter Hrot channels the wicked energy of Quake and Dusk with a booming shotgun, fast movement, and wobbly weapon models. Old-school inspirations covered in a Soviet coat of paint that’s so oppressive, it borders on horror. Two of Hrot’s episodes are out now, but the shooter is leaving early access with a third on May 16th and it’s one to watch.

The Remix edition comes in a nifty green colour scheme, is made from recycled materials and is bundled with a free Microsoft  Play & Charge kit, allowing you to replace the battery with a rechargeable Li-Ion alternative - significantly better for the environment than throwing away non-rechargeable batteries, as long as your home's energy comes from somewhat green sources.

The long-awaited sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is finally here, with reviews confirming that it was well worth the hype (you can read our full review here). The entry innovates and expands upon the formula established by Breath of the Wild in myriad ways, giving players the most open-ended Zelda game yet. 
With the launch finally here, we sat down with series producer Eiji Aonuma and director Hidemaro Fujibayashi to talk about the daunting task of following Breath of the Wild, as well as the new game's successes and challenges.

With The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom carrying forward and expanding much of what made Breath of the Wild so special more than six years ago, I decided to scan through the entire Legend of Zelda collection of Amiibo figures across multiple days to see what each figure yields.
It's worth noting that these figures' rewards all come with RNG mechanics, meaning that many of the good drops will require you to scan the figures multiple days before getting the reward you're really after.

This is only the third year that games have been recognized at the annual film festival. The event highlights upcoming titles, which have generally been smaller budget/indie works, that have “potential for excellence in art and storytelling through design, artistic mastery, and highly immersive worlds.” The previous Tribeca Games Award winners are Norco in 2021 and Thirsty Suitors in 2022. 
Here is the 2023 selection, which will be spotlighted with new trailers and developer interviews on the big night:
Chants of Sennaar
Despelote
The Expanse: A Telltale Series
Goodbye Volcano High
A Highland Song
Nightscape
Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical
Additionally, the festival will screen a new documentary called Hideo Kojima - Connecting Worlds. The film delves into the mind and creative process of the man behind Metal Gear and Death Stranding and features appearances from Guillermo del Toro, Norman Reedus, Grimes, Chvrches, and others. 
The Tribeca Film Festival runs from June 7-18, but the Games showcase airs on June 9. The Tribeca Game Awards is just one of the many video game showcases airing in June, and you can keep up with all of them by visiting our handy event schedule.]]></summary>

It's why I love the model of Imperialism, where everywhere is one turn, no shuffling away. It's also why I'm a little surprised how engrossing Foxhole is as a strategy game. As most players (including Brendy) will tell you, it's a game all about shuffling, ie. logistics. But after finally making time for it, I've realised that most of them, even some of the "logi" focused players, don't know what that actually means.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is battling impossible expectations. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild represented a radical and successful reinvention of The Legend of Zelda – a series considered by many to be the apex of game design. Despite its numerous changes to Zelda’s formula, Breath of the Wild was a massive success and its legacy only grows stronger with time.
To give Breath of the Wild a direct sequel (a rarity in Zelda canon) is a dangerous prospect. The resulting game lacks the admittedly difficult-to-recreate, undeniable impact and newness …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Discovery casually name-dropped Mortal Kombat 12 earlier in the year, when an earnings call revealed the fighter was “set to release this year, with ambitious launch projections.” The relaxed announcement wasn’t followed by any flashy marketing (outside of a few funny Ed Boon tweets) until now. Developer Netherrealm have been dropping small teasers that potentially point toward a series reboot, or a timeline cleanse, or a return to the series' past. Hey, the next instalment might not even be named MK12. Watch last night’s very brief teaser below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After playing the the demo at last year's PAX West, then playing the same demo again at this year’s PAX East, and then playing it a third time from the comfort of my own home as part of this year’s LudoNarraCon, I think I’m slightly obsessed with Demonschool. 
I’ve had a blast beating up supernatural weirdos with a group of misfit college teens. Together with its soundtrack of absolute bangers that combines dramatic church choir chorus with pulsing synth wave beats (please put the OST on Spotify, Ysbryd), and a slick art style that makes me dribble like a brain-hungry zombie every time I see it, I’m thinking that Demonschool might very well be on its way to being be one of my favourite games of 2023 when it releases sometime this year. What can I say? I love punching freaky demons in the face.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We know Mortal Kombat 12 is apparently coming sometime this year, and Ed Boon is stoking the fires of excitement by seemingly teasing an impending announcement.
In a Warner Bros. Discovery earnings call in February, CEO David Zaslav told investors that Mortal Kombat 12 was planned for release this year. Initially, Boon didn’t confirm or deny the news, but today he tweeted out a short video of a clock hand dramatically ticking towards 12 that then, interestingly, skips over it to strike 1. Boon's tweet asks, “Does anyone know what time it is?”
Does anyone know what time it is? #MortalKombatpic.twitter.com/pXY2wlidde
May 10, 2023
It might be the 12th mainline fighting game, but the teaser could be hinting at a reboot of sorts. Regardless, it appears an announcement could be imminent, which seems especially likely following the big delay of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Summer Game Fest is less than a month away, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see the hotly anticipated sequel pop up there.
Mortal Kombat 11 was released in 2019, with its Aftermath expansion arriving the following year. Developer Netherrealm also released Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile RPG, last fall. Although Netherrealm has released an Injustice game in between Mortal Kombat releases since 2013, it appears to be bucking that trend by jumping straight to the 12th entry.

The story follows Mimi, a young woman who returns to her departed grandmother’s countryside cottage in the real-life French region of Dordogne to uncover family secrets. Her return triggers a flood of childhood memories, which players relieve in flashbacks as a child version of Mimi. Gameplay involves exploring the cottage, taking pictures, and collecting keepsakes while witnessing the bond between Mimi and her grandmother and learning how these nostalgic experiences connect to the present. Check out the game's new trailer below, as the game looks even prettier in motion.

Meanwhile, the PC version is getting enhanced graphics options that allow players to further optimize presentational performance. Lastly, all versions of the game, including the Switch cloud port, will receive bug fixes via this patch.

The last we heard, Silksong was due out in the first half of 2023 but last night, Team Cherry delayed the game without offering up a new window. 
Hey gang, just a quick update about Silksong.
May 10, 2023
As you can see, it's clear Silksong won't be released in the first half of 2023 as originally planned, but there's no word or indication of what the game's new release date is. 
Team Cherry put out its first game, Hollow Knight, in 2017 and it was extremely well received. While the game received several free DLCs, the studio was also working on a larger expansion of paid DLC starring Hornet from the game. In 2019, the team announced this DLC had expanded massively in scope, to the point it'd now be a full sequel game called Hollow Knight: Silksong. Since then, fans of the first Hollow Knight have wondered when they'd be able to play Silksong.
While waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Hollow Knight review and then read about why Silksong is one of our most anticipated upcoming games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Private Division has announced a new publishing partnership with Pokémon developer Game Freak. It will publish a new action-adventure game from Game Freak meant to be a new IP for the developer. 
Codenamed "Project Bloom," Game Freak and Private Division state in a press release the new IP is expected to launch during Private Division parent company Take-Two's Fiscal Year 2026. Alongside this news, Game Freak has released the first piece of concept art for Project Bloom. You can check it out below: 

"We're thrilled to have the opportunity to create new IP that is bold and tonally different from our prior work," Game Freak director Kota Furushima writes in the release. "From the beginning, Private Division was the publisher we wanted to work with on our new game. Their track record and global expertise gives us all the confidence to create a sweeping new action-adventure game that we can't wait to share more about in the future." 
Take-Two Interactive chief strategy officer and Private Division head Micahel Worosz says you'd be hard-pressed to find a studio with more iconic hits over the past 30 years than Game Freak, addding, "We're ready to help Game Freak unleash their potential and we're honored to be the first Western publisher to work alongside this exceptionally talented and proven team to bring a bold new IP to market." 
Game Freak was founded in 1989 and is best known for developing the majority of mainline Pokémon entries across various Nintendo consoles. Its most recent Pokémon release was last year's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It has, however, released non-Pokémon games throughout its history, including this year's Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! on iOS and macOS devices. 
Private Division was founded in 2017 as a third publishing label within Take-Two Interactive. Notable titles published by Private Division include Hades, The Outer Worlds, Kerbal Space Program 2, Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and developer Guerrilla have revealed that the Horizon franchise has surpassed 32 million units sold. 
The series, which consists of 2017's Horizon Zero Dawn and its Frozen Wilds expansion, 2022's Horizon Forbidden West and this year's Burning Shores expansion for it, and the recently released PSVR2 exclusive title, Horizon Call of the Mountain, has quickly become one of PlayStation's best selling. In a new PlayStation Blog post detailing Guerrilla's history, PlayStation reveals the Horizon franchise has surpassed 32.7 million units sold worldwide. 


It also reveals that Horizon Forbidden West has sold more than 8.4 million units as well. 
"Millions more around the world have discovered Horizon thanks to PlayStation's subscription services and initiatives, including PlayStation Plus and Play at Home," Guerrilla studio director and art and animation director Jan-Bart van Beek writes in the blog post. "All told, it's a milestone we never imagined possible twenty years ago when we first started making games.
"The reception has been staggering, and we're grateful to the community for the continued love and support for the franchise."
The blog post ends with van Beek teasing that the studio "cant wait for you to find out where [Aloy] will go next." 
For more about the series, read Game Informer's Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West reviews. Then read what we thought of Horizon Call of the Mountain and the recent Burning Shores expansion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has announced a new action-platforming game called Mr. Run and Jump, which promises to be a speedrunner's delight. With lush neon graphics and reflex-based platforming stages, the game promises fast-paced and frenetic action for fans of the high-speed, tight-controlling entries of the genre.
As Mr. Run and Jump, you explore the Realms of Color on a quest to defeat Void and find the hero's missing dog, Leap. The title was originally created as a homebrew title for Atari 2600 in 2021, but a modernized version is now being released by developers Graphite Lab and Heavy Horse Games through official means. If this sounds up your alley, you can check out the announcement trailer below.


Mr. Run and Jump offers dozens of unique levels across six different worlds, as well as several enemies with distinct attack patterns and personalities. According to Atari, the title will offer more than 30 hours of gameplay when you take into account time trials, collectibles, and achievements.
Mr. Run and Jump arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Atari VCS later this year. For more on one of Atari's most recent successes, check out our review of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration.]]></summary>

Redfall is my biggest disappointment of 2023. As a massive fan of developer Arkane Studios’ previous work, from Dishonored through Deathloop, my expectations were high for the company’s new release. However, this vampire-hunting first-person shooter is messy, plagued with technical flaws and head-scratching design decisions counterintuitive to the game itself. The result is an often-bland experience, made frustrating by occasional glimpses of potential, and it’s sucked the life out of me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of waiting, fans will finally get their first look at Payday 3's gamplay, according to a new teaser trailer.
This teaser is the latest following a similarly brief trailer released in January. Today’s video succinctly states that the first look at gameplay will arrive this summer. Odds are it will debut during Summer Game Fest or another adjacent event, but we’ll have to await confirmation to know for sure.


Payday 3 has been in the works for a long time, having been officially announced in 2017. It hasn’t had the smoothest development cycle due to developer Starbreeze Studio flirting with closure at one point, among other factors. So far, we know that the co-op heist shooter is coming this year for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. It stars the original gang from the previous games and unfolds in New York.

Darkest Dungeon II is cruel. A simple miscalculation or bad luck can ruin your two-to-three-hour expedition before the chapter’s final boss. There are no checkpoints; if your party dies, it’s time to start fresh from the very beginning. Only some unlocked upgrades stay with you. When you have to make tough choices all the time while keeping in mind various systems, this can (and will) be frustrating and nerve-racking. At the same time, Darkest Dungeon II is the most cathartic and rewarding experience since the original in 2016.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Replay returns, and we're checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts! Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don’t Nod, makers of Life is Strange and Tell Me Why, has announced that its next title, Harmony: The Fall of Reverie, is coming this June and will get a playable demo this month. 
Steam and Switch players can pick up the game on June 8, whereas PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S owners have to wait until June 22. Harmony: The Fall of Reverie is a choice-driven adventure starring Polly, a woman who returns home to find her missing mother. It's here Polly discovers she has clairvoyant abilities connecting her to a strange dimension called Reverie. While visiting this world, Polly becomes Harmony and encounters six powerful god-like beings called Aspirations, which serve as the hearts of humanity such as Glory, Power, Chaos, Bliss, and Truth. 


Polly must restore the balance between Reverie and our world and decide which Aspiration ultimately inspires humanity by making decisions represented by a system called the Augural. This web presents a multitude of scenes players will jump between that reveal possible futures that, in turn, unlock additional story branches. Polly does this by collecting crystals given to her with each choice and character bond she makes, which are used to unlock nodes on the Augural that alter the course of the story. 
Harmony: The Fall of Reverie sports a vibrantly illustrated art direction and a soundtrack by award-winning composer Lena Raine. You can try it out early thanks to a limited-time Steam demo launching today that will be available until May 21.
For more on Don't Nod, check out its other new title, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden, which also launches later this year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redfall has been a letdown for many players, but perhaps no one is more disappointed than Xbox head Phil Spencer. During an appearance this morning on Kinda Funny Games’ Xcast, the executive opened up about Redfall’s launch woes.   
“There’s nothing that’s more difficult for me than disappointing the Xbox community,” says Spencer when asked about his reaction to the game's poor reception. “...just to kind of watch the community lose confidence, be disappointed, I’m disappointed, I’m upset with myself…”
Spencer continues by touching on the criticism of Redfall launching at 30 frames per second and how it goes against Microsoft’s original claim of first-party Xbox Series X/S titles always running at 60 FPS. “That was kind of our punch in the chin, rightfully, a couple of weeks ago,” he says …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redfall is not a good game. I don’t think you need me to pour salt on that wound if you’ve spent significant time with it. But its failure is a disappointing situation for several reasons. Developer Arkane is one of my favorite studios, so it sucks to see it fumble the ball. My admiration for the team made me genuinely excited for Redfall, which I still think is a cool premise on paper, making it a tough pill to swallow in practice. But the most upsetting element is seeing a studio fall short after trying something new and getting criticized for even attempting it.  
There are many valid reasons to drive a stake through Redfall’s heart, but the most worrying sentiment I’ve seen is Arkane should have never made it and given us Dishonored 3 or Prey 2 instead. That’s an understandable wish; I…]]></summary>
