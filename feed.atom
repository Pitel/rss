Okay, let's see if we can get through this one without a single 'wonder' pun...
Last week, Super Mario Bros. Wonder launched to almost universal acclaim from critics and players alike. Sure, you'll find a dissenting voice or two in the crowd if you go hunting for them, but the vast majority of Mario fans have been in their element spending the last few days exploring the Flower Kingdom and delighting at the strange effects elicited by the game's namesake seeds.

The LTC Neon75 is far from a big-brand choice, but the keyboard ticks all the boxes for me when it comes to features and design. There are beautiful 'pudding' keycaps, a compact and convenient 75% layout, tri-mode wired/wireless connectivity and hot-swappable key switches. Its US MSRP is a reasonable-sounding $70, but now it's available for a 50% off 'overstock' price on Amazon - that's just $35.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sow-sow.
Gardening in game worlds is relaxing – more so than its real-life counterpart, where plants wither no matter what you do. Garden Buddies from Dutch developer JamPics joins the many cosy Switch games where you can grow plants without wondering if you’ve under- or over-watered them. Unfortunately, it’s not the pick of the bunch.
Garden Buddies starts out well enough. Mutsy, a good-natured apple, invites you to their garden, a space you can decorate and customise. First up, you sprinkle flower seeds. The flowers become points you can exchange for items: various plants, stones, lanterns, a pond, a house. As you play you unlock new talking flora and fauna friends. They’re adorably designed: big shiny eyes, round bodies, little smiles. And they waddle around to a soothing soundtrack.

Video game adaptations have been hit or miss over the years. When we get The Last of Us, we also get Assassin's Creed. While they have been getting better over the years, it remains to be seen how long they'll hold out. Luckily, Fallout is shaping up to be another great adaptation, if the production is anything to go by.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was a kid I sort of hated Frasier. It was one of those shows you’d find in the 6pm slot on terrestrial TV, back when you had to show up for TV episodes on time or miss them forever, and as far as 10-year-old me was concerned, 6pm was Simpsons hour. Who was this strutting Seattle intellectual, with his glass of sherry and his call-in psychiatry show and his passion for silverware?
I couldn’t abide Frasier and developed a pathological aversion to headliner (and surprisingly convincing X-Man) Kelsey Grammer – but that was before The Simpsons spoofed Frasier and showed me the error of my ways. I still wouldn’t say I’m an outright Frasier fan - or Frasien, as they prefer to be known. Some of the humour is kind of eeesh, in hindsight. But I’ve experienced and enjoyed enough to find Edward La Barbera’s Fraiser Fantasy pretty funny.

In my recent review I noted that while LotF has some issues, it also has its moments of greatness. Lords of the Fallen joins Lies of P as two recently released Soulslike titles to have crossed the one million unit mark.





"Lords of the Fallen is the most important and ambitious game we’ve developed in our 20-year history, and the first in our new planned AAA pipeline of games in the years ahead. o see this fresh and innovative take on the action-RPG achieve one million sales in just 10 days has been humbling for everybody at HEXWORKS and CI Games."
- Marek Tyminski, CEO, CI Games.



Surely one of the reasons Lords of the Fallen has seen some early success is Hexworks dedication to improving the game. Since its launch, several patches have been released on all platforms to improve performance as well as add new features. A revamped New Game Plus mode was just added to the Soulslike, as well as crossplay between PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.


Lords of the Fallen is available now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While details are scarce at the moment, there's a possibility that Nvidia may unleash a SUPER variant of its RTX 4080 graphics card that has 20GB of RAM. That's if rumors from a number of sources are to be believed.


Speculations were shared by Videocardz (which originally came from Benchlife as well as a source on Twitter/X). It appears as though some information has fallen into the hands of leakers who assert that the boosted RTX 4080 is in the works.




Nvidia hasn't confirmed any of this at the time of writing. Suffice it to say, many grains of salt should be consumed while chewing this latest information.


Either a SUPER or a Ti


It's also looking like this elusive new model could sport the full AD102 chip, the same one used in the RTX 4090. The current 4080 uses AD103, so – as Videocardz says – the potential SUPER variant would need the AD102 GPU if it hopes to squeeze in 20GB of memory.


It's also worth noting that sources have not specifically said that it will be part of the SUPER series, so it could even be a Ti. In any case, temper expectations for now until Nvidia makes a formal statement about these rumors.


Speculations about the potential Nvidia graphics card were doing the rounds recently. We also know that Team Green had to "unlaunch" a 12GB version of the RTX 4080 about a year ago.


The 4000 series – named "Ada Lovelace" after the 19th century English mathematician – kicked off in October 2022. We've had a number of product launches since then, including a couple of Ti models. However, we've yet to have a SUPER, so it could be high-time for one.

"This will allow trophy hunters and completionists to seek out any outstanding tasks without having to contend with increased difficulty, should they so choose," the developers say in Lords of the Fallen's latest patch notes. And these are just the first of "some fundamental changes to ensure everyone continues to enjoy the NG+ experience", according to Hexworks. Heft that magic lantern and read on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Turn-based-meets-real-time.
Publisher Thunderful has today given us a closer look at the innovative combat system behind the upcoming metroidvania Worldless and we must say, we are rather intrigued.
Developed by Noname and set to release on Switch on 21st November, Worldless is a 2D adventure platformer with some immediately eye-catching visuals and a battle system that combines turn-based and real-time combat. Yes, this does sound a little paradoxical, but having checked out the above deep-dive video, it seems to be a fairly straightforward process of pulling off real-time moves in a set period, then bracing for an oncoming attack as your enemy does the same.

Time really flies, doesn't it? Can you believe it's nearly November 2023 already? Mad. Not only that but it's also now been 35 years since the debut launch of Super Mario Bros. 3 on the NES (as highlighted by our gorgeous pals over at Time Extension) in 1988. That's an awfully long time, and we've seen the Super Mario franchise blossom into an absolute titan in the years since, graduating to the 3D realm with Super Mario 64, spawning countless sports spin-offs and party games, and even gracing the big screen with the monumentally successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie.
As for Super Mario Bros. 3, Nintendo's third (technically fourth) mainline outing was met with significant critical praise and is consistently regarded as one of the greatest games of all time to this very day. So much so, in fact, that it spawned not one, but two re-releases over the years, the first of which being part of Super Mario All-Stars on the SNES, and the second on the GBA as Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3.

Take Subpar Pool's cue ball. What could have been just a straightforward mash-up of pool meets golf is suddenly given a new lease of life, warmth, charm and character, just because it has little eyes and a dumb, goofy smile plastered on its face. Some of its 'Chonker'-sized pool balls even have coiffed miniature moustaches for crying out loud, and they all babble cute nonsense noises at you as you ping them around its procedurally generated boards; hrnnnnngh they're just so gosh darn endearing that I simply cannot help myself. They make Subpar Pool a very easy game to like, which is precisely why it's so heartbreaking I can't quite bring myself to love it in the same way I do Grapefrukt Games' previous puzzle game, Holedown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been looking at the current crop of Silent Hill sequels, remakes and remasters and pining for the foggy streets and busted doorknobs of yesteryear, I recommend trying the demo for Heartworm. This is survival horror just the way Mother used to make it - before Mother read all those forbidden books and decided to sacrifice you to Samael, Lord of Serpents and Reeds. You've got your 3D engine with fixed camera perspectives, your thick coating of TV static, your sluggish vehicular control scheme, your enemies that could be either demons or metaphors and will murder you either way. 


There's a big dollop of Resident Evil here, too, and a gentler dusting of Fatal Frame. The main character is driven by grief, sports a fiesty tank-and-shorts combo, and is equipped with a flash camcorder for exorcising spooks rather than a firearm. In other words, she's the point on the Venn diagram between Jill Valentine, Miku Hinasaki and Harry Mason. The individual camera choices are more Evil than Hilly: the game frequently switches to a close-up face-on perspective when you enter a room, forcing you to step into the blindspot. That endless inter-dimensional staircase, though? Pure Team Silent. Other influences include Half-Life, Puppet Combo and Donnie Darko.


I'm pretty sold on Heartworm, though I'm still waiting for it to spark its own identity from all those grated-together shards of older horror games. So it's a bit sad that the project is in enormous trouble.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since one Escape From Tarkov player publicly revealed their findings that up to 60% of Tarkov matches might play host to cheaters, the community has taken a more negative stance towards the developer, Battlestate Games. Now, Battlestate Games has announced that its more focused and hectic Escape From Tarkov: Arena title will be coming out sometime in December 2023, and the players are highly suspicious of this claim.


The news broke when Forbes covered a recent interview with the Battlestate Games CEO, Nikita Buyanov, stating that "Early December is a good period of time that we want to release [Arena]." This soon made its way onto the r/pcgaming subreddit, where Tarkov players flocked to share their takes on what's actually bound to happen with Arena.


What to make of Escape From Tarkov: Arena?


"For anyone uninitiated," said Reddit user bauN7, "Battle State Games has been late on every single timeline they've ever given for Tarkov. Literally every. Single. One." Aside from the matters of release date windows, the players are also cynical about the value that Arena may or may not be adding to Tarkov as a whole. 


The situation is similarly dire on the official Tarkov subreddit, where players are admittedly being more technical in their critique at least. TheJigglyfat highlighted a situation in which Tarkov's emblematic desync issues caused massive differences between what two different players were seeing, which means that the match was effectively decided by lag live on stream.


It's not a great look, then, but the community's jadedness isn't necessarily a sign that BSG will have trouble managing Arena as well. In the end, if push comes to shove, at least the single-player offline version of Tarkov seems to be prospering well enough.

October 23, 2023
As is the case with many high-profile video game adaptations, the project is attached to some pretty big names. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy (the married duo behind Westworld) are executive producers, along with Bethesda Game Studios' own Todd Howard. The show will star Walton Goggins (Justified) and Ella Purnell, who fans of gaming will recognize as the voice of Jinx in the critically acclaimed League of Legends series Arcane. Filming for the series began in July 2022.
Over the past few years, video game adaptations have been getting better and better. This year is no different, with HBO's The Last of Us and The Super Mario Bros. Movie being two of the biggest hits of the entire year. Hopefully, Fallout with follow suit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to the topic of the best horror games of the last PlayStation era, Alien: Isolation typically ranks high. And why wouldn't it? With its terrifying atmosphere, deadly antagonist, and choo-choo train, its horror is as memorable as it is intense.


Wait. What was that last thing?


Ah, that's right. Trains. You see, it turns out someone decided to swap out the Xenomorph in Alien: Isolation for the less sinister-looking Thomas the Tank Engine.


Image via MattFiler



The mod comes courtesy of ModDB user MattFiler, with the rationale that this was something that just "had to happen sooner or later." A short video on the download page shows the new model in action. It doesn't quite have the finesse of the titular alien creature, but it still retains an element of dread and danger.


Thomas the Tank Engine horror is still horror


It might look a little goofy, but it reminds me (as I'm sure it will many of you) of the famous Skyrim mod that did something similar to Alduin. Then there's Choo-Choo Charles, the 2022 horror game about a killer train.


There's something about taking a loveable fictional character from many childhood memories and putting them in a different context. In this case, horror. While not many Alien: Isolation players are happy about being downed by the frighteningly fast creature, it's also not preferable to be the target of Thomas.


Of course, the spooky season is almost upon us, so we can probably expect to see some other mash-up of innocence and terror. Maybe the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles can make us piss ourselves in Outlast.

But I appreciate that while I might not get on with them, many others will enjoy the bite of an olive on its own, or the increased airflow to their larynx as they chortle at Joey doing the silly thing he does at Rachel, or whatever. Ghostrunner 2, a first-person cyberpunk slasher and sequel to Ghostrunner, has joined the echelon of things that aren't for me but might be for you.
That's because the game's relentlessly unforgiving, and sets margins so small you're rarely afforded much freedom. Sometimes it really does put you in the RGB kicks of a cyber ninja as you dash between the halves of cyborgs you've cleaved in two, but these moments can often be the weary culmination of agonising trial and error. If you're into that, great! If you're not, then I'd slink back into that shadow.

Ghostrunner managed to capture this feeling while remaining a solid first-person platformer on top of that. 


If anything, it was the first 3D title to give me that kind of tension since the only other games to scratch that itch were Hotline Miami and Katana Zero. Ghostrunner wasn't perfect, but I was ready for a sequel by the time it was announced. 


Now the aptly named Ghostrunner 2 is here, and with it that rush so few games captured for me. At first, I wasn't sure what to think of it, but playing its demo reeled me in. That snippet felt like Ghostrunner but more, and that was all I could ask f…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox will debut its new broadcast format, Xbox Partner Preview, this week where we'll hear from its third-party partners like Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, Remedy Entertainment, Studio Wildcard, and more. This new show will feature more than 20 minutes of trailers and new gameplay footage, and goes live at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Wednesday, October 25. 
You can watch the Xbox Partner Preview on Xbox-owned channels for a look at games coming to both Xbox and Windows PCs alongside new information about some upcoming Game Pass titles from the company's third-party partners. While Microsoft finally completed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard earlier this month, Xbox says the Xbox Partner Preview "will not feature any additional news, game reveals, or Game Pass information related" to the deal. 


Xbox says viewers can expect the latest information on in-game activities for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, a launch trailer for Alan Wake 2, the first gameplay for Ark: Survival Ascended, a "dive into the social world of Dungeons of Hinterberg," and more. 
The Xbox Partner Preview will air at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Wednesday, October 25 for roughly 20 minutes. 
In the meantime, catch up on Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard and then check out our list of every Activision Blizzard game Xbox now owns. Read our thoughts on Alan Wake 2 after going hands on with both an Alan Wake gameplay section and a Saga section.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following Spider-Man 2's successful launch last week, PlayStation has revealed just how impactful the game was. In the first 24 hours alone, the game sold over 2.5 million copies. This makes it the fastest-selling title from PlayStation's first-party studios. 




Numbers from the UK are also impressive. GameIndustry.biz reveals that Spider-Man 2 clenched the top spot when it comes to physical sales in the UK, surpassing Super Mario Bros Wonder. It also had 5% greater sales than Hogwarts Legacy on PS5. Overall, it is the 4th biggest physical launch in the UK this year, surpassed by Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, EA Sports FC24, and Hogwarts Legacy on all platforms.


Spider-Man 2's success is a product of some wise choices made by Sony over the years. It purchased the Spider-Man IP from Marvel in 1999 for $7 million which has turned out to be an incredibly advantageous move. Years later, Sony then tapped Insomniac to develop a new Spider-Man game, leading to the PS4 game. Not long after the studio was purchased by Sony for $229 million. 


Insomniac has proven itself yet again, but the studio isn't ready to sleep yet. Superhero fans can also look forward to Wolverine which is currently in development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 has only been available for three days, but the critically acclaimed sequel has already become the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game in the brand’s history.
In a press release, Sony Interactive Entertainment states that over 2.5 million copies of the game have been sold within the first 24 hours of launch. The publisher didn’t provide a breakdown in terms of physical vs digital, but that’s an impressive number for the PS5 exclusive.
This feat continues the series' record-setting trend; 2018's Spider-Man also became the fastest-selling first-party PS title at the time (for PS4 specifically with 3.3 million sold within the first three days of launch) and, later, became the best-selling superhero game ever in the U.S., a record it still holds today. Time will tell if this sequel can supplant its predecessor, but it's off to a strong start regardless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you want an example of how gothic and devilish gaming can get, look no further than Diablo 4. The recent installment in Blizzard's celebrated action-RPG series is literally collecting blood, with some potential hardware to come from it.


A recent video on the Diablo YouTube channel invites players to donate blood (presumably their own) to their local clinic. In doing so, rewards will be on offer. From donating blood.




To take that a step further, the studio is also looking to put together a custom PC that's liquid cooled by 666 quarters of real human blood. Anyone interested in taking part will need to show proof of their donation before the end of November 20.


Developers literally asking for a blood sacrifice


A website set up by the Diablo 4 team gives further details about the publicity stunt. According to the FAQ, you don't technically have to donate in order to get the rewards. This is simply about enough people donating to reach a required amount.


A post on Twitter/X says that the in-game rewards "will be unlocked for all players as we progress toward our donation goal." The custom-built PC is the endgame of all this. 


As for the specs, it sounds like it's going to be a pretty beefy system. It'll boast an Nvidia RTX 4090 graphics card, an Intel Core i9-13900K CPU, 64GB of RAM, and 3TB of M.2 SSD storage. Also, did I mention the human blood that's going to course through it? I'm pretty sure I mentioned the human blood that's going to course through it.

You play as Mara Forest, an investigator brave enough to search an abandoned amusement park in a short, white dress. She’s searching for the eccentric and elusive Edward Crow, a wealthy man who financed the eponymous amusement park, Crow Country. The amusement park has been left to rot for over a year, and I’m pretty sure you find out why in the demo, but I can’t remember, and I forgot to save the footage I took. Spooky!

Legend Haunted Lost Sectors are, essentially, just what it says on the tin: a heavily souped-up version of the regular Lost Sector missions with a bit of Halloween pizzaz plastered on top. They wouldn't even be particularly offensive as a side activity to accompany a full-fledged Festival of the Lost event, but Bungie instead introduced them as a replacement to the Haunted Forest, which veteran players may remember.

Over the decade since A Realm Reborn’s release, its reputation has grown with every single expansion. FFXIV’s producer and director Naoki Yoshida (more commonly known as Yoshi P) is now so synonymous with the game that it’s easy to forget he was only brought onto the project in 2010 - after XIV had been released, to overwhelmingly negative reviews.

The 'holy grail' of Super Mario 64 techniques has recently been perfected by the speedrunning community and it is capable of finally achieving a sub-1:37 time for 120-star runs.
The technique in question is all about bypassing the slow carpet ride required to nab the 'Big House in the Sky' star on Rainbow Ride. 'Carpetless' runs have been a known possibility since 2009, though nobody had been able to successfully utilise the technique in a full run to shave off any good amount of time. That is, until now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[May I have this high-score challenge?
2024 is on the horizon, which means it’s high time for Ubisoft to step onto the dancefloor with its latest Just Dance offering, Just Dance 2024 Edition. If you look back on our review of 2023’s entry, we mentioned that it significantly improved the tried-and-tested formula, boosting the visuals nicely while allowing players to remove the constant reminders for the game’s subscription service, Just Dance+, which has 300 more songs. It made for an experience that, while certainly not revolutionary, was a welcome step in the right direction.
Just Dance 2024 Edition, then, is more or less quite content to ride along on the coattails of its predecessor. It offers up another 40 new songs that cover a nice range of genres and styles which mixes the likes of ‘Survivor’ by Destiny’s Child with D Billions' 'My Name Is'; Whitney Houston's ‘I Wanna Dance With Somebody’ with ‘Canned Heat’ by Jamiroquai (and no, sadly the choreography hasn’t been taken from Napoleon Dynamite for that one). More recent hits to make this year's roster include Miley Cyrus' 'Flowers' and Sam Smith's I'm Not Here To Make Friends. As with prior entries, it’s worth just checking out the full track list prior to purchase to see if it will vibe with your musical preferences.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Onward and Upward!
You might remember that prior to the launch of Super Mario Bros. Wonder last week, we mentioned that the option to mute the game's talking flowers entirely seemed to be a thing. Many of you responded quite positively to the news, with some commenting that "The voices are awful" and "That'll be the first thing I do when I start the game".
While the game does offer up a number of options for the talking flowers (including voice on / text off, and vice versa), it seems that many folks are actually enjoying their whimsical chatter more than they perhaps realised. Indeed, we here at Nintendo Life were a bit wary of them at first (voiceover work in a 2D Mario game..? Hmm.) but we're actually rather fond of the little guys.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been 11 long years since the unveiling of Squadron 42, Star Citizen's singleplayer campaign, seven years since developer Cloud Imperium Games broke Squadron 42 off into a standalone purchase, five years since Crytek took them to court for allegedly breaching their CryEngine license, three years since Crytek and Cloud Imperium settled that lawsuit, and three years since director Chris Roberts sought to justify the game's mammoth development time to Kickstarter backers, declaring that "it would be doing a huge disservice to everyone working really hard on the project and all of you that are looking forward to it to deliver something that isn't great." Well, all that waiting has finally paid off, as Squadron 42 is now officially... "feature-complete" and "into the polishing phase", meaning that the Wing Commander-inspired space sim is almost guaranteed to release before the death of our sun.


Cloud Imperium have released a new trailer walkthrough to celebrate, which does admittedly look spaceworthy. It's a whistle-stop tour of Squadron 42 gameplay and story materials - from dogfights in asteroid belts that use a new precision targeting feature, through "OMG my CO is Gillian Anderson" cinematics, to physics-based puzzling malarkey involving a Half-Life Gravity Gun-adjacent gizmo. If I were, say, Starfield developer Bethesda, I'd be particularly worried about those planetary surface flyovers. Mind you, by the time Squadron 42 launches we'll probably be playing Starfield 2. I kid, Roberts, I kid!

We've long had grievances with some of the games showing up on Nintendo's eShop. Amongst some true shining gems, lumps of coal have been dumped with seemingly no consideration for consumer satisfaction, including the likes of The Last Hope - Dead Zone Survival (since removed) and Prison Life Simulator 2022.
The latest addition is perhaps one of the most egregious, and it comes from repeat offender INSTAMARKETINGANDGAME, a company that has knocked out "classics" such as Counter Bunny Hop - Strike Go Simulator Xtreme Deluxe 3D Shooter and War Tank Machine Battle Vehicle Simulator - Fight World Wars WWII Mechanic Troopers Royale Driving. It's a game that, quite frankly, goes way beyond the boundaries of decency.

This is not to put down Super Mario Bros. Wonder, of course, which jumped into second and (according to GameIndustry.biz's Chris Dring) has bagged itself the third-largest launch for a Mario platformer in chart history — not bad going, eh?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Metal Gear franchise has been quiet since 2018's somewhat bizarre Metal Gear Survive. The series' creator, Hideo Kojima, publicly left Konami in 2015 shortly after the release of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and since then fans just weren't sure what to expect, or even if to expect anything from the property. That changed recently when Konami finally revealed some plans for the franchise. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is being remade and retitled Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Volume 1 is releasing this week.
The collection contains the NES and MSX releases of Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, Snake's Revenge, Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and additional bonuses like soundtracks, scripts, and more. It's far from a complete collection of all things Metal Gear (hence the Volume 1 part of the title, presumably), but it arguably finally gives players access to the best of Metal Gear's past on modern consoles. The game releases on Xbox Series X, Switch, and PC October 24, but ahead of that release, Alex Van Aken (a Metal Gear newcomer) joined me (an old Metal Gear sicko) for an extended look at almost everything the collection offers.
We had early access to the PlayStation 5 version of the game and you can check out the full video below:

Super Mario Bros. Wonder brings back Mario and his Mushroom Kingdom brethren in a mainline series entry that we deem to be "the slickest, sharpest, and smartest that two-dimensional Mario has felt since 1991" in our review.
And it's Super Mario Bros. Wonder, remember — Nintendo's most famous sibling is right there and playable from the start, as he should be. In honour of this evergreen fraternal relationship, today we're looking back at all the other sibling relationships and rivalries in the Nintendo canon. The Mario brothers may be the most famous, but they're far from the only ones!

        <id>https://www.nintendolife.com/#article-157250</id>
        <link href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/suika-game"/>
        <updated>2023-10-22T12:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripe and ready.
A couple of years ago, a Japanese company called Aladdin X released a digital projector, and it included a fun little fruit game called Suika Game as part of its software. Suika Game was so well received by people who bought the projector that the company decided to port a version of it to Switch, but the game launched there to almost no audience response. Then, two years later, it randomly became a viral sensation in Japan after a few streamers made it popular. Now it’s quietly made its way to the eShop outside of Japan, and while it’s admittedly very basic, it’s hard to say that Suika Game lacks appeal.
Suika Game could best be described as “2048 with physics”. You drop fruit onto a board, with the goal of getting matching fruits to touch so they fuse into a bigger fruit, granting you extra points. The tough part comes in with the way that the fruits don’t neatly stack on each other. Each new fruit dropped in will roll around a bit and usually push others out of the way, often blocking access to fruits beneath it. Inevitably, this causes the board to fill up all the way and then you have to start all over.

One drawback thus far has been that there was no native integration with the Unreal engine. That has now changed thanks to a new open source plug-in created by The Chinese Room.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a new web event for Genshin Impact to promote the release of its new OST album, but some seemingly AI-generated artwork featured in the event leaves a lot to be desired.


The web event is called “Glad Tidings from Afar,” and you’re supposed to listen to some of the new Fontaine OST tracks, then send them as gifts. The recipients include various Genshin Impact characters, represented by chibis. When you send some music to a character, you’re “rewarded” with an animated version of their chibi emote. 


The problem is that some of these animated Genshin Impact chibis were very clearly made using some kind of AI tool. Tighnari, for example, can’t decide how many fingers he’s supposed to have or which way his thumb is supposed to be facing.

Earlier today, Day 1 of the London Fan Festival kicked off and Yoshida returned to reveal more details about the expansion.


We already knew two jobs were on the way, but not what they were. Now we know one of the two is going to be the melee job Viper. The Viper dual-wields swords that can be combined into a single double sword as well. The class will share gear with the Ninja class. According to Yoshida, the Viper is an original class but took inspiration from Zidane from Final Fantasy IX. The Viper is designed to appeal to those who want a new dual-wield job that is not Ninja.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Harvest Dew.
If the 'Uncanny Valley' is the term for something being almost-human-but-not-quite, then Harvest Moon: Winds of Anthos is in the Uncanny Stardew Valley. It's so close to being a really good farming sim game, but doesn't quite manage to hit the mark. However, for the first time in the turbulent and confusing history of Natsume's Harvest Moon games, it's actually... fun.
The story is the same old, same old: the Harvest Goddess disappears after some catastrophic geographical event, and it's up to us to restore her and the world through the power of farming. The twist here is that a volcano erupted, and Ms. Goddess decided to build a bunch of walls around all the villages, thus both protecting them and isolating them in one fell swoop. You'll have to dismantle the walls, befriend the Sprites living inside them, and revitalise the towns within, mostly by completing various fetch quests. The story doesn't make a lot of sense — everyone is very chill about getting separated from their families for a decade — but it's good enough to get started with.

Sega is certainly no stranger to wafting in self-nostalgia. After all, it has been shoving its old-school arcade roms into games since the days of Shenmue. Remember Space Harrier? Sega will never let you forget. 


The trend has continued for decades, and that's the only reason I knew what I played was something I've experienced a few times before. No, it's not Space Harrier (enough with Space Harrier!), but if you've played Yakuza or Judgment recently, you should recognize it too.

When everything is running well, it feels like Lords of the Fallen had the potential to be a landmark Soulslike title. But those situations are few and far between. I had hoped that the back half of LotF would highlight the good. Unfortunately, things got worse, and the final hours of my experience were a slog and, to put it bluntly, just not fun.


Boss fights seemed to get more and more tedious and just outright unfair. And as I progressed, the amount of performance issues and bugs I encountered just kept increasing. There are times when I really had fun with Lords of the Fallen. But those times were far and few between.

While Cyberpunk 2077 was initially going to have a multiplayer component, it vanished like a fart in the wind. However, that hasn't stopped me from fantasizing about what could have been. Plus, I also need to justify my obsession by getting her into this universe.

It was 1996 in Japan and 1998 in North America (and a year later in Europe) when the ageing Game Boy got an unexpected shot in the arm thanks to a little game named Pokémon. Nintendo's granddaddy of handheld gaming suddenly had a new lease on life, but in the West the release of the game was followed just weeks later by the arrival of a new console — the Game Boy Color — and it was on that wonderful system that many of us caught our very first Pocket Monster.

"We have a great relationship with Microsoft," said Bowser. "We consider them to be partners in many, many ways, and you only have to look at Nintendo Switch to see that partnership. Obviously, Minecraft is on Nintendo Switch, and we brought Banjo Kazooie to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. So, we're looking forward to that partnership continuing."

The popular but rare World of Warcraft mount from the Wrath of the Lich King expansion is now available in Diablo 4. And don't worry...if you are fearing the grind, it's not necessary here. Instead, all you need is a credit card!


That's right, instead of purchasing a quality game, you can spend just $25 to get enough Platinum for the cool mount. The Invincible Aspect bundle is available now for 2,500 Platinum through the Diablo 4 store. In case you were wondering, you can get 2,800 Platinum for $25. There's nothing in the store you can spend the leftover 300 Platinum on, but that's OK! I mean come on, it's the Invincible Mount in Diablo 4!

You are not prepared


Sorry if I'm sounding facetious here, I just hate it when a full-priced $70 game locks its coolest cosmetics behind an overpriced purchase. There should at least be a way to get the cosmetic in-game, even if it requires some sort of farming.


The Invincible Aspect bundle includes four cosmetics:



Invincible Aspect Mount


Bard of Undying Loyalty Mount Armor


Domination Helm Mount Trophy (The Lich King's helmet)


Echo of Frostmourne Mount Trophy (The Lich King's weapon)



Screenshot by Destructoid


In World of Warcraft, the mount has a 1% drop chance from the final boss in the Icecrown Citadel raid. As if that's not rare enough, you can only clear the raid once per week on each character. Some players have been farming the mount for years with no success.


I was going to get the Diablo 4 Invincible Mount but as you can see in the screenshot I was 2,440 Platinum short. Maybe next time!

I’ve probably already lost half of you, but it was worth it. For the rest of you who remain, I’m mostly kidding. Mostly. I think history is misremembering Battletoads as a landmark series, when most people only played the first two levels of the original title and never saw past the Turbo Tunnel. Let me tell you, it doesn’t get better from there. But before anyone really had time to let the trauma set in, Rare had ported it to a myriad of platforms.


Battlemaniacs is weirdly derivative of the original title. But, hey, the 1994 arcade game is pretty good.


And then there was Battletoads and Double Dragon. The concept is just incredible, taking the grandfathe…]]></summary>

I first played this game two years after its 2020 release, in the summer of July 2022, jobless and depressed. It felt good to exist in a world where capitalistic business executives make inhumane decisions about the last of humanity living in their Dharma Tower, except instead of suffering under their thumb, I, or rather, protagonist Ghostrunner, took a katana straight to the top to bring it all down. The game concludes with humanity free and Ghostrunner liberated from the A.I.-powered Cybervoid trappings under a new name: Jack.

Those changes are the additions of the Queens and Brooklyn boroughs on top of the existing Manhattan map and the switch from PlayStation 4 to exclusively PlayStation 5 (Spider-Man 1 and Miles Morales are also on PS5, but cross-platform).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2023 has seen a wave of unionization across the video game industry, with new unions popping up at companies like ZeniMax Media and Sega of America. Now Nintendo of America president Doug Bowswer has commented on the possibility of a union at his company. 


In an interview with Inverse, Bowser was asked what role unions might play at NOA in the future. Bowser touted NOA’s success without a union, pointing to its high employee retention rate. “Our focus has always been on creating a culture that's inclusive, has a work-life balance, and is focused on our singular mission of bringing smiles to faces,” Bowser said. 


An inclusive culture creates a great foundation for employees at any workplace, but some still see unions as key to securing better pay, benefits, and treatment from a company. Bowser acknowledged that unions aren’t off the table at NOA. “Everyone has the right to form a union, and certainly in the future, wherever it takes us, we'll respect that," Bowser told Inverse.


The state of Nintendo


In April 2022 Kotaku published a report in which former contractors alleged that they were mistreated and never offered a legitimate path to full-time employment. “They want to control you like you’re full-time, but not treat you like a full-time worker,” one contract worker said. 


IGN published a similar report in May 2022. Some workers interviewed for the piece complained of “a huge disparity” between themselves and full-time employees. The company has previously faced labor complaints for allegedly cracking down on discussions of unionization.

Of the notable things he said about it, one about Nintendo accounts is particularly intriguing.


“But one thing we've done with the Switch to help with that communication and transition is the formation of the Nintendo Account," Bowser told Inverse. "In the past, every device we transitioned to had a whole new account system. Creating the Nintendo Account will allow us to communicate with our players if and when we make a transition to a new platform, to help ease that process or transition.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's just a week away from Alan Wake 2's release, and we've finally gotten a look at the PC system requirements. It's a game that attempts to push graphical boundaries and competes with AAA titles from around the world, so it is no surprise that the requirements are quite steep. 




Regardless of your settings, you'll need 16GB RAM and Windows 10/11. Like a few other AAA games released this year, you also require an SSD with at least 90GB free. As for the CPU, Remedy is asking for a Ryzen 7 3700X or Intel equivalent for all settings except for the lowest where an Intel i5-7600K or AMD equivalent can be used.

The lowest settings will have you playing at 1080p at 30 FPS. To hit this, you'll need a GeForce RTX 2060 or a Radeon RX 6600. You'll also need 6GB VRAM. For a balanced experience that runs at 1440p at 30 FPS, ensure you have a GeForce RTX 3060 or a Radeon RX 6600 XT. The game also requires 8GB of VRAM. 


Ultra settings are for enthusiasts because you'll need a monster of a machine to pull it off. With ultra settings, you can play at 4K at 60 FPS. You will also need 12GB VRAM and a GeForce RTX 4070 or a Radeon RX 7800 XT. 


There are also settings for ray tracing included. Anyone hoping to get maximum ray tracing requires an RTX 4080 GPU. It's a big ask, but it may be worth it, as Control demonstrated Remedy's excellent use of ray tracing. 


The next chapter in Alan Wake's story is almost upon us, but he won't be coming alone. This time around there's a second protagonist, Saga Anderson, who has a nose for sniffing out a mystery.

        <updated>2023-10-20T17:32:53.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer One More Level and publisher 505 Games have pulled back the DLC curtain plans for its upcoming first-person parkour-action game, Ghostrunner 2, ahead of its release next week. As previously announced, all Brutal Edition owners of Ghostrunner 2 will get the Season Pass, which includes all of the DLC announced today. Otherwise, the Season Pass will cost $19.99.
As for what to expect, One More Level has revealed four cosmetic packs and a new way to play the game called Endless Moto Mode. Given that we know Ghostrunner 2 features a motorbike for protagonist Jack to ride, we're guessing this new mode has something to do with that. In each cosmetic pack, players will receive three sword skins, three hand skins, and one motorcycle skin. The first one – Ice Pack – goes live in-game on December 7. 
Check out the Ghostrunner 2 Season Pass trailer for yourself below: 


Sometime in February, the Dragon Pack will go live followed by the Heat Pack in June of next year. The Endless Moto Mode is due out sometime in September of 2024, with the Anniversary Pack following it in October. 
Buying the Brutal Edition of Ghostrunner 2 gets you all of this DLC and 48-hours of early access to the game, meaning you can jump in starting October 24 ahead of the game's standard October 26 release date. 
For more, check out the Ghostrunner 2 soundtrack list (and listen to a full song from it right now), and then watch this gameplay trailer from earlier this year.

        <updated>2023-10-20T17:24:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you remember how RoboCop: Rogue City was coming to Switch? No you don't, because it's not happening! Nacon has confirmed that their plans for a Switch version has been quietly tossed in the dumpster.


This might not be much of a surprise. The Switch logo hasn't been shown on the game's trailers since at least the Future Games Show that was held in August. It was, on the other hand, on its gameplay reveal trailer from last year. So, it seems that a Switch version was at least considered. Gematsu reached out to Nacon to get confirmation and was told, “At this moment, we don’t have any plans for a Nintendo Switch release.”


Normally for a licensed game, this wouldn't be a huge loss, but I recently played the Robocop: Rogue City demo, and it instantly shot up my list of anticipated games. I was not expecting that. Not only does it capture the feel of being a walking refrigerator, it also ties in deeper elements to complement its gunplay. My only question at this point is if it can maintain that quality for the game's runtime. If so, I'll be stunned, blown away, and many other hyperbolic statements that will hopefully get me into the accolades trailer.


As I mentioned, however, a Switch version of Robocop: Rogue City was never heavily advertised to start with. However, there's evidence that it was considered, but they decided not to go through with it. This might have been technical difficulties, lack of budget, or any number of other reasons. Still, it's a bummer for gamers who prefer to stick to Nintendo's handheld hybrid.


Did I mention how amped I am for this game?


RoboCop: Rogue City is still coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on November 2, 2023. And I'm very excited.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spider-Man 2 has only recently hit shelves but already Insomniac is thinking about the future. The first Spider-Man game received a spin-off, Miles Morales, so it's natural to wonder whether the sequel will also feature a sequel, perhaps this time starring Venom. According to senior narrative director Jon Paquette, Insomniac is waiting to see how the fans react before they decide on the direction of a possible spinoff. 


As Paquette explains, the main question Insomniac asks itself is "what do the fans really want?" Then, they try to give them that. After Spider-Man 2's successful launch, the studio does need some recovery time but discussing ideas will resume once everyone has "had time to sleep and take vacations."

Venom and his 19 inches


In Paquette's interview with Insider, he reveals that the aim was for the game to be "one of the best Venom stories you've ever experienced." To do this, they would need an amazing voice actor, and it was found that Candyman's Tony Todd was the man for the job. When crafting the tale, Insomniac drew from the Spider-Man comics, but the studio still puts a unique twist on things. 


It's not hard to imagine a Venom spin-off being celebrated, as it appears the character has already struck a chord with players. Part of his popularity comes from a viral PlayStation Tweet falling victim to bad phrasing when describing the Venom statue that comes with the Collector's Edition. 


In Spider-Man 2, Venom's symbiote is discovered to help heal sickness and make its host feel stronger than ever. The longer it sticks around, however, the more it shows its sinister side, but by then it may be too late. 


Venom is a handful, but Peter doesn't have to face him alone. He receives help from Miles Morales, who you can also play as.

To be clear, Super Mario Bros. Wonder isn’t a hard game. There are stages you can unlock here that will test your skill, but overall, this one’s 100% casual friendly. That said, as I was playing the game, I did come across a few quirks that I would have liked to know before I started playing. These are, ultimately, rather small things, but honestly, I’m just writing this as an excuse to chat more about this game with you all.

I knew it was going to be a rough road judging from the demo and every trailer shown for it. However, the roads are pretty beyond rough. They feel as though the roads, as well as the people on them, were created by someone who has never been in a vehicle before.


Alaskan Road Truckers has a lot of problems, but the biggest one is that the central gameplay – the driving – sucks out loud. Part of this is the driving controls and vehicle physics in general, but the other part is the world around your truck.


One of the first things that struck me was a bump in the road. Right by your HQ is this big dip followed by a hill, and if you hit that thing at a speed faster than a crawl, it will pop your rig up. I…]]></summary>

The most notable example of this is when former president Hiroshi Yamauchi purchased a majority stake in the Seattle Mariners when the team struggled in the 1990s.

Nothing so notable has happened since, but Nintendo still has a noticeable presence around Seattle. The Pacific Northwestern city hosted the first Nintendo Live outside Japan, and Nintendo of America's headquarters is in Redmond, Washington, a city in Seattle's county. Still, it's fun seeing the interesting partnerships between the city and the company.

It's the tactility of chunky spaceship interfaces combined with the frustration of the corporation cheaping out on everything and not caring that it'll get everyone killed. It's the desperate crews exploring derelicts out on the fringes of the known, where terrible, unspeakable things have been unleashed. Alien by way of Duskers.
I didn't love playing it, though. It was too frantic, too awkward, too short. Deadnaut Colon Signal Lost changes all those things and more. It's more like a re-interpretation of its own ideas than a direct sequel. Consequently, it's sanded off a little of its unique nature, but overall is a much better game.
Even though it's a bloody roguelike. Godddd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox's space 4X strategy game Stellaris is getting a new Astral Planes expansion, in which you send ships through rifts to "completely different realms of existence, where fundamentals that were certain at home may not always be true". I've read a few sci-fi novels in my time, and have come to the conclusion that tunnelling into other dimensions is seldom a wise move, but there's no turning back at the threshold when you're nurturing a mighty galactic empire, I guess. Find a trailer below in which some poor science ship pilot gets his brain fried by a crackling window of purple impossibility.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the beginning of September, the soundtrack for Tunic disappeared from streaming services. The composers, Lifeformed and Janice Kwan, said they'd received several false DMCA takedown notices for their work, which had resulted in the removal of both Tunic's soundtrack from numerous platforms, as well as three more of their albums. For a while, things looked very uncertain about the likelihood of their soundtracks returning. Left without much recourse against their distributor, the composers eventually filed a counterclaim to try and better protect their work and get them back online. Thankfully, they were successful, and all four soundtracks are back where they belong.  
It's been a messy saga about that's highlighted several issues about how DMCA claims can be manipulated like this, and they're not the only ones it's happened to recently, either. Fortunately for the Tunic duo at least, the situation's since been resolved and their soundtracks are now back where they belong - and to celebrate, they've released a whole new set of Tunic tracks that they describe as "initial piano concepts" for some of its major themes. And hey. You know me. I love a good piano collection of a video game soundtrack, so it is probably no surprise whatsoever that I've more or less had this on repeat for the last month. It's so, so, so good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking forward to Halloween? If not, see you at Thanksgiving. If you are, Steam is once again about to kick-off one of its many sales events. This time, it's all about the spooky (I refuse to say "spoops" in earnest).


In a recent video uploaded to YouTube, Valve announced the Steam Scream: The Revenge fest begins on October 26, going on until November 2. Keep an eye on this page for details about what deals and discounts will be on offer.




As usual, we don't know the specifics of what games will be featured, but we do know it's a celebration of all things horror-related.


For example...


In the trailer above, you can see glimpses of some of the titles participating in Steam Scream. It looks like there's a healthy bunch of AAA and indie games to look forward to.


We can see clips from Black Mesa (the ambitious fan remake of Half-Life), Metro Exodus, Little Nightmares 2, DEVOUR, Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach, the Dead Space remake, GTFO, Hollow Knight, and more. In short, it looks like it's going to be a pretty interesting fest for us horror fans.


This time of year is always a hoot for the genre. Steam especially seems to keep its finger on the pulse when it comes to Halloween. As a long-time lover of horror gaming, the next week or so is going to be an exciting one for me. Although, the scariest thing will be how I'm going to be able to afford all these discounted titles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion in the Scarlet & Violet series is nearly here, bringing more than 180 new cards. Paradox Rift features new Ancient and Future Pokémon, playing off a story element of the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet games, as well as type-shifted Tera Pokémon EX cards to play off one of the core mechanics of the latest-generation video games. 
Speaking of Pokémon EX cards, Paradox Rift offers more than 15 new Pokémon EX cards, but it doesn't stop there. Collectors and players alike can also expect more than 20 new Trainer cards, as well as 15 special illustration rare Pokémon and Supporter cards and 28 ultra rare full-art etched Pokémon EX and Supporter cards. There are even seven hyper-rare gold-etched cards to cross your fingers for.
The Pokémon Company sent along a bunch of booster packs from the Paradox Rift expansion for us to open in order to see what we could pull. After the last expansion focused squarely on the original 151 Pokémon, Paradox Rift largely shines the spotlight elsewhere (though a few Kanto creatures still show up). I loved the Yveltal and Garchomp EX cards I pulled, but my favorite is probably the Armarouge EX. I also loved the Ancient and Future Pokémon, but I'm disappointed the ones I pulled weren't foils. However, the gold-etched Iron Valiant EX card more than made up for that.
Check out my favorite pulls in the gallery below:

SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE END OF MARVEL’S SPIDER-MAN 2.
With Peter and Miles’ big team-up adventure now complete, developer Insomniac Games seems ready to suggest a new spider-powered hero, introducing this universe’s version of Cindy Moon, aka Silk.
Silk is a more recent addition to the Marvel canon, first appearing in the 2014 relaunch of The Amazing Spider-Man series. The character, created by Dan Slott and Humberto Ramos, is one of several heroic leads that have expanded the scope of the Spider-Man universe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard rolled out Diablo 4's Season 2, also known as the Season of Blood, this week, together with an absolute deluge of quality-of-life improvements across console and PC. The publisher have also now launched the hitherto Battle.net-based PC version on Steam, and are trying to attract newcomers with a discount on Valve's platform and a free 10 hour trial this weekend (that's 19th-22nd October) for Xbox players.


Have the Season 2 updates - which you could summarise as "slay vampires to get vampire powers" and "spend less time and have more fun grinding/farming for loot and levels" - salvaged Blizzard's action-RPG from the ashes of Season 1? I've been trawling the reactions this morning, and while the new Diablo appears to be evolving in the right direction, the big picture is still of a game with just as many raters as haters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cor, it sure is good to be back in Commander Video’s running shoes again. I know Bit.Trip Runner and Choice Provisions’ assorted Bit.Trip rhythm games have been available on Steam for absolutely yonks (and still are, in fact), but my memories of these are all on the Nintendo Wii. That’s where I encountered most of the games first - and I haven’t really been back since. I dabbled in Runner 2 on the Wii U, but positively bounced off the 3D-ness of Runner 3 when it came to PC, preferring instead the clean, simple lines of its stark pixel sprites. 
It's with some surprise, then, that I’ve had such a good time with Bit.Trip ReRunner, the recently released fancied up version of the auto-running original that brings its rhythmic courses kicking and screaming into that third dimension. But it’s really more of a compilation game than anything else, packing in extra protein in the form of EP soundtracks and freshly-created course selections from all eight games in the series (mashing tunes from Beat, Core, Void, Fate, Flux into a Runner-style format), as well as lots of new tricks and abilities up its sleeve. But the crown jewel in ReRunner isn’t so much the joy of getting a fresh dose of OG Runner again, but seeing what its player base has already started making with its brilliant Runner Maker level editor. Yep, much like Super Mario Maker before it, Bit.Trip has opened itself up to the whims of would-be game making audience, and they are running with it (sorry).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One Punch Man is great and often hilarious manga/anime about Saitama, the namesake of the franchise, who defeats every foe he encounters with one punch. It functions both as a great parody of anime characters who are constantly struggling to become stronger and as great action anime on its own. As a video game, however, it struggles somewhat as Saitama must defeat everyone in one punch, which isn't particularly fun gameplay, forcing you to play as the many other characters of the franchise, who sadly aren't Saitama.
One Punch Man: World is currently in closed beta and while it doesn't particularly solve any of those issues, it does look great and showcase some impressive action. It is a free-to-play game, though, which means there are gacha mechanics and lots of different currencies to deal with. Join Marcus Stewart and me as we check out the game and share our thoughts on the One Punch Man anime.

The latest Lords of the Fallen update, Patch v.1.1.207, is a thrilling litany of technical gremlins that have now been tracked down and slaughtered.


Amongst other things, the developers have turned off collision detection for an entire library, to avoid tanking the frame-rate when you - for reasons best known only to yourself - attack the books. In other news, the game will no longer crash itself in "revenge" when you hit walls too often (a rare, and rather amusing-sounding bug - best be wary when looking for secret rooms I guess). Hexworks have also identified the source of a crashing problem when playing Lords of the Fallen on Steam Deck, though the fix for that particular issue hasn’t yet passed QA. Oh, and they've made the continue button "sexier". Look, don't ask me, I just work here.

I’ll even continue playing it, which isn’t that common after a review, especially for such a timesink. This time around, it has grabbed me, and yet it's such a small step forward that I don't feel entirely comfortable recommending it outright.

It's less about mere familiarity than you'd think, given how late I first played it. Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri By Sid Meier endures partly because its design has aged well, but mostly because it's an unusually human 4X strategy. Its high concept story asks for interpretation, for a philosophical response. Where so many others are about the arbitrary icons of nationalism, or stock elves/insectoids/robots, it's a game about ideology and personality. Where a sequel to Civilization's "send a colony ship into space" ending could have asked "what if lasers and aliens", Alpha Centauri instead asked: Where is humanity going?

Eight years and millions of digital building permits later, Colossal Order has returned to construct a convincing sequel in Cities: Skylines II.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Space Tales is a new real-time strategy game from Vietnam-based Saigon Dragon, who worked with Numantian Games to develop the brilliant They Are Billions. In They Are Billions, you scraped together walls and turrets to hold off a world's worth of undead, and prolong the miserable lives of a tiny handful of non-zombified humans at your settlement's core. Space Tales is breezier of demeanour - like the confusingly named 2014 RTS Space Rogue, it takes inspiration from 1940s retro-futurism, with brightly coloured maps and chunky chrome unit design. But there are similarly grim overtones. The game puts you in charge of a Starship Troopers-esque expeditionary force, carving out secure nooks on very-much-inhabited alien planets and flogging them as holiday destinations.

For our larger theme we discuss games that flip-reverse their theme when you least expect it, which is usually seemingly-cute games becoming horror - much like Harvest Island.
Plus: James gives us a rundown of fun games he tried at EGX, which sound very cool!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After busting down the castle door with their chaotic, siege-based citybuilder Diplomacy Is Not An Option last year, the last thing I expected to see next from developers Door 407 was a chill, meditative puzzle game that's just about, well, building tiny cities. In Urbo there are no sky lasers, no oncoming hordes. Nothing. Just dinky little grid-based maps, and an endless stream of tiny adorable buildings to plonk down on them in the pursuit of sweet, sweet point scores.
This being a puzzle game, the aim here is to place three buildings of the same type altogether, either in a line or right-angled cluster, at which point they'll all shzooge together to level up to the next building type. This is where the Threes comparison comes in, though you can zhuzh more than three of the same building together if you're smart to earn more points. But it's not quite as simple as that. You see, your buildings will only shoump onto the tile you placed down last, and careful city planners will likely want to think about placing their buildings in reverse so they end up with their fancy new house in the place they actually want it, not in an awkward middle spot that cuts off two precious tiles from play, or awkwardly sits in the middle of another chain of dwellings accidentally. And yep, that's where the Dorfromantik connection comes in, and I really do like it very, very much.

Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl launched in 2021, offering a competent, albeit underwhelming, alternative to popular platform fighters like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. The premise of taking heavy inspiration from the Smash Bros.'s gameplay but replacing the gaming icons with some of the most popular Nickelodeon characters from across generations is enticing, but the launch product didn't quite live up to the lofty expectations established by Nintendo's genre leader. Though post-launch updates and DLC brought the product closer to what fans were h…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is almost here – just one more day until it hits PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20. We loved it – read Game Informer's review of it here – and are excited for everyone to get their hands on it. Yesterday, we learned Insomniac Games recommends players download the day one patch for the "best experience" before starting the first mission, and now, we've learned when to expect the fan-favorite New Game Plus feature in the sequel. 
As first reported by PlayStation Lifestyle, someone asked Insomniac Games community director James Stevenson if New Game Plus and mission replay will be in the game at launch. Stevenson said, "No, we're working on an update for those features but they won't be in Day 1."
No - we’re working on an update for those features but they won’t be in Day 1
October 17, 2023
After someone on Twitter expressed their disappointment in the replies, Stevenson clarified that New Game Plus was not a Day 1 feature in the original Marvel's Spider-Man, but instead a mode added roughly six weeks after launch. 
Someone else asked Stevenson on Twitter if New Game Plus is coming this year or 2024 and Stevenson said it "should be before end of year."
Should be before end of year
October 18, 2023
So if you're looking forward to replaying the story of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 with all of your favorite suits, gadgets, abilities, and more unlocked from the jump, it sounds like it could be just a month or two away. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review and then read about the Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Day 1 patch. After that, check out Game Informer's spoiler-free tips to know before starting Marvel's Spider-Man 2.

It's a roguelikelike deck-building strategy game where you draft units who drop onto a grid in random positions, enabling all sorts of abilities and combos depending on where they all land. It's kinda like the roguelikelike slot machine Luck Be A Landlord dressed for a Halloween party in a turn-based tactics costume. Million Monster Militia is ropey in its current early access stage, but I have enjoyed discovering weird builds and I am cautiously curious about its future after some updates.

After all, the flipside of the genre mantra of solving problems through imaginative application of the tools is that when you achieve a boring solution, that's all your fault. Did you miss the final jump while trying for a complex, third-storey infiltration in Deathloop, resulting in a sadly non-immersive firefight in the courtyard below? Did you fail to combo those magical abilities and terrain variables as the developers hoped - nay, dreamed you would, forcing you to rely on ye olde cover-shoot tactics to reach the checkpoint? Shame on you! Don't you know how much imsims cost to develop? Go back to Open-Ended Systems School and retake that course in The Power of Choice. Also, consider playing Mosa Lina instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 7th Guest is a 1993 puzzle adventure game that was released on PCs in 1993, just a few months before Myst. It was an early instance of a fully modeled 3D location, and its use of FMV actors for its cast felt like you were looking into the future of video games. It received a few underwhelming sequels and other adaptions, but The 7th Guest VR marks arguably its biggest and boldest reimagining. Effectively a remake, this version of the game takes the familiar locations and story and adds in new puzzles and new performances. Considering the original game (and this remake) is about exploring a spooky house and solving puzzles, it feels at home in VR. You can watch Wes LeBlanc and me check out the game below.
For a whole lot more on The 7th Guest, you can read our oral history of the game right here. You can also take a look at this translated interview between Mario and Zelda creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Spirited Away director, Hayao Miyazaki, from the early 90s where Miyamoto called the game "inspiring".

Newegg are currently offering a deal on Corsair's SF1000L, a compact 1000W 80+ Gold rated fully modular power supply - it's down to $150, from $180. 
That's still a lot, but this is quite a fair price for a 1kW PSU from a well-known manufacturer, let alone an SFX-L one as these are often more expensive due to their level of miniaturisation that is required. This basically allows you to use even the most energy-intensive CPUs or GPUs available*.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asus make some of the best gaming laptops going, and their Flow Z13 (discounted today!) is one of the most interesting too. It's an ultraportable 13-inch machine with high-end specs, a 1200p (1920x1200) 120Hz touchscreen and a detchable keyboard. Plug in Asus' discrete GPU (or any other eGPU solution), and you're left with an extremely powerful gaming machine - then unplug and you've got a thin and light laptop for getting work done or consuming media on the go. Nice. 
Anyway, this laptop retailed for $1300 when it first debuted last year, but now it's down to $700 at Woot in the US. That's a substantial savings and a good deal for a 13-inch laptop with a Core i5 12500H CPU, 16GB of DDR5 RAM and a 512GB NVMe SSD.

It did so for several reasons – its beautifully realized visuals, top-notch voice acting, and, of course, the potential to play as some of my favorite characters in a Metroidvania-esque adventure. That wasn't all, though; The snippets of composer David Housden's score in the reveal trailer indicated this team was on to something. 
It was clear from the first listen that Housden and Dlala put a lot of effort into making Illusion Island sound like Disney. What's more, it replicated not just the broader stroke that anyone can hear and go, "Oh, that sounds like Disney music," but instead created something wholly original that simultaneously sounded…]]></summary>

Starfield hit Xbox and PC on September 6 and while its Xbox Game Pass release surely helped it become the biggest launch ever for a Bethesda game with more than 6 million players, Circana's data tracks dollar sales. This means Starfield was the best-selling game of September despite Xbox Game Pass. Circana executive director Mat Piscatella says on Twitter that, "Starfield ranked as the best-s…]]></summary>

The two parties have worked together for an upcoming music video for the K-Pop group as well as in-game Overwatch 2 content. 
Le Sserafim is comprised of five performers: Kim Chaewon, Sakura, Huh Yunjin, Kazuha, and Hong Eunchae. The group and Blizzard are working together for a video for Le Sserafim's next single, "Perfect Night," and it will debut on October 26 at 9 p.m. PT. The collaboration also includes a Le Sserafim-inspired custom game mode for Overwatch 2 and exclusive in-game items like hero skins. More details about the in-game events will arrive on October 30, according to Blizzard, but the content goes live for players on November 1. 
"We're extremely excited to be working with Le Sserafim for our game's first musical artist collaboration," Overwatch general manager Walter Kong writes in a press release. "Like the heroes of Overwatch, the Le Sserafim members are amazing as individuals, but unstoppable when they come together." 
Blizzard says Le Sserafim will also make an appearance at this year's BlizzCon on November 4 to perform "Perfect Night," as well as other songs, in the BlizzCon Arena following the conclusion of Community Night. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Overwatch 2 review and then read about the company's celebration of Overwatch 2's first anniversary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being as much of an insufferable, online-but-ultimately-in-quite-a-basic-way person as I am, I'm a Junji Ito girlie. The horror manga artist has an immediately recognisable style that intersects detailed, line heavy art with strange and upsetting concepts, and some of his short stories have acquired a sort of semi-memetic status ("This is my hole! It was made for me!"). If you're at all familiar with Junji Ito's work you will look at unforgiving almost-text-adventure World Of Horror and go "Huh, that's inspired by Junji Ito."
This isn't just because it looks like his work but rendered in MSPaint, or because it contains, just, direct references to it, but because of the whole vibe. You encounter face-sloughing-off kinds of monsters and vengeful spirits inspired by Japanese folkloric yokai, but also weirdo janitors doing stuff like turning the swim team into mermaids in a kind of pervier version of Tusk. At the same time, there's a streak of the Lovecraftian in play to keep it nice and legally distinct, as each self-contained run at the titular world is an attempt to save your town from destruction at the hands of an Old God (they earn the leaden thud of the capital letters). You will fail a lot. But isn't failure part of the fun!? Imagine that enthusiastic question as a big spoonful of marmite popped into your mouth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's rare that a developer explicitly introduces their game to you as "boring", and Indika seems anything but. Created by Odd Meter, the studio behind the well-received fantasy VR bow simulator Sacralith: The Archer's Tale, and published by Frostpunk developer 11 bit Studios, it's a "very serious adventure game" set in 19th century Russia, which casts you as a young Orthodox Christian nun on the run. Awash with doubts about her faith, and persecuted by a mysterious creature, the woman flees her nunnery and falls in with an escaped convict, who tells her of a mysterious "holy elder" who might ease her troubles, drawing on the power of a sacred artefact.
The game's setting is naturalistic, with motion-captured facial animations and photorealistic buildings and interiors, wrought using Unreal Engine. But it is also a "fairy tale" landscape, in the words of studio co-founder Dmitry Setlov, shot through with phantasmagorical flourishes - monochrome or blood-red filters and apparent hallucinations, to say nothing of the aforesaid creature, a skulking mass of tendrils that puts me in mind of the Shadow from Ursula K Le Guin's novel A Wizard Of Earthsea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing a ton of Super Mario Bros. Wonder over the last couple of weeks (in addition to the hands-on I had as a part of our current cover story), and the review embargo has officially lifted. However, due to restrictive embargo guidelines that don't allow us to discuss large portions of the game, we have opted to hold our final review until the game is available for purchase. With that said, I did want to share some brief thoughts within the confines of the embargo.
I've loved my time with Super Mario Bros. Wonder. The game is aptly named for a title that instills a strong sense of wonder around every corner. Each stage introduces new gimmicks with appropriate and well-designed on-ramps, then expands on them in fun and unique ways. I truly never knew what I was getting into each …]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-10-18T11:52:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than two years after its initial reveal trailer, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is almost here. Due out October 20 exclusively on PlayStation 5, developer Insomniac Games' sequel to 2018's Marvel's Spider-Man and 2020's Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a game we thoroughly enjoyed – read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review here – and we're excited for others to play it. Insomniac is too, but in a new statement, it tells players that while the game will be playable on physical discs in full, it recommends downloading the day one patch. 
More specifically, the download update is Version 1.001.002 and it will be available at launch this Friday. Digital owners don't need to worry about this as the patch will be installed as part of the pre-loaded version of Marvel's Spider-Man 2.

October 17, 2023
"The disc contains the entire game and is playable from start to finish with no patch or online requirement," Insomniac's statement reads. "But for the best experience, we highly encourage physical/disc-based players to download update Version 1.001.002 on launch day – prior to experiencing the opening mission of the game for the first time. Digital players – don't worry, if you pre-load the digital version of the game, you'll get 1.001.002 as your pre-loaded version." 
As for why, Insomniac says this update features polish to the gold master of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 available on disc. It improves the opening sections of the game and includes other general refinements to the Spidey experience. It also includes some additional accessibility options. 
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 hits PlayStation 5 on October 20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Amnesia games are set decades apart, but they all begin in the same moment, a moment of waking that is also a moment of erasure and disconnection, a rebirth outside the flow of events from which to descend into the machine of history afresh. On 19th August 1839, a young man opens his eyes to find himself in a vast, silent castle in the forests of Prussia. He discovers a letter from his "past self", Daniel, who urges him to murder the castle's secluded owner, a baron named Alexander, and warns that he is being hunted by a monstrous Shadow. 60 years later on New Year's Eve, the celebrated meat factory owner Oswald Mandus starts awake in the opulent stillness of his manor house in London. Hearing the distant voices of his children, he goes to look for them in the "splendid architectures" below.
On 21st July 1916, at the height of World War I, the soldier Henri Clément stumbles from his sickbed in a colossal bunker beneath the Western Front. With nobody about, and no memory of events during his convalescence, he follows a trail of blood through the collapsing tunnels towards the pantry. And on an unknown day in March 1939, the engineering drafter Tasi Trianon wakes in the wreckage of a plane, deep in the Algerian desert, and enters the nearby caves in search of her husband Salim. Four games, four forgotten pasts, four new beginnings, one descent.
Beware: major spoilers for the entire Amnesia series below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If XCOM and Invisible, Inc. had a secret one-night stand in the back of a Cyberpunk 2077 taxi, the resulting lovechild would probably look a lot like Cyber Knights: Flashpoint. It's the next game from the Trese Brothers, the makers of Star Traders: Frontiers, and I've been playing its opening missions over the last couple of days. It's good, folks, and there's a lot to dig into with its release into early access this week. 
There's a sizable story campaign and a bunch of side missions already playable here, and its emphasis on stealth and escalating security levels whisked me right back to the good old days of 2015 when I first sat down to play Klei's stealthy masterpiece. There are still a couple of rough edges here and there, but if you've been looking for a strategy RPG with a harder-edge than, say, Mimimi's recently released Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, or just something a bit sneakier than your run of XCOM-likes, Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is definitely worth keeping an augmented eye on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the glorious Xbox One years, when every Microsoft executive was engaged in the act of putting one foot in their mouth while shooting it simultaneously, there was a giddy period of marketing conducted by means of Phil Spencer's T-shirts. He'd rock up on E3 stages like a cabaret dancer, touting tees with various new or elderly videogame licenses on them, and whipping older fans into a frenzy of speculation as to possible remakes or sequels. I myself had to go lie down after seeing Phil in a Phantom Dust shirt. Teaser-shirts, we should have called them. Look at him in the picture up there, showing off a chestful of Hexen. Shameless!


Sadly/happily, those halcyon days are behind us, but Phil still loves to dangle the carrot of an ancient IP now and then. Speaking on the Xbox podcast last night (while sporting a boring Halo championship jacket), he suggested that Microsoft could do more to revive their older franchises. Or at least "revisit" them in some fashion.

Paradox will keep ownership of The Lamplighters League and other games developed by Harebrained, though the Crusader Kings publisher have no plans for a project or sequel in the same genre.

While the former largely succeeds in providing an enjoyable nostalgic experience, the latter fails to allow partners to have the same amount of fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the release of Intel's somewhat underwhelming 14th-gen processors today, I feel a lot of people are going to be looking once more at AMD Ryzen 7000 systems. These CPUs offer the same access to DDR5 RAM and PCIe 5.0 components as Intel's latest offerings, yet typically consume less power while delivering better gaming performance at the high end. That makes it easier to build a balanced system, especially with deals on Ryzen 7000 CPUs and motherboards starting to become more commonplace. 
Case in point is this AWD-IT bundle deal on a Ryzen 5 7600X and an MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk WiFi motherboard for £400, versus £445 for the two items separately. That's a pretty fair deal!

But the biggest surprise? How familiar it felt. So, it might be a bit odd that MW3 is wholly unsurprising for being more COD and simultaneously, a surprise for being more COD. Really, I think it comes down to developer Sledgehammer's decision to mash some of COD's previous triumphs with some of its finest maps.
Despite COD extending its hand with a warm welcome back, I can't help but feel it's one trembled with nerves. MW3's beta suckered me in with its nostalgia hits but there's definitely an air of it being a stopgap as devs figure out where it should turn next.

Hot on the heels of Mortal Kombat 1's launch, NetherRealm is already exploring new corners of the Mortal Kombat universe through a new mobile title, Mortal Kombat: Onslaught. This hero-collection, squad-based RPG lets you build teams of iconic fighters from the history of Mortal Kombat to take on various challenges. Ahead of its launch today, we had a chance to see the game in action to know what to expect from this new take on the long-running series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fleetingly Epic Games-owned online audio distribution company Bandcamp have shed "at least" half their staff in the course of being sold off to Songtradr as part of mass layoffs at Epic this summer. That's according to the union Bandcamp United, who are even now restarting discussions with Epic in the hope of obtaining a better outcome.
It's terrible news for those affected, of course, but it also doesn't bode well for the future of independent music. Bandcamp, which has now traded hands twice in two years, is one of the few places where indie musicians can make a living. There are plenty of angry reactions from musicians and bands on social media, as you'd expect, but game developers are also rallying in support of Bandcamp United, with criticism aimed at Epic and Songtradr in equal measure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["I am most moved and always have been by stupid courage — the kind when, against all odds, the hero just keeps going," William Goldman once said. This is a thing Goldman I have in common. To help you tell us apart, a point of difference between Goldman and I is that he expressed his love of stupid courage by writing Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, whereas I express mine by really liking Cyberpunk 2077.

Stupid courage is a trait that CD Projekt Red's first-person RPG seems to admire, but that's never more clear than in a new ending to the base game added by the Phantom Liberty expansion. It shows what happens when the heroes reject stupid courage and choose self-centred pragmatism instead. Spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty throughout.

More specifically, Season's Greetings hits Lake on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on November 15.

The gist, for those who missed out on the demo: you walk around small islands punching resources out of the landscape, building crafting stations and dwellings, and slowly amassing the means to access other islands. Or, you ignore all that, and treat the whole thing as an idle clicker, with no time limit and no real opportunity to fail.

This week, Sky and anti-piracy group FACT reported a similar operation using clear and unusually specific language. That's a welcome change; back in January, police forces all over the UK were instructed not to discuss visit numbers due to fears that the deterrent effect would be watered down.

Amongst other things, we can expect more robust search features, support for third-party subscriptions, better EGS launcher performance, a download manager with improved controls, and a new "for you" personalisation tab - all of that rolling out across 2024 and 2025.


Naturally, Epic will be continuing with their free games program through "2023 and beyond", and they've also put together a couple of special publishing offers for developers, Epic First Run and Now on Epic, which are designed to lure more studios from the amoeba-like embrace of Valve's gaming empire.

There was, of course, the Future Of Play booth that our Graham organised for the show (the contents of which you can see right here), but every year the Leftfield Collection houses a couple more custom controller games that are just as illustrative of all the amazing things going on in the world of interactive entertainment these days. 
Case in point, there were two games from this year's cohort that impressed me in equal measure over the weekend - and it was perhaps fitting that they were located directly opposite one another in the Leftfield Collection's long, white corridor. One was a mind-bogglingly complex, almost military-grade-looking briefcase stuffed full of switches, nozzles and buttons, and the other was an impossibly cute cardboard flip book and projector combo that let its cartoon hero Bib bound across the 3D paper environments to find a way home. Here's a little look at both of them in action.

Hermit And Pig is indeed a game about a reclusive old hermit and his truffle-hunting pig, but this charming adventure RPG also has one of the most involving turn-based battle systems I've come across in a while. 
Taking place in first person a la Dragon Quest, Hermit must deal with all sorts of mad and angry wildlife as he hunts for his favourite forest mushrooms, and their scowling (and endearingly daft) expressions are just the tip of this excellent iceberg. For you're not just choosing from a list of moves and watching them play out onscreen. Oh no. Each attack also comes with its own three-button fighting combo, and you'll need to input the right one (often at the right time) to deal the most damage. It's a brilliant system, making Hermit And Pig easily one of this year's highlights from EGX's Leftfield Collection.

Wonder declared the series’ return to the 2D side-scrolling genre with a colorful bang. The game signals the return to Mario’s roots from a core gameplay perspective, but it’s more connected to Mario’s past than most people initially realized. While many remember the creative level design, expressive art style, and discovery of the game-changing Wonder Flowers, the most memorable moment came at the end of the announcement trailer, as everyone’s favorite plumber grabbed a never-before-seen item and transformed into an elephant. That moment told everyone that Super Mario Bros. Wonder, despite taking the series back to its 2D origins, is trying bold, new things unlike anything the franchise has seen before.

As a speed-focused arcade racer, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged is a joy thanks to the emphasis on going fast, collecting Hot Wheels cars spanning decades, and crafting your own tracks. However, it doesn’t quite have the variety of tracks to keep it fresh throughout, and the story mode is an innocuous affair, leading to middle-of-the-pack results instead of the checkered flag it was chasing.
While it may not be as technical as most racing sims or as silly as the Mario Kart serie…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you played a videogame at all in 2022, I hope it was Roadwarden. A blend of RPG and visual novel from Polish developer Moral Anxiety, it cast you as lonesome wayfarer maintaining the paths and investigating the mysteries or grievances of a thinly populated wilderness setting. It's a game of immense feeling, craft and cleverness, inspired by table-top games, which puts hoarier ideas about videogame role-playing through the wringer. In the world of Roadwarden, there's no grinding for XP or mindless loot-crafting treadmill. Knowledge, empathy and insight are worth far more than material wealth or wielding the shiniest axe. Quests can hinge on something as minute as your ear for dialects or knowing the correct form of address. And each village along the trail is a world in itself.


Moral Anxiety's Windy Meadow - which actually dates back to before development of Roadwarden, but has been substantially remastered since the latter's release - essentially narrows the focus to one of those villages. Out today, it's a quietly gorgeous visual novel in which you follow several characters in different timeframes, building up a layered understanding of one and the same setting, with scene transitions plotted on a beautiful pixelart map screen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Newly released documents have given us a rare inside look at how gun manufacturers have tried to use videogames to promote their wares to younger people - specifically, players of Activision's original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, released in 2009. The memos and emails in question are from now-defunct US gun company Remington Arms, which was once part of the conglomerate Freedom Group. They've been disclosed by a lawyer as part of legal proceedings launched by the parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, in which 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people using a Remington-made AR15 rifle.

Made by the same team behind 2018's Project Hospital, Silence Of The Siren is an homage to Heroes Of Might And Magic where several different alien races are fighting to control a distant alien planet. It's a little bit 4X-y, but not massively so, and I had a very fun time indeed with its EGX demo over the weekend, which I think I played for almost a solid hour and completely forgot about the growing queue of folks behind me. Sorry about that…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Analogue Pocket is a retro handheld marvel, capable of playing your favorite Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games on its beautiful screen with modern sensibilities and technology – simply put, it's the best way to play a Game Boy game, assuming you can get your hands on the always-sold-out device. Now, Analogue is targeting the Nintendo 64 catalog with its next device, the Analogue 3D. 
Analogue has shared an image of what appears to be the device, although the full look at it is obscured. You can view it at the top of the article, but it's below as well:
An image released alongside today's news teases what appears to be a sleek, black, and faithful recreation of the Nintendo 64 controller. You can check it out below: 
Analogue says the 3D device will feature 4K HDMI output, its proprietary Analogue OS, wireless Bluetooth, and 2.4G Wi-Fi. It will also have "4 original-style controller ports," presumably so that players can use their original Nintendo 64 controllers with the 3D. The company says the 3D's 4K output allowed "us to created incomprehensibly profound Original Display Modes," and that in collaboration with 8BitDo, it will release a wireless controller for the device. 
Analogue didn't share more, but the 3D is set to release some time in 2024. Preorders are not yet open, but if it's like the Pocket release, preorders will happen well before the actual release (and if you want one, plan on preordering because the Pockets sold out immediately). 

While waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Analogue Pocket review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We talk about retro and throwback game releases being a "blast from the past", but in this case, it's more like you're strolling down a sunny path amid soothing birdsong, and then one particular, innocent-looking paving stone swivels underfoot with a rustle of gears, dropping you into a dingy, yellow-panelled room. There are vacuum tubes mounted on one wall, doors to either side, and a ladder leading further down into darkness.
You click one of the doors and the perspective switches over slide-projector style to a second room with identical proportions. There are pipes emerging from the floor, here, and some kind of antique radio on a pedastel in the centre. Hang on, I know this place. I know this formless sense of dread. I know these machinations. The last time I set foot here, it was 2009 and I was running a Flash game blog, writing up choice submissions to sites like Kongregate. This is Submachine, a 14-part escape puzzle series from Mateusz Skutnik, which Skutnik has now compiled, polished-up and re-released as Submachine: Legacy.

Being the sequel to two excellent games is not a guarantee of success. But it does set strong expectations. Thankfully, Spider-Man 2 meets and exceeds those expectations, providing uniformly stellar superhero action characterized by blazing-fast combat, smart mission design, and regular injections of thrilling set-pieces. Behind all that excitement, it also houses a fervent and heartfelt commentary on second chances, rehabilitation, and redemption. As a result, even in its dark moments, Spider-Man 2 delivers a wholesome and optimistic adventure rooted in j…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Minecraft update 1.21 has been revealed, and well, looks like Mojang have been reading my posts demanding the addition of a proper maze generator, those sneaky devils. As explained by Minecraft game director Agnes Larsson, the forthcoming Minecraft update – which has yet to be given a release date – is designed to “focus more on combat adventures and on tinkering” than last year's Cave & Cliffs update.
The headline addition is an underground structure called the Trial Chamber, a procedurally generated cluster of traps and treasure rooms, fashioned from copper and tuff blocks and arranged around a central hallway. From the Minecraft Live footage this weekend, Trial Chambers look like an evolution of the game's old buried fortresses, with some nifty new flourishes in the shape of copper bulb blocks that slowly give off less and less light, and new Trial Spawners, which generate a certain number of hostile mobs based on things like the number of players in your party.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The EGX demo for magic school adventure Leximan was perhaps only ten minutes long, but that's all it really needed to confirm that this wordy spell-caster is a riotous delight of a thing that should absolutely be on your radar. Built out of a game jam prototype from 2020, Leximan casts you (sorry) as a would-be wizard who's struggling to make an impact compared to his more verbally proficient schoolmates. In this particular demo, he's woken by a friend to go and assist the school cook with preparing breakfast, but things go horribly awry when a pesky fire elemental turns up to spoil it all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll admit I've been a bit sceptical of Loco Motive since it was first announced a little while ago. Any point and click adventure game that makes a bid trying to be funny like the good old days has a very real chance of being painfully unfunny in my experience (looking at you, Deponia), and I was worried that Loco Motive would fall into the same try-hard pile as other so-called comedy adventures that have come out recently (see also Turnip Boy - yeah, I went there, fight me). But having played a timed 20-minute demo of it at this year's EGX, I'll hold my hands up and say, yep, I'm the one who's been slapped in the face with a giant custard pie here, as Loco Motive is genuinely really quite good, folks, and I'm pleased to report the good old days are still very much alive and kicking. Well, except poor old Lady Unterwald, who carks it within seconds of the game starting, and whose murder you end up getting framed for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I see dirt, I know what I must do: clean. Whether it's in my own, real-life home or in a game, I am compelled to scrub, wipe and tidy - and the oily, purple globs of gunk clogging up Loddlenaut's appropriately named region of Flotsam Flats are just begging to be zapped by my little diver's handy laser gun. With just a single squeeze of the trigger, he sets to work, moving his arm automatically to neatly attack each neighbouring blob without any further prompting or manual aiming. All I need to focus on is getting him close enough to the gunge and he'll take care of the rest. Sure, it's perhaps not quite as involved as your PowerWash Sims and other polish em ups, but the combination of Loddlenaut's lo-fi visuals, comforting score and surprisingly soothing controller rumble all work to give it its own kind of zen-like charm - and it was enough to make me forget the surrounding din of the EGX Rezzed Zone for a very enjoyable 20 minutes or so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo revealed in August that longtime Mario voice actor Charles Martinet would no longer be voicing Mario. Amongst speculation of a different voice actor for Mario in Super Mario Bros. Wonder trailers, Nintendo also announced Martinet was not jumpman's voice in the game, leaving fans to wonder who the new voice is. After months of internet sleuthing, guesswork, and more, Nintendo has confirmed that Genshin Impact voice actor Kevin Afghani is the new voice of Mario. 
"The voice actor's name is Kevin Afghani," Nintendo tells Game Informer in a statement.
Afghani celebrated the news with a tweet today about how excited he is to voice both Mario and Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. 
Incredibly proud to have voiced Mario and Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Thanks to Nintendo for inviting me into the Flower Kingdom!
October 13, 2023
Afghani's credits include Arnold in the aforementioned Genshin Impact, Raditz in Dragon Ball R&R, and Short Detective, General, and Grunt in the Secret History of Cuphead short.
Super Mario Bros. Wonder hits Switch exclusively on October 20. Ahead of its release, Mario graced the cover of the latest issue of Game Informer, and we've been diving deep into the making of the game and more in our exclusive Super Mario Bros. Wonder coverage hub. Here are some of the stories you can find in it:

Both offer co-op and competitive multiplayer options. Both deliver modernized visuals. And both give players new gameplay concepts and abilities that expand the original franchise vision in unprecedented ways. However, perhaps the most shocking thing these two games have in common is when they release.
In the 1990s, Sonic the Hedgehog was the sole series able to briefly challenge Mario's claim to the platforming throne, and next week may prove the series' fates are forever intertwined.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Association of American Publishers has shared its overview of notorious piracy markets with the U.S. Trade Representative. The organization sees shadow libraries, including LibGen and Sci-Hub, as key problems, with the relatively new meta-search engine Anna's Archive also getting a mention. Third-party intermediaries pose problems too, the publishers note, with abuse of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) as a growing concern.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Mortal Kombat 1 out in the wild we're revisiting the entry that set the series on its current trajectory: 2011's Mortal Kombat (aka MK 9). Join us as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign.  
After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up.

This means that Activision Blizzard, which is the company behind franchises like Call of Duty and Diablo, is now part of Xbox's first-party umbrella. As a result, Xbox's stable of IPs and game franchises has become much larger, welcoming the likes of Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and more. 
While many know Activision Blizzard as the company behind industry juggernauts like Call of Duty and Overwatch, the company is home to plenty more games. In light of today's news, we've decided to create an easy place to see every Activision Blizzard game franchise that Xbox now owns.

Earlier today, Microsoft officially acquired Activision Blizzard for nearly $69 billion. Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick revealed he will remain as CEO through the end of the year after Xbox head Phil Spencer asked him to stay to help with the company transition. While staying through the end of the year presumes Kotick will depart from the company in 2024, that remained technically unknown.
However, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier says that Kotick will depart from Activision Blizzard, a company he took over 33 years ago, on January 1, 2024.

One of Superstars’ biggest selling points is to take down Eggman with up to three other players. Unfortunately, co-op is restricted to local play. Living alone and working remotely makes couch co-op a tricky proposition, and the only way for me to test this is by using the PS5’s Share Play feature with another editor, but that feature won’t work until the game launches next Tuesday. Until I can get a sense of what it’s like to take down badniks with another person, my general thoughts on Sonic Superstars is that if you’re looking for a Genesis-era throwback, Sonic Team and Arzest have nailed it …]]></summary>

Earlier this morning, the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority approved Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The CMA was the last hurdle for Microsoft's acquisition after it received approval in more than 40 countries and regions, including the U.S. earlier this summer. The deadline for Microsoft to close this deal was October 18, but reports indicated the company was planning to finalize it today, October 13. That has now happened, and Activision Blizzard is officially part of Xbox's first-party studio umbrella.
Xbox released the video below to celebrate its acquisition:

The CMA granted Microsoft a preliminary approval last month and now, a few weeks later, the U.K. regulatory agency has finally given Microsoft the full approval it needs.

But it's not alone; the Legend of Zelda series, which started around that time, also remains a genre leader all these decades later. During our discussions with Nintendo during our Super Mario Bros. Wonder cover story (and other interviews earlier this year), we tried to drill into why these franchises – in particular, the Mario franchise – have maintained their popularity and level of quality while so many other series have struggled to hold onto it for even a fraction of the time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!
Dark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.
This time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. 
Our reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
