        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that season 4 of Video Gameography is complete, and the Uncharted series has been, well...charted, it's off to new frontiers and fresh faces. After saying farewell to co-host Ben Reeves in the last episode, we welcome GI Associate Editor John Carson to the podcast as the new co-host alongside the ever-present Marcus Stewart. Along with a series of guests, season 5 of Video Gameography will be an exploration and examination of 2K's Bioshock franchise.
So, we cordially ask, would you kindly follow us into the depths of the sea? We're headed to the city of Rapture, made by and for movers and shakers, unbound by the expectations and judgments of the surface world.
Developed by Irrational Games (AKA 2K Boston) and released in 2007, Bioshock reimagined and redefined what a modern shooter could be. In this episode, we explore the origins of the series stemming from the commercial failures of the well-loved PC franchise System Shock and the turbulent development cycle in which Bioshock triumphantly succeeded in spite of. We discuss director Ken Levine's inspirations of Rapture and its inhabitants like the industrial mastermind Andrew Ryan, the Big Daddies, Little Sisters, and much more.
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), and Game Informer Associate Editor Wesley LeBlanc (@LeBlancWes) as we unpack the history and narrative of the first Bioshock! 
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel. From there, find the Video Gameography channel under "Community Spaces."]]></summary>

Happy Kirby Week! It's another busy one here at Nintendo Life, with the launch of not only Kirby and the Forgotten Land, but also Rune Factory 5. We loved Kirby, giving it a solid 9/10 in our review, but were a tad more critical of Run Factory, slapping a score of 7/10 on our review.
On the news side of things, we're about to see the release of not one, but seven new Wii U and 3DS games, which is just bonkers. Activision/Blizzard are once again in a spot of bother, we learned that The House of the Dead: Remake is getting a 'Cowboy Mode', and NOA employee Samantha Robertson has left the company after 11 years. Phew!

Last month, Microsoft president Brad Smith mentioned how the tech giant wanted to bring the Call of Duty series to the Nintendo Switch not long after it announced its plans to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion.
With this in mind, there's now a rumour that Activision "supposedly" has plans to bring Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered to Nintendo's hybrid system. This would reportedly be the same remaster launched on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2016 (which was based on the original 2007 release Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare).

Kirby’s inaugural 3D adventure is finally here with Nintendo and Hal Laboratory’s Switch exclusive Kirby and the Forgotten Land. It’s a wonderful trek (read our review) through an abandoned land that looks awfully like our own, where the cute, yet dastardly Beast Pack have taken over the various cities, factories, malls, and theme parks. Here are some tantalizing suggestions to keep in mind while you venture into the worlds set in the Forgotten Land.

How old should your children be when introducing them to video games? What are the best titles to teach them how to use a controller? Are there games that both a youngster and adult will find equally enjoyable?
As a father of a nine-year-old daughter, I get asked these questions frequently by people with children of their own, and I always stumble with my response as I try to recall the route I took to acclimate her to games. Most kids want to play games at an early age, yet there aren’t many resources out there that help parents and guardians find a safe and re…]]></summary>

Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga may let you relieve all nine films from the eyes of its greatest heroes, but where would they be without their foils? A new trailer runs down all of the baddies sworn to the Dark Side or otherwise that you'll be crossing plastic lightsabers with or play yourself.
The trailer gives us shots at humorous takes on Kylo Ren (with TT Games leaning into the shirtless Kylo memes), an organ-playing Palpatine, General Grievous, Boba Fett, and, of course, Darth Vader. The video also gives us an unexpectedly fun twist on Order 66.

Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is fast approaching, which is good news given how long it's been in the development pipeline. Billed as the ultimate Lego Star Wars experience, the ambitious title lets players relive the nine mainline films, which you can play in any order, completely rebuilt in a new engine from the ground-up (as well as the first Lego iterations on The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker). That means even fans who played previous Lego Star Wars titles won't be getting the same games they finished years ago. Although the development wasn't without significant bumps in the road, we look forward to seeing how it all comes together when Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga launches on April 5.
For more on the game, you can read TT Games explain how The Skywalker Saga feels like one cohesive galaxy and how it will receive post-launch DLC based on The Mandalorian.]]></summary>

Earlier this week Nintendo confirmed that Dragalia Lost will be shut down after some final story updates, to which the response of many may have been a shrug of the shoulders. The mobile exclusive was an interesting title, though, as it was the only new IP that Nintendo had invested solely into its mobile business, developed alongside CyGames. Though plenty of core gamers have an innate snobbery or antipathy towards mobile games, Dragalia was well-regarded by its fanbase.

After flinging herself up a sheer cliff face with the help of some high-flying parkour magic, Forspoken’s protagonist, Frey, approaches a rotunda made of stone and metal. Blazing in the center of the structure is a pool erupting with a glowing, flame-like aura. This is our first introduction to a Seat of Reflection, a kind of mini-dungeon players will be able to fight through while traveling in Athia. Overcoming its challenges will be tough, and monsters lurk within which players won’t find outside the complex. But with the potential to enhance your fighting skills, the rewards promise to be great.

Rocket League’s blend of soccer and car combat proved to be a massively successful example of an idea “just silly enough to work.” Turbo Golf Racing borrows from a similar playbook by combining over-the-top arcade-style racing with, you guessed it, golf. 
The upcoming title pits players in a chaotic race to guide their respective giant balls into a big hole. You can jump, dash, glide, and flip your vehicles to knock balls through boost rings and past obstacles like sand traps and trees to get it in the hole before your opponents. Courses sport speed boost ramps, and barreling off hills deploys glider wings on the cars. Up to eight competitors can compete online, and you can get a taste of how races play out in the trailer below.

Equipping super cores to cars grants perks such as the ability to smack the ball greater distances or powers like a ground stomp. You can also gussy up your vehicle thanks to a range of unlockable cosmetics such as paint jobs, body types, spoilers, and tires. Free updates will add additional courses, power cords, and customization pieces.  
Turbo Golf Racing is getting a beta in the near future (which you can sign up for here) and will launch in Steam Early Access before going 1.0 later this year. When it does, the game is slated to hit Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S and will be available on Game Pass.]]></summary>

Kingdom Hearts is kind of in the bad books with Nintendo fans at the moment. After years of requesting the franchise make its debut on the Nintendo Switch, we got what we asked for... albeit via an awful Cloud Version. We said the port was "incredibly disappointing" in our review of the Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece, awarding it a 5/10.
Still, despite this, it's quite fun seeing the series get a nod from Disney itself, with the latest Disney+ Mickey Mouse special - 'The Wonderful Spring of Mickey Mouse' - featuring none other than Kingdom Key D, the key blade that Mickey Mouse wields for the majority of the series.

Today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central, we’ll be diving headfirst into Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands! Editors Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and Brian Shea will be blasting through the newly-launched Borderlands spin-off in co-op and showing off the game's first two hours. 
Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands retains the looter shooter template of Borderlands but injects it with a heavy dose of Dungeons & Dragons-inspired fantasy. Fan-favorite character Tiny Tina serves as a dungeon master of sorts, dictating the adventure your band of gun-toting heroes embark on. The star-studded cast boasts the voice talents of Andy Samberg, Wanda Sykes, and Will Arnett with Ashly Burch reprising her role as Tina.

After spending far, far too long trying to obsessively control every detail of Distant Worlds 2, I've accepted that I need to take my own advice and work with its macromanagement systems instead. They are, after all, the reason its ludicrous scale is workable at all beyond the opening hours, and a major reason its predecessor was so interesting and forward-thinking to begin with. But they are also a source of great friction and confusion, especially if you don't take the time to learn how they actually work.
Distant Worlds 2 is, ultimately, a game that you need to meet in the middle. Consequently, it's one that I can only partially recommend. But I really do recommend it for that part.

Tango Gameworks is currently celebrating the release of GhostWire: Tokyo, which is out on PlayStation 5 and PC today, but the studio is already preparing for future titles. Namely, ones that will showcase the studio’s strengths in genres other than horror. 
In a new interview with Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, former Resident Evil director and now Tango founder, Shinji Mikami, said he wants to change the image of Tango, as translated by Video Games Chronicle. He said that right now, he recognizes that Tango is seen as a studio that “specializes only in survival horror,” but that…]]></summary>

Crimesight only allows up to four players, but you’ll be exploring a snowed-in cottage as you try to either work out who the murderer is, or help them win. You can take a look at the trailer below.

I'm always up for a good Zelda-like, and everything I saw of Tunic back then seemed to confirm that this was 100% a game I would like and enjoy. 
You can probably imagine my excitement, then, when Microsoft announced there would finally be a playable demo to people download during last year's E3. However, as I briefly mentioned in my post about Tunic's brilliant in-game instruction manual yesterday, I actually came away from that demo a bit disheartened. With just a single (and quite unforgiving) dungeon to explore, I was left thinking it hewed a bit too close to the Soulsian school of combat difficulty than I'd like. Upon playing the final game, however... Delight! Magic! Joy! I actually can't get enough of it. To think I almost dismissed what's now one of my early game of the year contenders on the basis of that one 20 minute demo now seems incredibly hasty on my part, but with so many games now being shoved down our throats on a daily basis, those first impressions can somtimes be devastatingly powerful.

Buggos is about driving your endless swarm of alien insects to spread across a newfound planet and wipe out the gross humans standing in the way.
There's very little stress and no need for detailed schemes, reflexes, or micromanaged tactics. As long as there is food, more buggos will come, and as long as there are buggos, they will loosely move in the direction you command, dying in droves but succeeding in aggregate. It's a good time that asks for little but a point to attack and a desire to consume everything in your path. I'm actually surprised at how much I want to keep playing it.

Deliver Us Mars is the newly announced sequel to 2019’s sci-fi adventure game, Deliver Us The Moon. Per the title, this time you're flung to the Red Planet on a mission to save the human race from extinction.
Set 10 years after the events of Deliver Us The Moon, humanity is on its last legs. A distress signal from Mars draws the astronaut protagonist and the Zephyr crew to investigate, where they find human colony ships in the hands of a mysterious faction called the Outward. They'll need to recover these ships while also finding answers to what's going down on the planet.

Gameplay details are scarce, but surviving Mars’ unforgiving landscape requires a blend of puzzle-solving and combat, much like the first game. The atmosphere and a powerful sense of isolation and intrigue defined Deliver Us The Moon, and Deliver Us Mars looks to have no shortage of either element. 
Deliver Us The Moon was something of a hidden gem, and we look forward to seeing how Deliver Us Mars builds upon that strong foundation. The game is “coming soon” according to developer Keoken Interactive, but we do know it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

However, a new Lego game has been announced for 2022 and it’s called Lego Bricktales. Set in an original world, Lego Bricktales is a game more focused on the creativity of playing with Legos and ultimately, building beautiful dioramas. Announced in a trailer, it’s being developed by Clockstone, the team behind Bridge Constructor, and published by Thunderful Publishing.

In terms of content the Switch doesn't have the 'Aftermath' version found on other systems, but it has now caught up with some older free DLC and added some welcome features.

The recent trend of resurrecting long-ceased shoot-em-up IPs from the dead, usually when the original developer has shuffled off its electronic coil, is a welcome one. M2 revived Aleste, Platinum Games reanimated the Crestas, and now small indie outfit Picorinne Soft — comprised of brothers Ryo and Satto — has ventured a sequel to Visco’s Andro Dunos, a largely forgotten, Hellfire-inspired Neo Geo shoot-em-up from 1992.
Despite stellar work, Picorinne Soft’s Steam, Dreamcast, and recent ex-A Arcadia releases remain relatively underground. While Andro Dunos II carries over its forebear’s ship and Hellfire-style weapon system, everything else is so vastly improved and expanded upon, that it bears only scant resemblance to the original game. It’s so different, in fact, that Visco’s IP seems like little more than a Trojan horse to gain them wider recognition. This, as it turns out, is an all-round win.

Gran Turismo 7 has been heavily criticized by its player base as of late due to the game’s live-service economy. The latest simulation racer from Polyphony Digital reviewed quite well – Game Informer gave it an 8.75 out of 10 – but since its launch, the game’s credit system has been heavily scrutinized, with players citing that it’s built around encouraging microtransactions.
Things got worse for Gran Turismo 7 after scheduled maintenance expected to last two hours last week lasted for more than 24 hours, leaving the game largely unplayable due to its always-online nature. On top of that, the up…]]></summary>

Probably not, I'd wager. Thankfully the Box Office Game, a new browser-based Wordle-like, lets you trade points for further clues: the first billed actor, the director, the tagline, and so on. 

In doing so, it becomes a more broadly accessible movie guessing game than Framed, and I'm enjoying it a lot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Master Chief makes his official television debut today, but you won't find Microsoft's iconic green Spartan soldier on traditional TV stations. Despite being produced by Showtime, the live-action adaptation of Halo can only be found on the Paramount+ streaming service.
If you're new to Paramount+ and haven't had a subscription on file, you can sign up for a free seven-day trial and squeeze in the first episode, and maybe the second if you're quick enough when it releases next Thursday. Otherwise, a full-blown membership will run as low as $4.99 a month for an ad-supported plan or $49.99 for an entire year which saves $10 if you're okay with paying for the subscription upfront. You can sign up for the trial or subscription on the Paramount+ website. The app can be downloaded on a variety of smart devices, including the most brand synergistic way to watch Halo, on your Xbox. If you're a Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, you can snag a 30-day trial for Paramount+ thanks to membership perks available right now.
If this week's premiere episode is any indication, new episodes of Halo will go live on Paramount+ every Thursday at 2 a.m. Central. The series is scheduled to run for nine episodes; however, a second season has already been greenlit and will likely enter production sometime in the future.
Halo stars Pablo Schreiber as John–117, AKA Master Chief, Jen Taylor as Cortana, and Natascha McElhone as Dr. Catherine Halsey.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has announced its acquisition of a third video game studio in mobile developer Boss Fight Entertainment, according to The New York Times. 
Boss Fight Entertainment is based in Allen, Texas, but boasts 130 employees across studios in Austin and Seattle. One of its biggest titles is the strategy RPG Dungeon Boss, and the talent there consists of veterans that worked on games such as Halo Wars, Age of Empires, and Star Wars: The Old Republic. Netflix has not revealed how much it paid for the studio.
Since last September, Netflix has been gradually scooping up game developers to bolster its presence in the video game market. Earlier this month, it purchased Finnish mobile developer Next Games for $72 million. Netflix’s acquisition of Oxenfree developer Night School stands as its most noteworthy purchase so far. The team behind Afterparty is currently developing Oxenfree II: Lost Signals. You can read more about what the future holds for Night School in our interview with the studio’s director. 
In addition to spreading its IP into the game industry, Netflix has a plethora of video game adaptations in the pipeline. The company recently announced plans to create a Bioshock movie and a new Resident Evil series. It also renewed The Cuphead Show for a second season.

Deliver Us Mars takes place ten years after the events of the original, but should offer similar third-person sci-fi storytelling - only now with seemingly higher production values, and a red planet to explore.

April is shaping up to be all about brick building in a galaxy far, far away. At the start of the month, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is releasing on almost every video game platform, and shortly after that, Lego is releasing three awesome new dioramas inspired by scenes from the original trilogy.
For decades, Star Wars fans have been buying Lego vehicles and location sets that sometimes allow for specific moments to be set up. This new series is all about those moments, recreating the trash compactor scene, Luke Skywalker's training on Dagobah, and the Death Star trench run. These sets focus on the little visual details to make those moments pop, and are less about play, yet still allows for a degree of interaction, such as the trash compactor closing in on the heroes.
All three sets release on April 26. The Dagobah Jedi Training Diorama retails for $79.99 and comes with exactly 1,000 pieces. The Death Star Run Diorama is $59.99 and consists of 665 pieces. The Death Star Trash Compactor Diorama is $89.99 and delivers 802 pieces. Dianoga’s head is included in this set along with six minifigures. 
You can see all three sets in the gallery below. What moment should Lego recreate next?

The Borderlands series has left a permanent mark on the industry by popularizing the blend of loot mechanics in the tried and true first-person shooter. Throughout five mainline shooters and one adventure game, its offerings of cooperative mayhem and absurd humor catapulted Borderlands among the most beloved shooter franchises in gaming – it even has a feature film adaptation in the works. With Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands' impending release (here's our review), now is a great time to reflect on the series and rank each game from our least favorite entry to our most beloved.

This news comes by way of Bloomberg, which reports that the company behind franchises like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft had a lawsuit filed against it Wednesday by a current employee who alleges rampant sexism amongst other things. The suit was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court by attorney Lisa Bloom, who held a public press conference in December regarding the company’s sexual harassment, on behalf of a current employee, referred to as “Jane Doe” in court documents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Small Impact Games, along with publisher Team17, has announced a new first-person shooter called Marauders, which is designed with mixed PvP and PvE in mind.
Click here to watch embedded media
Set in an alternate 1990s where The Great War never ended, humanity has fled to space, where many people are forced to scavenge space stations and the like to survive. The setting is retro-futuristic, offering a dieselpunk aesthetic instead of a high-tech and clean space fantasy like Star Trek. Players will raid cosmic vessels solo or with up to three other allies for loot, such as new guns and gear, and hopefully, make it out alive in the end. If successful, you'll likely have all kinds of new weapons and tools to bring into upcoming matches and experience gains to boot. Or you can hock most of it for some extra spending cash.
Other players raiding the same place can spoil the run by taking your team out during firefights that are likely to break out. Alternatively, they could also hop in your ship and commandeer it as their own. Starships can be individually customized and upgraded, allowing players to escape safe and sound after gathering precious space plunder while also adding dogfighting opportunities to the match. Losing your means of escape, let alone one you've spent time beefing up between missions will be something you'll want to avoid.

The full release date is currently unknown, but a closed beta period for those who preorder is said to be happening sometime soon and will be entering early access this year. Small Impact Games' intergalactic looter shooter Marauders will be coming to PC via Steam and will also be available as part of Xbox Game Preview through PC Game Pass.]]></summary>

No update on Henry Cavill this week, but we talk a bit about Matthew's cursed trip to DisneyLand Paris, ways that Ghostbusters could take on a very different tone, and, once again, inject some serial killer energy into the podcast. Nate delivers a fun Cavern Of Lies where we have to guess which of the plots of terrible ghost games are made up. And for some reason I've written 'The Count of Monster Disco' in my notes. The reason escapes me. But it was probably funny.

It’s no secret that Battlefield 2042 had a rough launch period. Touted as a powerful new-gen title with stunning graphics, exhilarating gameplay, and massive arenas unlike anything that’s come before in the series, 2042 simply failed to hit those marks from a polish perspective. Fan outrage was palpable as refund petition signatures climbed to heights just shy of the hundred-thousands. Hell, at one point, more steam users were playing Farming Simulator 22 over Battlefield 2042. Even so, the next game in the franchise has entered pre-production, and developer DICE feels “valuabl…]]></summary>

Oh, but, teleporting me to the right map coordinates is fine, huh FromSoftware?!
There's already several creative ways to bother people online while playing Elden Ring, but as Ed points out, cosplaying Thanos was one of the more destructive ways. There was an exploit that hackers could use where they could teleport you to a void, trap you in an infinite death loop, and completely torpedo your save.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As several members of the RPS Treehouse can attest, I have not been able to stop playing Tunic this week. I was a little cautious going in, having not particularly gelled with the E3 demo from last year, but in hindsight, that early glimpse was nothing but the tip of a tiny fox nose peeking out of its burrow. In its full, regal splendour, Tunic has become an early game of the contender for me, and a large part of that is down to its wonderfully clever in-game instruction manual.
When Imogen (RPS in peace) interviewed Tunic dev Andrew Shouldice last September, they talked about how instruction manuals were a fundamental part of a game's design back in the days of the NES, and at one point he even pulled out his old instruction booklet for Zelda II: The Adventure Of Link to demonstrate some of the "tantalising hints" they'd offer to curious players. As Brendan (also RPS in peace) noted in our Tunic review, the in-game manual is indeed a critical part of what makes Tunic special, and the act of piecing it together page by page really does capture that feeling of discovering some great secret that only you and the dev team know about. But here's a secret between you and me: it's not by chance Shouldice pulled out that old Zelda II manual during our interview last year. His fox hero may be cut from the same cloth as Nintendo's green sword-swinger, but the art inside Tunic's instruction manual also pays a wonderful tribute to those Zelda booklets of yore, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve spent over 40 hours with Elden Ring and I’m still not very good at it. At this stage I’m less of a worthy Tarnished warrior on their way to be crowned the Elden Lord and instead more of a Mr. Bean type, accidentally succeeding through sheer incompetence alone. I can’t explain it, but my method of defeating Godrick had the same energy as Bean making a sandwich, in that I think the game eventually just took pity on me and let me win the fight to save me any further embarrasment.


I’m coming to terms with the fact I may never finish Elden Ring. I'm only in the second proper area, but I'm finding encounters to require a level of patience I simply don't possess. Its boss fights are simply too hard. But if I’m struggling this much at such an early stage, what else could Elden Ring possibly have to offer? What types of monstrosities lurk in the farthest reaches of the Lands Between, and how difficult are they to defeat? Spoilers, naturally, below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think "platformer" and my next thought is "slick". Hollow Knight springs to mind, as does Ori, as does Celeste. They all have precise and snappy movement, with upgrades and new abilities that add complexity without stodge. As for 3D platformers, Super Mario 64 remains a glowing example of how movement makes exploration joyful. String together rolls and jumps and you're not just navigating a world, but bounding through it like a gymnast (who's also a part time plumber to help pay the costs of serious competition).
Elden Ring is a terrible platformer. It's stiff and awkward and less gymnast, more Gimli on the Buckfast. But this is what makes its platforming sections good. They force you to embrace your limited toolset and channel your amateur longjumping, golfing, and climbing skills you definitely don't have.

March 23, 2022
As reported by Eurogamer, images and a short video clip were uploaded to Twitter showing Sam, Henry, Ellie, and Joel in garb similar to their in-game counterparts (see images above). The actors playing the brothers remain unknown, but The Mandalorian's Pedro Pascal is portraying Joel, and Game of Throne's Bella Ramsey stars as Ellie. Ramsey is even wearing the young heroine's iconic hoodie and winter jacket.
The clip, seen below, shows the four jogging across a street in some downtown metropolis. They crouch/take cover near a car (except for Joel, of course, he's too badass to hide). Then the crew disappears into a building. Where they're going is a mystery, but if the television show is following the series of events that take place in Naughty Dog's acclaimed title, the journey will be harrowing to say the least.

HBO’s The Last of Us is slated to drop in 2023 and is brimming with talent including the previously mentioned Pascal and Ramsey. Anna Torv (Mindhunter), Nico Parker (Dumbo), Merle Dandridge (The Last Of Us video games), and Gabriel Luna (Terminator: Dark Fate) are also cast members. Craig Mazin (Chernobyl) and Neil Druckmann (lead writer and creative director on the game) are helming the show.

FSR 2.0 will represent a switch from simple spatial upscaling to more closely match the advanced temporal upscaling techniques of its rival, Nvidia DLSS – and while it won’t use DLSS-style machine learning, AMD say the trick to FSR 2.0’s improved performance is down to some good-old-fashioned human brainpower.

Telltale Games returned in 2019 with the reveal that it was developing The Wolf Among Us 2, and since then, we’ve received a few trailers and a 2023 launch window for the narrative adventure game. 
If you played the first Wolf Among Us, then a lot of what you’re seeing in the sequel’s trailers and marketing is probably familiar. There are returning faces like Bigby Wolf and Snow White, and some new ones, too. However, if you haven’t played the game, it sounds like you’ll still be able to enjoy its sequel because in a new interview with Edge magazine, Telltale CEO Jamie Ottilie said the first episode will get players up to speed on the characters, as reported by IGN. 
“We strive to design our narratives so they can stand on their own,” Ottilie told Edge, citing that despite that, he hopes players jump into the first game to experience it before the second. 
However, if players don’t, they’ll still be prepared for the sequel by the end of its first episode because Ottilie thinks “the opening of the first episode sets things up in such a way that the player understands how the characters got where they are now.” 
We’ll all be caught up after playing episode one sometime in 2023. For now, read Game Informer’s extensive breakdown of the resurrection and reinvention of Telltale Games, which covers the studio’s shutdown, its subsequent reopening, its new development on The Wolf Among Us 2 and its The Expanse game, and more.

For £30.58, you can get almost a hundred games, and some books and software too. It's great value, but there's only one day left to buy it, so you should probably get a move on.

  As of today, the bundle's raised over £12 million pounds to help victims and refugees from the war in Ukraine, which is an amazing achievement. All of the proceeds are being split between four organisations providing relief efforts: Razom for Ukraine, International Rescue Committee, International Medical Corps, and Direct Relief.

Even if that stroll is sometimes interrupted by rowdy gangs of yokai. 


In Matthew’s earlier preview, he noted a similarly evocative atmosphere to that of the YouTube channel Virtual Japan, which has featured one particularly calming walking tour through a rain-soaked Tokyo. Ghostwire has walking, and rain, and Tokyo, so when review code came in we thought we’d have a crack at making our own. And here it is, in 4K with maxed-out ray tracing:

If you’re a fan of 2019’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and plan to visit Galaxy Edge at one of the Disney parks in the near future, there’s good news. As spotted by Venture Beat, Cal Kestis’ lightsaber hilt will soon be available to purchase, thanks to it winning a 2020 fan poll for requested legacy lightsabers. 
Beginning March 25, you can buy Cal’s legacy lightsaber hilt at Dok-Ondar’s Den of Antiquities. It sports the signature damaged base but comes with a dual lightsaber adapter. That means you can make it a double-bladed sword should you buy a second hilt. You can display the replica as is, or add a blade to it at Savi’s Workshop – Handbuilt Lightsabers store. Actor Cameron Monaghan, who portrayed Cal in the game, visited Disneyland to get an early peek at his signature weapon and make it a full lightsaber. You can view the photos from his visit, such as the one above, at the Disney Parks Blog. 
There’s no word how much Cal’s weapon will cost, but replica lightsabers can run for over $100, and adding a blade to them is similarly pricey. You can only buy the lightsaber at Galaxy’s Edge in Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, FL or Disneyland Park in Anaheim, CA.
You can watch us relieve Cal Ketis’ entire journey in our ongoing Super Replay of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, which may hold you over as we eagerly await the confirmed sequel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is Microsoft’s monthly subscription that gives players access to not just Xbox Game Pass on consoles but also PC Game Pass and Xbox Live Gold. Now, alongside its other features, it includes three months of Marvel Unlimited. 
Marvel Unlimited is Marvel’s comic book subscription service that, like what Game Pass is for games, gives users access to tons of comic books on devices like phones, tablets, and more. In fact, in the trailer announcing this news, Marvel boasts that there are more than 29,000 digital comics on the service.

However, one important thing to note is that you must be a new Marvel Unlimited subscriber to take advantage of this deal. If you already have a subscription or have had one in the past, you will not be able to take advantage of these three free months on that account. However, you could always create a new Marvel Unlimited account. Over on the Xbox side of things, fortunately, this deal applies to both existing and new Ultimate subscribers. 
News of Marvel Unlimited joining Xbox Game Pass Ultimate in this capacity isn’t surprising. Not only has Microsoft been bolstering the offerings of Ultimate consistently to boost its subscription count, but it already has partnerships with Marvel’s parent company, Disney, in the form of free Disney Plus service. It also includes bonuses like EA Play, discounts, and free perks, like a monthly Halo Infinite cosmetic pack.]]></summary>

Time on Frog Island is a delightfully silly-looking sandbox game that puts you in the shipwrecked boots of a sailor stranded on an island. He needs to repair his vessel to escape and can only turn to the island’s frog citizens for help. Unfortunately, the sailor can’t speak his language and can only get the materials he needs by trading for them.
The core of the game involves navigating a web of trades as you sprint across the island, figuring out different methods of gathering everything everyone needs while solving puzzles. Holding different items grants unique abilities, encouraging discovery and experimentation. Your captain protagonist also sports a froggy tongue for some reason, which you can use to snap distant items. When you’re not reassembling your boat, you can relax with some fishing or farming.  You can watch the new trailer unveiled during GDC below.

Jim, Dave, and Sally all have their map markers in Vice City for a portion of the game, then they'll shift over to Tilted Towers after a few hours. Perhaps the bridge to Shrek's Swamp won't open unless you rescue the princess from Bowser's Castle later down the line.
And there's nothing wrong with an open world that gently steers you in the right direction. Elden Ring does this with its checkpoints that blow the equivalent of directional arrows in the breeze, helping you feel in control of your progress. But I'd argue it's even better at the opposite: wresting that control away in a split-second.

Souldiers is a promising-looking retro-inspired action game that draws inspiration from Metroid and a sprinkle of Dark Souls. We now know it’s arriving this May and that it’s hitting PlayStation and Xbox platforms in addition to Switch and PC.
Launching May 19, Souldiers tosses Soulslike combat, RPG classes and progression, and side-scrolling Metroid-style exploration into a blender to form what looks to be a fun and challenging adventure. Characters take the roles of archer, caster, or scout and can be customized further thanks to various skill trees. Toppling enemies and bosses requires a mastery of when to attack, dodge, and parry. Outside of battle, you’ll solve environmental puzzles to unlock new areas of the vibrant, interconnected world.

Doomfist, a damage hero in Overwatch, will be swapping roles in Overwatch 2, whenever that finally releases. 
This news comes by way of Overwatch 2 game director Aaron Keller, who announced that Doomfist would instead become a tank hero during a recent stream, as reported by PC Gamer. Keller even touched on some details regarding this change, including some switches to Doomfist’s moveset to make him a Tank. 
“He basically has a leap that’s similar to a Winston leap,” Keller said. 
Winston’s leap is more about horizontal movement whereas Doomfist’s leap, as it stands today in Overwatch, is about vertical height and resulting slamdown damage. It sounds like his leap will be more similar to Winston’s in Overwatch 2, which makes sense because it would give Doomfist the ability to reach a combat scenario quicker and tank some damage. 
PC Gamer reports that Keller further described the tank version of Doomfist as “more surviveable” with “good escape” capatilibies. During the stream, Overwatch lead hero designer Geoff Goodman said Doomfist “does a lot less damage” as a tank than when he was a hero, but he also said that today, in Overwatch 2’s closed alpha, Doomfist is overpowered and in need of a nerf. 
This is a big change for Doomfist, which accompanies larger changes happening in Overwatch 2, like a shift to 5v5 gameplay. Bastion will also be wildly different in Overwatch 2, as well. For more about Overwatch 2, read about how Blizzard is “decoupling” Overwatch 2’s PvP and PvE experiences.

The lumbering forms of Elden Ring’s trolls disguise an ancient melancholy. Turned traitors in the war between demigods and giants, their reward for loyalty to the Golden Lineage was an eternity in shackles, used as frontline fodder in bloody conflicts or beasts of burden hauling funereal carriages around the Lands Between. Since learning their history, I often muse sadly upon it, as I weave between their horribly gnarled legs in my freshly tarnished underwear and hoover up the shiny objects scattered underneath their feet. 


I’m on my second run of Elden Ring now, progressing slowly and methodically, examining every statue and reading every spell description. But the first time through, the need to cram the whole content buffet in my face at once got the better of me. Underleveled and underprepared for most areas, I developed the winning strategy of stripping down to my burial rags for a speed boost and streaking through the wilds, shoving everything valuable down my pants.

Ubisoft announced back in September that Far Cry 6 would be crossing over with Stranger Things in future DLC and today, the company has revealed that this crossover will go live tomorrow. 
Ubisoft revealed that the Stranger Things crossover mission starts March 24 in a new teaser trailer released today that offers a quick glimpse at some of the imagery that will be featured in it. As expected, it features some sights that fans of Netflix’s Stranger Things will recognize, like the infamous Demogorgon, the trademark red skies, and more. As it’s still Far Cry 6, protagonist Dani Rojas will be the playable character during this crossover mission, but perhaps some familiar faces will show up in it, too.

On top of that, this mission will be playable by all because this weekend – March 24 through March 27 – Far Cry 6 will be free to play. Like the rest of Far Cry 6, this crossover mission can be played alone or in co-op. 
Despite being announced months ago with a release date less than 24 hours away, not much is known about this Stranger Things crossover. It’s certainly an odd piece of DLC, considering there’s not much, if anything, that connect the two franchises, but it looks like it’s going to be a good time nonetheless. Fortunately, we don’t have to wait too long to find out because it’s out tomorrow. 
For more about Far Cry 6, read Game Informer’s Far Cry 6 review and then find out why it’s on Game Informer’s list of the top 10 action games to play right now. After that, catch up on the Far Cry 4 Pagan Min DLC recently released for Far Cry 6.

A new update for the PS5 is live and it brings a number of enhancements to the console, including improvements to parties, UI enhancement to Game Base and Trophy Cards, and more. 
Before diving into the details of the update in a new PlayStation Blog post, though, Sony revealed that players can expect Variable Refresh Rate support in the coming months. Of course, this will only be an option to those…]]></summary>

Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is Gearbox Software's best game. Built upon the studio's successful Borderlands formula, this experience adds a whimsical element to the familiar looter-shooter thrills and delivers so much firepower to your fingertips you'd think you were wearing the Infinity Gauntlet. Caked in silliness and always trying to make you laugh, Wonderlands hits with distinct charm and handles its characters and world with care, making you engage with both on a journey I didn't want to end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pals, we've got the jump on a new story trailer for FixFox, an almost distastrously nice game that really deserves the oft-misapplied adjective "wholesome". This story trailer is a bit of a tease, in that it doesn't really de-mystify any of the elements of the game that I found most mystifying in my earlier preview, but it definitely does give you a flavour of the kind of adventures and quick-fixes you get into as Vix the space mechanic. Plus it shows off some of the cooler visual flair FixFox has (especially in its loading screens). Give it a watch after the cut.

As Matthew's review notes, there’s a lot of busywork, but Tango Gamework’s rain-slicked rendition of the Japanese capital is quite the place to explore. And to gawp at, even if you don’t have the hardware for its fanciest ray tracing capabilities. 


Indeed, despite some spooky-looking system requirements, Ghostwire: Tokyo can run well on older or lower-spec builds, just as surely as it gets the most out of the very best graphics cards. Within these paragraphs we’ll take a close inspection of how it handles different hardware and display resolutions, as well as which are the best settings to change for optimal PC performance.

Nintendo’s insatiable pink mascot finally has his first full-featured 3D adventure with Kirby and the Forgotten Land. After being sucked into a mysterious vortex (oh, how the tables have turned), he finds himself transported to what looks to be an unknown post-apocalyptic world. By building upon his old bag of tricks and adding successful new gimmicks like Mouthful Mode, Kirby makes a fantastic transition to the third dimension. 
Kirby’s classic suite of abilities are all here and are as fun to use as ever, only now he’s able to use them in 3D space. He can j…]]></summary>

Fobia - St. Dinfna Hotel is a newly announced survival horror game opening its doors this year that invites players to survive a monster-infested hotel. Its resource management and puzzle-solving evoke shades of a modern Resident Evil in a way that has our attention, as does its time-traveling hook. 
Players control rookie journalist Roberto who investigates the infamously haunted St. Dinfna Hotel. The building, located in Treze Trilhas, Santa Catarina, Brazil, has been the subject of rumored disappearances connected to paranormal phenomena, and it’s your job to get to the bottom of it all. Spoiler: the hotel is all sorts of infested by sinister creatures looking to kill you.

Surviving requires thoughtful management of resources. Depending on your inventory, it may be better to run and hide than to fight whatever monstrosity hunts you. St. Dinfna is riddled with puzzles, and Roberto possesses a mysterious camera that connects him to parallel realities, letting players explore past, present, and future timelines to uncover all of the hotel’s secrets. The game’s website also mentions that players will control another protagonist besides Roberto, with both stories intertwining to a grand finale. 
Fobia – St. Dinfna Hotel multiversal storytelling adds an intriguing layer to the standard haunted house affair, and we’re curious to see how it pans out when it arrives later this to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Or you can sample its scares now, thanks to a free Steam demo.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The MPA has teamed up with Google to remove pirate site domain names from search results in countries where these are already blocked by ISPs. No court has ordered Google to take action but the company is voluntarily complying with "no-fault" ISP injunctions. According to the MPA, this delisting of pirate sites is an effective tool in the fight against online piracy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cantata, the upcoming game from Afterschool Studio, is releasing in Early Access on the 12th of May. It's a turn-based strategy game set during a surreal and futuristic war, where, shocker, the aim is to kill your opponent. The twist is that while you’re building your base in each encounter, you’ll also need to manage logistics. The maps in Cantata are bigger than most other strategy games, so you’ll have to construct a supply chain alongside your army to keep your base expanding. And it’s all wrapped up in a unique and colourful aesthetic too.

Update 3/22: In case you missed it, the Ascension Update for Returnal is now live. That means you can now bring a friend along in the newly added co-op mode. You can read the original story below to learn more about what Ascension entails, but it also adds a new location in The Tower of Sisyphus. This tower, which can only be played solo, adds floors of combat trials with who–knows–what awaiting at its peak.

Square Enix has made a name for itself for many reasons, one of them for its penchant for iconic enemy and boss designs. Kefka. Sephiroth. Sora's pants. The list goes on. In that way, Forspoken has a lot to live up to, and Developer Luminous Production's follow-up to Final Fantasy XV is attempting to do just that. Today, we're showing off exclusive 4K gameplay featuring the baddies that would halt protagonist Frey Holland from accomplishing her goal of saving Athia.

But what's a tour of the enemies of Forspoken without knowledgeable guides? Join your hosts Kimberley Wallace and Alex Stadnik as they prep you for what you'll be fighting ahead of the game's October 11 release date. In the first part of today's spicy 4K video, we outline the tier structure of what you'll be battling. The blight is a mythical storm that mutates anything it touches and has turned the beautiful world of Athia into a terrifying magical hellscape. Enemies physically change depending on which of the three tiers they fall into. The deeper you go into the storm, the higher tiered the foe will be, and thus the challenge also rises alongside their increasingly scary appearance. On top of that, we highlight the Pitiless Arbiter, a mini-boss terror that Frey will have to vanquish if she hopes to return home.
Thank you as always for watching our latest cover video. Let us know what you think in the comments below. Enjoyed today's look at Forspoken but want more? We have an entire month of written and video coverage featuring Square Enix's exciting new ARPG, including exclusive looks at the spells Frey uses, a tour of the latest area of Avoalet, and our in-depth preview impressions on The Game Informer Show.

All we've got to go on is a cryptic image of a lynx-like Witcher medallion sitting in a bed of snow. Some of us from the Treehouse ran through what we'd like to see from The Witcher 4, including some truly insightful quotes about leg muscles from myself. One thing I failed to mention, though, was Roach, Geralt's horse.
I'm sure Roach has a great personality, I'm sure he's very kind. But from a purely professional standpoint, I can't stand him. He's hardly smooth in the stirrups, nor can he really climb anything substantial. That's why I'd like Roach swapped out for Elden Ring's Torrent, a horse-goat that corners like Colin McCrae and double jumps like Super Mario. The Witcher 4 deserves a super horse like Torrent.

      Electronic Arts
			
Developer:
      EA Tiburon
      
EA Sports PGA Tour has been delayed out of 2022 and will now launch sometime during Spring 2023. 
EA’s big return to golf video games never had a firm release date and had been pushed out of its Spring 2022 window last November. The press release announcing the delay does not cite a reason for the change in plans.  
First announced in March 2021, EA Sports PGA Tour is the first golf game from the publisher after a years-long hiatus. So far, we know that it will feature the Masters Tournament (which the game has an exclusive partnership with), PGA Championship, U.S. Open Championship, and The Open Championship. It also has a career mode that includes The Players Championship and FedExCup Playoffs. The game will also include the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) and The Amundi Evian Championship. EA Sports PGA Tour is being developed using the Frostbite Engine by EA Tiburon. 
EA still has not confirmed the platforms PGA Tour will appear on, but one would imagine it’ll target current consoles and/or PC. In the meantime, check out this opinion piece on why EA should abandon the annual release model for its sports games.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has given away some cool and outright strange custom consoles in the past, but its latest creation may top them all in the weird category. To celebrate the upcoming premiere of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, the company is giving away a movie-themed Xbox Series S accompanied by a pair of furry controllers modeled after Sonic and Knuckles.
The gamepads are covered in what Microsoft describes as “textured coatings reminiscent of the ‘bristly’ texture of hedgehogs in the wild.” Excusing that Knuckles is an echidna, the controllers are officially dubbed Sonic Blue and Knuckles Red. It appears that only the front of these controllers is fur-covered; the back retains the standard textured plastic. The console itself sports a black paint job with a big gold ring around the vent with an image of the two rivals clashing. It’s... imaginative, to say the least, though I can’t imagine the dust and debris those controllers will collect over time. But at least they should feel comfy to hold. 
There are two ways to get your hands around this unique piece of hardware. You can either retweet the sweepstakes tweet and include #XboxSonic2Sweepstakes or redeem Microsoft Rewards Points (US only) in the console’s rewards app. You can read the official rules by visiting the contest’s Xbox Wire post. The contest begins today and wraps up on April 30. 
Sonic the Hedgehog 2 premieres in theaters on April 8, but it’s already getting a third film and a spin-off series on Paramount+. To gawk at other movie-themed Xbox consoles, check out this custom Shang-Chi Series X.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you heard of Humanoid Studios, the new development team led by ex-Bioware boss Casey Hudson? Last summer, Hudson announced the company on Twitter, stating, "[Humanoid Studios is a] videogame company built to unleash the creative freedom of developers - bringing innovation and artistry to players through an all-new IP." The details surrounding this project have remained a mystery for almost a year, but new concept art uploaded to the developer's site might offer some clues about what Hudson and co. are making. According to the now-updated home page, Humanoid Studios is creating a multi-platform science-fiction game.  
Humanoid Studios' "Our Mission" section reads as follows, "Delivering magical interactive storytelling, by connecting talented creatives to powerful tools, in a safe and supportive environment. Our current project is a multi-platform AAA game, focusing on character-driven narrative in an all-new science-fiction universe." The background art on the site is reminiscent of games like Destiny and GTFO. Of course, Mass Effect influences are apparent, too, with ethereal alien ruins, craggy vistas, and hazy underbellies. 
"By combining excellence in the arts with innovative technologies, videogames have the extraordinary power to transport you to new worlds of adventure," Hudson states. "That's what first inspired me to make games, and it's at the heart of what we do at Humanoid Studios." When the developer's flagship title will release is anyone's guess, but it's safe to assume that the game is still in early development as several roles – from level designers to systems programmers – are being sought out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the comments under my interview with the Paradise Killer devs last week, someone suggested posting more of the answers as like a B-side. I thought this was an excellent suggestion, for three reasons: 1) it's a much easier post to write on my part compared to doing the full interview; b) Oli Clarke Smith and Phil Crabtree said a bunch of interesting things that I wasn't able to cram into the article; iii) it might give you a sense of how weird interviews actually are. 
This transcript is just two questions and a follow-up, but runs to over 1500 words. The whole conversation I had with these two dudes was over 40 minutes long. So much of interviews gets discarded (like tears in rain etc) and the process of distilling it all down to a few quotes can be, to put it succinctly, a pain in the hole. Especially if your interview subject talks quickly. Top tip to people who don't like interviews: talk slowly. It'll be over faster.

Rare Games has announced that the next Sea of Thieves adventure, Forts of the Forgotten, will launch this week, giving players two weeks to make a daring rescue for the residents of the Golden Sands Outpost. 
Rare also released a new cinematic trailer showcasing what’s in store in Forts of the Forgotten to get pirates prepared for their next adventure. It begins with a Sea Fort, a new addition to the game as of this month’s Season Six, where we see one pirate held captive in a jail cell watched by two pirate ghosts from a Spanish fleet. The two speak of their dreaded captain, and it turns out, it’s The Servant of the Flame, who longtime players will recognize as the former leader of The Reaper’s Hideout. 
Click here to watch embedded media
As you can see in the trailer above, The Servant of the Flame wants something from the pirate held captive, but before we can find out why he needs her, the trailer cuts to a ship sailing just outside the Sea Fort. We then see the Masked Stranger, who some suspect is either in cahoots or at odds with The Servant of the Flame. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don’t have to wait too long because Forts of the Forgotten begins this Thursday, on March 24, and will run through April 7. 
Sea of Thieves’ first adventure, Shrouded Islands, was released in February. Forts of the Forgotten represents a new addition to the game that will happen each month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starship Troopers - Terran Command, an upcoming RTS based on the film series, has been delayed to June 16th 2022. Well, in the grand scheme of delays, that’s not too bad. The original release date for Starship Troopers - Terran Command was March 31st, just nine days away. Publisher Slitherine Games and developers The Artistocrats announced the news in a Steam post for the game, pinning the reason on “further polish and bug fixing.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last night, CD Projekt announced they were working on a brand-new Witcher game. Details are thin on the ground at the moment. All we have to go on is a cryptic piece of artwork showing what appears to be a lynx-like medallion peeking through some snow, and a declaration that it's going to represent a "new saga" of The Witcher series. Heck, we don't even know if it's technically going to be called The Witcher 4 yet (it probably isn't, in fairness), but for sake of ease that's how I'm going to refer to it for the time being. 
Still, talk of a new saga has got me thinking. Does that mean we'll simply see a new protagonist in the existing Witcher timeline we know and love? (Ciri, perhaps, or young hot Vesemir?) Or will it go earlier, maybe tying into the upcoming Netflix prequel The Witcher: Blood Origin that's set 1200 years before the events of the books? Or something else entirely? We probably won't know the answers for some time, but until CD Projekt have more beans to spill, RPS asks: what would you like to see from a new game in The Witcher series?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Taiwanese studio Red Candle Games have put up a crowdfunding page for their latest project Nine Sols, and it looks promising. It’s an action platformer with gorgeous hand-drawn animation work, and as Red Candle put it, it’s “a journey of Asian fantasy inspired by Sekiro, Hollow Knight and Katana Zero.” That’s me sold. And clearly a lot of other people agree too, because Nine Sols broke its goal of three million Taiwanese dollars (that’s roughly £80,000) within 24 hours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Critics who describe a work as a love letter to something else have obviously never written a love letter. Real love letters are written by people so ruined by an oxytocin-soaked brain that they’re compelled to pick up a quill and rattle off paragraph after paragraph of rambling, horny nonsense, a hot stream of unalloyed adoration that is destined to one day be read aloud in a grave voice by the host of a mid-tier crime podcast.


Shredders is an actual love letter to snowboarding. It might have been coded using cut up letters from magazines. It is a pure, geeky, effusive veneration of the sport and its players, and so sincere about its passion for going down the side of a mountain on a long bit of wood that it occasionally verges on embarrassing. You’ve heard of dancing like nobody's watching, now get ready for a game about snowboarding made as though nobody will ever play it.

You'll be able to play as Glover in a brand new PC port coming to both Steam and GOG, and rather than restoring the old PC port that already exists, it's been "completely redone" using the original source code from the N64 version of the game.

Piko Interactive are the developers behind this release. Buying old games and rereleasing them seems to be most of Piko's wheelhouse, as they've bought a bunch of old IPs and stuck the games onto digital storefronts. Piko Interactive were, for example, behind the Steam releases of Super 3D Noah's Ark, First Samurai, and something called Bubble Ghost which sounds cuter than it probably is. Piko's previous releases typically also include the original file for the game, so hopefully Glover purists will also be satisfied by this version. And game preservation is always a good thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft recently announced that they’d cracked how to get Game Pass games running on the handheld Steam Deck. Great! It involves installing a beta version of Microsoft Edge (less great!) and, by way of a Game Pass Ultimate subscription, streaming those games to the Deck in a browser. Not running Game Pass games locally, in other words, but running them well enough to be playable, and with seamless compatibility for the Steam Deck’s controls.


After having gone through the lengthy setup process (explained below, if you want to try streaming Game Pass games on the Steam Deck yourself) and playing for a while, I can say it’s a good enough start in bringing Microsoft’s library to Valve’s handheld. Between this and the Epic Games Launcher, it’s a relief that the Deck’s default SteamOS won’t be limited to Steam games after all. Still, a beta is a beta, and there are very much some kinks to work out.

There’s no official date set for the update yet, but you can read Platinum's full plans in a blog post. The update's split into two halves, with one focused on providing new content, and the other full of changes to try to improve the game based on player feedback. And I would imagine there's a lot of that to go through, based on how critical the reviews for Babylon's Fall were.

For whatever reason, the other two films never got their own games - I just assumed that was because nobody liked the films that much. The truth is, developers TT Games have been working on them all along, albeit as part of Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, a mega-game including all nine mainline films in the franchise. 
It's been in development for a while, and has been delayed several times, allegedly resulting in extensive crunch. It's finally coming out on April 5th, but having played about an hour of Episode IV, this is not the Lego Star Wars-ing I remember. The plots are the same, of course, but much of its mindless minifig bashing has now been swapped for... over-the-shoulder third-person shooting? I feel a great disturbance in the Force.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many creators leave fingerprints on their games, but few apply their digits as physically as Shinji Mikami in Ghostwire: Tokyo. One sidequest in Tango’s open world spook-busting adventure sees a neighbourhood disturbed by piano music, eerily plonking away at ungodly hours. Roaming the streets you soon catch the haunting strains of Moonlight Sonata, a piece famously played in Mikami’s Resident Evil to unlock a secret passage. But it’s more than a cute nod. Ghostwire’s credits reveal the player to be Mikami himself - showing off talents usually reserved for fellow Bethesda creators behind closed doors. 
While I’m sure he contributed more than tinkling mood music for an optional quest, Ghostwire has been framed as a debutante ball for the next generation of Tango talent. In Archipel’s ace interview series Mikami spoke about fostering new creative leads and taking more of a backseat compared to his work on The Evil Within, which was more clearly made in the Resi mold. The result is, by design, the studio’s least Mikami-ish romp to date: a sprawling tale of a metropolis turned ghost town that is one part love letter to the city and its urban legends, and an opportunity to zap headless school girls and floating puppets with electrifying particle effects.

IPhone 11, 12 i poslední 13 používají umělou inteligenci pro „vylepšení“ obrazu z kamery. Jde o technologii Deep Fusion, kdy je obraz sejmut až devětkrát s různou expozicí. Deep Fusion pak složí obraz z nejjasnějších částí na těchto devíti vstupních snímcích.

They ultimately refused to pay so BREIN filed a full lawsuit and has now come out on top.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the heart of Total War: Warhammer 3 is an extremely relatable struggle to murder four members of the monarchy, claim their souls, and cash them in so you can meet a really big bear. I would like to meet a big bear. I'm willing to do a lot to meet a really big bear. But many players have felt that this 'Souls race' forces the game into an unpleasant and uninteresting shape. Thankfully, the devs have plans for the next patch which they say should "make the Souls race less urgent".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week I took a bit of holiday to, you know, catch up on some housework, have a bit of a rest and, to change the habit of a lifetime, play some video games. I knew straight away what would be first up on my video game playlist: FAR: Changing Tides, the sequel to Okomotive's beautifully melancholy roadtrip adventure, FAR: Lone Sails. While Changing Tides tells a separate story to its predecessor, putting you in the shoes of a new protagonist and swapping its desolate wastelands for a watery seascape, the hot, beating core powering the game remains very much the same. With nothing left for you at home in the wake of an unknown disaster, it's time to pack up and head on out for a new beginning, with only your hulking great boat/steamtrain contraption for company. 
If you still haven't played FAR: Changing Tides, I'd urge you to stop reading now and come back later. There are big spoilers about the game's ending coming up in this article, and I really don't want to ruin that for you. So, fair warning, okay? If you're still here I'm assuming you've played and finished Changing Tides, because holy moly, isn't it just the most perfect thing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thy Creature is an odd one. I want to make several comparisons to other games that probably aren't very accurate or fair. I think that's because it's one of those that's made up of the gaps in between other genres. Right from the start of its anime goth girl intro I knew this wasn't really my kind of thing, and yet its striking art and sense of sincerity felt compelling. 
And it was a bit weird, which is sometimes enough. It depicts a frankenstein cast out by villagers, left to wander the wilderness, across forests and mountains, still peppered with arrows, turning up at a sinister tower that seems to welcome them. And just a few minutes in, it reveals itself as a mystery puzzle game with bullet hell parts. Almost none of this is my thing at all, but here I am playing it. Hmm.

In that time I’ve taken it on day trips, chatted to Gabe Newell and the Valve dev team about it, and been laughed at in a pub for inverting the Y axis on it. And all the while, the Steam Deck itself has been getting better - considerably so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before we get stuck in, here's the sitch. PC code for FF Origin went out a bit late, so the thoughts below are my initial impressions of the game based on the chunk I've played so far, which is about half the game. This isn't a full review, but I also can't see my thoughts changing. Anyway. Let's embrace Chaos.
Stranger Of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is a Soulslike Final Fantasy spin-off that swings so much it misses. Your sole focus is to kill a bad guy called Chaos and the game provides fights and loot in their hundreds, possibly thousands, to ensure you're beefy enough when the time comes. But cut away the combat and you're left with little, really. Search for anything other than Chaos and you'll find there's nothing else driving you forwards. You'll finish the game and part as strangers still, probably.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the small slice I've played of samurai slasher Trek To Yomi, I'm convinced it's going to be the most Instagrammable game out there. Every frame looks gorgeous, capturing feudal Japan through a grainy black and white lens that evokes classic samurai flicks. Thankfully, there's some substance to match this style too. Combat is elegant and the story seems refined, not bloated, which makes this a ronin romp worth watching out for.

I chose the Astrologer class and used sorceries galore to effortlessly steamroll through almost every boss. Nothing could compete with my trusty staff, so I didn’t need to use spirit ashes for my first 100 hours or so. I was fine by myself, like any good romcom protagonist at the start of the movie.
As I walked into the final boss arena, I had unwaivering confidence. I strolled in, staff at the ready and prepared to win. Then, my string of easy victories came to a shocking end. I got walloped and decimated for about 10 hours and eventually announced my defeat. Elden Ring was a game I just couldn’t finish. Fortunately, love had other plans, and I entered into a whirlwind romance with the Mimic Tear Ash.

With a pay-what-you-want minimum of only $10, the Bundle For Ukraine offers almost 600 indie video games as well as tabletop games, comics, and more. It is ridiculously good and for a good cause. But time's almost up, and you only have a few hours left to nab it. Probably should.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week the Electronic Wireless Show podcast is talking about our favourite heists. Although we start with a bit of confusion because I changed the topic too late and Matthew didn't notice. Yes: I successfully pulled off a truth heist!
As well as talking a lot about heists in games, we discuss whether or not most crimes are heists. For example, theft in general is just spicy picking up, and murder is a soul heist. Matthew clues us in on what it was like to work for a secret shopper company, and Nate tells us about his repeat of his annual Eat Every Thing In Lord Of The Rings watch-along. Will this result in his daughter blocking memories? Only time will tell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A sequel is coming for excellent cooperative heist game Monaco, publishers Humble Games announced today. Jim Rossignol's Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine review in 2013 was pretty straightforward: "This is one of the most important independent games this year, and might well end up being one of the best-loved games of the decade." I don't think it panned out quite that way, partially because indie games grew so larger and more mainstream than expected across the decade, but the IGF Grand Prize winner is still a cracking game. And Monaco 2 looks pretty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GPU-based upscaling has proven to be one of the most useful additions to gaming PC tech in years. Big performance improvements in exchange for only a minor drop in visual quality, if any at all? Yes please and thank you. Nvidia’s DLSS has established itself as the gold standard of upscalers, outperforming AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR), but the Radeon makers are now readying two new offerings: FSR 2.0 and Radeon Super Resolution (RSR).


FSR 2.0 looks to be a straight upgrade on the current 1.0 version, promising sharper picture quality with “optimised anti-aliasing” to better compete with the built-in, AI-assisted edge smoothing of DLSS. It will still need to be implemented in games by their developers, though – unlike RSR, which aims to work with just about any game by applying its upscaling algorithm at the GPU driver level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The folks over at Eastshade Studios sure do have a brand, don’t they? Cozy, rustic, slow-going living with a touch of the magical has a certain appeal all its own, and as the recent announcement of Songs Of Glimmerwick proves, EastStud don’t intend on shaking up that brand any time soon. This is a wonderful thing for me because their previous outing and namesake, Eastshade, is not only one of my favourite games of all time, but also such an important kind of game in the terrifying, nightmare world we find ourselves in today.
You see, Eastshade does one thing very, very well. In fact, it does it so well that most players probably won’t even have noticed until they look back and really think on it. Eastshade teaches mindfulness, a keen and acute awareness of oneself and one’s surroundings in the present moment. And that, my friends, is where the appeal comes from.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move befitting a game about immortal beings who live out countless repeating lives on artificial islands powered by human sacrifice, Paradise Killer is getting a re-release. Sort of. It's coming to next-gen consoles today, with all platforms (including PC) getting some extra bits added for free that weren't in the original 2020 release. Not bad for a game that Kaizen Game Works creative director Oli Clarke Smith thought would only really sell to "a niche of freaks". If you're not one of those freaks, I'd heartily recommend becoming one. Playing Paradise Killer is like going to a seaside cosplay party where police procedurals play on loop and cocktails are snorted in a dehydrated powder form. It is a meticulously authored murder mystery with a cast of freaks.
When I sat down to talk to both Clarke Smith and technical director Phil Crabtree about Paradise Killer's new update, it turns out that niche has already become quite large. Even Crabtree's dad has played Paradise Killer, though Crabtree isn't sure he really understood it. Crabtree also tells us he sometimes get messages from friends saying someone they know just played Paradise Killer and was talking about it. "It just seems so weird that that there is this audience there that we never expected, and it doesn't seem that far away," he says. "Like, it's not this mystery group of people, there always seems to be some connection that's quite close to you."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clink your wine glass. Tunic is not so much a love letter to Zelda as it is a wedding speech. Many games pay their respects to the blonde lawn mower and his absentee princess, but few have such fondness and understanding of the exact feelings those adventures conjure up, the precise sensation of exploring, the nook-scavenging, and the meticulous internal mapping that happens when you play Zelda's brand of wundergame. Tunic might have sacrificed some of its own identity in hitting every Ocarina note so perfectly, but when the result is such a capable homage it's hard to complain.
