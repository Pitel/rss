Another fun week in the Nintendo Life is finished, and it had some interesting bits and pieces of news. The highlight was probably Nintendo's Q3 financial results, which generally showed that Nintendo is making a lot of money; even shareholders are relatively happy, crikey. For you NFT watchers, multiple projects were abandoned on that front, while elsewhere MLB The Show 22 is coming to Switch(!), Yacht Club Games unveiled Mina the Hollower (it's already pretty good), and Pokemon Legends: Arceus has sold well because of course it has.
Also, as a little note, the lovely Jon Cartwright has now left Nintendo Life to pursue an exciting new opportunity, and we wish him well.

At the end of last year, Nintendo Minute's hosts Kit and Krysta aired their final episode after 8 years and over 400 episodes.
There were a lot of questions raised about their sudden departure, and they've now spoken about this themselves during an interview with the YouTube channel MinnMax. As suspected - it's all to do with the closure of Nintendo's San Francisco office in California, with the pair ready to start a "new chapter" rather than relocate to Nintendo of America's headquarters.

Apparently, a "certain super spy" could be making a return in the coming weeks. This is according to VGC editor and former Playtonic Games writer Andy Robinson, who shared a message over on Twitter.
While it's unclear who exactly this spy could be, one obvious guess is James Bond. Some have also referenced SNK's '90s release The Super Spy and various other video game characters that work in the same field or a similar one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Click to watch embedded media
  
Gran Turismo 7 is the first mainline entry in the series since 2013's Gran Turismo 6 back on the PlayStation 3. Sure, Gran Turismo Sport was released during the PlayStation 4 generation, but that game left fans wanting more and also equally excited about what was in the pipeline. It turns out, what was in the pipeline was the next full Gran Turismo and after watching a behind-closed-doors preview of it recently, Game Informer editor Wesley LeBlanc came away excited for "the real driving simulator." 
As someone who's never dabbled in the Gran Turismo series beyond a few hours each entry, he was looking for something in GT7 to entice him to stick around. What he found was a couple of new modes and features that seemingly aim to do just that, although we won't know until the full release in March. However, if you're a hardcore GT fan, don't worry – all the bells and whistles you've come to expect in these games are present, looking (and sounding) better than ever. 
In this New Gameplay Today, Wesley is joined by fellow Game Informer editors Ben Reeves and John Carson, all hosted by video editor Alex Stadnik. They talk about new features, returning favorites, being funny on the racetrack, and more. Thanks for watching, and be sure to let us know what you think of this upcoming racing game from PlayStation and Polyphony Digital.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve announced the Steam Deck in July of last year and it was met with cautious excitement. Its premise is great – play your Steam games on the go in a Switch-like fashion – but many were confused at the actual layout of the device. Its buttons seem to be running off the edge, the analog sticks are quite high (and not offset like they are on the Switch) and there are two very-large touchpads. 
Oh, and it looked quite big. With excitement continually ramping up for the device, Valve announced last week that the Steam Deck would launch on February 25 (for those who preordered the first wave, of course). That release date is close and it seems some people have already got their hands on the device. They’ve posted some comparison pictures, too, that reveal the Steam Deck is chonky. 
Here’s what it looks like compared to Sony’s PlayStation Vita, a relatively small handheld device:

And here’s the comparison everyone wants to see – the Nintendo Switch vs. the Steam Deck: 
The Steam Deck is enormous... pic.twitter.com/fMVXckNkiK
February 4, 2022
As you can see in the image above, the Steam Deck is significantly larger than the Switch. For fans of big screens and people with large hands, this is likely an exciting comparison. For people with smaller hands, or for fans of more compact devices, that excitement might be waning. Only time will tell but fortunately, we won’t have to wait too long as the Steam Deck will hit the hands of consumers later this month on February 25.

They're sustained by fans' hopes and dreams of what the games might one day become but this is a double-edged sword. The developers, Cloud Imperium Games have now decided to make their public development roadmap for future updates more vague, because some players get dead narked about delays. I can see that happening after nine years.

The Kagawa Prefecture, located in the south of Japan, is also known as the "Udon Prefecture" for its famous locally-made noodles. Who better to team up with the Kagawa Prefecture than Yadon — the Japanese name for Slowpoke?
The reggae song above is actually from 2014, when it was released in celebration of Slowpoke Day on the 10th of August. It's been revived to promote Kagawa, as part of a collaboration between The Pokémon Company and the Kagawa Prefecture Tourism Association — a collaboration which has been going on since 2020.

The Steam Deck is very big. It is so big, in fact, that we're pretty sure it could beat up your dad and also eclipse the sun without breaking a sweat. People have been having a lot of fun comparing the Large Lad to a bunch of much smaller things, and even some average size things.
The Steam Deck is bigger than a Nintendo Switch. We already knew that, of course, but it's nice to see it from a different angle. It is even bigger than a Nintendo Switch with the Hori Split Pad Pro, which is impressive, because those things are also very big.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Children of Morta is one of the most exceptional hidden gems of the last generation, but the cooperative dungeon crawler has woefully lacked a much-requested feature: online play. Playing with a friend locally has been great, but now you can finally play with remote buddies – or maybe even a sweetheart – this Valentine’s Day. Assuming you’re on PC, that is. 
On February 14, the long-promised online two-player co-op option finally makes its way into the Steam version game. Don’t worry, console players: the feature is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch, but developer Dead Mage doesn’t have a timetable on when that will happen. In a press release, the team states it wants to ensure online play functions well on PC before rolling it out elsewhere. 
Online co-op comes via The Fellowship Sanctuary update, the final piece of content of its eight-piece DLC roadmap. That means 11bit will be wrapping up major support for the game which was first released in October 2019 to a 9 out of 10 review score from us here at Game Informer. The dungeon-crawling action game centers on a large family of warriors, all of whom are playable, who must fight back an evil corruption. 
In his review of the game, Editor-in-Chief Andrew Reiner wrote “I can’t stress just how smartly made Children of Morta is. The narrative flows smoothly in and out of dungeons, the characters have real life to them, and the gameplay is enthralling and has those addictive qualities that make you just want to keep leveling everyone up. In the 15-plus hours I invested in this adventure, I was thoroughly captivated by everything Dead Mage set out to achieve. The way family comes together for the final conflict is truly impressive.”

Its director, Josef Fares, is perhaps best known for his dislike of The Academy Awards and you might have seen him on The Game Awards stage last December. That’s because he accepted the Game of the Year award that night. 
Fares is likely still riding the high of that win, but today, news released that’s sure to keep him smiling. Hazelight Studios’ official Twitter account revealed that It Takes Two has sold five million copies.

“5…that’s FIVE million copies of It Takes Two sold,” the tweet reads. “Our team is absolutely stunned just thinking about how many players have now enjoyed our game.” 
5… that’s FIVE million copies of #ItTakesTwo ￼sold! 😳💥🥳
February 4, 2022
Having sold five million copies, It Takes Two is now Hazelight Studios’ most popular game, beating out A Way Out’s 3.5 million copies sold, as reported by GameSpot. 
It Takes Two being this successful isn’t much of a surprise – the game’s great! Game Informer gave it a 9.25 out of 10 and you can read that review here. Hazelight Studios seems set on capitalizing on the game’s success, too, as it recently announced a film and television adaptation is in the works. 
While waiting for that, check out where It Takes Two falls on Game Informer’s top 10 games of 2021 list, and then read this feature about It Takes Two’s creator on love, endings, and a $1000 pledge.

Most people don't have their breakups turn into viral trends on social media, but most of us can imagine how utterly horrible that would be. For Holland, the star of Land of Screens, it's her reality — and so, she tries to get away from screens for good.
Land of Screens is a point-and-click adventure that deals with the trials of modern life: Going to a party where you don't know anyone, attending family reunions, and trying to force your friends to do outdoor activities.

Updated with SNK VS. Capcom: Card Fighters' Clash and Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. Enjoy!

You'd be forgiven for thinking that physical tabletop gaming might have trouble surviving in this digital and ever-mobile age, but collectible card games and traditional board games are arguably more popular than ever. Excellent digital versions of household staples sit alongside entirely original offerings that serve up the full tabletop experience with added digital convenience. Online play can be a real lifesaver if you're stuck indoors and can't get to a friend's house, and not needing to lug a weighty card collection around will do wonders for your posture, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas.

Fallen Order was released November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Daniel Tack, and Andrew Reiner on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat. Just as a reminder, subscribing to Game Informer on Twitch rewards access to the official Game Informer Discord channel where you can interact with our lovely community as well as the editors.

Rockstar’s blog post today concluded with a note stating as much, which you can read in full below:
So there you have it. While not the biggest surprise in the world, there is a vocal sect of fans that will be relieved to know that, yes, Rockstar won’t be re-releasing GTA V in perpetuity.

But to hang out with Alba for some all important frolicking lessons. She's a pro at this skipping marlarkey. If she's not throwing her arms out like an aeroplane when she's running up and down the yellowing hills of this sleepy little island village, she's doing a jolly little skip that is probably the most delightful thing I've ever seen in a video game. In fairness, the whole game is just pure joy distilled into a chill wildlife photography adventure, but man alive, the skipping is something else. More of this please, developers.

Not so long ago, we reported on the news that Retro-Bit was reproducing the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis version of Mega Man: The Wily Wars, a collection of the first three NES Mega Man games that originally launched way back in 1994. It was a Japanese and European exclusive at the time and is quite rare – which is why Retro-Bit's reprint is so welcome.
We were lucky enough to get a sample this week and we thought you might like to take a look at what's included. You get an interchangeable sleeve, collector's cards, a poster and much more besides. As you can see, the cartridge is housed in a cool transparent case, and the package has a series of different lenticular covers.

Nintendo revealed its Q3 financial results and conducted an earnings call Q&A this week. As is the norm for a quarterly update it didn't have any major reveals or announcements, but rather gave a state of play in terms of sales and business performance - particularly important in this case as it includes sales from the Holidays.
The overall picture was positive; Nintendo is on course for major profits this year, and increased its estimates on that score. It did reduce the anticipated Switch hardware sales by one million, but increased its software sales projection by 20 million units. Some of our coverage on the results is below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eight years after the launch of Grand Theft Auto V, Rockstar Games have finally confirmed yes, they really are making a new GTA. For eight years they've focused on adding new content to the MMO-y GTA Online mode, which seems a licence to print money by selling in-game cash for real cash. This has made some fans ornery, wondering if they'll just keep on plugging away at GTAO forever, especially with GTAV coming to next-gen consoles this year. But no, really, Rockstar say they really have been making a new one.

This week it's the FTL-inspired The Last Bastion that's making things difficult. You're the leader of a defeated army regiment, retreating across a series of regions to a stronghold where your king plans to make a last stand. It's sort of roguelike, with a hint of something like Reigns in balancing your forces and reputation, with light interactive fiction parts. I'm a little bit annoyed that I like it.

Mario Kart Tour, the mobile game that gets constant updates while we wait for new Switch MK content (sorry), has been adjudicating on an important debate over the last week. Who's better, Waluigi or Wario? We stated the fact that Waluigi is better and now it has nearly been proven by science, with Team Waluigi taking a 2-0 lead in the game's event after two rounds.
That said, Nintendo is seemingly trying to rig the game, with the 'final round' being worth three points; in theory Wario could win just one round and be the winner, which we're sure you'll agree is a scandal in the making.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghostwire: Tokyo is an upcoming action-adventure game from Tango Gameworks (aka the folks behind The Evil Within), which means it has ghosts and ghost-adjacent monsters in it. Last night Bethesda showed off a bit more of the game with a streamed showcase, with a ten minute breakdown of the game in action. I, however, was privy to a hands-off presentation that comprised a whole half an hour of Ghostwire Tokyo being played. What luxury!
It reminded me much less of The Evil Within than I expected. It has a lot of horror elements, don't get me wrong, but Ghostwire: Tokyo is much more of an action game using the language of horror to convey its themes than the other way around. Rather than spending most of your time on the back foot, creeping around in the hope you can get past a lumbering ball of dead lady limbs with most of your health intact, time in Ghostwire: Tokyo is more likely spent one-shotting headless demon schoolgirls with a bow and arrow. The general vibe, if not the specifics, reminded me a lot of classic, thundering 90s and 00s action films like Blade. So, in other words, Ghostwire: Tokyo looks rad as hell. Even better, it's also unashamedly strange.

Changes that are available on desktop but could be even more helpful, methinks, on the upcoming Steam Deck.


The first appears on the Library page of games you own, but haven’t installed yet: a new “Space required” string that lists how much hard drive or SSD space it will need. As it stands on the main Steam client, you can’t normally see this info without clicking the Install button, so that’s a click saved whenever you’re trying to find out if a new game (or nostalgic re-install) will fit onto stuffed storage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dying Light 2 is finally out and it seems the latest zombie parkour game from Techland is doing really well. 
If Steam numbers are anything to go off of, Dying Light 2 is easily Techland’s most successful game. In fact, its all-time peak is nearly four times larger than Dying Light’s all-time peak. Mind you, Dying Light has been out since 2015 and Dying Light 2 has been out for essentially 24 hours. That it’s already surpassed the original game with such massive numbers is quite the feat, as noted by games analyst Benji-Sales on Twitter.

More specifically, Dying Light 2’s all-time peak at the moment is 177,222 players, according to Steam Charts. Dying Light’s all-time peak is 45,876. In fact, Dying Light 2 has already surpassed last year’s big horror release, Resident Evil Village, which has an all-time peak of 106,631. 
Now, it’s important to note that PC player counts don’t necessarily translate to console player counts, but there’s a good chance that if PC player counts are this high, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One concurrents are just as high, if not higher. If that’s the case, then Techland absolutely has another hit on their hands. 
That wouldn’t be surprising either because Dying Light 2 is a great game – Game Informer gave it a 9.5 out of 10. Not to mention, Techland has already publicly discussed its commitment to this game, releasing a five-year roadmap for planned DLC. The sequel could get another boost in player counts too when the Switch version of Dying Light 2, which was recently delayed, is finally released.

Those of you who have visited this site regularly over the past decade or so might be aware that I'm a big fan of Konami's Castlevania. Ever since I was first introduced to the vampire-killing franchise with the potent double-whammy of Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge and Super Castlevania IV in the early '90s I've been utterly in love with it; the intoxicating mixture of gothic broodiness, engaging characters and fantastic music has made this my go-to series whenever I need a gaming pick-me-up. Sure, for every Symphony of the Night there's often a Castlevania Judgment, but on the whole, this is a lineage of games that will always be close to my heart – despite the fact that Konami seems largely disinterested in adding anything meaningful to the franchise.

The proposed sentence is found in court documents relating to Bower's ongoing case, and the US government argues that a 60-month / five-year sentence would reflect "the nature and circumstances of the offence, the history and characteristics of the defendant, and the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offence, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment... to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct" (thanks, Eurogamer).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Its latest power move in gaming.
We're in the midst of high profile takeovers in the gaming industry, in addition to major investments. A lot of headlines have followed Tencent's increasingly prolific investments in game companies, but today the focus is on Saudi Arabia's 'Public Investment Fund' (PIF), a government-run sovereign wealth fund, which recently spent around $1 billion on stakes across two businesses.
The bigger chunk was spent on 5% of Nexon, a Korean firm with hugely successful online games. The more notable investment from a Nintendo / console perspective, however, is PIF's purchase of 5% of Capcom, which according to Bloomberg amounts to around $332 million in value at current share prices. They're being described as 'pure investment' moves, as opposed to precursors to a takeover; time will tell on that, but at present it's a modest shareholding.

When we saw Voice of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden on our YouTube subscriber list the initial assumption was that it was a mobile spin-off or smaller experience. We already had Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars in October on Switch, yet it's the same creative team and developer bringing us The Forsaken Maiden - its out soon on the eShop, too, on 17th February priced at $29.99USD / €29,99 / £24.99.
As a reminder, both The Isle Dragon Roars and this new entry have Yoko Taro on board as Creative Director; they're the creator behind the outstanding Drakengard and NieR games. With such a small gap between releases its clear that the card-only format and the processes setup for development are ideal for turning stories and ideas into games rather quickly.

He's one of the original founders of Turtle Rock Studios and creator of Left 4 Dead. At Valve, he worked on CS:GO and Team Fortress 2. Westwood Studio's classic RPG Nox? That's Booth as well. After a stint working on VR games for Facebook, he's currently the chief creative officer at Bad Robot Games, the game-centric offshoot of J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot film and TV production company. But, not content with having one job at a time, Booth has also been working at Resolution Games on the VR tabletop RPG Demeo.
A streamlined, high production values version of Dungeons & Dragons, Demeo won a lot of "best of" accolades in VR game round-ups. But soon it's coming to regular ol' PCs, with early access starting on April 7th. I spoke to Booth about Demeo, but also the future of co-op games. He had quite a lot to say.

It has already experienced mortality once, so this creature more than anyone is ready to suffer the ignominy of death. It has practice, it knows what's coming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost 100,000 consoles sold.
The arrival of Pokémon Legends: Arceus had a predictably positive impact on the Switch's fortunes in its homeland last week.


Between 24th January and 30th January, Arceus sold 1,424,657 copies, a massive contribution to the staggering 6.5 million units it has sold so far worldwide. This shot in the arm has enabled the Switch family to shift almost 100,000 hardware units in Japan during the same timeframe – a modest bump from the 77,219 consoles sold in the previous week.


As has so often been the case lately, the entire top ten is made up of Nintendo Switch software (first numbers are estimated sales for this week, followed by total sales):


 Pokemon Legends: Arceus (The Pokemon Company, 01/28/22) – 1,424,657 (New)
 Mario Party Superstars (Nintendo, 10/29/21) – 19,169 (833,192)
 Pokemon Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl (The Pokemon Company, 11/19/21) – 14,951 (2,483,102)
 Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (Nintendo, 04/28/17) – 13,064 (4,400,203)
 Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (Nintendo, 12/07/18) – 12,986 (4,739,797)
 Minecraft (Microsoft, 06/21/18) – 10,663 (2,496,078)
 Animal Crossing: New Horizons (Nintendo, 03/20/20) – 8,695 (7,166,966)
 Ring Fit Adventure (Nintendo, 10/18/19) – 7,733 (3,059,839)
 Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain (Nintendo, 12/03/21) – 7,127 (2,307,549)
 Momotaro Dentetsu: Showa, Heisei, Reiwa mo Teiban! (Konami, 11/19/20) – 6,749 (2,5814,176)

Here are this week's hardware figures for Japan, followed by lifetime sales in brackets:

Switch OLED Model – 46,947 (1,077,288)
Switch – 32,331 (17,927,296)
Switch Lite – 19,800 (4,530,354)
PlayStation 5 – 21,871 (1,128,590)
PlayStation 5 Digital Edition – 1,468 (208,748)
Xbox Series X – 1,098 (76,983)
Xbox Series S – 598 (59,051)
New 2DS LL (including 2DS) – 267 (1,181,306)
PlayStation 4 – 11 (7,819,302)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 25th Annual DICE Awards are taking place later this month, and the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences has announced head of Xbox, Phil Spencer will receive the prestigious AIAS Lifetime Achievement Award.
Presenting the award to Spencer will be industry luminary, and fellow Microsoft alumn Todd Howard, who was welcomed into the company through the acquisition of Bethesda Game Studios and its parent company ZeniMax Media, led by Spencer in 2019. In the announcement of the award recipient, the AIAS gave a summary of Phil's history in the game industry including the new role of Microsoft Gaming CEO and the many studios he's brought into the Xbox family. 
The list of accomplishments is long, and many have only come about in the last few years. The AIAS describes the Lifetime Achievement Award as "reserved for individuals whose accomplishments span a broad range of disciplines over a lengthy career in the industry," and individuals do not necessarily need to be hands-on with development. It's safe to say Phil Spencer has been a very influential force in the direction Xbox is heading this generation with its focus on powerful console hardware, flexible ecosystems that span the Xbox, PC, Mobile, and elsewhere, and popular services like Xbox Game Pass.
Meggan Scavio, President of the AIAS, was quoted saying, “Phil Spencer has demonstrated both passion and leadership throughout his entire career at Microsoft. He’s responsible for countless impactful and pivotal initiatives that have reverberated throughout the entire gaming industry." The award has been previously presented to Minoru Arakawa, Howard Lincoln, Ken Kutaragi, Doug Lowenstein, Bing Gordon, Satoru Iwata, and Genyo Takeda.
The 25th Annual DICE Awards will be held on February 24 at 8 p.m. Pacific at the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its surprise launch last month, Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel has taken the world by storm. The free-to-play title based on the popular children’s card game trading card game has rocketed towards the top of Steam charts and Twitch streams, though a mobile release was the last big missing piece of its (millennium) puzzle. Switch has been the only option for playing on the go, but that changes today with the game’s launch on iOS and Android.
Although Master Duel became available on mobile a week ago in other countries, today marks its debut in North American territories. That means you can get Ash Blossom’d and stare down Eldlich the Golden Lord anywhere an internet connection allows. If you’re new to Master Duel, it’s basically a premium version of the traditional trading card game. Unlike Duel Links, Master Duel uses Master Rule 5 AKA the standard ruleset of the real-life game. Master Duel also supports cross-play and cross-progression, with Season 2 of ranked duels kicking off earlier this week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Tango Gameworks provided the first extended look at Ghostwire: Tokyo's moment-to-moment gameplay and the other activities players can get into throughout its haunted Tokyo. A pair of videos provides a walkthrough of the game's action, while a developer interview reveals the team's design process. 
We already knew that the game’s story is set after Tokyo’s population disappears thanks to the arrival of dangerous Yokai, or spirits. You play as a lone survivor, Akito, who awakens possessed by a spirit named KK who imbues you with elemental powers. This power is called Ethereal Weaving, and let you channel the elements of fire, wind, and water. Executing these moves resembles a blend of Doctor Strange’s spellcasting and Avatar: The Last Airbender’s bending thanks to its flashy, elaborate hand gestures. Physical weapons complement your spells such as a bow and various talismans, and you can stealth attack enemies instead of blasting them head-on.  
Among other features, the first video shows off Akito tango ability, which lets him fire a spirit tether to grapple and ascend buildings. We also got a look at corrupted, fog-covered areas players must clear out and surreal shape-shifting areas that evoke the psychological horror of Tango Gamework’s previous series, The Evil Within.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Switch is now the third best-selling console from Nintendo after surpassing 103 million units sold. 
More specifically, in Nintendo’s latest round of quarterly results, the company revealed that 103.54 million Switch consoles have been sold. That means it has officially surpassed the Wii, which sold 101.63 million in its lifetime. Before these results, the Switch was at 92 million units sold and behind the Wii, Game Boy (118.69 million), and the DS (154.02 million).

Nintendo’s president also revealed that the Switch is only in the middle of its lifecycle, suggesting it might be on its way to passing the Game Boy at least. The DS’ massive 154 million seems like more of a stretch but that doesn’t mean it’s not possible. 
However, it seems the company…]]></summary>

Yesterday, both EA and Sony released their quarterly financial results so it’s no surprise Nintendo’s arrived today. What is a surprise, though, for some is that we might still be another five years away from a new Nintendo console.

“Switch is just in the middle of its lifecycle and the momentum going into this year is good,” Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said during the results, as reported by Bloomberg. “The Switch is ready to break a pattern of our past consoles that saw momentum weakening in their sixth year on the market and grow…]]></summary>

Let me introduce you properly to Risona, Asari Commander. She’s a legendary Human Samurai creature in the Boros/Lorehold colors that costs 1RW to cast. Bringing a solid three power and three toughness and Haste to the board, Risona is bringing a decent body for her cost, ready to rush in for an attack.

You swat away hordes of monsters with weapons and magic that fire automatically. All it needs from you is one hand on the wheel. You are, in essence, the pale captain of a battleship that must weave its way through demons and bats. The garlic and holy water cannons will take care of the rest.
Not only do I crave more vampiric survival, but I also wish it had been released years ago. This is the perfect pre-lesson huddle. The perfect after-school treat. A nerdy talk generator for those locker chats.

This doesn't just mean things from fighting games, although they do obviously make a good showing. As you can imagine, Nate makes the case for RTS games with what he and his pals term 'the GG push'. Plus, we have a great Mortal Kombat themed Cavern Of Lies this week, courtesy of Matthew.
Much time is spent on some excellent digressions this week, including James McAvoy as a rampaging dinosaur from Jurassic Park (a state of affairs that I think would have improved his weird improv film My Son). Plus, could Matthew Save the world if he grew to six size the times of the earth and cut off a slab of his bum like a big steak, to feed us all? Will someone make a game like Deep Rock Galactic, but for mining Matthew's celestial bum-meat? A whimsical episode this week indeed.

The studio recently released some images and gifs of Horizon Forbidden West running on a PlayStation 4 Pro and a neat “meet the cast” trailer. Today, it released new footage about the challenges within the expansive game world.

Aloy’s friend Petra says it’s essential for Aloy to check out every shop in the settlements she visits to ensure she has the best armor, weapons, and upgrades possible. She then suggests that Aloy visit the Melee Pits to learn new spear mechanics and hone her skills. 
After checking out the Melee Pits, Aloy can give the Hunting Grounds a go, where she’ll have to take down specific machines and more. If that’s not enough, Aloy can pick up Salvage Contracts to earn some extra currency. Of course, returning challenges include ruins, cauldrons, machine arenas, and more. 
The trailer even seems to imply machine races in Horizon Forbidden West. We’ll all learn more about these challenges when Horizon Forbidden West hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on February 18. 
While waiting for its release, read about these eight promising improvements coming to Horizon Forbidden West and then read about how Guerrilla Games is taking Aloy to new places in this sequel. Check out this breakdown of everything we know about Horizon Forbidden West after that.

The hyperbole of a generation, a distortion of edgy marketing either aped or mocked by today's advertising sophisticates. You get blisters from walking up hills, not video games. In the forensically sucky cyberpresent of 2022, there is no place for such exaggeration.

Last week, I noticed my hand was sore. I didn't think much of it, mostly because I wasn't sure why it would be hurting. On Monday, while playing OlliOlli World, I found my reason. I'm not sure there's a better way to recommend World than that; it pushed my hands to their limit. 
Compared to the previous two OlliOlli games, which could be prohibitively difficult, World is simultaneously an easy-to-approach 2D skateboarding game with an impossibly high skill ceiling.

Those tests were carried out on Ubuntu Linux (as usual) for that dual-core processor and was an interesting little processor for the price and for the lack of any AMD Zen 3 competition currently at that low price point. If needing to make daily use of such an Intel Celeron system, switching out your Linux distribution can help. In this article are benchmarks of the Celeron G6900 across Arch-based Manjaro, Intel's Clear Linux, Fedora Workstation 35, Ubuntu 22.04 daily, and openSUSE Tumbleweed.]]></summary>

Long has the internet wondered what developer Yacht Club Games would do to follow up the success of the indie darling Shovel Knight. We now know the answer is Mina the Hollower, a gorgeous homage to Zelda and Game Boy titles of old, and we're going hands-on with the title on today's edition of New Gameplay Today!
Join John Carson and Alex Stadnik as they fill you in on everything you need to know about Mina. We detail the non-spoiler parts of the story and dive into who our new mouse protagonist is and why she's collecting as many bones as she can in the process.
We also take a look at the game's new mechanics. Don't worry Shovel Knight fans. There is still plenty of digging to be had as Mina burrows her way through this gorgeous pixel art world. She'll also be using Castlevania-inspired weapons such as a whip and throwing axes to slay her bone-clenching foes. She'll need every last weapon she can get her hands on, too, as Yacht Club also is upping the difficulty. Whether it's the aforementioned dastardly foes or the perilous puzzles, players will assuredly have their hands full when Mina the Hollower drops in late 2023.

Do you want to see more from the game? You're in luck. On top of this episode of New Gameplay Today, we're also showing off the game commentary free in our full playthrough of the provided demo. We know you'll miss our beautiful dulcet tones, but this way, you'll get to fully take in the beautiful GameBoy-inspired art, the bumping soundtrack, and the intense combat and puzzle sections!
Thanks as always for watching. If you enjoy previews of some of the biggest games from 2022 and beyond, be sure to subscribe to our YouTube page for every new episode of New Gameplay Today. Recently, we've gotten to go hands-on with Gran Turismo 7, Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, and Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel.]]></summary>

After years of building out the world and characters of Shovel Knight through expansions and side adventures, developer Yacht Club Games is finally ready to create something unrelated to the dirt-digging hero. The studio is taking to Kickstarter once again to fund its newest project Mina the Hollower, which features a mousey protagonist with a familiar penchant for moving soil. I’ve spent quite a bit of time hands-on with the game’s demo, and while it’s a very early vertical slice, my first adventure with Mina offered a difficult yet promising look into what the final game may have in store.
Like Shovel Knight’s 8-bit homages to games like Mega Man, Yacht Club wears its inspirations proudly on its sleeve. With a top-down camera…]]></summary>

Not only does it showcase some of the bleeding-edge graphics the Gran Turismo series is known for, but it reveals that GT7 is much more than just a racing game. 
Of course, it is absolutely still a racing game first and foremost but if competitive racing isn't your jam, GT7 seems jam-packed with other things for you to do and enjoy.
"Over its 25-year history, the Gran Turismo series has demonstrated a serious love and respect for cars," GT7 producer Kazunori Yamauchi said at the top of the showcase. "What's more, Gran Turismo 7 represents the 25th anniversary of the series. Gran Turismo 7 will represent the pinnac…]]></summary>

The DNA of Sport, which was mostly focused on competitive multiplayer, seems to be present in GT7, but after previewing the game, it’s clear that this sequel offers so much more. 
And that’s exciting for someone like me who has never really made it beyond a few hours into a Gran Turismo game. I went into this preview looking for reasons to be excited for Polyphony Digital’s latest love letter to cars and came away with enough to feel like GT7 is worth checking out.

Additionally, the YouTube video’s description reveals Ghostwire: Tokyo’s release date of March 25. It also reveals pre-order bonuses and a Deluxe Edition, which grants early access to the game three days early (for digital purchases only). The following bonus items are Shinobi Outfit, Kunai Weapon, and Streetwear Fashion Pack.

In addition to releasing on PlayStation 5 as a timed exclusive, Ghostwire: Tokyo is also launching on PC. The first-person action title puts you in the shoes of Akito, one of the few remaining humans in Tokyo after the population vanishes and paranormal entities take over. Akito joins forces with a spirit named KK, granting him otherworldly abilities of his own to take down these spirits. Ghostwire: Tokyo was first unveiled during Bethesda’s 2019 E3 showcase and was initially slated to release in 2021 before being delayed. 
We’re excited to get a new look at the game tomorrow and pleased that its release isn’t that far off. In the meantime, be sure to check out our career profile on Ghostwire: Tokyo’s bubbly former creative director Ikumi Nakamura.]]></summary>

The 2K team spends much of the video emphasizing the game’s increased accessibility thanks to a more simplified control scheme that makes 2K22 easier for newcomers to grasp.

The company released its quarterly results today and it revealed that 17.3 million PS5s have been shipped so far, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz. At this same point in its lifetime, the PS4 had shipped 20.2 million units, representing a lag in shipped numbers for the PS5.

        <updated>2022-02-02T17:47:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony released its quarterly financial results yesterday and in it, CFO Hiroki Totoki revealed that PlayStation plans to launch 10 live service games by March 2026. 
This isn’t surprising, considering the company essentially just invested $3.6 billion in developing live service games by acquiring Bungie earlier this week. However, 10 games is a lot. Ten live service games in four years is very ambitious, but it seems Sony and PlayStation are going to rely on Bungie’s expertise in the genre a lot, not to mention, Bungie has its own original IP in the works too.
“The strategic significance of this acquisition lies not only in obtaining the highly successful Destiny franchise, as well as major new IP Bungie is currently developing, but also incorporating into the Sony group the expertise and technologies Bungie has developed in the live game services space,” Totoki said, as reported by The Verge. “Through close collaboration between Bungie and PlayStation Studios we aim to launch more than 10 live service games by the fiscal year ending March 2026.” 
With all this talk of live service and multiplayer games in light of Sony acquiring Bungie, you might be wondering if PlayStation is shifting away from its focus on single-player, story-driven games. Considering Sony’s first-party studios known for those kinds of games are still around, you’ll likely still be seeing single-player games from PlayStation. With the acquisition of Bungie, it just seems that Sony is using some of its newer studios and expertise to get studios pumping out new live service games. 
In the meantime, catch up on Sony’s acquisition of Bungie and then check out Game Informer’s reactions to that news. Read Game Informer’s Destiny 2: The Witch Queen preview after that.

This is pretty straight down the middle as far as Gen 4 SSDs go: the 1TB model I’ve tested claims sequential speeds up to 5150MB/s for reads and 4900MB/s for writes, enough to embarrass any PCIe 3.0 SSD without veering into mega-enthusiast territory. There’s a broad range of capacities too, starting at 250GB and ending at a roomy 2TB.

        <updated>2022-02-02T16:59:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[343 Industries revealed last year, before the launch of Halo Infinite, that the game would not ship with campaign co-op or a Forge mode. Halo Infinite creative director Joseph Staten said around that time that an update regarding these two modes, and a seasonal roadmap for the shooter, would arrive in January, but that didn’t happen. 
Staten has now revealed that the planned Halo Infinite update on the game’s seasonal roadmap, co-op, and Forge has been delayed. The reason why is so that the team can have more time to share concrete plans.

“Hey folks,” Staten said in a tweet. “In November, I said we’d have a Halo Infinite update on our seasonal roadmap, co-op, and Forge in January. We need more time to finalize our plans so what we share is something you can rely on. This work is my top priority, and we’ll have an update as soon as we can.” 



Hey folks. In November, I said we'd have a #HaloInfinite update on our Seasonal roadmap, Co-Op, and Forge in January. We need more time to finalize our plans so what we share is something you can rely on. This work is my top priority, and we'll have an update as soon as we can.
February 1, 2022
As for when to expect this update, that’s anybody’s guess as Staten did not further elaborate. Fans noticed this update hadn’t happened when the calendar jumped from January to February but Staten let everyone know that a delay had happened on February 1. Here’s hoping the update comes soon because we can’t wait to jump back into Halo Infinite’s campaign with a co-op partner. 
If you’re waiting for that too, read Game Informer’s Halo Infinite review in the meantime and then read about how Halo Infinite was the series’ biggest launch ever. Check out the changes to the economy of Halo Infinite’s multiplayer store after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gardens is a new studio revealed today made up of former Skyrim, Journey, and Marvel’s Spider-Man developers that is designed to be remote-first, prioritizing studio transparency, sustainability, and empowerment amongst employees. 
The co-founders are Chris Bell (Journey, What Remains of Edith Finch, Sky: Children of the Light), Lexie Dostal (Dustforce), and Stephen Bell (Blaseball, What Remains of Edith Finch), but Gardens is already home to developers who have worked on projects like Marvel’s Spider-Man, the Ratchet & Clank series, the Fallout series, and more.

Their mod, the Resident Evil 4 HD Project, is out now, and I think it's the most impressive remaster mod ever made. In replacing the game's textures and models with high-def versions, they've tried hard to replicate both the form and the style, and even tracked down locations and objects Capcom had photographed to work into textures. Dead impressive.

Basically, the plan was to create NFTs based on its popular Worms license with the help of NFT maker, Reality Gaming Group. Team17 billed these NFTs as environmentally friendly because they were a “side chain” of Ethereum and produced using RGG’s carbon neutral servers. Team17 even had plans to donate a portion of the revenue earned from NFT sales to global sustainability firm Coins 4 Planet and its Refeed Farms initiative, which promotes using worm beds as a cleaner method to process waste. The NFTs themselves were, of course, just various images of Worms characters, which you can see in the header up top.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yacht Club Games, creators of Shovel Knight have announced it's working on a new IP called Mina the Hollower, and like her platforming predecessor, Mina looks to build upon some classic inspirations. 
Unveiled during a presentation on G4 this afternoon called Yacht Club Games Presents, Mina the Hollower is a new title that shares elements of The Legend of Zelda and Castlevania. Not straying far from Shovel Knight's retro aesthetics, Mina looks like it was ripped from the Game Boy Color era. As Mina, you'll be whipping enemies, burrowing into the ground, and equipping various sidearms and trinkets to survive and save a cursed island full of deadly baddies and bosses.
Like Shovel Knight before it, Yacht Club Games is starting a Kickstarter campaign for Mina, but don't worry; the studio is fronting most of the funds to make the project a reality. In the press release provided to Game Informer, Director Alec Faulkner spoke about why the Kickstarter is being utilized again, saying, “We want your feedback, collaboration, and support in making Mina the Hollower the best game it can possibly be." Alec continues, "Though we’re financing a majority of this project ourselves, we hope we can create a more expansive game this way. More importantly, we want to build a community around Kickstarter, much like we did with Shovel Knight. We also want to share our development process, more than ever before!”
To sweeten the deal for backers, Yacht Club is partnering with Fangamer to create physical rewards such as "a physical soundtrack, enamel pins, an art book, and an adorable plush."
No release date has been given for Mina the Hollower, but we hope to be whipping and digging soon. For more info on the Kickstarter and its backer rewards and goals, head over to the Mina the Hollower project page. Yacht Club still has some Shovel Knight projects in the works, with Shovel Knight Dig on the horizon and updates to Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon coming soon.]]></summary>

Life is Strange: Before the Storm was also a hit, but not so much a surprise because after the original game, we all knew what DontNod and the Before the Storm team, Deck Nine, were capable of. 
Since the 2015 release of Life is Strange, we’ve received two mainline sequels in Life Is Strange 2 and Life is Strange: True Colors. The storylines have become even more branching and naturally, the visuals and performance of the series have improved. Now, those improvements have made their way back to the first two Life is Strange games and both are playable today in the Life is Strange: Remastered Collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Pokémon Legends: Arceus hitting Switch last week, and reviewing quite well here at Game Informer, you might be feeling the Pokémon bug. What better way to address it than by adding some new Pop! figures to your Pokédex, err, collection. 
Pop! is well known for its lineup of figures for basically everything and it’s Pokémon collection has been quite popular so it’s no surprise that the company is releasing more. Pop! announced today that three new figures are available for pre-order and if you’re a fan of psychic, fairy, or fighting types, these might be for you.

As you can see in the slideshow above, which features a look at each figure and the box it comes in, the newest Pokémon Pop! offerings are Lucario, Sylveon, and Alakazam. All three are available for preorder and will cost you roughly $12. They'll be released on March 15 so you won’t have to wait too much longer if you preorder. Plus, it gives you enough time to evolve your favorite Eevee in Pokémon Legends: Arceus into a Sylveon. 
While waiting for your Lucario, Sylveon, or Alakazam (or all three) to arrive, check out these Pokémon Pop! figures revealed last September. After that, check out our thoughts on Pokémon Legends: Arceus and then read Game Informer’s Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl review. 
Are you interested in any of these new Pop! figures? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Every time they announce the next port in development, the howls of Bloodborne fans can be heard across the internet. When will From Software's gothic slasher make the move to our superior home computers?

I've no answer for you, but fan-made demake Bloodborne PSX should tide you over for a little while. It's Bloodborne as if made for 32-bit consoles, four hours long, and features the original game's first two bosses. It's out now.

Seriously, I own some geeky merch to demonstrate my love for this series; up to and including, yes, the official Life Is Strange deck of playing cards. In other words, I am exactly the sort of fan the Life Is Strange: Remastered Collection is geared towards; so you may be surprised when I say that I'm not planning on picking it up anytime soon.
I'll be honest, I've been wary of the remasters of the first Life Is Strange title and its prequel Before The Storm ever since the first stills were released. "Look how much emotion their faces show now!" was the boast, splashed across side-by-side images of Rachel frowning in the original vs Rachel smiling in the remaster, Chloe frowning in the original vs Chloe smiling in the remaster, Max smiling slightly in the original vs Max grinning widely in the remaster... perhaps you begin to see my issue.

Hear that? It's Sony buying Bungie. It's Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard. It's Tencent accidentally dropping £365 billion down a grate as they stroll down the street and unknowingly buy the Earth's crust. They were on the phone to me at the time, putting an offer on my flat. I am tired of these big companies buying everything. Can we just slow down for a hot second and chill out a bit, please?

For every aspect of worldbuilding that I enjoyed, there was a bug that had to be overlooked. For every character that I found charming, there was some voiceover that was jarring. For every area that was absolutely gorgeous there was a part of the script that made me extremely grateful for having editors on all my writing. Over and over, I found these flaws didn’t stop me from enjoying the core that I could see underneath. At least, until the game (as far as I can tell) bugged so badly that I literally couldn’t continue.

I am usually catastrophically bad at these games, as I lack the sheer nerve to commit all my assets to something at once, or take out loans to cover a product run, even in a fictional digital setting. Still, I was drawn to Startup Panic like a moth to a flame, and giggled to myself at the prospect of cosplaying as a Silicon Valley nerd trying to reinvent having a chicken coop. I called my founder Beth, and the company was therefore Betherium. But it turned out that the product I was tasked with making and selling was, basically, Facebook.

Just as Shepherd was reborn for Mass Effect 2, Powers rises again in the new video retelling BioWare's sci-fi RPG sequel with England's greatest secret agent. It remains funny and silly and an unexpectedly good fit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just when you thought all the big movers and shakers had done their multi-billion dollar acquisition deals for the year, Sony have just announced they're buying Bungie for $3.6 billion. A small sum, perhaps, in the face of the $69 billion Microsoft are currently shelling out for Activision Blizzard, but rather than simply subsuming the Destiny developer into the PlayStation mothership, president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment Jim Ryan has said that Bungie will "remain an independent and multi-platform studio and publisher." Well!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following Code Force's recent demonstration, I was optimistic about the upcoming space 4X/simulation/strategy/forward slash game Distant Worlds 2. The original was a game I very nearly adored, but playing it always meant being a little too frustrated to talk about it without complaining a lot (which, granted, I do about everything, but still).
Code Force have since sent us a preview build, and I've been consumed with it for the better part of a week. I'm struggling to gauge exactly how much to reserve, because it's had me positively cackling at my minor successes and howling in enjoyable despair at my setbacks. If they can do, ooh, two thirds of what I'm hoping in the six weeks before its release on March 10th, this could be every bit as brilliant as its predecessor, with fewer flaws.

It's codenamed Project Golden Nekker and... that's about all we know for know. It's not another 'Witcher Tales' like the previous singleplayer Gwent game, like Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales, and it is confirmed to have at least two (2) monsters. Possibly three (3) if you consider that man is the real monster. Or four (4) if you hate libraries.

Good news, then, for frequent flyers who happen to own an Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics card: Flight Sim is getting DLSS support this year.


Specifically, DLSS will be available when running the sim in DirectX 12, as part of a handful of upcoming DX12 enhancements that also include optimisations for playing on multiple monitors. Developers Asobo Studio confirmed the DLSS addition in a recent devstream, which you can watch in full below, though the feature is still being tested so there’s no specific date beyond 2022.

In celebration, both the director of the original JRPG and the creative director of the recent FF7 Remake have posted messages looking back and forward. Along with several FF7 mobile games kicking about, they tease that more new FF7 things we don't know about are coming. Hopefully this means we'll hear more about efforts to complete the remake, but I guess they could also be talking about merch or new movies.

The electronic twinkle of health-restoring chicken, which sounds uncannily like the shield’s up sound from 1999 classic 3D Astro Blaster. The ‘boo boo de boo, boo boo de boop’ of the chest-opening jingle, to which my shoulders cannot help but shimmy. Best of all: the plink of picking up an XP-granting gem - at first a sporadic treat, soon a near constant hum as the tide of enemies grows from a trickle into a flood. 
Vampire Survivors is a simple, early access, arcade-style game about dodging an ever-growing horde of monsters while acquiring spells that fire automatically. You can (and should) play it with one hand while eating a bag of crisps. It’s a very good way to spend £2.

And not just with the expectation of being good GPUs, but with the hope that they can fix one of the biggest vexations in PC gaming: a years-long component shortage that’s made all of the best graphics cards nearly impossible to buy at fair prices.


Intel graphics chief Raja Koduri is at least well aware of the pressure, tweeting that the company is “working hard to find a path towards the mission - getting millions of Arc GPUs into the hands of PC gamers every year.” Koduri was responding to an open letter from our friends at PC Gamer, calling on Intel to finally toss an escape rope down the hardware hellmouth we’ve all found ourselves trapped in. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger also responded, claiming “We’re on it.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This weekend I am looping the Assault On Precinct 13 theme to build the plodding determination I will need to survive the impending NFT bonanza. I do take some comfort in the fact that NFTs are so unpopular that Riot had scramble to cover after accidentally suggesting a Valorant character liked NFTs. And I especially enjoyed Yanis Varoufakis explaining why the metacryptofungiverse sucks. But more and more companies are talking about NFTs and things will get worse, and I'll need the energy I can only get from Precinct 13 (and the amazing unused Jimmy Chambers song based on it).
But the terrible future can wait, what are you playing this weekend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Through an entirely unplanned sequence of events, I'm currently playing two big action adventure games that couldn't be less alike. One is God Of War, a big, serious dadventure epic about an emotionally distant father trying his darnedest to connect with his (at times very irritating) son. The other is Kena: Bridge Of Spirits, an altogether more wholesome adventure about a young girl cleansing a lush, forested mountainside from a serious case of bad vibes and helping lost ghosts pass on to the other side. 
About the only thing they have in common is that they both have what one might call 'cute' NPC companions. Dad Of War is joined by his eager archer "BOY!" Atreus, while Kena has her gaggle of black, fluffy Rot friends (above, right). According to the widely accepted law of big googly-eyes, I should find the Rot absolutely adorable and thus beyond reproach. Atreus does not have big googly-eyes (they are merely wide and naive), but he is certainly a lot cuter than God Of War's other main companion, a talking disembodied head. And yet. Even though Atreus has now reached that stage where he's doing all his adolescent whining and rebellion and "I know you are, but what am I?" nonsense in the space of about two hours, I would much rather have this sulky pre-teen by my side than the interminable Rot. Let me explain.

I'm pretty bad at them as well, which doesn't help. Mostly though, I became jaded and curmudgeonly at around nine years old, and will never know such naive wonder again.
Still, Hyper Echelon is fun.

It's a statement I have only briefly put to the test during a rushed weeked in San Antonio, a trip I mostly remember for 1) seeing a roadside billboard that advertised Jesus on one side and massive tits on the other, and 2) making a joke about having a puffy taco "so I guess I should see a doctor!" [finger guns] that fell bone-chillingly flat to a dinner table of American business colleagues.
You know where everything actually is bigger? The past. Join us on this special supporter-funded bonus podcast episode where Nate is our gentle and enthusiastic guide for really massive historical monsters. A giant owl? Bigfoot is really an orangutan? A huge fish that might in fact just be well big, owing to a mistake with its skeleton? Yes, we have all these delights and more. A big thank you to our supporters for making The Nate Files happen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anecdotally, the first records of modern golf date back to its banning in 15th century Scotland. “Nay Golf,” said parliament. “It’s turning the soldiers into fiendish, turf-snorting club-strokers who’d rather say shit like ‘Triple Bogey’ than batter the English, and we’re no having it.” RPGolf Legends is not set in 15th century Scotland, but it does take place in a world where golf has been banned. Only you - through the power of bare-bones ARPG combat and a fun but limited golf mini-game - can save the noble sport from ostensible nonexistence. 
I say ostensible because, in reality, golf is everywhere. Our heroine Aerin’s hometown is called Mulligandale. It has two shops, one of them dedicated entirely to golf. Folk shimmy about in golfwear, talking about golf. Many give out golf-related quests, the rewards for which are usually some form of golfing paraphernalia, often golf balls. The actual golf courses themselves have been sealed off by an ill-defined big villainous, but if you put a translucent barrier around the thing you’re trying to crush and still let the people you’re attempting to terrorise build their entire society as a monument to it, you’re basically asking for a plucky hero to restore the national passtime to glory. Highly questionable bit of villainy, this.

        <link href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-kids-we-were-review"/>
        <updated>2022-01-28T10:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the mists of time of 2013, a bunch of Japanese developers got together to make a series of short 3DS games called the Guild series. Headed up by Ni No Kuni makers Level-5, it had some pretty big-name contributors: Keiji Inafune, Goichi Suda, Yoot Saito and Yasumi Matsuno among others. But there was one game that stood out to me as something really quite special. It was the considerably less well-known Millennium Kitchen's Attack Of The Friday Monsters, a sweet slice of life adventure that saw you play as ten-year-old Sohta walking the streets of his small Tokyo suburb on a hazy summer afternoon in 1971. It was a tender celebration of childhood nostalgia and imagination, with just an inkling of some menacing undertones, both from the people Sohta meets in his neighbourhood and the titular Friday kaiju monsters that may or may not exist in the real world. 
I mention all this because The Kids We Were is probably the only game I've played since then that's even come close to capturing some of that Attack Of The Friday Monsters magic. You won't find any kaiju here, but this is a similarly nostalgic portrait of pastoral Tokyo, as viewed through the eyes of young Minato on his summer holidays, first in the present day and then in the 1980s when he ends up travelling back in time Back To The Future-style to when his parents first met as kids. With three days to right past wrongs, this is one of those gentle, coming of age tales that leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy in all the right places, even when there's no real 'game' to speak of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest DLC for Prison Architect was both announced and released yesterday. It's called Perfect Storm and it adds 'Calamities' to the game - disasters which can befall your prison that you need to build contingencies for and overcome. That includes weather such as lightning storms, heatwaves and snow storms, but also rat infestations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hitman 3 had a rough launch on Steam last week, quickly gathering 50% negative user reviews. Many of the complaints related to price and confusion over the various editions on sale.
To make amends, Io Interactive are giving anyone who buys Hitman 3 on Steam before February 19th a free upgrade. If you buy the standard edition (£50/$60), you'll be bumped up to the Deluxe Edition (£75/$90). If you bought the Deluxe Edition, you'll get a free upgrade to the Seven Deadly Sins Collection (which on its own costs £23.73 with its 15% launch discount).

Maybe if we turn away and pretend they're not there, it'll all burn out when scammers grow tired of being scammed by other scammers. However, one of the few people I do want to hear talk about it all is Yanis Varoufakis, who was Valve's in-house economist before becoming Greece's finance minister then an MP. In a wonderfully long new interview, he is not impressed by much of the hype, and it is DELIGHTFUL.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Be honest with me: when you read the words "Lovecraftian dating sim", did your mind go straight to a joke about tentacle porn? Horror-themed dating sims are not exactly new, but it's rare to be given the opportunity to date the eldritch gods themselves, and taken at face value, it's hard to imagine where else this could be going.
Well, allow me to dispel your illusions right away: Sucker For Love: First Date is not an H-game. It is, in fact, the most chaste dating sim I think I've ever played, while also managing to be the most obscenely graphic. You often hear games that straddle different genres accused of not knowing what they're trying to be. Sucker For Love does not suffer from this issue: it knows exactly what it wants to be. The challenge is for you, the hapless player, to keep the hell up.

So lets talk about them today!
In other news this week, Nate thinks he has come up with an original premise for a Pixar film, only to discover he has invented Seth Rogan's nightmare film Sausage Party, and we are officially starting our campaign to get Henry 'Vitamin H' Cavill on the show. We will be mentioning him every week from now on. Plus: what we like doing on our birthdays, school plays, and pro-wrestling adaptations of Dickens.

The sleek wooden objects careen through the air in a perfect circle - in theory, at least - before returning right back to where they began in the palm of your hand. They’re something that fascinated me as a child, and 20-something years later I still don’t really know how or why they work.


Deflector is like someone taped two swords to a boomerang, Mad Max-style. How does the boomerang still operate with twin blades slashing back and forth on either end? Don’t know. How does it always circle its way back to where you’re standing after dashing around an arena filled with enemies? Not a clue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard have declined to voluntarily recognise the union forming at Raven Software's QA department, forcing workers to take the long approach. The group calling themselves the Game Workers Alliance will now have to hit up the National Labor Relations Board and run elections, but say they're still confident about unionising because, y'know, they have the support of a supermajority. "Once again, when management is given a choice, they always seem to take the low road," the group said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although announcing three games at once feels a bit much, I'm really happy about the Respawn feat. Star Wars news. Respawn Entertainment always felt like one of those development studios that should have been shut down by a bigger studio circa 2015 because the people loved Titanfall but it wasn't, you know, Call Of Duty or anything. I turned my back for what seemed like but a moment, and suddenly Apex Legends exists and Respawn are one of the key players under EA, growing stronger from within. One day we'll be watching Andrew Wilson at an E3 showcase and realise it's actually Vince Zampella's eyes looking out at us. Everyone coming on stage to present is just Vince Zampella doing a voice and wearing a different baseball cap.
Point is, I'm mostly just pleased that Respawn are still around to make games featuring robots that surprise and delight us. And if they're not allowed to do Titanfall 3, Star Wars is at least a rich field to till said robots. Lousy with robots, is Star Wars. But honestly, if anyone is going to make Star Wars games (apart from BioWare, who have spent recent years making Dragon Age 4 and / or collapsing like a magnificent neutron star) then I'd root for Respawn. They may not make the Star Wars games you think you want, but they'll make the ones you need right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire Survivors is an action RPG boiled down to its core. You walk around, you kill monsters, you level up, you get stronger, you kill more monsters. In place of story, an inventory, or even the need to fire and aim your own weapons, there is pixel art spectacle. 

On my last life, I killed around 24,000 monsters in 30 minutes. I am hooked.

        <updated>2022-01-25T15:59:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was cause for joy and concern alike when Intel revealed the Core i5-12400F, alongside loads of other new 12th gen Alder Lake CPUs. Here was a much more affordable, still gaming focused-alternative to the Core i5-12600K, yet it would lack the signature hybrid of fast Performance cores and flexible Efficiency cores that made that chip one of the best gaming CPUs ever made. 


Turns out, the concern was for naught: the Core i5-12400F is a cracking slice of silicon, both for the money and for games specifically. Although the sole reliance on Performance cores (or P-cores) puts it behind the Core i5-12600K for desktop multitasking, if it’s just the frames per second you’re after, this cheaper chip can match and sometimes even surpass its big brother.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firework actually came out almost exactly a year ago, but the English language version (translated from the original Chinese) was released just before Christmas. Which is a good thing, because Firework is well worth checking out if you have an interest in either horror games or puzzle games. The horror isn't blood-chilling, but rather twisted up with grief and sorrow in how inevitable it is. Similarly, the puzzles aren't going to stump you for long, but they fit very well with the story. These two strands of the game weave together and create a nice, thoughtful experience that's worth the four or so hours of having it.
