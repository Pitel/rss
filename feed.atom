Voice overs are still relatively new in the Zelda series, and now the latest trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has revealed Ganondorf's return.
If you are wondering who is behind the voice, it's Matthew Mercer - known as Cole Cassidy (McCree) in the Overwatch series, Leon S. Kennedy in Resident Evil 6 and more recently as Chrom in Fire Emblem Engage. He's also worked on a lot of anime from Attack on Titan, One Piece to Hunter x Hunter.

We've just been bombarded with all sorts of new information about The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and if this wasn't already enough, a leaked TV advertisement for the upcoming release has now leaked online. It's surfaced on the Zelda subreddit and it's unclear exactly where it came from, but Nintendo likely won't be happy.
The title describes it as a "slightly unfinished version" of the American live-action television spot. In it, you can see Link assembling a vehicle, taking on a spoiler... three-headed "Flame Gleeok" (seemingly confirming some previous rumours), and lighting up a darkened area with some rather unique arrows.

It’s not even a slow news day, but someone needs to talk about the rampant shirtlessness that’s going on in Hyrule these days. If someone is even wearing a shirt, it’s very likely that it is only half a shirt. Zelda has long been the series of choice for people who leave the camera lingering on a character’s physique for an inappropriate amount of time, ever since the Great Fairy popped out of Ocarina of Time. This kind of discourse is important, regardless of whether or not it will be forgotten about in a week’s time.
I have carefully analyzed the latest trailer for Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and through painstaking research and self-reflection, I have deduced the scientifically hottest hotties featured in the trailer.

Today's Final Fantasy XVI State of Play was centered completely on the upcoming RPG. It was easily the most extensive look we've had yet, showcasing everything from combat and bosses to RPG systems.
Final Fantasy XVI follows Clive, the protagonist, through three different parts of his life. Part of it shows him as a young teen, then again in his 20s, and later in his 30s. The warrior finds himself set on a quest for revenge across the world of Valisthea, dealing with the politics and powers of the supernatural Eikons and massive crystals along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s PlayStation State of Play was devoted entirely to showcasing new footage and information for Final Fantasy XVI, giving fans a guided tour of its action, exploration, characters, and more.


The presentation showed off a hefty amount of the flashy action RPG combat we recently got to sample in a recent hands-on demo. Though the story begins by following protagonist Clive in his 20s, the plot will also explore periods of his teen years and 30s. We got a look at the world map, various accessibility rings, and the combat prowess of Clive’s faithful wolf companion, Torval. 
We also looked at Cid’s hideaway, a large headquarters that opens up later in the game where you can craft gear, buy items at a store, check quests, interact with allies, and practice abilities in a special training room. Despite showing off so much, teases that Square Enix still has plenty to share in the future regarding story quests, side quests, and endgame content. 
Final Fantasy XVI launches on June 22 for PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by reading our recent features breaking down the game's Eikon combat, Arcade Mode, and interviews with the developers who discuss the game's balance of multiple gameplay styles, its return to high-fantasy, and the series' abandonment of turn-based action.]]></summary>

A leaked project from an internal Microsoft hackathon shows that staff at the operating system developer have noticed these issues - although it sounds like a version of Windows optimised for gaming handhelds is a long way off.

Warner Bros. Games and Rocksteady have officially moved the Suicide Squad into 2024. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has been delayed to February 2, 2024.
A report from Bloomberg in March said that Warner Bros. was looking at moving Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League from its May date out to sometime later this year. Today's news pushes it even further out, roughly nine months away.
"We have made the tough but necessary decision to take the time needed to work on getting the game to be the best quality experience for players," reads today's statement on social media. "Thank you to our amazing community for the continued support, patience and understanding. There is much more to share in the months ahead and we looked forward to seeing you in Metropolis next year."

The Justice League lives, for now
Rocksteady's four-player co-op action game has been in development for some time, and already experienced some delays. Major shifts like this are not too uncommon, but the suddenness, combined with previous delays, makes Suicide Squad's case a bit stranger.
We had also just seen a significant chunk of this game at a recent Sony State of Play. The full co-op gameplay showcase didn't get everyone on-board with the direction though, and growing concern over a live service-focused structure took root.
So, now, Rocksteady's co-op Suicide Squad game is pushing the launch time back further. With an actual date set, that's at least something. But even the concept of February 2024 seems so distant right now, I've got to wonder what sentiment will be like when Warner Bros. and Rocksteady resurface later on.
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is now launching on February 2, 2024 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League has been delayed to next year following recent rumors that it wasn't going to make its May 26 release date. 
The superhero co-op shooter will now launch on February 2, 2024. Developer Rocksteady posted a short message on Twitter stating it wants to “take the time needed” to ensure the best possible experience. Check it out below.
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League puts players in the shoes of Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and King Shark as they fight to rescue Metropolis from an invasion by Brainiac. The villain has hijacked the minds of the Justice League, meaning the Squad has to take down Earth's greatest protectors to save the day. The game has received a hefty dose of fan vitriol since its last gameplay demonstration in February confirmed an always-online requirement as well as live service elements, such as a cosmetics-only battle pass. Other fans have found its cooperative loot-based shooting to be an uninspired fit for the property.
Although we don't know the specifics behind the delay, sources told Bloomberg in its original report last month that Rocksteady was only pushing the game to add polish and did not plan to overhaul the game’s existing framework. Even though a nearly-year-long delay is a lot of time, it's still very unlikely that it's enough for the team to make the sort of dramatic changes some fans are hoping for. We'll have to wait and see how Rocksteady spruces up the Suicide Squad and hope it results in a quality experience when the dust finally settles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Library of Congress announced its 2023 class of National Recording Registry inductees, and it includes a video game song for the first time. That big honor goes to the classic Super Mario Bros. theme.
Officially titled “Ground Theme,” it was composed by Nintendo’s Koji Kondo and first appeared in 1985’s Super Mario Bros in World 1-1. The song has since become the most well-known melody of the Mario franchise, not to mention one of the most recognizable music tracks in video games. Now, it will be forever preserved alongside some of pop culture's most famous and influential songs. 
“Having this music preserved alongside so many other classic songs is such a great honor,” said Kondo in a statement. “It's actually a little bit difficult to believe.”
Mario’s classic tune will be inducted alongside heavy hitters such as Madonna’s “Like a Virgin,” Jimmy Buffet’s “Margaritaville,” Queen Latifah’s “All Hail the Queen,” and Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas is You.” You can read the full list of inductees at the Libary of Congress’ website. 
This is quite an achievement for Nintendo and especially Kondo, who has lent his talents to numerous other Nintendo soundtracks and also had a hand in composing the music for the very successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie. You can read our recent interview with Kondo and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto about the making of the film here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sing with me, sing for the year
Musical role-playing adventure Stray Gods is charting a course for launch. The vocal venture will kick off on August 3 for PC.
The debut game from Summerfall Studios, Stray Gods is a story about Grace, who gets caught up in the life and drama of Greek gods after she's made the prime suspect in the death of Calliope. In the process, she comes into some new powers, and will have the opportunity to discover the truth. Maybe she can even find some romance on the side?
This quest for truth, answers, and heavenly connections plays out in interactive musical form. Characters break out into song, and the player gets to make choices about the tone of Grace's responses, potentially shifting the overall tenor and direction of the song.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coQQ-K8Iwi8
The voice of the gods
It's a pretty fascinating system, with former Dragon Age writer David Gaider penning the script. And alongside an interesting premise and narrative framing, there's also a host of voice talent signed on. Here's a rundown of the voice actors working on Stray Gods:
Laura Bailey as Grace
Troy Baker as Apollo
Mary Elizabeth McGlynn as Persephone
Janina Gavankar as Freddie
Khary Payton as Pan
Abubakar Salim as Eros
Felicia Day as Athena
Rahul Kohli as Minotaur
Allegra Clark as Hecate
Merle Dandridge as Aphrodite
Erika Ishii as Hermes
Ashley Johnson as Calliope
Lauren "Lolo" Spencer as Venus
Anjali Bhimani as Medusa
Kimberly Brooks as Oracle
Anthony Rapp as Orpheus
Throw in Austin Wintory as composer, alongside musicians Scott Edgar, Steven Gates, Simon Hall of Tripod, and Jess Cerro (Montaigne), and it's a lot of talent.
Honestly, I am very curious to see how an interactive musical like this would shake out. These branching paths intrigue me, as does the Greek pantheon theming around a murder mystery. We'll see how Summerfall's debut Stray Gods comes together on August 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a long wait, Ubisoft+, the french publisher’s Netflix-like gaming subscription, has finally arrived on console by way of the Xbox One and Series X/S. But it comes at a hefty price. Rather than launch a new, cheaper tier, players will have to pay $18 for the existing premium multi-platform subscription.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After two hours of XDefiant, I came away with a rather different thought in my mind than I expected. More than anything, I was impressed at just how good we have it in the multiplayer FPS genre at the moment. Apex Legends, Warzone 2, Overwatch 2, Valorant, Rainbow Six Siege. That's some unbelievably tough competition. XDefiant has to either give players something completely different, or absolutely nail the basics. It's opted for the second path, and having played several matches against a medley of press people and content creators, I'm not convinced Ubisoft's new arena shooter is up to the challenge.

In a landscape where many major shooters have adopted the free-to-play model, it's extremely hard for a new IP to enter the ring. Titans like Fortnite and Apex Legends don't just have large, dedicated audiences—their respective development teams have spent years refining gameplay in response to player feedback. Competing in the space is an incredibly intimidating task, but amazingly, after playing two hours of Ubisoft's XDefiant, I'm optimistic that it might have what it takes.

Frictional Games has announced that a last-minute delay has affected its upcoming horror sequel Amnesia: The Bunker, which will no longer meet its May 16 release date — The first-person spooker will now launch on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms one week later on May 23.
"We’re pushing the release of Amnesia: The Bunker back by one week, and it will now be coming out on May 23 instead," noted the indie developer on Twitter. "This will give us a little more time to polish the game and make sure everything is perfect before launch. We appreciate your patience and hope you are looking forward to playing Amnesia: The Bunker. It will be worth the wait!"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6hfkkw6aKE&ab_channel=frictionalgames
The latest in the streamer-friendly horror series, Amnesia: The Bunker sees the player take up the role of a French soldier deep in the misery and isolation of World War I. Trapped in an abandoned bunker, the protagonist must pick their way through the darkness, solving puzzles and attempting to stay one step ahead of a mysterious and frightening force that lurks within the shadows and corridors of this living hellhole.
Amnesia: The Bunker hopes to bring new and unique mechanics to the franchise, including a sandbox approach to player choice, emergent gameplay, and constant alterations to the environment in order to provide variety and individuality to the player's experience. A grim story of survival, and the will to live in even the direst of circumstances, hopes to deliver the psychological horror that is the Amnesia trademark.
Amnesia: The Bunker launches May 23 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Despite its following and my love of city builders, I haven’t been paying much attention to Against the Storm. That changes today, as Hooded Horse has announced the latest update to Eremite Games’ Early Access settlement game.
The Sentinels of the Forest update expands Against the Storm with a new playable race of fox people (the fifth species in the game), as well as their faction-specific technologies. Apparently, the Foxes work with “rainwater-fueled technologies,” but most importantly, they make tea. There are both tea houses that can be built, as well as tea doctors, which heal people using the powers of tea.
Check out the new trailer below, courtesy of GameTrailers.
https://youtu.be/vPdCARWzUYE
I also use tea to cure all my ills. Specifically, if I feel tired in the morning (which is every morning), I usually drink two pots of tea and follow it up with a nap. That usually gets me the energy I need to make it to lunch.
Against the Storm is a city builder that has you build to survive torrents of corrupting rain. Rather than focus on a single settlement, you work to connect a network of them with previous towns assisting newly built ones. It bills itself as a roguelite, where certain portions of your progress are carried over to new games, and “hundreds” of gameplay modifiers ensure that no two playthroughs are the same.
Damn. I’m going to have to check this out.
Against the Storm is currently in Early Access on PC. There's a demo available if you're curious. If everything is on track, the full release should come in a few months. The Sentinels of the Forest update hits today.

If Warhammer 40,000 is too futuristic for you and you’ve wanted to dial it back a bit, Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun might be the game for you. Styling itself after late-‘90s shooters, Boltgun strips away distracting graphics and asks you to just shoot the crap out of everything in front of you. And now, we’ve got a date for it: May 23, 2023.
I know so very little about Warhammer 40,000. This 30-second trailer tells me absolutely nothing about the property, while at the same time telling me everything I need to know about the game. There’s jumping. There are people blowing up. And everything is pixelated.
https://youtu.be/DJzGLICnZrg
Honestly, I’ve played tons of Total War: Warhammer, which is sort of unrelated? Like, it's a different universe or something. However, you don’t really need much context for it. There are vampires, beastmen, and BDSM elves, and that’s all you need to know. Or, at least, that’s all I need to know.
Similarly, Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun has it all: rocket launchers, shotguns, and bloody messes. You play as a space person, and I may be an outlier here, but I really hope that they don’t make constant wisecracks. That part can stay in the ‘90s.
Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun is coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Switch on May 23, 2023.

In something we didn't think we'd be writing today, everyone thinks Ganondorf in the new The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom trailer is pretty smoking hot. VG247 brought this to our attention, and now it's our job to share this revelation with you.
If you haven't watched the final pre-launch trailer yet, then you might be a little bit confused. Before today, we've only seen the Demon King as a rather "unhydrated", bone-y looking being. But as of today, we've seen him in the flesh — literally.

Marvelous news for fantasy fans, as THQ Nordic has announced a new chapter in the beloved adventure series, Trine — Trine 5: A Clockwork Conspiracy is currently in the works at studio Frozenbyte, and is expected to launch this summer on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.
The new sequel will reunite heroes Amadeus the Wizard, Zoya the Thief, and Pontius the Knight, as the trio embarks upon a brand new quest that will see them take on the might of the fearsome Clockwork Army.

The trailer is suitably delightful, spotlighting a colorful and whimsical kingdom, cool-looking character abilities, and a typically spirited sense of adventure. With all of these new features on deck, it's looking like Trine 5 could prove to be a real treat for series fans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After debuting at £320, the Core i5 13600K has remained resolutely at that price thanks to limited supply and high demand. Now, the 13600K has seen its first major discount, dipping to around the £300 mark at Amazon UK. Meanwhile, the same CPU without integrated graphics, the 13600KF, is down to £281. 
These are solid deals for a great-performing 14-core, 20-thread CPUs that excel in gaming and content creation - especially given that you can pick up a motherboard that allows you to carry over the DDR4 memory in your existing build to keep costs down.

There were some of us who weren't quite sold on the game after the last 10-minute gameplay trailer, but this whistle-stop tour of what we can expect has gone a long way to get us on board. Firmly on board.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Companions, villagers, and the return of a king
Nintendo aired the final pre-launch trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom today, and it was quite a doozy. From more story context and mechanical teases to the confirmation of a longtime series villain, there's a lot to unpack.
While the general story set-up still feels a little unclear, we do know one thing for sure: Ganondorf is back. The king of the Gerudo appears a few times in today's trailer, and also seems to be speaking over the trailer at a few points. Zelda also looks to be lost, in some way; we catch a glimpse of Link failing to catch and save her, and then again, her calling for Link to come find her.
Even further, we see Hyrule alive in a pretty spectacular way. Not only are there towns popping up in the ruins of the land, but we see villagers fighting enemies, and companions teaming up with Link. Heck yes, Sidon and Link can fight together!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHGShqcAHlQ
The kingdom closes in
This is the third official trailer, and also the last one before The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launches next month. Compared to previous games, even its predecessor Breath of the Wild, it's felt like we haven't seen a ton about this entry. Then again, that's mostly been working, in my opinion.
The recent gameplay showcase did spotlight Link's new abilities, seemingly linked to his arm. Today's showcase went even further in though, showing all the wild ways in which they can be used. Cars and flying machines are one thing, but in the trailer today we see Link carting around villagers with a horse-drawn carriage and fighting a walking bokoblin fortress.
Add in a bunch of wild machinery and possible Zonai influence, and I feel like I've got even more questions now. All in all, a pretty solid video to pick apart in the last month leading up to Tears of the Kingdom's launch on May 12.

This week's Japanese charts are now in from Famitsu and it's yet another win for Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe which once again comes out on top this time around, selling 16,458 copies (thanks, Gematsu).
If you are thinking that this seems lower than previous weeks, you would be correct (the game had 21,014 sales last week), but with the absence of any new titles in the top ten, the chart is mostly undisturbed. The PS4 version of Resident Evil 4 beat its PS5 counterpart to second place this week and the rest of the table is a Nintendo-fest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At PAX West in Seattle last year, I had the pleasure of interviewing the voice cast of Team Fortress 2. I chatted to John Patrick Lowrie (The Sniper), Gary Schwartz (The Heavy, The Demoman), Robin Atkin Downes (The Medic) and Ellen McLain (The Administrator) about the game's fifteen year long legacy, the process of finding their character's voices as well as their favourite quotes. It was a riot of an interview and, to be honest, a bit of a career highlight. It also did really well on TikTok, which I have mixed feelings about.

Fifteen minutes after the gang left the grimy conference room in which the interview took place (I had immediately crawled onto the floor in an attempt to ease the anxiety from having conducted said interview), I got a Twitter notification. Robin had posted a video. Following our chat, the group had attempted to order a sandwich from a cafe in-character, leaving the staff completely bemused as a result. Understandably the video did numbers, and over the last six months, the gang have been releasing new episodes in what is now known as "The Sandvich Saga" on a regular basis.

While Pokemon Scarlet & Violet copies continue to fly off the shelves, we're getting a decent chunk of content rollouts in the form of seven-star raids. But Game Freak and The Pokemon Company also have an overwhelming amount of tiny promo events going on too, including this upcoming opportunity to get a new backpack style.
Announced on the official Japanese Pokemon site,  the powers that be are running a promo for the upcoming Pokémon Japan Championships 2023 (also known as PJCS2023). All you have to do is play three matches and be connected to Pokemon Home.
How to get the Scarlet & Violet Great Ball backpack
The entry period for the event is from April 13 at 9AM JST through April 21 at 8:59AM JST. From there, the event will kickoff directly after from April 21 at 9AM JST through April 24 at 8:59AM JST. Here is a full list of Pokemon that you're allowed to enter.
Note that this is a participation reward, so you can play three matches, win or lose, and still pick up the bonus. You'll also get 10,000 LP (League Points) for your efforts.
The code will actually be doled out through Pokemon Home, which you can then input in Scarlet & Violet via the Mystery Gift system. Yeah, that's not complicated at all! Maybe one day you can just get the reward directly in-game when participating in an online event instead of jumping through hoops.

The GeForce RTX 4070 launches with a heavier price tag than the RTX 3070, and doesn’t make the shin-splintering performance leap forward that its predecessor did, but between its high speeds, low power usage, and DLSS 3 advantage, it’s a potent upgrade regardless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Y can't Sims crawl?
Thanks to a reader, this lengthy thread of Sims 4 fun facts from Twitter user OnlyAbiDoang came across my desk and I couldn't look away. Even if you haven't played The Sims series yet you likely know someone who has: or at least experienced it by osmosis through some sort of weird factoid throughout the years. It's that ubiquitous. But I didn't realize just how wacky I could get.
https://twitter.com/onlyabidoang/status/1640039940640890880
Here are a few choice facts from the thread:
If you get struck by lightning in The Sims 4: Seasons you either die outright or you can wield the power of electricity like a superhero
You can spy on the Grim Reaper (yes, Death himself) using a listening bug and hear his conversations
Normally only child Sim characters can see elaborate imagination sequences playing out, but an adult with the childish trait can secretly view them too
You can complain about food poisoning and get compensation
The thread goes on for a long while, and it's great "weekend reading" material. It's essentially a series of Easter eggs and glitches/exploits, some of which yield some crazy results that are hilarious both in and out of context.
Every so often I dive back into The Sims and marvel at how well it's been supported over the years, and how many quality of life features have been implemented since launch. It doesn't hold my attention as much as a lot of other games, but it's a decent reminder of how great Maxis could be as a studio.

The extra time will be spent “to better incorporate community feedback,” by improving the balancing, meta-progression, and onboarding, and giving the roguelike a few more layers of polish.

The National Recording Preservation Board (NRPB) has announced that Koji Kondo's iconic Super Mario Bros. theme is to be inducted for preservation in the U.S. Library of Congress. The instantly recognizable ditty will be the first piece of video game music ever to join the NRPB's catalog of significant compositions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTa6Xbzfq1U&ab_channel=ultragamemusic
Each year, the NRPB selects 25 pieces of music that it deems "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant, and/or informs or reflects life in the United States". I like to think that the Super Mario Bros. Theme falls into the latter category. Kondo's simple but endlessly entering tune — officially known upon conception as simply "Ground Theme" made its debut in World 1-1 of 1985 NES release Super Mario Bros. It has since been remixed and used endless times for various Nintendo titles, TV shows, and commercials.
Joining Mario in the library this year will also be guitar shop nightmare "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin, Madonna's censor bothering "Like a Virgin", Eurythmics "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)", John Lennon's "Imagine" and, from the goddess of winter herself, Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas is You". For all you midwestern dads, Jimmy Buffet is getting representation via his 1977 hit "Margaritaville".
Sadly, there is no sign of my personal favorite Super Mario Bros. tune, "Take on Me" by a-ha.

Known as Hakoniwa Bokujou Hitsuji Mura in Japan, the Switch version launched in Japan last November, but we'll be getting it on Switch, PS4, and PC here in the west — the PC version is out on 28th April, even! A PS4 version will also be launching in Japan at the same time.

You want to know the one thing that it doesn't have yet, though? It hasn't been rearranged in a music maker minigame from a 13-year-old DS title. Oh wait, yep. It now has that too.

Alongside concerns that the system introduces a single "point of failure" that could undermine the security of national networks, ISPs believe they could be held liable when over-blocking enters the equation. More generally, consumers could end up paying for blocking, rather than the rightsholders set to benefit from it.

Hosting the whole show will be Lil Wayne. It's an interesting pick, for sure. But it's not exactly the first time the artist has crossed over with Street Fighter, either.

Interestingly, the studio's science fiction vision appears to borrow heavily from H.G. Wells.

In a commitment to ensure I never sleep, Game Freak has already announced the next 7-Star raid challenge in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. From April 14 to April 16, Typhlosion will be available as the next Pokemon with the Mightiest Mark title. If you can’t log in this weekend, it will rerun the following weekend from April 21 to April 23.
We know Typhlosion will have the Ghost Tera Type, which is a fun reference to Hisuian Typhlosion from Pokemon Legends: Arceus. However, like many previous raids, Typhlosion is difficult to prepare for. At first glance, Dark-Type Pokemon should be the best counter to a Ghost-Type Pokemon. However, if Typhlosion knows a Fighting-Type move, most Dark-Type monsters suddenly become a liability. Considering how long it takes to fu…]]></summary>

Video rentals are one of those things that I fully accept is antiquated by modern technology, something that I absolutely would not be interested in a return of, but I still can’t help but miss. It’s hard to explain, and I’m not entirely sure I have a full handle on it.
The video store aesthetic was enough to get me interested in Rewind or Die. The “Night Shift” prologue was one of the highlights of 2022’s Stay Out of the House, so I was hoping for something similar. What we got was something different, but different can be good too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is not a mystery game after all
Following a recent interview with Team Ninja lead Fumihiko Yasuda, reports swirled that the studio had another game in the works, set to arrive before 2024's Rise of the Ronin. But Koei Tecmo confirms those rumors aren't accurate to Team Ninja's plans.
Speaking to Famitsu, Yasuda discussed Team Ninja's upcoming docket of games. The previously announced Rise of the Ronin is set for 2024. Yasuda also expresses a desire to release something new in 2025. The confusion arises around a certain phrasing, though.
"'Rise of the Ronin' has been under development for about 7 years and is scheduled to be released in 2024," Yasuda said. "This work will be released in 2023, and I feel like I want to release a new title in 2025."
Famitsu's interview was published online on March 11, after the release of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty earlier this year. This, alongside mention that the game in question was in development, led to speculation and reports that Team Ninja has another game planned for 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlmdeQFyqC0
Koei Tecmo clarifies
As noted in Famitsu's article, though, this interview was conducted on February 14, 2023, prior to the launch of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty. And the interview itself is about Wo Long, too.
We reached out to Team Ninja parent company Koei Tecmo to clarify, and a spokesperson confirmed that "this work" refers to Wo Long. The spokesperson also confirms their 2023 game is Wo Long, and Team Ninja does not have another full game planned for 2023.
Which, considering Wo Long still has a season pass' worth of content on the way alongside Rise of the Ronin and thoughts of a 2025 game, is probably a good thing. Team Ninja has had a steady cadence over the last few years.
Meanwhile, Wo Long does sound like it's a pretty rad. That's out now, with added content on the way for the rest of this year.

Retro publisher Sunsoft, the studio behind 16-bit franchises such as Aero the Acro-Bat and Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel, has announced that it intends to hold its second "Sunsoft is BACK" live stream next week, featuring more information on the resurrected publisher's upcoming releases.
Sunsoft's first comeback stream, which was held in August of last year, saw the dormant studio announce a selection of new titles for the Japanese market, including the revival of '80s strategy series Ikki Unite, a remaster of 1992 platformer Gimmick!, and a rerelease of 1991 Famicom adventure Ufouria: The Saga — One of the games in the cult Hebreke franchise. In addition to these announcements, Sunsoft also teased that it had a full remake in the works, but is yet to offer up the identity of the mystery title.
Next week's stream is expected to feature new information pertaining to the above titles, and will perhaps see Sunsoft finally lift the lid on the teased remake. Of course, we may find that the studio is only planning to continue its focus on the Japanese market and some of its more obscure IPs, but it's still interesting to see the long-forgotten studio make its presence felt some 20-30 years later. We will, of course, bring you all of the news from the stream right here on Destructoid, so stay tuned, folks.
The "Sunsoft is Back" live stream kicks off April 20 at 15:00 JST / 07:00 BST / 23:00 PT.

Secret Mode has announced that it’s bringing Sumo Digital Academy’s revival of the Amiga almost-classic Zool Redimensioned to PlayStation consoles on May 16, 2023.
Zool was originally released in 1992 on the Commodore Amiga before being ported to other consoles. Despite its availability on different platforms, it’s largely considered to be an Amiga cornerstone. 2021’s Zool Redimensioned was a ground-up remake that bases itself on the Amiga version. It features widescreen support, which is a pretty revolutionary change, considering it was a game that would sometimes punish quick movements.
https://youtu.be/xTEsWEeVGm8
I enjoyed it for what it was. It was a worthwhile update, but I don’t really think about Zool Redimensioned all that often anymore. In my review, I called it a “comfortable slice of ‘90s platforming," which still sounds appropriate to me now. Good call, past me.
Along with this port comes multiplayer in the form of party modes Zool’s Gold, Rool of Zool, and Ball Brawl. Not much has been shown off about them. The trailer shows off Rool of Zool, but it’s hard to really make out what’s happening. I see bosses though, so it kind of looks fun. The patch will also be coming to the existing PC version. My family won’t play platformers with me because I exist on a higher plain of skill in that genre. Every genre, really, but don’t tell them I said that.
Zool Redimensioned is currently available on PC, and will be making its way to PS4 and PS5 on May 16.

Futurlab has revealed its plans for the transcendental dad-game Powerwash Simulator for the rest of 2023. While a lot of these plans are currently just winks and eyebrow wiggles, it will at least give you an idea of what to look forward to.
The most concrete of plans is patch 1.2, which brings additional jobs and updates old ones to expand Powerwash Simulator’s mystifyingly deep lore. This is coming April 18, 2023, which is just around the corner, so you won’t have to wait long. This patch will be followed by another free content pack every quarter, including a “seasonal” one. While that will probably be Christmas Themed, I’d love to power-wash the feathers off a turkey.
https://twitter.com/PowerWashSim/status/1646151201237393412?s=20
Along with this is three paid DLC packs for Powerwash Simulator. They haven’t really said much on what those will involve, but they do say that they will take you outside the fictional county of Muckington to “all sorts of new and exciting places.” Space? The bottom of the ocean? How does a power washer work in a pressurized environment? Like normal, I’m guessing.
The biggest wink, however, is just “exciting news.” Ooo. I bet it’s VR, which really isn’t exciting to someone like me. Someone who doesn’t own a VR headset.
There’s also a physical version of the game on the way for consoles. I say “physical,” but the Switch version is just a download key, which is just… I don’t see the point. I should totally buy my dad the PS4 version, though.
I love Powerwash Simulator, though. It’s like a less janky version of Viscera Cleanup Detail. I can barely keep my kitchen clean, but you can bet I’ll get every nook and cranny if you give me points for it.
Powerwash Simulator is available for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, PS5, and Switch.

Amplitude Studios is pushing back the date for its dungeon crawler. Previously set for May, Endless Dungeon will now be launching on October 19, 2023.
The roguelite action game was set to arrive in just about a month's time, on May 18. However, it sounds like Amplitude Studios is going to need a little more time to work on its dungeons.
"We want to provide the best roguelite experience possible for our community, and we think there's still more work for us to do to make sure we get there," reads today's announcement on social media. The PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One versions are now moved to this date, while the Switch version will have a release date announced later.

Don’t you hate it when you finish a hard day in the work mines, step blinking into the sunlight, and find out that the mountain you were on is now just a small island surrounded by ocean? So relatable. That’s how Flooded begins.
Flooded describes itself as a reverse city builder. What it means is that the world is currently undergoing flooding of biblical proportions, and you need to survive in small pockets of land, finish up your objectives, and escape before there’s no land left to dry your socks on. I wasn’t sure if this concept was really going to work for me, but now that I’ve played through Flooded, I realize that its design is not only palatable, but actually somewhat brilliant.

It’s clearly riffing on Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland as our protagonist, the titular Ravenlok, moves to a new inherited house, gets sucked through a magical mirror and steps into a trippy, mushroom-filled land. From there, she needs to fight this realm's off-brand Queen Of Hearts and save the remaining, slightly weird, storybook denizens.

In a tweet, Arkane reveals that only Quality mode will be available when the game releases on May 2. A 60 FPS Performance option is coming at an unspecified date, but until it does, here’s how the game will run depending on your hardware:
Xbox Series X - 4K 30 FPS
Xbox Series S - 1440p 30 FPS
Sounds like PC is the way to go if you value performance over resolution, but hopefully, it doesn’t take too long for the option to appear on console.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frogwares are in a bit of a tight spot at the moment, being as they are a Ukranian studio. If I was trying to make video games in a warzone and: a) my last game was a big sexy prequel to my long running Sherlock Holmes series; b) the one before that was a Lovecraftian detective game with pretty recent assets; and c) my back catalogue contained a Lovecraft-themed Sherlock Holmes mystery, then I'd probably do what they've done with Sherlock Holmes The Awakened. Which is to remake the old Lovecraft-themed Sherlock Holmes game, but with new assets.
It's also got new puzzles and areas, and a slightly rewritten story to account for this being a sequel to Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One. It's a smaller, less ambitious game than Chapter One with some jank knocking around, and I wouldn't recommend it if you're not a fan of the series, but you know what? I think there's a glimmer of greatness in the very fact of its constraints.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Illumination’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie has become a staggering box office success since its premiere last week. The animated adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has emerged from its first weekend as the best opening animated film of all time, achieving several other records along the way. 
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the film walked away with over $375 million in sales in its first five days, surpassing Frozen 2 as the top opening animated film premiere globally. That includes a $206 million domestic haul, $146 million of which was earned over the weekend (remember the film premiered on a Wednesday). Overseas, the movie has earned over $173 million.
Additionally, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is now the top opening film of 2023 (beating Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), has become Illumination’s most successful opening, and has the best opening of any video game film adaptation (surpassing Sonic the Hedgehog 2's debut). The film also has the biggest five-day premiere ever, a record previously held by Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. If all of that wasn’t enough, the film also has the biggest IMAX opening weekend of all time at $21.6 million globally.
Needless to say, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is exceeding expectations, and it’ll be interesting to see if it can maintain such a strong start. To get an idea of how it fares, you can read our review of the film here. Be sure to also check out our interviews with the movie’s cast and Nintendo’s own Shigeru Miyamoto and Koji Kondo.]]></summary>

So, The Tank he lived, and also died. Questing endlessly in this grimy medieval world won’t cut it. You’ll also need to keep your troupe paid and fed, so when evening fell to find nought but a handful of foraged mushrooms and a single mouldy apple I’d pried from the fingertips of a disemboweled bandit, it was time to get creative.
“Waste not, want not”, said the Earl of Human Sandwich, the inventor of cannibalism (I’m told). With this in mind, I’d invested one of my early ‘Knowledge Points’ into a tech that let me repurpose my dearly departed as delicious drumsticks. Slain friendlies don’t disappear after battle. Instead, you’ll find their tastefully dressed corpses in the loot menu afterwards. Ghoulishly, the ‘loot all’ option doesn’t add their cadavers to your inventory with the rest. You’ll have to manually drag them over, giving you just enough time to consciously make the decision to either bury or eat them. I did not bury him.

That means it won't receive any new updates, but players can still install and play Dreams – including creating and sharing games – after that date. Previously announced updates will still hit the game before September, such as patches improving animations and the Create mode, as well the Tren update. Events such as DreamsCom, Impy Awards, and All Hallows Dreams will no longer take place as well. In the blog, Media Molecule writes,

The Vampire Diaries follows Elena Gilbert, a high school student who discovers vampires are living in her hometown after one of them attacks her younger sister. The game is loosely based on the book series of the same name by author L. J. Smith, which later got adapted into a hit TV series.
Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill is the first installment of the long-running Nancy Drew game series, also based on a book series of the same name. In her first adventure, Nancy seeks to uncover the killer of a high school student who seems to have been disliked by all of his classmates.
You will need the data files from the games’ original install CDs, and a fresh daily build of ScummVM. Apart from the original release, Secrets Can Kill’s Russian translation is also supported. The ScummVM wiki pages for The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill contain information on which datafiles are needed. Please, report any problems you encounter in our issue tracker.

EA returns to the PGA with an inconsistent, frustrating simulation, struggling with its identity. While gorgeous, with pro golf’s best interactive presentation, the on-the-course action delivers inconsistent results.
In licensing, EA wins, scoring the Masters and key courses like Pebble Beach. Presentation counts, like the Masters’ first day showing opening tee shots from Jack Nicklaus and others. Quiet commentary meaningfully discusses each hole during flybys. Gorgeous vistas line the courses, and every individually rendered bl…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-04-11T16:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For April's issue of Game Informer magazine, we took a look behind the scenes at Hyper Light Breaker, the latest game from developer Heart Machine. In addition to an interview with Creative Director Alx Preston, we were able to view exclusive footage of one of the game's mini-bosses, The Last Master. Check out the reveal below.


The Last Master is a deadly opponent that spawns randomly when players (known in this world as Breakers) activate beacons, objects that allow them to access the main boss gate. If you think she looks similar to the player characters, you've got the right idea; in the video, Preston says "She ended up here in this land as a Breaker and succumbed to the dangers of the Overgrowth." As a result, The Last Master's arsenal mirrors yours, wielding a sword, a spear, and an automatic pistol. Her behavior mirrors the Breakers' as well, and she can dash, jump, and climb after anyone that attempts to escape.
While the first game in the Hyper Light franchise was a 2D single-player experience, this new title is a 3-player co-op rogue-lite, with a new procedurally generated open world on every run. Players will create a Breaker, explore a cursed land called the Overgrowth, and attempt to the bosses plaguing this realm known as Crowns.

For more of the game, check out our feature in the latest issue of Game Informer. You also can see the initial reveal trailer here and the IGN's gameplay reveal right here. Hyper Light Breaker enters early access this fall.]]></summary>

Setting the table for Diablo IV’s dark tone are two haunting pieces of cover art designed by the famed artist Brom. Our standard cover showcases the heavenly might of the rogue angel Inarius while the Game Informer Gold cover features Lilith, Diablo IV’s main antagonist, in all her demonic glory.
Issue 355 also includes a conversation about life and death with former Tango Gameworks artist and director Ikumi Nakamura in the abandoned streets of late-night Tokyo (which you can read online). You’ll also find an entertaining personal story about using VR as a carnival scam, a feature detailing Devil May Cry 5’s influence on Final Fantasy XVI’s combat, and an emotional piece discussing how a grieving father found solace in the Shenmue series’ depiction of loss. You'll also be treated to previews for upcoming titles, including Redfall, Exoprimal, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. 
You can also try to nab a Game Informer Gold version of the issue. Limited to a numbered print run per issue, this premium version of Game Informer isn't available for sale. To learn about places where you might be able to get a copy, check out our official Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, and stay tuned for more details in the coming weeks.

Print subscribers can expect their issues to arrive in the coming weeks. The digital edition of this issue launches later today for PC/Mac, iOS, and Google Play. To subscribe to either the digital or print version, click here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Retro FPS Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun now has a release date of May 23rd, developer Auroch Digital have announced. Revealed last year, Boltgun is an homage to old-school shooters like classic Doom, mimicking those game’s speedy shooting and bloody visuals, and placing it in the Warhammer universe. Its loud, fast, and fun trailers meant Boltgun ripped its way onto RPS’ most anticipated games list, so thank the grim-dark gods for a release date.

We’re standing at a slaughterhouse. But it’s a slaughterhouse in a deeply strange location, or, as Nakamura calls it, “Silicon Valley,” the technology district of Shinagawa in Tokyo, Japan. As I look at trucks packed full of cows at – whether they know it or not – the end of their lives, immense skyscrapers surround us, housing tech goliaths. Sony, Canon, and Microsoft all have offices here. The lifeblood of Japan’s tech industry, all looking down at death, turned to process.

After twenty years of development Dwarf Fortress finally made the jump to Steam in December 2021, complete with exciting new features such as "graphics" and "mouse support". Although the game was already critically lauded, its availability on Steam made it a financial success, with thousands of long-term fans thrilled to provide the brothers with a long-overdue payday. 


Following their panel on the highs and lows of procedural generation, the pair had a chat with Rachel about the game's recent Steam release, upcoming features, their favourite player stories and - most importantly - Zach's dog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo Live, a fan event celebrating all things Nintendo, is taking place in the U.S. for the first time this September. 
The event, which has previously been held in Japan, will take place in Seattle. It serves as a large convention that will allow Nintendo enthusiasts to play popular Switch titles, take photos with Mario and other characters, and enjoy live entertainment, including game tournaments. The event will also feature a number of Nintendo-themed activities scattered across the venue. 
“Fans of all ages can currently experience the unique games, characters and worlds of Nintendo on Nintendo Switch, but we want to expand that scope with a new experience,” said Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser in a press release. “With Nintendo Live 2023, we’re giving attendees a chance to celebrate together with family, friends and the broader Nintendo community in the spirit of fun and creating long-lasting memories.”
There’s no information on the exact date or location for the event nor when ticket sales begin, but you can keep an eye on the event’s official website to learn more once those details become available. Nintendo is enjoying a wave of positive momentum this year following the opening of its second Super Nintendo World theme park at Universal Studios Hollywood as well as the successful premiere of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.

In his weekly newsletter for the Guardian, Keith Stewart laments the recent cancellation of this year's in-person E3, highlighting the loss of access an event like E3 offers to journalists that can't be replicated by a glut of sterile, online showcases.
Following the passing of legendary composer Ryuichi Sakamoto last week, Mat Ombler has documented his effect on the world of video games. Featuring quotes from Jesper Kyd, Takeshi Furukawa and Yuji Naka, it's clear that Sakamoto's influence on the way games sound cannot be understated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The developers of Ark have revised their plans for the release of Ark: Survival Ascended, an Unreal Engine 5 enhanced edition of their dinosaur survival sim. It will now cost $60 rather than the previously planned $50, is no longer bundled together with ARK 2, and will instead include the remasters of Ark: Survival Evolved's several expansions - although most won't be available at launch.

Studio Wildcard also went into more detail as to why this upgraded version is no longer a free update, and why they feel it's necessary to shut down Ark: Survival Evolved's official servers.

McGee says that Electronic Arts have decided to pass on the project. As such, McGee says he has "reached an endpoint with 'Alice' and with game production in general."

That makes this Micro SD a premiere option for Steam Deck owners, who will benefit from faster copying times when transferring game directories from the internal storage to Micro SD or downloading from the internet, and game load times should also be as speedy as anything with this A2-rated drive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You might not know what Muv-Luv is. I hadn’t even heard of it till a few years ago. Which is strange, since Muv-Luv is considered by many to be one of the most greatest visual novels of all time. What begins as a light-hearted slice-of-life high school romantic comedy eventually pulls the rug out from under the player, and transforms into a war epic featuring mechs and aliens with a much darker tone. In Muv-Luv’s original Japanese release, this twist was hidden and only briefly hinted at in the marketing.
Today both Muv-Luv games are easily available on Steam, marketed specifically with this twist, and where they sit fully-translated and with Overwhelmingly Positive reviews. iOS and Android ports are apparently in development, and other Muv-Luv spin-offs continue to get translated. But the first time anyone experienced a complete English language version of Muv-Luv was in July 2010, when a fan translation group called Amaterasu released a patch localising the first game.

I could call it a 2D beat 'em up with your classic heavy/light attacks (actually punch/kick, but whatever), which is important to mention. It's also tempting to namedrop the things it reminded me of, like Hotline Miami, Beraltors, and a tiny hint of The Cat Lady, but that could get you picturing just about anything, and is unfairly reductive to a game that has the right to stand on its own.
Pill Baby is, obviously, all those things. It's far better and more coherent than any of those descriptions would make it sound.

In any case, I disregarded this advice. "I don't need an instruction manual for post-apocalyptic survival," I thought. I've rummaged through this particular abandoned house countless times, after all: In DayZ, in Dead Island, in State Of Decay, in Days Gone. I even reviewed the first Saints And Sinners back in February 2020. I know my way around a zombie's cranium better than anyone.

Anyone who has a copy of Backyard Football, Backyard Baseball 2001, and even Backyard Football 2002 (which was originally a LAN-only title) can download the latest daily build* of ScummVM and play online games against real people!
This all became possible because the three developers from the Backyard Sports Online fork had joined the team and brought their services with them to the ScummVM. These are LittleToonCat, Jim “jibbodahibbo” Westerkamp and Sam “QuestionMonkey” Kupfer.
Please note that Backyard Football and Backyard Baseball 2001 require online accounts for the complete online experience, so you need to register to Backyard Sports Online, which is our fantastic online-play service and a thriving community of fellow Backyard Sports players, they even have a couple of competitive online Baseball and Football leagues, if that's your style, you can find more information in their Discord server! People who already have a Backyard Sports Online account can log in using the latest daily build and play, but if you do not, you can register right here! This is not required to play Backyard Football 2002 online.
If you encounter any issues playing online, please let us know via the issue tracker.
This fantastic art is done by a fellow BSO community member Peppyrus.
* only the Windows, macOS, Debian, Raspberry Pi, and Android builds are compatible with network play at the moment. And only the 2.8.x branch of ScummVM has this functionality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look, I’m not saying Far Cry 3 is responsible for *gestures vaguely towards modern AAA games* but it’s definitely a prime suspect. If I was trying to connect a piece of red string from the middle of my evidence board (which would probably be a picture of the map screen from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla), I’m not sure I’d push a pin directly into Jason Brody’s face, but I’d definitely circle it in black Sharpie a few times. Basically, in the eleven years since its release, I’ve grown a bit suspicious of Far Cry 3’s lasting legacy. 


And yet, in those halcyon days of 2012, we named it our game of the year. Although it’d be easy to simply say that decision was made a bit before my time here, I should probably admit that when reviewing the game for the blog I used to run when I was at university, I awarded it an equally prestigious (stop laughing at the back) 10/10. That almost seems ludicrous, doesn’t it? Far Cry 3? Game of the year? Surely not.


After spending a few hours revisiting the sunny shores of Rook Island, I was shocked to discover a game that feels surprisingly pure. Mechanically, I hasten to add. The actual act of playing Far Cry 3 in 2023 is still good fun, it’s the bits around it that are a bit ropey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For April Fool's Day, Sega released a game where the company finally went and did the unthinkable: they killed Sonic. The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog is a real visual novel in which you investigate the death of Sega's beloved mascot, currently free on Steam. Here's the game's description via the publisher: 
It's Amy Rose's birthday, and she's hosting a murder mystery party on the Mirage Express! When Sonic the Hedgehog becomes the game's victim, everyone is off to get to the bottom of things. However, something feels a bit off - is this really an innocent game or is something more sinister afoot?
Surprisingly, the free game has proved very popular. As told by Sonic social media manager Katie Chrzanowski (via GameSpot), more one million people have played the game. Going a step further, it's apparently the 61st highest-reviewed game on Steam right now, and as GameSpot points out, the best-rated Sonic game on Steam (though that's not the highest margin to clear, all things considered). As of this writing, The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog has over 11,000 user reviews on Steam, netting it an "Overwhelmingly Positive" ranking. You can check the game out for yourself right here. 
Over 1,000,000 of you have grabbed The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog and it's currently the #61 highest rated game on Steam of ALL TIME.

I am still the frustrated artist struggling to survive that I was in the first Passpartout. This time, though, I’ve lost more than just my shabby shack. There are no bills to pay; instead, I’ve invested all my money into art supplies and rented a studio in the town of Phénix. Finally, I can become an art master, having my naive artwork displayed just alongside Van Gogh's.

Dlala Studios recently shared an extensive hands-off presentation of its upcoming game, Disney Illusion Island, where we got a chance to see some of the game's early cutscenes and a substantial gameplay demo. Seeing the game in action answered a number of questions and presented a handful of intriguing new ones. For one, the game can be played alone, and though their animations differ, Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy all play the same. It's not a Super Mario Bros. 2 situation where they all run at different speeds and jump different heights. No matter who your favorite character is (Donald being an early cont…]]></summary>

As a fun homage, you can find the PICO-8 version inside Celeste proper. And now, as an even funner homage, you can play it on the Playdate. A loveable game on a loveable handheld.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a moment in BioShock Infinite's opening act that's always stuck with me. As you emerge onto the floating city of Columbia, the game takes you on a guided tour of the sights and sounds of this airbone civilization. As you saunter through the streets, you learn about its citizens and its creator, just sort of taking it all in. The sun is shining. You're surrounded by smiles. Before you know it, an airship rises above the clouds and perches next to a hugging couple, gently swaying in the summer breeze. Aboard the ship is a barbershop quartet, cheerfully harmonising the iconic Beach Boys tune God Only Knows. It's a memorable scene, and has become an integral part of the game's lasting iconography. 


But for Tyler, Nick, Derek and Greg, this section was more than just a fun tease for the secret behind Columbia's unusual success. Self-confessed music school kids, the quartet inspired them to create their own musical group styled after Infinite's singing hairdressers. In 2023, BioShop Infinite celebrated their ninth year at PAX East, where they performed a wonderful collection of harmonised tunes to an absolutely packed community room - and we were there to film it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's weird that Road 96 has gotten a prequel, because it only came out about six months ag- what's that? A year and a half? Good lord. Still, it seems a slightly odd move, because Road 96 - a first person hitchhiking choose 'em up about the collective action of wayward teens bringing down a totalitarian government - doesn't really need a prequel. On top of that, Road 96: Mile 0 is a sequel to developer DigixArt's first game Lost In Harmony, a musical runner about skateboarder Kaito whose fiend Aya is dying of a terminal illness.
In Mile 0, Kaito and his family have moved to a small gated town called White Sands, in the 90s USA-adjacent dictatorship Petria, and made best friends with Zoe, who 96ers will remember as a recurring NPC from that game. Zoe is the daughter of an important minister and lives in the nice part of town; Kaito's parents are workers who are forced to live on the wrong side of the tracks. Through a combination of Road 96-style character-driven vignettes and Lost In Harmony-style rhythm action tracks, the two come to the conclusion they must leave White Sands. If you played Road 96 you kind of already know how Mile 0 has to end.

Not in the scientific, evolutionary sense of all of human history, I should add, but rather how we, the RPS Treehouse, ended up writing about video games for a living.
The question comes courtesy of Bloodyhell, who asked: When did you know that you not only wanted to play games, but to write about what you played? And, does writing about games ever dampen your enthusiasm when you are dealing with deadlines and putting words on a page?
A sneaky double-part question, there, but both good questions nonetheless. So come and find out our collective origin stories, and whether any of us have cried tears of pain and regret over the years after turning our favourite hobby into an actual job.

It's a promise of all the myriad adventures to come. And despite some fundamental changes in genre and perspective, it's something that the team behind the upcoming Minecraft Legends has tried hard to preserve.
I recently was treated to the most in-depth look so far at Minecraft Legends, in an hour-long livestream which gave us all some much needed answers on what manner of beast Legends actually is. It's a curious blend of action adventure and RTS, one that shares Minecraft's focus on exploration, but guides the player down a stricter, simpler path of summoning friendly mobs and constructing defences to repel a Piglin invasion. This will likely be a solid introduction to the RTS genre for a lot of players, but I came away unsure about whether the game will have enough depth to keep its prospective playerbase's attention.

Publisher Microsoft had already confirmed the game would be “temporarily” removed from Game Pass (for console, it was never on the PC version) due to licensing issues, although there was no word on a removal from storefronts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Stars is an RPG unabashedly inspired by the 16-bit era of Japanese RPGs. Even just looking at screenshots of the game recalls the best of the era, and that’s not an accident. Developer Sabotage Studio’s CEO and Sea of Stars’ creative director, Thierry Boulanger, is a huge fan of the genre and has been building towards making a game like this since he started building the fantasy world Sea of Stars and The Messenger takes place in during Elementary school.
Dozens of classic RPGs inspired Sea of Stars’ development, including Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, but we asked Boulanger to pick the most significant ones in the video below.

We thankfully won't need to re-run that result, but we cannot fully leave the past behind us. One eagle-eyed reader observed that time loops and staged reloads "aren't really comparable", and I cannot overstate my embarrassment at having made such an obvious mistake. My deepest apologies to everyone who has trusted me to conduct this research with great rigour. I must do better. So reader dearest, I now ask you to pick between two things we can all agree are two of a kind. What's better: dark darkness, or bioluminescence?

Season 4, which starts next week, brings players the next post-launch hero in the form of Lifeweaver, a unique support character. In preparation for Lifeweaver's impending release, Blizzard released a ton of new details surrounding the nature-loving character.
Lifeweaver comes to the Overwatch team from Thailand and uses advanced biolight technology, which plays a major role in his abilities. As a result, his kit introduces some new mechanics. First up, his first primary ability, Healing Blossom, charges a luminescent flower, which he sends off to teammates. The longer he charges the flower, the more healing it grants to the recipient.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for an excuse to break out that Leviathan Axe for another adventure? As of today, there's a new update for God of War Ragnarök featuring a load of new content, all built around a robust New Game Plus mode.
New Game Plus opens up for anyone who has beaten the game, and all of your equipment and skills will come along for the ride. You also have access to all weapons, including the Draupnir Spear. However, it should be noted that areas requiring that spear to access will still remain closed until you reach the appropriate point in the story. For similar reasons, you also won’t start your new playthrough with Sonic or Hex arrows.
Several new armors show up. The most interesting is the Spartan Armor, which recalls Kratos’ look from the old days in the Greek Pantheon. While wearing it, you get no perk, no stats, and it’s locked at Power Level 1 – expect a challenge.
New Game Plus also features a new level cap, enchantments, and progression paths to improve your capabilities. Players can also tackle an expanded version of the Niflheim Arena, where you play as either Kratos or Atreus and bring along a variety of companions to help out.
Among several other additions and improvements, players can also take on a Black and White Render mode for a more cinematic playthrough.
It’s a notably large blast of new content that ensures that dedicated fans should have good reason to jump back in if they desire.
God of War Ragnarök released last November for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.
You can read the full details on the newly arriving content over at the PlayStation Blog.]]></summary>

Why Nvidia and not the developers, CD Projekt Red? Well, that might have something to do with Overdrive Mode being such a graphics card shatterer that it will supposedly take a GeForce RTX 40 series GPU – with DLSS 3 in effect – to run.

Show me a game with a gun in it that looks like it could feasibly run on Windows 95, and all of the neurons in my brain will start to fizzle and spark. I just think they're neat, and their recent resurgance has been extremely nice for me, specifically. 


Unsuprisingly, then, I've been very excited to get my hands on Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun, a retro FPS by Auroch Digital set within the grim-dark universe of Warhammer 40k. A retro shooter where you play as a Space Marine is so obvious a pairing it's a wonder the concept has never been tackled before, to the point where the game's own marketing materials sort of pretend that it already was back in the 90s but everyone just forgot about it.

Regardless, Defender’s Quest 2: Mists Of Ruin is now ready to re-emerge into the public’s consciousness with a 2023 PC release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An important Star Wars question is: what colour lightsaber would you have? The lightsaber is the mood ring of elegant weapons for a more civilised age. Jason de Heras, design director on Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, agrees with me on the purple blade (a colour introduced to the canon specifically because Samuel L. Jackson wanted it for his character in the prequels). "I was like, 'we gotta have a pink lightsaber blade'," says production director Kasumi Shishido. "So whenever I play I always stick with my pink saber."
Shishido tells me the dev team focused on improving on Jedi: Fallen Order for this sequel, and one of the bigger areas where they did that was customisation. "We knew we wanted to put more resources and effort into it," she says. "There's a lot more that you can do with Cal, with BD... and just within Cal, it's not just outfits you can customise, so I'm just really excited to see what players are going to do with it."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's episode seven of Indiescovery and this week, wow, the gang is tired. With a busy four days in Boston for PAX East, mine and Liam's brains were basically mush last week, so Rebecca - an absolute angel - graciously said she could host a special PAX East episode where she chats with Liam and me about the indies we saw on the show floor and try desperately to string together a coherent sentence. She also made bulletpoints of our entire chat so writing up the shownotes would be easier; we do not deserve her.
Saying that, our exhaustion doesn't stop us from kicking up a riot over the BAFTA Game Awards at the start of the episode. We then delve into our PAX East indie round up and, as always, we end with our current hyperfixations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A belated apology to anyone who was assaulted by a sudden burst of upbeat bagpipes in the GDC press room the other week. I was having an early sneak peak at Inkle's new game A Highland Song in an appointment booth with paper-thin walls and no ceiling. The speakers on my Steam Deck demo unit were really going "full pipe" that day, so I'd like to say a big awkward sorry to any of my neighbours in there who were trying to conduct actual serious business interviews. 
But also: A Highland Song is 100% a game that deserves to have its music cranked up to full, whether it's returning Heaven's Vault composer Laurence Chapman's soaring orchestral score, or Scottish bands Talisk and Fourth Moon's aforementioned folk music. The clue's in the name, after all, and after a spirited 30 minutes with it, I'm certain this will have Inkle fans singing from the hilltops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1993, the Super Mario Bros. made their big-screen debut through a live-action adventure starring Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper. While that film has garnered a cult following in the decades since its theatrical release, it does little to truly pay homage to Nintendo's flagship franchise in the ways all the best film adaptations aspire. Fast forward 30 years, and Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo have finally delivered a cinematic adventure starring the iconic fraternal duo that is joyful, fun, exciting, and, perhaps most importantly, respectful of the source material.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Stadium, the classic 3D battler/minigame collection for the Nintendo 64, just got a Nintendo Switch Online release date. While the game's imminent arrival to the online service was announced at a Nintendo Direct in September 2022, today is the day we finally know when we can play it. Pokémon Stadium comes to Nintendo Switch Online Wednesday, April 12. As is the case with all N64 games, you'll need the expansion pack in order to play it. Check out the full trailer below.


While some fans may have hoped this port would include trading with Pokémon Home, they're unfortunately out of luck. The fine print in the trailer specifies that "Pokémon cannot be transferred to this game." That said, there is also a notable improvement: four-player online multiplayer will be available, so you can play Clefairy Says or Sushi-Go-Round with friends all over.
Nintendo Switch Online's expansion pack had a slow start, but its library has gradually snowballed into a much more significant package. In February, the service added a Game Boy Advance library, which included fan favorites like The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap and Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. A month later, Metroid Fusion joined the lineup. Meanwhile, the base tier of NSO got an update last month that added another small handful of titles. To see all the retro games currently available on the service, check out our complete list.

When Respawn Entertainment announced it was making a third-person action game in the Star Wars universe, many fans didn’t know how to react; the studio was critically acclaimed, but at the time, Respawn was purely known for shooters like Titanfall and Apex Legends. However, 2019’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order surpassed the expectations of many, delivering a terrific adventure full of exciting action and memorable moments. Now, with all the learnings of Fallen Order, Respawn is ready to top itself in hopes of creating another unforgettable Star Wars adventure.

        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20230401/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-01T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ScummVM project, a free and open-source software project that allows users to play classic point-and-click adventure games on modern systems, has announced a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence gaming.
Thanks to the innovative work of ScummVM developers, AI tools such as ChatGPT are now able to play point-and-click adventure games directly, without any human intervention.

"With this new capability, we hope to explore the potential for AI to learn, adapt, and evolve within the context of classic adventure games," said Eugene Sandulenko, lead developer of the ScummVM project. "Now AI can experience the joys of helping Putt-Putt join the parade or Adibou count things. We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans."
"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule."
Update: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:
Getting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.
Taking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream
Refusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!

It’s the biggest weekend of the year for WWE, but some folks may not realize that it’s also a massive event for the entire industry. The city Wrestlemania takes place in also hosts multiple shows from smaller wrestling promotions, various fan conventions, live podcasts, stage shows, and other events looking to capitalize on the giant influx of fans in the area. It’s a good reminder – or revelation for some – that there’s a lot of other great stuff out there besides Vince McMahon’s billion-dollar behemoth.
The same is true for video games, as wrestling games don’t often get a spotlight without WWE’s branding. Hopefully, this list rectifies that by bringing more awareness to other upcoming titles that replicate or reimagine sports entertainme…]]></summary>

Universal Studios provided me with a day pass to the park for the purpose of experiencing Super Nintendo World. While the photos do little to show off just how cool the experience of visiting Super Nintendo World is, follow along with my experience in the gallery below.

Today, IGN received an email sent within the ESA explaining that the show "simply did not garner the sustained interest necessary to execute it in a way that would showcase the size, strength, and impact of our industry."

On April 7, the invisible leader of the Cenation joins the game’s roster of celebrity athletes alongside Michael Jordan and Steph Curry. Given his well-documented freakish strength, Cena excels at hitting long drives and rocks a vaguely familiar red, white, and blue ensemble. Cena is set to compete at Wrestlemania 39 this weekend, challenging Austin Theory for the United States Championship. If he comes up short on Saturday, he can always bounce back and win the Masters instead. Or continue improving his K/D ratio in Fortnite. Cena is nothing if not versatile. 
PGA Tour 2K23 is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Xbox players can try the game for free on the weekend of April 6-9, while Steam players can play until April 10.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2023/03/30/netflixs-scott-pilgrim-anime-series-reunites-the-live-action-movie-cast"/>
        <updated>2023-03-30T14:52:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We learned last year that Scott Pilgrim is getting another encore in the form of a new Netflix anime series. If that wasn't exciting enough, we now know that the cast from the cult classic 2010 film is reprising their roles.
As reported by Deadline, the still-untitled Scott Pilgrim show will be computer animated by Japanese animation studio Science SARU (Devilman Crybaby, The Heike Story, Inu-Oh). Scott Pilgrim vs. The World director Edgar Wright returns as executive director, with Scott Pilgrim author Bryan Lee O’Malley and artist Bendavid Grabinski will serve as executive producers, writers, and showrunners. The plot of the graphic novels/movie centers on slacker musician Scott Pilgrim battling the seven evil exes of his new girlfriend, Ramona Flowers. 


The primary actors from the live-action film are higlighted in the trailer above, which include:
Michael Cera - Scott Pilgrim
Mary Elizabeth Winstead - Ramona Flowers
Kieran Culkin - Wallace Wells
Satya Bhabha - Matthew Patel
Chris Evans - Lucas Lee
Anna Kendrick - Stacey Pilgrim
Brie Larson - Envy Adams
Alison Pill - Kim Pine
Aubrey Plaza - Julie Powers
Brandon Routh - Todd Ingram
Jason Schwartzman - Gideon Graves
Johnny Simmons - Young Neil
Mark Webber - Stephen Stills
Mae Whitman - Roxie Richter
Ellen Wong - Knives Chau
Unfortunatley, the series currently still doesn’t have a release window other than “coming soon.” Scott Pilgrim has always had a strong relationship with video games; the graphic novels and film incorporate a bevy of gaming references. Of course, we’d be remiss, not to mention the much-beloved 2010 beat ‘em up Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which was remastered for modern consoles in 2021. 
Are you excited to see Scott Pilgrim return as an anime? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Live A Live became one of our favorite RPGs when it launched on Switch last year, and the celebrated remake is making the jump to PlayStation consoles and Steam on April 27. 
Additionally, there’s a free demo on PlayStation available today that lets you play three of the game’s eight stories. Live A Live was originally released in 1994 for the Super Famicom in Japan, but it hadn’t been localized for the West for decades. Directed by Takashi Tokita, one of the lead creative minds behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV, the game consists of eight very different short stories, each starring its own protagonist and featuring distinct gameplay mechanics and presentations. While the battle system is turn-based strategy, sometimes the game flips that on its head in unique ways.
Last year, Square Enix resurrected the title by giving it an Octopath Traveler-style HD-2D facelift, a rearranged soundtrack, and full voice-acting. You can pre-order the game on PlayStation and Steam to get a 20% discount. To learn more, you can read our review of Live A Live here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yasunori Mitsuda has worked on dozens of games since the mid-90s, but he is best known for his work on Chrono Trigger. The story of how he came to work on the game is surprisingly straightforward. "[Sea of Stars creative director Thierry Boulanger] was like, ‘We have a contact that is in touch with all these people. And he just kind of reached out, and [Mitsuda] liked what he saw. And so he's like, 'Yeah, I would, I would love to be a part of this’,” Sea of Stars lead composer Eric W. Brown says. “There’s no words to describe this. Like, it’s… we literally got the guy.” Mitsuda committed to creating about 10 tracks for the game, and the process has been smooth.

On paper, Crime Boss: Rockay City is bombastic, star-studded, and promises a city-spanning adventure about a criminal organization’s rise to the top. The actual game, however, is anything but. The gameplay is unbalanced, buggy, repetitive, and boring. The celebrity-filled cast is exciting at first glance, but crude and humorless writing weighs down the already-phoned-in performances of characters voiced by Michael Madsen, Michael Rooker, Vanilla Ice, and more. The single-player roguelite campaign lacks any of the genre’s typical hooks, and bu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forspoken may not have set the world on fire, but those who enjoyed it have a new reason to revisit the world of Athia. Square Enix has announced a new story expansion called In Tanta We Trust, and it takes place decades before the campaign begins.
The story sees Frey Holland follow a mysterious voice that leads to her being sent back in time 25 years before she first stepped foot in Athia. She arrives at the Purge of Rheddig, the battle that caused Athia’s collapse and pushed the Tantas to madness. Frey must now fight to save this era of Athia, and she has backup in the form of Tanta Cinta. Frey gains new magical powers, including tag-team-focused abilities that utilize Tanta Cinta’s talents. The DLC also features new environments for players to scale using Frey’s parkour skills. 
Forspoken: In Tanta We Trust is a paid expansion that launches on May 26. Those who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game can play it three days early, on May 23. For more on Forspoken, you can read our review here. You can also check out this story on how Square Enix recently absorbed developer Luminous Productions.]]></summary>
