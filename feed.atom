        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, acclaimed writer George R.R. Martin (A Song of Ice and Fire) took to his blog to make a few comments about his role in the development of From Software’s upcoming Elden Ring. While the blog is short, the author is clear that his work on Elden Ring took place years ago, and focused on worldbuilding the fantastical realms that players will be investigating come February. In the blog, Martin comments that video games aren’t really his thing – but then goes on to say he played some old-school strategy games like Master of Orion, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and Railroad Tycoon. Apparently Martin has some excellent taste with the games he chose to play back in the day!

Martin’s post is pretty clear, in that he worked on worldbuilding for the realms of Elden Ring. Exactly how this translates to the final game is unknown, but with what we saw in the network test, the world is full of discovery, even in that small slice. While the core foundational tale of the Tarnished and The Lands Between appear to have some significant similarities to the Dark Souls right now, the world itself and much of that history is yet unknown, so we’ll have to wait and see exactly what happens. Martin also notes how video games have become bigger than films in the entertainment world these days. You can check out the entire post over on Martin’s official blog here. Martin also notes that Elden Ring looks “incredible.” On that final point, I’m inclined to agree.
Elden Ring is scheduled to arrive on February 25th on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. Are you looking forward to it?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Definitely not sugar, spice, and all things nice.
It turns out there can be such a thing as too much Christmas cheer, especially during the week before the big day when we’re sick of the sight of the cute snowmen shops have been hawking since October and rag-tag bands of singers are prowling the streets, vocally murdering every carol you thought you liked and having the gall to ask for money for doing so. It’s enough to make anyone turn to Home Alone’s Kevin McCallister for festive inspiration, rigging up red-hot irons and blowtorches to fend off anyone who dares to get too close.
Unfortunately in the real world his style of destructive improvisation is not seen as the ingenious work of a mischievous scamp trying to protect themselves from harm, so we’ll have to settle for the next best thing instead: Switch games that either allow us to be more than a little bit mean ourselves or give us the chance to escape for a short while into a world that’s more All Hallows’ Eve than Christmas Eve.

Originally marketed in Japan with bottles of tea labeled as “Windia’s Delicious Urine” — the ostensible excreta of Deathsmiles’ central protagonist — one has to wonder what exactly Cave’s aspirations were for this entry in their shoot-em-up canon.
A 2009 bullet hell shoot-em-up (or ‘shmup’), Deathsmiles is an eccentric pastiche of broomstick riding heroines battling the forces of darkness through fiery caverns and over Ye Olde English shipyards. Its roster of ‘Lolis’ (or ‘Lolitas’, for those less au fait with anime lexicon) are a group of female witches aged 11 to 17 that occupy Gilverado, a Halloween-themed world filled with dragons, wizards and giant, satanically possessed cows. Each character’s weapon and orbiting spirit familiar offer different advantages for survival and scoring, and shot types can be alternated between a faster (but weaker) laser, and a slower, more powerful cannon. Holding both buttons engages your familiar’s homing properties, allowing them to target anything within a specific range.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. Over the next several weeks, we'll examine all of the mainline shooter entries up to Halo Infinite, so sit back and relax as we kick the season off with Halo: Combat Evolved.  
Developed by Bungie, Halo: Combat Evolved was positioned as the launch title for Microsoft's promising but unproven Xbox. Released on November 15, 2001, Halo redefined the first-person shooter and immediately solidified the Xbox as a must-own console. It's tough to imagine what Microsoft's place in the game industry would be today without Halo's success. Bungie became a household name, but the studio existed long before Halo and struggled financially prior to its launch. Twists and turns such as axing Halo's original PC exclusivity and going through bizarre working titles such as The Santa Machine are just some of the fascinating topics we'll unpack in this week's episode. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Game Informer Editor-in-Chief Andrew Reiner (@Andrew_Reiner) as we unpack the history and impact of Master Chief's video game debut.  
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel. From there, find the Video Gameography channel under "Community Spaces."]]></summary>

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild sequel didn't show up at The Game Awards and it left some fans concerned about the progress of its development. According to IGN's boss Peer Schneider, there's no need to worry.
In the latest episode of the IGN Games podcast (via a story on GamesRadar), Schneider mentioned how he spoke to "some people in the industry" who have supposedly assured him BOTW2 is still aiming for a 2022 release. Next year, in general, is also going to apparently be a very exciting one for Nintendo:

But it's not all bad! Before we get to that stage, we can use these bots to create amusing content, such as news headlines, Ace Attorney cases or even Pokémon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm writing this on my last day at work before I get to go on my Christmas holidays. I'm going to take this opportunity to say something I've always wanted to, but never had the chance. I hate you, reader.
Only kidding! I mean, statistically speaking I probably wouldn't get on with all of you, but I actually really appreciate that you're taking the time to read this and check out what games we'll be playing this weekend. In fact, we'll probably play loads of games over our breaks, but we'll tell you about those later. Until I see you again, have a lovely time celebrating the end of the year, however you do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just imagine playing USA, World and Exotica on the go.
Cruis'n Blast was released on the Switch in September, and since then fans have been asking for more. One common request seems to be for Nintendo to bring the classic entries to the recently announced Switch Online Expansion Pack.
It appears the creator of the series is just as eager. During a Reddit 'Ask Me Anything' on the Nintendo Switch subreddit, Eugene Jarvis - the founder of Raw Thrills and creator of the Cruis’n series - was asked about the possibility of the N64 Cruis'n trilogy speeding onto the Switch. And while it appears to be up to Nintendo, he'd "love to see it happen".

If you subscribe to Nintendo's official YouTube channel, you've likely seen at least one episode of 'Nintendo Minute' hosted by Kit and Krysta. Each week they talk about the latest happenings in the world of Nintendo and of course play some games.
Sadly though, it seems they've just aired their final episode. The show started out in 2013, and after 8 years and over 400 episodes, Nintendo has decided to end it. The "final episode" is an emotional reflection on Kit and Krysta's 'Nintendo Minute' journey over the years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Handheld consoles are often home to a variety of niche games and genres, and the PlayStation Vita keeps that streak going. The system is a great buy for people who can't get enough JRPGs and adventure games, but that's not all it has to offer. We've compiled some of the top games for the system, including some fresh and familiar faces.
Sony doesn't seem to be supporting the system as aggressively as it did when it launched, but it's far from a barren wasteland. Japanese developers have taken advantage of its high-end portable specs to deliver gorgeous-looking RPGs, and indie developers have found a place to explore their comparatively smaller and quirkier ideas. There's a wide variety of gameplay to be found on Vita, as our list highlights.
Here are Game Informer's picks for the top 10 games on the PlayStation Vita, as it currently stands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its re-release earlier this year on consoles, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance has finally released on PC today. No, not the sort-of-reboot from this summer. That's Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance, a very different game. We're talking about the OG! It's been a 20-year journey for the action RPG, first released on PlayStation 2 in 2001, that saw ports on Xbox and Gamecube, but never Windows until now.
While its store description says it uses the 3rd Edition Dungeons & Dragons rule set, Dark Alliance plays out more like Diablo than the more strategic-feeling Baldur's Gate titles. You'll play as one of three characters representing the archer, fighter, and sorceress classes, fighting hordes of mystical minions, and taking quests through Black Isle Studios' rendition of the Forgotten Realms. 
This updated release features higher resolutions (up to 4K!), solo or co-op play, and full controller support on PC. For those reading this, who prefer playing on console, you're in luck. Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch, too. 
And now we wait patiently for Dark Alliance 2 to surface on current hardware. Once, again, we are not talking about a sequel to this summer's game with a similar name.
Have you played the PC version of Dark Alliance yet, or even the console ports? How does the game hold up after all of these years? Conviene in the comments and chat with us about it!]]></summary>

It's not easy to release a kart racer in a world where Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continues to sell gangbusters on Switch, but alas, Nexon is bucking the trend and not only releasing their own kart racer, but it's a free-to-play game, too. And it's a fun time! 
Game Informer editor Wesley LeBlanc recently went hands-on with KartRider: Drift during the closed beta that ran from December 8 through December 15. During the beta, players were able to progress through 20 levels of both the free Battle Pass and Premium Battle Pass. Plus, two licenses of unique minigame-like challenges were available to play through, as were races in both the Item Mode and the Speed mode. 
In this New Gameplay Today, your hosts Wesley and Alex Stadnik will walk you through all that this beta had to offer. Thanks for watching, and be sure to let us know what you think of this upcoming free-to-play kart racer.]]></summary>

Within minutes of playing the campaign or multiplayer, nostalgia hits hard, and the title reminds us why Halo is one of gaming’s most important series. Infinite is easily developer 343 Industries’ best Halo game to date, an effort that honors the series’ 20-year legacy while blazing a new trail forward for Master Chief and the Spartans. No matter what mode you dive into, the gameplay delivers the iconic “feel” that made the series’ first entries hard to put down and expands upon it in a variety of excellent ways. Whether you are exploring a sprawling open world with Master Chief or are teaming up with friends for an intense battle in ranked play, Halo Infinite is a masterwork that pumps out excitement, maki…]]></summary>

Click here to watch embedded media


Henry Cavill has returned to reprise the role of the silvery-haired monster-slaying hunk Geralt of Rivia. Season two continues Geralt's adventures, this time with his apprentice Ciri (played by Freya Alan) in tow. Also returning this season are Yennefer (Anya Chalotra), Vesimir (Kim Bodnia), Triss (Anna Shaffer), Lambert (Paul Bullion), and everyone's favorite bard Jaskier (Joey Batey), among a bevy of newcomers.
Have no fear; this won't be the last you'll see of these characters! Season three has already been confirmed, so feel free to take in the show at your own pace – like me, who has yet to watch any of season one, though I'd like to very soon.
Catch eight brand new episodes of The Witcher streaming right now on Netflix, with at least one more season coming in the future. And remember, toss a coin to your Witcher, but not at your television. That probably won't end well for the screen or your wallet.
Are you carving out time to catch this season of The Witcher? Which items and potions are needed to begin viewing Geralt's live-action adventures? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

They say that one of the most zen things you can do with a few hours of your life is digging in Minecraft. There's something supremely relaxing about the soft, repetitive sound of pickaxe-meeting-stone; combine it with an enchanted diamond pickaxe and a couple of beacons and you can mine out entire caves in mere minutes.
But what about... an entire world? Does that sound zen, or does that sound incomprehensibly pointless to you? Well, that's what YouTuber and streamer Minthical has been doing for the past four years... and he's almost done, apparently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas.

Fallen Order was released November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Daniel Tack, and Andrew Reiner on Twitch today at a special start time of 3 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat. Just as a reminder, subscribing to Game Informer on Twitch rewards access to the official Game Informer Discord channel where you can interact with our lovely community as well as the editors. See you in chat!]]></summary>

2021 has come and gone (almost) and despite a quiet start to the year, Switch owners have seen some real gems launch over the past 12 months. We've seen big releases (admittedly re-releases or remakes in several cases) of most of Nintendo's biggest franchises, with some big anniversaries popping up, too.
We got a Mario, a Zelda, a couple of Pokémon, a Metroid(!) and, perhaps most excitingly, a Big Brain Academy. Hey, it's a fun little game! Throw in WarioWare, another Mario Party and a host of brilliant third-party and indie titles — plus a sexy new SKU in the Switch OLED model — and it's tough to deny that Nintendo's console ended up having a strong software showing throughout 2021.

After its enjoyable demo that led to feedback and game adjustments, we now don't have long to wait before Triangle Strategy launches on 4th March. From the team that brought us Octopath Traveler, this time around we're getting turn-based strategy and what could be a fascinating tale to navigate.
A big part of the game will be making decisions at key moments, which will apparently influence the story, your allies and more. That's a focus in the latest trailer, which also shows us more of young Prince Roland Glenbrook, a key protagonist in the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tencent is making another big game development acquisition with the purchase of Turtle Rock Studios' parent company Slamfire, Inc, which includes Turtle Rock in the deal.
According to a press release shared with Game Informer, the Left 4 Dead and Evolve developers will remain an independent operation at its current Lake Forest, California office. It was also noted that despite the studio's most recent release Back 4 Blood, which was published by Warner Bros. Games, the game and its continued development will not be affected. 
Steve Goldstein, president and general manager of Turtle Rock, had this to say about the acquisition, "Tencent’s outstanding partners, global reach, deep knowledge of gaming and unprecedented support will help us create the kinds of ambitious games we dream of, while allowing us to retain our autonomy and independent spirit.”
Tencent, for the uninitiated, is a massive Chinese holdings company that has investments all over the video game landscape. Here are some other companies you may or may not know that Tencent has a stake in:
Riot Games
And many more. The above names represent anywhere from 100% ownership in the case of Riot Games to a small stake like Tencent's 5% ownership in Ubisoft. With this newest acquisition of Turtle Rock and Slamfire, Tencent is bolstering its gaming portfolio even further with the veteran development talent.
No sale price was given at the time this story was written, nor were any details of any new games Turtle Rock may be working on past its current responsibilities regarding Back 4 Blood.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The NA version, that is.
Early Mega Man box art — specifically the North American versions of Mega Man box art — are infamous for being a bit, well, off. And we're being exceptionally generous when we say 'a bit'; the NA cover used for the original game is renowned for being one of the worst examples of video game box art ever created and even Capcom designers themselves have been known to voice their dismay at the decisions made in those early NES days. We'd beg to differ that it's the worst box art ever, although there's no denying it is absolutely atrocious.
By the time Mega Man 3 rolled around, things had settled down a bit and the North American Mega Man adorning the 8-bit classic's cover is much closer to the Rockman we know and love. Sure, his face is a little impish, but compared to 1 and 2, it's close to being acceptable.

Games deserve to be played in their entirety forever, regardless of when they came out, yet this year saw so many of them unceremoniously delisted by publishers…

You know how the bee-bee-bee-bee-beep of a laser-targeting Guardian in Breath of the Wild can completely ruin your day? It doesn't have to be this way. Reddit user RinHara5aki has discovered yet another weird trick within the game that can save Link's bum from getting exploded, and all it takes is a little bit of Magnesis.
We've already painstakingly covered the myriad ways in which you can slay a Guardian — one of the most fearsome enemies in Breath of the Wild — and even the fact that you can ride them. But it turns out that the big metal chaps are easy to defang, too.

        <updated>2021-12-17T14:37:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot on the heels of Ghostbusters: Afterlife, it seems a new game based on everyone’s favorite busters could be on the way. 
That’s according to Winston Zeddemore actor, Ernie Hudson, at least. Hudson told YouTube channel Countdown City Geeks that a new one is on the way and that scheduling for recording voice-over is underway, as reported by Nintendo Life. Hudson also said fellow Ghostbuster Dan Aykroyd, who plays Ray Stantz in the films, is attached to the game as well.

“I just got an email because we’re doing another video game,” Hudson told Countdown City Geeks. “They’re scheduling it now to do the recording and I’m not too sure [who is] going to do it. I know me and [Dan Aykroyd], I think. I’m not sure [if Bill Murray] will do anything on it. So, there will be another video game…When they’ll bring it out, I don’t know, but it’s definitely happening.” 
Speaking further about the game, Hudson said whoever is developing it is sending him “prototypes of the character to get the image right.” He said the team seems to have a hard time creating his image, citing that while whoever is developing it is able to nail down Murray and Aykroyd’s likeness, he always ends up “looking like Eddie Murphy or somebody.” 
At the time of this writing, whatever Ghostbusters game Hudson is referring to has not been officially announced so it seems the actor let slip something he (probably) wasn’t supposed to. While waiting to learn more, check out our thoughts on the 2009 game in Game Informer’s Ghostbusters review and then read about how it was recently remastered and re-released in 2019. Check out Game Informer’s review of the 2016 Ghostbusters game after that.

They didn't have much to say about it at the time, but last night they announced it properly. Named Nine Sols, it's an action platformer with combat inspired by Sekiro. Honestly, they still don't have much to say about it beyond that, but they have released a gorgeous poster featuring a cat-like character that you can see in full below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix and Marvel have revealed a new collaboration with Adidas in the form of six new sneakers inspired by the universe’s most unlikely team. 
Announced today, this collection will launch in 2022 and feature six unique shoes, each inspired by one of the Guardians. There are two based on Eidos Montreal’s take on Star-Lord, and then one for Gamora, Drax, Groot, and Rocket. However, Square Enix did not reveal the price for any of these sneakers so we’ll likely learn more sometime next year. 
“A key starting point for the design of each sneaker was the unique visual cues from each of the characters – whether it’s the stitching details on Star-Lord’s leather jacket, Groot’s earthy color palette, or Drax’s unmistakeable tattoos,” Adidas senior designer James Liu said in a press release. “From there, we wanted to inlay various design discovery elements that helped further bring the story of reach character to life. Bringing it all together across the collection are unique signifiers for this original take on Guardians of the Galaxy as a Super Hero team – with matching sockliners, hang tags, labels, and packaging.” 
For more information about the collaboration and how the shoes came to be, you can read Square Enix’s full interview with Liu here. As for what the shoes are, here’s what you can expect: Star-Lord Forum Hi 84, Star-Lord Forum Mid, Gamora ZX 2K Boost 2.0, Drax Ozelia, Groot NMD R1, and Rocket ZX 1K Boost. Here’s what each looks like:

If you haven’t yet played Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, you should – it’s great, and you can read about why in Game Informer’s Guardians of the Galaxy review. Find out which awards Guardians of the Galaxy took home at The Game Awards 2021 and then read about this patch that added ray-tracing to the game after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Epic Games Store Holiday Sale started today, with lots of discounts and that but more importantly: 15 days of free video games. They're starting with one that I'm certainly curious enough to play for free but not buy: Shenmue 3. Yeah gwan, I'll grab that. Epic are also going wild with coupons again, giving a £10 (or $10) coupon on every game you buy which costs at least £13.99 (or $14.99). Given Epic's habit of paying for timed exclusives, they do have discounts on some games you'll not get elsewhere, or at least not with those vouchers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IGN published a new report last Friday detailing a toxic work culture at Bungie, including sexism, crunch, and an HR department that protects abusers, amongst other problems such as stories of repeated microaggressions, inequality, and more. IGN spoke to 26 current and former employees of Bungie to create this report and, just under a week after its publishing, Bungie’s head of HR, Gayle d’Hondt, has stepped down. 
d’Hondt announced this to Bungie employees by email yesterday, and IGN saw said email in full. The former head of HR said she wants to do “everything in my power to make sure everyone who works here has a safe, welcoming, and supportive environment.” In doing so, d’Hondt said she feels Bungie’s leadership team needs to move forward with people new, or rather, people that haven’t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me slap you with the caveat up front. Halo Infinite's best place is its open world, through which you can swing like a honking metal Tarzan and do sweet Warthog jumps from cliffs. But its best level, the most satisfying A-to-B gun boulevard, comes late in the campaign (spoilers ahead). The House Of Reckoning is a series of rooms where contrived artificial battlefields have been constructed inside an alien fortress. They are abstractly human structures surrounded by sand, as if your extraterrestrial enemies have been playing house but believe a homo sapiens' house looked exactly like a chunk of Normandy beach circa 1944. The narrative reasoning behind this level is absurd. But the fights that occur within are excellent.

It seems 343 Industries listened to feedback because yesterday, during a Halo Holiday 2021 livestream, the studio’s head of design, Jeff Hook, detailed various changes coming to Fracture: Tenrai when the event returns in January, as reported by Eurogamer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Red Candle Games is the team behind well-received horror games Devotion and Detention, but it teased a seemingly less spooky new project in March. The studio released a brief clip of a 2D action game labeled as a work in progress, and today we have a title and a hint at what the adventure entails.
The game is called Nine Sols, and Red Candle Games describes it on Twitter as a “hand-drawn 2D action platformer with Sekiro-inspired deflection-focused combat.” The game stars a vengeful hero on a journey to kill nine rulers, called Sols, of a forgotten realm inspired by Asian fantasy. This world was also home to an ancient alien race. The official art posted below reveals the protagonist’s cat-like appearance (which was obscured by a hat in the demo clip).
Nine Sols doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms, so it’s probably a ways off. Still, given the quality of Red Candle Games' horror titles, it’s exciting to see the team tackle something outside of what's become their usual wheelhouse. 
In the meantime, check out our review of Red Candle Games' most recent release, Devotion.]]></summary>

Before we get to that, though, we must first discuss (at length) whether 200 t-shirts is a lot of t-shirts, what Nate is having for his Christmas dinner, what kind of cop duo would be named Halloumi & Date, and also what our favourite Christmas songs are.

The company has also offered up additional free game-time to players who own the game or have an active subscription, adding another 14 days of time on top of the seven announced last week. This news comes by way of an FFXIV Lodestone blog post made yesterday by director and producer Naoki Yoshida. Yoshida originally issued warnings of expected Endwalker congestion in November and as predicted, the servers filled up immediately, with some players hitting queues with over 5000 people ahead of them.

It’s not surprising, though, considering the MMO added 1 million new players ahead of Endwalker’s launch.

The original's bombing mission sequence, which sees Cloud and co. blow up a planet-killing mako reactor in the industrialised hellhole of Midgar's city centre, was already one of the Final Fantasy series' best openers, but here we get to really luxuriate in every last detail of its twenty-four-year glow-up. Director Tetsuya Nomura may have a reputation for excess in JRPG circles (both in his tangled storylines and his passion for buckles and belts), but in FF7R that tendency toward indulgence has been applied with deadly, laser-like precision.

More recently, Nvidia went a step further, quietly launching a brand new version of the RTX 2060 that doubles its VRAM to 12GB.


Emphasis on the “quietly”, mind – even if you’ve been regularly checking for available GPU stock or perusing our graphics cards deals guide, you probably won’t have even noticed there’s a 12GB RTX 2060 knocking around. So what’s the deal with this mysterious card, and should you even consider buying an RTX 20 series card in this day and age?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Gunk might not be the most sophisticated name in the universe for a gooey black jelly that pulses with an ominous red light, but goodness it sure is appropriate. As space haulers Rani and Becks touch down on a forgotten planet in search of a strange energy signal, the place is absolutely gummed up with the stuff. It oozes and throbs in the caves, plains and rivers of this once vibrant landscape, and the urge to suck it all up into Rani's chunky power glove (a literal hand vac in this case) is overwhelmingly strong. After all, when it turns the ground black and saps the world of all its colour, this is one case of Extremely Bad Vibes you'll want to remedy as soon as possible. 
Your reward for scooping up all the gunk in any given area is the kind of graphical wizardry video games do best. A burst of light, a shruum of sound, and the world is instantly transformed back to its former glory. Despite its gloopy namesake, The Gunk is frequently stunning, its soft pastels and coral-esque flora showing such an eye for jaw-dropping visuals that it's hard to believe this is SteamWorld developer Image & Form's first ever 3D video game. If this is what they've been holding back on all these years, then their upcoming action adventure SteamWorld Headhunter should be a real treat for the old eyeballs. That said, while Image & Form have clearly navigated their 2D to 3D transition from an art perspective, their typical flair for adding their own spin to different genres has been less successful. There's a lot to like about this 3D action platformer, but it's missing that spark to really make it sing.

I began The Gunk with eager anticipation, blasting across the swirling clouds of the cosmos. The opening cinematic is beautiful and full of promise. Unfortunately, it is also the apex of the short game’s trajectory. In a game filled with alien worlds splashed with color and populated with extraterrestrial mysteries, The Gunk falls surprisingly flat. Fortunately, this spacecraft manages to stay afloat with likable characters, solid gameplay, and a serviceable story.

Babble Royale is a new Scrabble-like battle royale where 16 players fight to be the last letters standing. You have to make words in such a way that you escape a zone that's closing in, and attack other players by building words off of theirs. I honestly didn't think it would work, but man, it absolutely does.

Recent entries like Odyssey received an impressive amount of post-release content in its first year. But even after releasing several successful, large-scope expansions in 2021, Valhalla is going strong and appears ready to outpace its predecessor by continuing its Viking voyage into a second year.
The Dawn of Ragnarök is the centerpiece of that ongoing rollout, a major new expansion set to be released in late winter, aiming to add a considerable chunk of new missions, environments to explore, and even gameplay-altering new character powers. That major expansion is steering toward launch in March, but you don’t need to wait that long to get…]]></summary>

After showing what Horizon Forbidden West looks and runs like on PS5, Guerrilla Games has given the world a glimpse at what Aloy's next adventure looks like on the previous Sony console. 
In a tweet, Guerrilla offered a peek at four screenshots from Forbidden West running on PlayStation 4 hardware. While it doesn't say whether the captures came from a PS4 amateur or a PS4 Pro, the vistas on display are still stunning to behold. Take a glance at the lush jungle flora with a mechanical bird hovering overhead, a desolate desert settlement, the Tallneck in all of its towering glory, and Aloy strolling through a pond riding atop what looks to be the horse-like Strider.

These images do look great, and yes, I'm sure if you put them next to their PS5 counterparts, you can nitpick which details may be missing, or how far the draw distance for LODs are. But instead, we're going to take this preview of the rare PS4 visuals and celebrate how good they look on their own merits. If the performance side of the game pans out as well as these stills have, last-gen PlayStation owners may not feel as much pressure to find an elusive PS5 before Horizon Forbidden West's February 18 release.]]></summary>

Featuring the painterly and lush art style of A Plague Tale: Innocence, if one thing was clear with Requiem’s announcement, it’s that publisher Focus Entertainment and developer Asobo Studio are planning to up the ante. Today’s batch of in-game screenshots is proof of that. 
Released on Twitter earlier today, these four screenshots showcase some of what we can expect in Requiem. Based on what we know of the game so far, these screenshots show Amicia and Hugo in new cities south of France, which is the primary setting of the sequel.

Development duties are being headed by Ubisoft Toronto, and the game will be built on the company’s ever-present Snowdrop engine.
The reboot was announced after years of speculation regarding what the next step was for stealth icon Sam Fisher. In an article on the Ubisoft website, word of Splinter Cell’s resurrection comes alongside an interview with developers working on refreshing the series. Producer Matt West sheds some light on the team’s ideas for the project, saying, “To me, a remake takes what you’d do in a remaster and goes a little bit further with it.” He goes on to state the plan is to stick close t…]]></summary>

A new narrative campaign for Terminator: Resistance just launched last week, and our war against the machines will bleed into 2022 with the newly announced RTS game, Terminator: Dark Fate – Defiance. Developer Cats Who Play and publisher Slitherine today released the first details and two short videos that give us glimpses at how this future war will unfold for PC players.
Set in the same universe as the Terminator: Dark Fate film from 2019, Defiance delivers a campaign experience that puts you in the role of the Founders faction's commander and asks you to keep the last remnants of humanity alive. You may even have the chance to deal a devastating blow to the Legion's machines. As you make progress, you'll rally allies to your cause, but the choices you make could have consequences.

Cats Who Play revealed details that your weapons and vehicles will take on damage, meaning armor and hull integrity could wear thin over time and leave your troops vulnerable. If a building collapses, the physics-based debris could devastate your efforts. You can also use physics to your advantage to take out well-fortified enemy strongholds.
If you'd rather play as the machines, you'll get the chance to do that in the multiplayer and skirmish modes. In these avenues of play, you can control the Founders, Legion, and Resistance. For multiplayer, the battles can be 1v1, 2v1, or 2v2.
Cats Who Play hopes to have Defiance out in 2022, although no specific date or season has been announced at this time.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nerves have been sufficiently jangled as of late, not least thanks to the slew of action packed games that have landed in recent months. I crave an altogether more sedate beginning to next year, and so my mind turns to games in which violence, reflex or any other kind of unblinking attentiveness takes a back seat. 
Looking for a broader mixture of games? Check out our regularly updated list of the best PC games you can play right now.
Primarily we're talking violence-free games here, but I wanted to drill a little deeper than that - so nothing that generally requires a competitive streak. I'm chasing a certain feel rather than a certain category. Flying, walking, puzzling, driving, building, dreaming, climbing, stretching, swinging (not like that), swimming, wondering: these are just a few of the ways in which flashing pixels can make you feel a very different sort of accomplishment.

They’re expensive, often cumbersome, drastically over-designed things that lean way too heavily into the g4m3r aesthetic, and that’s coming from someone who’s built up something of a tolerance to it from years of unprotected RGB exposure. I’ve sat on them and have even shared homes with some of them, but have never, ever seen the appeal over a halfway decent office chair.


And then the Noblechairs Epic TX comes along, and it’s got me rethinking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Herschel “Guy” Beahm IV, known by most as Dr. Disrespect, has launched a “AAA game studio” with former Call of Duty and Halo developers. 
Beahm is one of the more well-known streamers out there, be it the audience numbers he pulls in when streaming or his public ban from Twitch after streaming inside of an E3 bathroom. He’ll still be streaming, but he’s now making the jump to the game development side of video games by way of new studio Midnight Society. 
Welcome to Midnight Society /// https://t.co/xuTZGJskyx pic.twitter.com/RWWQSaXcGY
December 14, 2021
“We flip the tables on the traditional video game development model and embrace the ‘Day Zero Community,’” the Midnight Society website reads. “That means including our players – yes, you – from the earliest most inception. That could be testing reload times and recoil patterns on a firing range or jumping in for the first-ever PVP sessions. No more ‘I hope this game will be good.’ Be there when your voice can actually make an impact because we want to hear it. Really.” 
As for what to expect from Midnight Society, the studio does not have a formal announcement for a game. However, all signs point to a multiplayer shooter. Be it Beahm’s involvement, former Call of Duty and Halo developers, the mention of “reload times and recoil patterns in a firing range” or the job listing description that urges possible employees to “step up, strap in, and start defining the next best competitive multiplayer experiences, period,” it seems Midnight Society’s first game will be a shooter.

The website features some images, too – seen above – that might hint at what the team’s first game could be. It might be concept art, but it could also be nothing related to whatever Midnight Society is working on as well. We'll see sometime in the future.

That’s one thing I learned from my time with this kung-fu caper. To keep my fists flowing, I needed to be patient, and not mash the buttons. Seriously, slap those buttons with zero thought and you’re dead.
Death in Sifu means you age, and if you die lots, you age faster. Hit 70 and you won’t be rising from the dirt again. Instead, you'll have to start your quest for vengeance over from the beginning. While it can be tempting to cling onto your youth for this reason alone, I actually liked growing old, with my beard and my harder-hitting attacks. Not only do you develop a relationship with your body in Sifu, but your trips to the afterlife also help you master its myriad of moves. Sifu really does get better with age.

        <updated>2021-12-15T15:51:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony Pictures Entertainment released the first official trailer for its upcoming Uncharted movie, starring Tom Holland as Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg as Victor “Sully” Sullivan, back in October and it featured plenty of iconic sequences from Naughty Dog’s action-adventure series. 
That trailer led many to speculate that while Uncharted takes place before the Naughty Dog games, opting to go with a much younger Nathan Drake, the movie would be touching on each of the games in some way. For example, we see the iconic cargo-plane-over-a-desert sequence from Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception in the trailer. We also see Chloe Frazer in the trailer, a character who doesn’t appear in the games until Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, and the main antagonist seems pulled right out of Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune. 
If you were looking for a tie or connection to Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, the newest poster released by Fandango today has you covered. 
As you can see in the poster, it’s quite reminiscent of Uncharted 4, or rather, one of the final settings in it. Near the end of Uncharted 4, our cast is swinging from pirate ship to pirate ship in search of pirate gold and an escape from a ruined pirate city. Nathan Drake eventually makes his way to what is basically a pirate ship graveyard and it looks a lot like what’s seen in the background of this new poster. 
As for how Uncharted will tackle this connection to Uncharted 4 – which mind you, is just speculation for now, but like, come on, look at it – alongside the nods to the other Uncharted games, we’ll have to wait and see when Uncharted is released in theaters on February 18. All that’s left now is to hint at The Lost Legacy and Golden Abyss. 
While waiting for this movie to release, check out the first official trailer and then check out this look at Nolan North, the voice actor of Nathan Drake, on set with Holland.  Are you excited about Uncharted? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

The aptly named Diamond and Pearl factions (Arceus takes place in the Sinnoh region, after all) are factions you'll interact with in addition to the previously revealed Galaxy Expedition Team. 
Both clans share a deep respect for Pokémon though they are divided by their opposing philosophies. The Diamond clan, led by the daring Adaman and his Leafeon partner, values living in the moment with your allies. The Pearl clan cherishes the land itself, and its leader Irida, along with her Glaceon, is suspicious of newcomers. The trailer also introduces Ginkgo Guild Merchants, a traveling guild you’ll purchase goods from.

Ringu was first released in 1998 in Japan by director Hideo Nakata before it was remade as The Ring in the West by director Gore Verbinski, who would direct a trio of Pirates of the Caribbean movies for Disney (weird directorial jump, right?). Already a famous horror icon in Japan, Verbinski’s take further solidified the story of The Ring (and Ringu) as a classic in the genre. Now we’re all scared of videotapes, wells, and scary people emerging out of television screens. Behaviour Interactive will revive those fears with its newest chapter, due out in March of 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inscryption is, without a doubt, the best game I've played this year. It's creepy, surprising, and superbly fun, and now you can play the best part for as long as you please. Developer Daniel Mullins has released a "mini-expansion" in beta on Steam, which (minor spoilers ahead!) makes its animal-based card game a standalone roguelike experience. Named Kaycee's Mod, it's slightly tougher than what you might have played already, and adds new challenges too, so you can keep going back in for more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I finished watching The Game Awards reveal trailer for Rumbleverse, the new Epic-published battle royale game that looks a bit like Fortnite but with melee combat, I raised a practiced eyebrow of derision. "Well, that looks terrible," chortled I, knowing full well that I'd still give it a go at the earliest opportunity because I am an absolute sucker for battle royales.
Two things happened later that day that I did not expect. First: I got the opportunity to dive into Rumbleverse's action-packed 40-player matches far earlier than I'd anticipated, as part of a one day early look at the game. I downloaded and installed it in short order, and jumped right in. Two hours later, at 1am in the morning as the servers shut down, I happened across a second, far more unexpected thing. I found myself absolutely desperate to play more. I've sunk thousands of hours into Apex Legends, Fortnite, Plunkbat, Hunt: Showdown, Warzone, and various other behemoths of the genre. Yet those two hours I spent playing Rumbleverse might be the most fun I've ever had in a battle royale.

Sea of Stars
Sea of Stars was announced in 2020 as a prequel to Sabotage Studio’s The Messenger, and while we saw it last year, which is where we also learned that Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda is helping compose the game’s score, today’s Indie World Showcase gave us another glimpse into its beautiful world. We saw a new trailer featuring some of its turn-based combat, stunning pixel art, and we heard a taste of what Mitsuda is cooking up. But perhaps the most exciting part was that we have a release window: Holiday 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Praey for the Gods has been in Steam Early Access since 2019, but it’s officially 1.0 as of…today! Furthermore, the game is also available on consoles. 
The game has been kicking around for some time, having first been revealed in 2015. It caught our attention thanks to its Shadow of the Colossus-inspired boss battles. Set in a frozen, open world, you play as a warrior outfitted with tools such as a glider and grapple hook used to scale titans as well as mountains and other structures. As a survival game, you’ll also have to catch food and craft items/equipment to survive the unforgiving landscape. If this is your first time hearing about the title, the launch trailer below offers a good idea of what the experience entails.

For those who have been playing the game in Early Access, the final version adds two final bosses, completes the narrative, and features a swath of quality of life updates/bug fixes.
You can play Praey for the Gods on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inscryption is one of 2021’s biggest surprises in more ways than one. Outside of being a very good game (it cracked our Top 10 Games of 2021, after all) it also has a lot more going for it than it lets on. Those who have seen the adventure to its conclusion but are itching for more creepy card game goodness should be happy to hear that a small expansion is out now.
The update is called Kaycee’s Mod and serves as an endlessly replayable version of the cabin portion of the game. Players can challenge Leshy in an increasingly difficult series of card battles, with each level unlocking new cards, challenges, and even developer logs recorded by the expansions’ namesake. If you’ve completed Inscryption, you know the significance of that last bit. 
❗️Inscryption: Kaycee's Mod❗️
https://t.co/ohMNIFpK6F pic.twitter.com/c7sfQHHNFi
December 14, 2021
To access Kaycee’s Mod, you’ll have to right-click on Inscryption in your Steam library. Select “Properties”, click the “Betas” tab, and punch in the code “givemeascensionmode”. Once you’re at the start screen, hit Shift+K+M to unlock the mod. Creator Daniel Mullens also warns that players should probably back up their save files prior to accessing Kaycee’s Mod. 
In a Steam post, Mullens explains that Kaycee’s Mod is a thank you to everyone who’s played Inscryption and that he wanted to appease fans who really enjoyed the Leshy’s Cabin chapter of the game. The expansion is billed as a beta, so expect some eventual balance changes as well as two new cards/items, more dev logs, and even a final encounter at the end of the 12th level.

Paralives is a life sim game that may even have the chops to topple The Sims' supremacy when it launches. This video of the character creation is the beefiest look at Paralives we've had for a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of our relaunched supporter program this year, we've been busy organising lots of great free game keys for RPS premium supporters. Admittedly, the last two we've done (Darkest Dungeon and Wartales) have both been quite small with only limited numbers of codes available, but I'm pleased to say we've finally put together that long-awaited 'big' free game drop that all premium supporters will be able to get involved with. 
That next free game is Plunder Panic, a swashbuckling pirate 'em up in which teams of up to six players battle it out on the high seas. Here's how to get your copy.

        <updated>2021-12-13T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fights In Tight Spaces is about one specific trope that all the spy movies I’ve seen love to use: our main character’s got to a part in the story where they can relax a bit, inevitably they let their guard down, and on cue, a mystery assassin erupts from the shadows to take advantage of the opportunity. The hero’s got nothing but their brawn to make it out, but then, surprise! They actually use brains instead. Nobody ever saw it coming. The thing is, watching those movies, we all know the main character’s not really going to die. I mean, it’s called The Bourne Identity. There’d be no movie without a Bourne! (The Jeremy Renner one doesn’t count.)
Instead of non-stop fast and frenetic action, Fights In Tight Spaces goes for a different approach, and dissects those same action sequences into a turn-based battle. Rather than the scene being a choreographed piece of stunt and camera work that’s over in a matter of seconds, it’s a roguelike deckbuilder that puts the player in charge of every minute decision an action hero would have to make in one of those situations. Which means, if that untouchable main character dies at any point, it was because of what you did. Most of the time anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I usually don't like comparing games when I review them, but I have a funny feeling I'm not the only one that was reminded of other moody puzzle-platformers when I first saw White Shadows. It's a game that features a monotone colour pallette, a dystopian setting, an incredibly abstract story and the first few minutes had me pushing around boxes to get past obstacles, so yes, it will remind you of Playdead's Limbo or Inside. White Shadows gets close to growing its own wings and taking off, thanks to an incredible emphasis on musical sections and cinematic presentation. Sadly, some uninspired puzzles and an incoherent final act clip its wings before it gets to soar.

Original story:
Later today, Ubisoft will announce something new for Assassin's Creed Valhalla. They're not yet saying what it is but because Ubisoft either can't or won't keep a secret, leaks have sprung up. According to supposed screenshots and store info, it's an expansion named Dawn Of Ragnarok with a lot of fantasy fanciness, journeying into Norse legend with Odin and dwarves and giants and that.

Swings and roundabouts, or in this case, new islands and a frustrating feature that meant some of your shots wouldn't hit their target. Thankfully Raven Software realised it wasn't the most popular addition to the game and have begun the process of patching it out entirely. But it'll take time to fully remove.

In future I won't have to produce my own Radio Edit, however. During last night's Game Awards, Microsoft announced that the service, on PC, is now simply called PC Game Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My mates and I are doing the dishes, discussing whether we’ll see the region of Noxus feature more prominently in the next season of Arcane, an animated series based on League Of Legends. In the air: soap bubbles and excitement. One of my friends asks me whether Jinx is like that in-game. “It’s been a while, but I think so, yeah”, I reply.
I’m in the car on the way to badminton and I’m listening to the song Dynasties & Dystopia from Arcane, the show based on League Of Legends. In the air: hip-hop and a bobbing head. Something significant has happened here. All of a sudden, I am obsessed with a game I shelved years ago, and yet I have no desire to go back. Is this next-gen? More than that, probably.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While not as flashy as a new 4K monitor or one of the best graphics cards, an SSD can make a surprisingly big difference to your PC gaming experience. Storing their data in semiconductor cells rather than old-timey spinning plates, SSDs have considerably faster transfer speeds than traditional hard disks, and so can slash loading times right down. This also makes them generally more expensive, although prices are coming down all the time, this guide to the best SSD deals right now could help you find a particularly good bargain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was wary of the possibility that White Shadows would be one of those platformers. You know the ones. The grim and depressing ones that despise you, with a child and a Stasi man, where the Stasi is actually memories of your daughter, and the child has to throw the puppy in a blender to get over a hedge.


With its stark monochrome look, ominous industrial environments, and dystopian themes, I can't really deny that White Shadows is of that genre. But while I normally get bored of depressing platformers within half an hour, I enjoyed this whole thing and even the credits.

Still, last night at The Game Awards we all got a first look at Star Wars Eclipse in the form of a cinematic trailer. And let's be honest: that trailer is cracking. It's really good. And it's so good that I think we all need to remember that there is absolutely no way QD aren't going to spectacularly boot this.

Here, at the behest of our very kind supporters, I must navigate a strange maze of specimen tanks, suggestions of whiskers, tentacles and odd wings occasionally stirring behind the glass as I pass. Eventually I will reach a row of grey filing cabinets, locate the right drawer, and tug it open, the scream of rusted metal echoing through the dark room.
I will spend some time rifling through the papers within, growing more and more frantic as I hear the slow tread of heavy footsteps approaching. I must find the right file, but also I must escape in time! I haven't been caught yet. Today I escaped with the fifth episode of The Nate Files supporters-only podcast. It's about speculative biology. Oh no.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every so often, Matthew and I will be browsing BBC iPlayer in our never-ending search for something to watch and we'll get served up some clips from the Live From The BBC comedy series. It's a few years old now, first airing in 2016 before finishing in 2018, but there is one particular episode we will watch again and again. That episode is by the Bristol-based comic Mat Ewins, who in this set appears as a self-styled adventurer, film maker and amateur video game maker promoting his latest work Adventureman 7, a sort of budget Indiana Jones meets Tomb Raider kind of deal. 
He's one of those comedians who uses a lot of multimedia in their sets, playing daft, self-made videos to help deliver punch lines. There's plenty of that nonsense in Ewins' set here, but for this occasion he also created an entire video game companion piece, styled up as a mid-90s, almost N64 / PS1-style affair in which - unsurprisingly - comedy antics ensue. Matthew and I love it to bits, and I thought that in this, the 25th anniversary year of Lara Croft, we should remember the incredible Adventureman and all of the brilliantly-bad video games he was in we never got to play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're a motorist in south west England, chances are you've probably encountered (or at least heard of) Swindon's Magic Roundabout. It's a monstrous concoction of five roundabouts smoshed together, and as far as I can see it serves no purpose other than to terrify bamboozled drivers up and down the country. I'm not kidding. In 2009 it was named the fourth scariest junction in Britain, after London's equally mega roundabout at Marble Arch, the M8 junctions in central Glasgow and Birmingham's Gravelly Hill, affectionately known as Spaghetti Junction. 
It's the kind of nightmarish urban planning I try to avoid when building my own road networks in Mini Motorways, the excellent sequel to minimalist transport sim Mini Metro, but its new Challenge City update puts all four of these real-world asphalt atrocities to shame. In this new mode, each city gets a bunch of new rules and conditions you'll need to abide by, and after playing an early version of it this week, there's one challenge that's truly diabolical. Not only does it limit the number of road tiles at your disposal, but it does so in favour of, wait for it, unlimited roundabouts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About five hours into Icarus, the new survival game from Day Z’s Dean Hall and co, I had a moment. I’d just been savaged by a bear, and had morosely jogged back over to my corpse from the respawn drop ship several miles away. It was dark, and also stormy, and also there were more bears. I desperately needed to find and reclaim my pack, stuffed with meat, tools and building supplies, which was proving difficult because your corpse just appears as a small pile of excruciatingly indiscernible brown sandbags. As the minutes dragged on, my mind flashed back to the time I spent half an hour searching for my wireless earphones amidst gails of horizontal rain on Brighton beach, shivering and still half-soaked from a foolhardy morning swim. The experience was so horrible it transcended mere discomfort and turned into, on some level, genuinely enjoyable farce. 


That’s Icarus, that is. It’s obviously flawed, wildly frustrating and frequently janky, but it’s also somehow simultaneously good enough to have kept me playing into the early morning on multiple nights without even realizing the time. It’s like Schrodinger's cat, except if the cat was a bear made of draining thirst meters. I went on to spend another 20 hours (mostly) happily within its grasp.
