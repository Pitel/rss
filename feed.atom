        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a moment in BioShock Infinite's opening act that's always stuck with me. As you emerge onto the floating city of Columbia, the game takes you on a guided tour of the sights and sounds of this airbone civilization. As you saunter through the streets, you learn about its citizens and its creator, just sort of taking it all in. The sun is shining. You're surrounded by smiles. Before you know it, an airship rises above the clouds and perches next to a hugging couple, gently swaying in the summer breeze. Aboard the ship is a barbershop quartet, cheerfully harmonising the iconic Beach Boys tune God Only Knows. It's a memorable scene, and has become an integral part of the game's lasting iconography. 


But for Tyler, Nick, Derek and Greg, this section was more than just a fun tease for the secret behind Columbia's unusual success. Self-confessed music school kids, the quartet inspired them to create their own musical group styled after Infinite's singing hairdressers. In 2023, BioShop Infinite celebrated their ninth year at PAX East, where they performed a wonderful collection of harmonised tunes to an absolutely packed community room - and we were there to film it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm beggin' darling please, Layla
We’re just a few weeks away from the launch of Redfall for Bethesda Softworks, which means it’s about time for the developer to properly introduce the characters we’ll be hunting vampires with. There are four heroes in the base game—I would be shocked if we don’t get one or two more in an expansion pack—each with unique abilities that I can’t wait to see in action. First up for the introduction videos is Layla, the telekinetic hero who can conjur umbrellas, elevators, and her undead boyfriend Jason as she fights against the things that go bump in the night.
The video gives a little bit of information on Layla’s background, focusing on the night she and Jason came face to face with a couple of bloodsuckers. Using the telekinetic powers she gained during a laboratory accident, Layla's abilities make her a good candidate for anyone attempting to solo their way through Redfall. In combat, she can manifest protective umbrellas to shield her from attacks, a Lift to reach higher places, and a ghastly version of her old beau for when she's surrounded. A versatile fighter, Layla will likely be the first fighter I go with when I get around to paying the nightmare island town of Redfall a visit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdLeBCGh1PU
Developed by Arkane Austin, the same team that gave us Prey and Dishonored, Redfall will release on May 2, 2023, for Xbox Series X|S and PC, and it will be available at launch through Xbox Game Pass. Anyone who preorders the game or plays on Game Pass will receive the Vampire Hunting Pack, which includes a shotgun, a weapon skin, and the Blood Ravager Stake Weapon Attachment, which sounds dope as hell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Be on the lookout starting April 14
We have yet another Pokemon Scarlet & Violet distribution on the horizon, and this one is already technically included in the game: Palafin. As you may know, acquiring Palafin in Scarlet & Violet is done by evolving Finizen at level 38 while using the (online) Union Circle system. Some folks haven't done this yet (or are unable to), so perhaps this distribution will help!
Here's the full tweet from the Play Pokemon Twitter account:
"Tune in for the 2023 European International Championships live stream starting April 14th for some fantastic #PokemonVG & #PokemonTCG gifts! Learn how to add Palafin to your team roster and Miraidon ex to your digital Pokémon TCG collection."

The accompanying news article has a bit more info on how it'll actually be distributed, and a confirmation that it's based on competitive Pokemon player Gavin Michael's Palafin:
"Wait for the password to appear during the 2023 EUIC broadcast, then go to the Mystery Gift feature in your game and enter the password to receive Gavin Michaels' Palafin—you can even add it to your next competitive team! This password can only be used once per save data."

So that's it! Wait for the code to arrive and enter it. Seems easy enough! We'll update you when that time comes. Until then, you can find all the info you need on the Palafin itself below.
Promo Gavin Michaels Palafin info:
Poké Ball: Cherish Ball
Gender: Female
Level: 50
Original Trainer: Gavin
Nature: Adamant

Mr. Sun's Hatbox is a brand-new roguelike that's all about stealing hats and getting the job done. Announced last year for PC and consoles, we can exclusively reveal that the game will also be coming to Switch, and you don't have long to wait to become a bonnet burglar, as the game launches on 20th April.
Developed by Kenny Sun, who has previously worked on the "Tinder for aliens" game Tender: Creature Comforts, Mr Sun's Hatbox throws you into a world where you need to embark on dangerous, ridiculous missions to gather as many hats as you can. It's an intricate mission, one that you need to build your own base for and create an entire organisation to become the ultimate trilby tea leaf.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's weird that Road 96 has gotten a prequel, because it only came out about six months ag- what's that? A year and a half? Good lord. Still, it seems a slightly odd move, because Road 96 - a first person hitchhiking choose 'em up about the collective action of wayward teens bringing down a totalitarian government - doesn't really need a prequel. On top of that, Road 96: Mile 0 is a sequel to developer DigixArt's first game Lost In Harmony, a musical runner about skateboarder Kaito whose fiend Aya is dying of a terminal illness.
In Mile 0, Kaito and his family have moved to a small gated town called White Sands, in the 90s USA-adjacent dictatorship Petria, and made best friends with Zoe, who 96ers will remember as a recurring NPC from that game. Zoe is the daughter of an important minister and lives in the nice part of town; Kaito's parents are workers who are forced to live on the wrong side of the tracks. Through a combination of Road 96-style character-driven vignettes and Lost In Harmony-style rhythm action tracks, the two come to the conclusion they must leave White Sands. If you played Road 96 you kind of already know how Mile 0 has to end.

Developer Heart Core has announced that the boss rush game Gripper will be getting several quality-of-life updates in the coming weeks and months, adding a sizeable list of additions and improvements that should prove welcome for players.
Primarily, since the game currently only has one difficulty option, the team is implementing three unique difficulty settings based on player feedback: Normal, Hard, and Impossible. It's also been confirmed that Normal and Hard modes will include new checkpoints in the 'Tunnels' sections of the game, which should provide some respite.

The question comes courtesy of Bloodyhell, who asked: When did you know that you not only wanted to play games, but to write about what you played? And, does writing about games ever dampen your enthusiasm when you are dealing with deadlines and putting words on a page?
A sneaky double-part question, there, but both good questions nonetheless. So come and find out our collective origin stories, and whether any of us have cried tears of pain and regret over the years after turning our favourite hobby into an actual job.

It's a promise of all the myriad adventures to come. And despite some fundamental changes in genre and perspective, it's something that the team behind the upcoming Minecraft Legends has tried hard to preserve.
I recently was treated to the most in-depth look so far at Minecraft Legends, in an hour-long livestream which gave us all some much needed answers on what manner of beast Legends actually is. It's a curious blend of action adventure and RTS, one that shares Minecraft's focus on exploration, but guides the player down a stricter, simpler path of summoning friendly mobs and constructing defences to repel a Piglin invasion. This will likely be a solid introduction to the RTS genre for a lot of players, but I came away unsure about whether the game will have enough depth to keep its prospective playerbase's attention.

The beloved action RPG — which initially launched on GameCube in 2003 — made it to Switch back in February in a remaster based on the Japan-only PS2 port. Yet many reported multiple bugs, glitches, and issues with the remaster, with some calling it "worse than the original", comparing it unfavourably to the PS3 remaster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last night ID@Xbox held their latest showcase to spotlight all sorts of indies. One of the highlights was the cute deduction game Lil’ Guardsman, a riff on Papers, Please where you work on a guard post, choosing to accept or refuse entry for fantasy folk wanting to get into the city. Or you can just jail them. It looks like lighthearted fun, and it’ll be hitting PC and consoles later this year.

Remedy’s time-bending Quantum Break - part superpowered shooter, part live-action TV show - has been delisted on Steam and The Microsoft Store. The game’s Steam page is still up, but it’s no longer available for purchase on PC or Xbox consoles. Publisher Microsoft had already confirmed the game would be “temporarily” removed from Game Pass (for console, it was never on the PC version) due to licensing issues, although there was no word on a removal from storefronts.

The Pokémon European International Championships take place in London next weekend,, and during the event, The Pokémon Company will be distributing a limited-time code for a Pokémon to add to your Scarlet & Violet team.
The code — which will be shared on stream — is for Palafin, the pure Water-type dolphin Pokémon (thanks, Serebii!) that's become pretty infamous for its Zero to Hero Ability. Swapping out the harmless dolphin, and then bringing it back in, reveals a muscular bi-pedal dolphin creature with huge stat increases. It's a menace, to say the least.

Nintendo is offering to reimburse players who don't wish to transfer their Wii U and/or 3DS eShop credit to Switch, following their closure at the end of March. This has only been announced for Japan so far.
OatmealDome shared and translated the announcement from Nintendo's official Japanese Twitter account, and from 6th April 2023 to March 2025, those in Japan can contact Nintendo to get money back on their untransferred eShop credit, if they wish to do so. Obviously, if users have already amalgamated their balances from Wii U and 3DS to Switch, then the service is unavailable.

While we're sure many fans out there are already dreaming of adaptations like The Legend of Zelda and Metroid series, there is "probably nothing to announce in the near future" even though Nintendo Pictures is now officially a thing. This shouldn't be all that surprising to hear given how long it took Nintendo and Illumination to complete the Mario Movie. Here's Miyamoto's response in full:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The VP seems to have left following Stadia's downturn
Phil Harrison, the former head of Stadia at Google, has reportedly left the company.
A new report from Business Insider said that Harrison left Google around the time when it shut down the Stadia streaming service. Though no official statement's been made as of this writing, Harrison's LinkedIn does reflect the change, with his departure from Google marked at April 2023.
Harrison has been around the games industry for quite a while, working at both Sony and Microsoft over the years. He joined Google in 2018, taking the lead on the company's efforts to start up the cloud streaming service Stadia. Harrison even took the stage at GDC 2019 to unveil this vision for a streaming future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUih5C5rOrA
Of course, we all remember how Stadia turned out. In 2021, Google shut down its internal development projects for Stadia, saying it would not be investing further in bringing exclusive content from its internal development team. At the time, Harrison cited the "exponentially" rising costs of creating "best-in-class games from the ground up."
Then, a year later, Google officially closed the curtain on Stadia. All hardware purchases made through the Google Store would be refunded, and in January of this year, the service officially shuttered. Harrison wrote in a blog post that the technology hadn't "gained the traction with users" that Google expected.
The clouds set
There's been no formal announcement, and no indication of what may be next for Harrison. As for Stadia, well, that's just about through.
Google recently told Axios in an interview that it's been selling a bundle of services to publishers, moving into the role of tech partner for live-service publishers.

Even just looking at screenshots of the game recalls the best of the era, and that’s not an accident. Developer Sabotage Studio’s CEO and Sea of Stars’ creative director, Thierry Boulanger, is a huge fan of the genre and has been building towards making a game like this since he started building the fantasy world Sea of Stars and The Messenger takes place in during Elementary school.
Dozens of classic RPGs inspired Sea of Stars’ development, including Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, but we asked Boulanger to pick the most significant ones in the video below.

I’ve been writing up kusoge games on a near-weekly basis for two years now. I’m up to 65 articles, if my count is right. That’s a lot of bad. But you know what? Sometimes I enjoy it. I have some good memories of the bad games I’ve been sharing with you.
Kusoge is a portmanteau of the Japanese word “kuso,” meaning crap, and “gēmu,” for game. Crap game. However, the term "kusoge" has a certain degree of affection behind it, sort of like “Eurojank.” The game may be poorly made, it might be excruciating to play, but there’s something that makes it worthwhile. Maybe it’s broken in a hilarious way. Perhaps you can tell that the developer really tried their best in poor circumstances. Or maybe the design is such a trainwreck that you can’t look away. Whatever the reason, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Straw Hats are back
It looks like Luffy and the gang aren't quite done with their RPG escapades yet. Bandai Namco is working on a new story DLC for One Piece Odyssey called Reunion of Memories, and it's coming soon.
There's no indication of a date just yet, but today's teaser trailer lays out some of the narrative groundwork. Much like the story of One Piece Odyssey itself, Reunion of Memories looks to be diving back into the storied past of the manga series. Lim, the young woman from Waford who played a key role in Odyssey, looks to be the focal point again, as the team is contending with a Dark Lim doppelganger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LpM5Yc9-Io
In a message from the game's producer, Katsuaki Tsuzuki, it's said that one of the key points of this One Piece Odyssey DLC is the theme of "new hidden story with bonds." It will also focus heavily on battles, and the team recommends clearing the main story before tackling the DLC.
There will also be some new characters that weren't in the main game. The full roster isn't being confirmed yet, but Tsuzuki says you may be surprised to find other characters "where you least expect them." More details are on the way soon.
Additionally, since release, the team has been listening to feedback and player requests, some of which have already been implemented in patches since launch.
The quest never ends
One Piece is still one of those series that I'm aware of but have never really personally dug into. That said, Odyssey seems like it was an interesting exploration of the fiction, if nothing else. I certainly respect the effort to try and tell the tale in an RPG format.
For those hoping for deeper One Piece cuts in their Odyssey, I hope they get what they want when the Reunion of Memories DLC hits.

For a while, Nintendo kind of took a silent approach to the "Joy-Con drift" Switch hardware issues. Eventually, the number of impacted consumers hit critical mass and they had to respond: by offering free repairs. Although Europe and the UK have done this on a case-by-case basis (and not necessarily out of warranty): that's changing now with a grander, more sweeping statement on the Nintendo EU support pages. In other words, the UK and Europe are getting a little deal-sweetener as of this month.
Here's the full statement from Nintendo of Europe about the situation:

Before I begin, let me discuss the article I planned to write about The Last of Us on PC.
I agreed to cover the PC port of this game because, somehow, in 2023, I do not know a single thing about The Last of Us. I've dodged all story spoilers, and I deliberately avoided the HBO series so I could play this game completely blind. My logic was this would be a refreshing take, especially with the impending decade anniversary of the original game’s release. I even workshopped some jokes about how I was too busy grinding Pokemon effort values at the time to play one of the most critically acclaimed video games ever made.
I mean, what else was I going to talk about? The performance?

The Resident Evil 4 chainsaw controller is one of the best controllers ever made. Wait, did I say best? Good, because I meant best.
As a quick history lesson for those who need it, the chainsaw controller was a novelty peripheral manufactured by NubyTech that launched alongside the original Resident Evil 4 in 2005. It retailed for $49.99 and, for all intents and purposes, was just a weirdly shaped GameCube controller. Despite some PR jargon explaining how the chainsaw controller will improve your Resident Evil 4 experience (it didn’t), this thing primarily existed for collectors to display as a vanity item.
If you'd like to learn more about this curiosity, I recommend you check out the excellent "Stop Skeletons From Fighting" video about the subject.

        <updated>2023-04-05T18:11:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want it
I'm a pretty huge fan of Magolor in the Kirby mythos. He's formidable and cute! Just like Meta Knight, it's a fantastic combination of shonen-level anime appeal. Frankly, he needs his own game (but I'll have to settle for his own mode for now). However you feel about him, you can enjoy one of Kirby's greatest frenemies on a canvas bag as a My Nintendo US reward.
Here's the full description of the bag from Nintendo:
"This sturdy canvas pouch has a zipper closure, so it’s the perfect place to store treasured items. Featuring the powerful pink puff Kirby and the mysterious cosmic traveler Magolor."

So it's a bag.
It's 500 Platinum Points (which is on the median/low end for many rewards), so if you want it, get it! Although rewards generally stay up for a decent amount of time and occasionally come back in stock, nothing is guaranteed on My Nintendo: especially with supply chain woes continually rearing up.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

The New Game Plus update for God of War Ragnarok is live today, giving players a good reason to hop back in if they didn't get enough the first time around. It adds a pretty decent amount of content for a new run too, from new armor to enchantments and more.
Today's PlayStation blog runs down the specifics, including the basics: this is NG+, so all your equipment, weapons, and skills will carry over from a previous save. This includes the Draupnir Spear, though it comes with a caveat. Sonic and Hex arrows will still require players to reach the point in the story where they become available. Also, areas requiring either the arrows or the Spear to reach will not unlock until you've reached the main questline's point where they become available. Sorry, still s…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The universe is always expanding
Hello Games has both announced and dropped a new update for No Man’s Sky: update 4.2, Interceptor. Or maybe. The patch notes are live, but it's not on Steam yet.
This is the jillionth update on the path of redemption for No Man’s Sky, which famously launched in a horrible state. The Interceptor update brings with it a continuation to the game’s story while introducing corrupted planets. Hello Games also outlines a great deal of quality-of-life tweaks in its emoji-filled Tweet. There’s also a new class of ship! I’m going to show the Tweet here, but if you don’t like emojis, here’s a link to the patch notes.
https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1643599380531023874?s=20
I feel like it’s tiresome to keep bringing up that No Man’s Sky kind of sucked at launch. It’s so high profile, and 2016 was about a million years ago. It’s been a decent game for a lot longer than it was a disappointing one. However, I do wish more games got this treatment. What if they fixed Spore? What if Spore eventually became the game it was promised to be? That would have been pretty cool.
There’s also a new trailer for the Interceptor update, and I am so lapsed on this game that I have absolutely no context for what’s going on. But, with that said, I think I might reinstall it and see if I get sucked in this time.
https://youtu.be/REQmGvAtHu0
No Man’s Sky: Interceptor is available now for Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for an excuse to break out that Leviathan Axe for another adventure? As of today, there's a new update for God of War Ragnarök featuring a load of new content, all built around a robust New Game Plus mode.
New Game Plus opens up for anyone who has beaten the game, and all of your equipment and skills will come along for the ride. You also have access to all weapons, including the Draupnir Spear. However, it should be noted that areas requiring that spear to access will still remain closed until you reach the appropriate point in the story. For similar reasons, you also won’t start your new playthrough with Sonic or Hex arrows.
Several new armors show up. The most interesting is the Spartan Armor, which recalls Kratos’ look from the old days in the Greek Pantheon. While wearing it, you get no perk, no stats, and it’s locked at Power Level 1 – expect a challenge.
New Game Plus also features a new level cap, enchantments, and progression paths to improve your capabilities. Players can also tackle an expanded version of the Niflheim Arena, where you play as either Kratos or Atreus and bring along a variety of companions to help out.
Among several other additions and improvements, players can also take on a Black and White Render mode for a more cinematic playthrough.
It’s a notably large blast of new content that ensures that dedicated fans should have good reason to jump back in if they desire.
God of War Ragnarök released last November for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie is finally out today and we have some thoughts. There are thoughts about things that we liked, thoughts about things that we didn't like, and thoughts about all things in between. We managed to get a lot of these down into our review, but a movie of this size was always going to benefit from the ol' conversation treatment too, so that's exactly what we've done.
In the above video, Alex and Jim team up to discuss their thoughts on the movie, covering the story, animation, score and that all-important voice cast. While the chat steers clear of any major spoilers, the pair do discuss several plot points, so if you want to go in completely blind, we would say that this is best watched after you have seen the movie — that way, you can join in and see if you agree or disagree with our comments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That's no moon!
Italian-based studio Stormind Games came onto the scene in 2016 alongside the announcement of Remothered: Tormented Fathers, a decent survival horror game that eventually found its way onto the Switch. After its more critically panned sequel dropped two years later, the studio decided to pivot to another genre with a new project, featuring an original IP the company had more control over. This project is Batora: Lost Haven, an isometric action RPG set in an alien world. Batora launched late last year on other platforms and was met with middling reviews; now it’s come to Switch, and we understand why. Batora isn’t a bad game, but it isn’t an especially good one either.
Batora begins on a post-apocalyptic earth and places you in the role of Avril, a spunky teenager picking through the ruins of London with her best friend, Mila. Suddenly, Avril is whisked away to the alien planet of Gryja by two godlike icons of the sun and moon, who grant her their powers and name her as their champion. Avril is then charged with vanquishing the forces that destroyed Earth (and various other planets), absorbing a bunch of elemental energy from some planetary cores, and restoring balance to the universe. Or something like that.

Unsuprisingly, then, I've been very excited to get my hands on Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun, a retro FPS by Auroch Digital set within the grim-dark universe of Warhammer 40k. A retro shooter where you play as a Space Marine is so obvious a pairing it's a wonder the concept has never been tackled before, to the point where the game's own marketing materials sort of pretend that it already was back in the 90s but everyone just forgot about it.

Jason de Heras, design director on Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, agrees with me on the purple blade (a colour introduced to the canon specifically because Samuel L. Jackson wanted it for his character in the prequels). "I was like, 'we gotta have a pink lightsaber blade'," says production director Kasumi Shishido. "So whenever I play I always stick with my pink saber."
Shishido tells me the dev team focused on improving on Jedi: Fallen Order for this sequel, and one of the bigger areas where they did that was customisation. "We knew we wanted to put more resources and effort into it," she says. "There's a lot more that you can do with Cal, with BD... and just within Cal, it's not just outfits you can customise, so I'm just really excited to see what players are going to do with it."

Crackshell has been showing off snippets of their upcoming Hammerwatch II for a few years now, but today it has been fully revealed. Modus Entertainment has announced that Hammerwatch II will be coming to PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch this summer.
2013’s Hammerwatch and its spinoff, 2018’s Heroes of Hammerwatch, are something of fixtures in the indie hack-and-slash space. They’re notable for their strong co-op elements. Hammerwatch II is boasting much of the same action, but including a day/night cycle and an “entirely new” mapmaker. The press release for this also touts “smarter enemy AI,” which sounds kind of weird for a Gauntlet-like.
https://youtu.be/levsLa-NLWI
The trailer dropped alongside the announcement shows off the good stuff: ghost wolves! Also, dragons and dungeons.
The release also says that a special edition of Hammerwatch II will be available at retail stores and digitally at launch. Titled Hammerwatch II: The Chronicles Edition, this will run you $40 American dollars and include “the original remastered Hammerwatch,” as well as character color palettes, “facial items,” and a voice pack. I have no idea if this is a new remaster of Hammerwatch and what that entails, or if it's just a re-release.
I never played Hammerwatch, but Steam thinks I really should since it features heavily on the store for me. It looks cool, but having one friend is exhausting for me. I can’t imagine what it would be like to have three friends.
Hammerwatch II will be dropping on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch sometime this summer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You'll also get an "update bonus"
Fire Emblem Engage is still trucking with updates and DLC (via the expansion pass system), and we're at the end of the line with this first (and potentially only) pass today, through the game's 2.0 update. Let's quickly break down the biggest aspects of Fire Emblem Engage 2.0.
The big thing is that Wave 4 of the expansion pass is now live. Titled Fell Xenologue, it includes new characters, maps, locations, and class types as a micro-expansion of sorts. This is on top of the prior three waves which really were micro-DLC, with smaller skirmishes and the ability to recruit spirits. 2.0 also adds more "update bonuses," which can be acquired upon entering the Somniel: the game's core hub.
The other tidbit (which is going to be either useless or a cool perk depending on how much you engage with Nintendo's mobile side) includes a "collaboration" with Fire Emblem Heroes, which basically involves bonus items. Bug fixes have also been deployed in a typically vague fashion.
There's nothing too exciting on offer here unless you're diving into Fell Xenologue. You can check out the full patch notes for Fire Emblem Engage 2.0 below.
Fire Emblem Engage 2.0 patch notes (full link)
Ver. 2.0.0 (Released April 4, 2023)
General Updates
Compatible with Wave 4 of the Expansion Pass.
Update Bonus has been added. You can receive items when entering the Somniel from Chapter 5 or later.
Collaboration content with the smartphone app “Fire Emblem Heroes” can now be downloaded for free from the Nintendo eShop.

You can receive items when entering the Somniel after downloading the data from the eShop.
Note that players who have already downloaded the bonuses from linking with “Fire Emblem Heroes” cannot download the content again.
Issues have been fixed to make for a more pleasant gaming experience.

Dig out your best crowd-fighting paraphernalia, as The Pokemon Company has announced that its staggeringly popular Pokemon Center London is returning to the British capital next week — From April 14-16, 2023, fans of the cuddly critters will have to opportunity to bag themselves exclusive merchandise, from clothing to plush toys, available only at the "pop-up" retailer.
The Pokemon Center London has appeared twice before within the city's walls, firstly during the fall of 2019, where poor planning and understated demand saw fans queuing for up to five hours daily to bag themselves shirts, hats, bags and, the centerpiece of the store, a plush doll of Pikachu dressed up as a Little City Gent. Following a postponement in 2020, (amidst the burgeoning COVID-19 pandemic), the pop-up store eventually returned in the summer of 2022, running alongside the Pokemon World Championships.

If you fancy making the trip to next week's opening, then you'll need to book yourself a timeslot over on the store's official website. This virtual queuing system hopes to eliminate the chaos of the 2019 event, though it should still be noted that merchandise will likely be sold on a first-come, first-served basis, with the more exclusive items selling out in double-quick time. You can just turn up on the store's opening days without warning, but you might find that you have to hang around for a little while before giving appropriate entry.
The Pokemon Center London is located at ExCeL London arena, and will be open from April 14 to April 16.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modern warfare.
After numerous delays to an initial proposed launch date of December 2021 due to real-world events that Nintendo evidently felt made launching a light-hearted warfare game problematic, Wayforward's Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp is finally almost here. Featuring the classic Game Boy Advance campaigns from both Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising, there's enough turn-based tactical good times here to satiate even the hungriest of wannabe Sun Tzus, and the whole thing has had a right old spruce up in the graphics department.
We've been busy getting to grips with the first 13 missions from the Advance Wars campaign and it's been an absolute blast so far. There's been no great shakeup of the core gameplay here — these are genuinely timeless strategy classics we're talking about after all, a pair of almost flawless experiences and the sorts of games that don't really need to be messed with. However, some excellent new modes and a few modern bells and whistles have been introduced, making for an even slicker and more streamlined experience than the one you'll remember from back in ye olden days.

There are 30 in total, spanning the length and breadth of Norse myth. Mjölnir's magical abilities include ricocheting off of walls, speeding through the air, ground-pounding, and absorbing different elements to tackle some tough puzzles.

The all-new Super Mario Bros. Movie is out now in cinemas (you can check out our thoughts on the film here if you're interested) and physical disc pre-orders are now live, too.
The film's available to buy on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, with the latter also being treated to a fancy Steelbook edition that'll look awesome on your shelf at home. There's also a lovely limited Tin Star Edition (4K in the UK, Blu-ray in the US) that is essentially an even fancier Steelbook.

Naughty Dog has released another patch for the troubled PC edition of its critically acclaimed grimfest The Last of Us Part I — In addition, the studio noted that fixing the port's issues was currently its top priority, and those waiting on its Steam Deck Compatibility will need to remain patient while the game, y'know, gets fixed.
The Last of Us Part I V1.0.1.7, which is available to download right now, tackles several crash instances that would occur when booting the game or when transitioning between Windowed and Fullscreen modes. Additionally, the new update includes fixes for the game's UI, and tackles some of the strange behavior exhibited by NPCs out on the mean streets of Boston. Players with nVidia Series 30 graphics cards are advised to update their drivers before playing with the new patch installed.
"We at Naughty Dog and our partners at Iron Galaxy are closely watching player reports to support future improvements and patches." writes ND on the official patch notes. "We are actively optimizing, working on game stability, and implementing additional fixes which will all be included in regularly released future updates."
The Last of Us Part I launched on Steam on March 28. And, despite being delayed by almost a month, has disappointed fans with a litany of issues, ranging from visual glitches and broken textures, to clipping animation, effect botches, long load times, and random crashing. The Steam releases holds a "Mostly Negative" review rating on the Steam platform, a disappointment given Naughty Dog's excellent PC port of previous release such as Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves.

When you think of the titles of some of Nintendo's most iconic platform games, many of them just make sense as they are: Super Mario World, Kirby's Dream Land, and Donkey Kong Country. It all fits as a naming convention, right? Well, according to ex-Rare dev Kev Bayliss, the inclusion of the word 'Country' in Donkey Kong Country for the SNES actually has a more significant meaning behind it.
In a reply to a question on Twitter as to how the addition of the word 'Country' came to be, Bayliss confirmed that the game had been known as 'The Country Project' during development, owing to the fact that Rare was effectively situated in the middle of the countryside. Bayliss states that Nintendo had simply decided to keep 'Country' in the name, and so Donkey Kong Country was born.

With a busy four days in Boston for PAX East, mine and Liam's brains were basically mush last week, so Rebecca - an absolute angel - graciously said she could host a special PAX East episode where she chats with Liam and me about the indies we saw on the show floor and try desperately to string together a coherent sentence. She also made bulletpoints of our entire chat so writing up the shownotes would be easier; we do not deserve her.
Saying that, our exhaustion doesn't stop us from kicking up a riot over the BAFTA Game Awards at the start of the episode. We then delve into our PAX East indie round up and, as always, we end with our current hyperfixations.

If you want to go into the Mario Movie completely blind and without any knowledge of when the track appears, we suggest watching the film before you head into this article as we will go on to talk about the track itself and how the movie uses it...

I was having an early sneak peak at Inkle's new game A Highland Song in an appointment booth with paper-thin walls and no ceiling. The speakers on my Steam Deck demo unit were really going "full pipe" that day, so I'd like to say a big awkward sorry to any of my neighbours in there who were trying to conduct actual serious business interviews. 
But also: A Highland Song is 100% a game that deserves to have its music cranked up to full, whether it's returning Heaven's Vault composer Laurence Chapman's soaring orchestral score, or Scottish bands Talisk and Fourth Moon's aforementioned folk music. The clue's in the name, after all, and after a spirited 30 minutes with it, I'm certain this will have Inkle fans singing from the hilltops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That's right, it's a Tournament arc
Crusader Kings III is setting out for some new festivities in May. The next Crusader Kings III expansion, dubbed Tours and Tournaments, debuts on May 11, 2023.
While Crusader Kings has had plenty of courtroom drama, this particular expansion looks to add some pageantry to all of it. Host a royal wedding! It's never gone poorly for anyone, ever. Head out on tour, or yes, even hold your own tournament. I'm sure leaving your kingdom in the hands of a cunning and ambitious seat-warmer will certainly turn out fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATwJhpy_FQw
It's not all just events planning, though. The new travel system will include route planning, which means determining how fast you want to travel versus how safe your charted course will be.
Additionally, Knightly Accolades are getting a spotlight, as are some new armor designs and clothing. Fashion is crucial, even at a sometimes bloody tournament.
Expanding your borders
The Tours and Tournaments expansion for Crusader Kings III will go for $29.99, and will launch alongside a "major" free update for all CKIII players. Or, if you prefer a more deluxe route, you can also pick up the Chapter II pack.
The Chapter Packs for Crusader Kings III tie in a few extra updates, big and small, for $34.99. Picking that up now will immediately garner the Elegance of the Empire Pack, with historic regalia inspired by real-life rulers. Further on down the road, alongside Tours and Tournaments, Chapter II pack-owners will get the Wards and Wardens Pack as well as the Legacy of Persia pack.
Basically, a lot more grand strategy is on the way for a pretty solid grand strategy game, from what I've heard. Tours and Tournaments arrive for Crusader Kings III on May 11.

It's 2023, and there's next to no interest in the Electronic Entertainment Expo. E3 has been canceled. The exhilarating conferences are over. The epic moments are over. The hilarity of bloopers on stage is over. E3 is a trade show that was like Christmas for video game fans, and, sadly, it appears to be all gone.
Still, there once was a time when essentially everyone in the gaming community came together and looked forward to the exciting games ahead. It was an event I've always wanted to go to, but I just missed my opportunity. It's something I'll always regret, but at least the VODs of past streamed conferences are memorable. Here are 10 of my favorite E3 moments from the event's history.

        <updated>2023-04-04T20:00:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remake-a-touille
Mods for the 2023 Resident Evil 4 remake have already had a strong start, with various costumes and alterations for the game's principal cast. But with Moushley, a social media post has spurred on a legion of fan art and, finally, a special mod for putting Moushley in Resident Evil 4.
If you're unfamiliar, Moushley all seems to have started with a Twitter post from user @Agrimmora, imagining the president's daughter Ashley Graham as a tiny mouse. The adorable take on Ashley encouraged many more adaptations and versions. Moushley is having a moment, I'd say.
Well, a new mod now takes the Moushley idea and gives it the Pixar treatment. Cathroon's "Moushley Graham - Ratatouille Mod" asks the question, "What if Moushley was Ratatouille-ing Leon?" The results are simply stupendous.
https://twitter.com/cathroon/status/1643119048945958915
The Moushley model comes from TheCapsuleFiend, and uses it as a hair replacement option for Leon Kennedy. With it, Moushley can ride atop Leon's head, directing him through all the horrors of Resident Evil 4. It's headcanon, but valid.
You'll need the Fluffy Mods Manager and ensure that the hair strands option is turned off in the settings, but otherwise, it should be a squeaky clean install from the Nexus mods page.
A cheesy addition
While there have been plenty of wild and weird mods for Resident Evil 4, I really do like the Moushley addition. For one, it's reflective of a fun fan reimagining, and is relatively wholesome.
It's also just a neat little addition for addition's sake. It's not a new gameplay feature, or cheat code. (Though you do have to play safer, for Moushley's sake.) It's just a neat little touch for those who enjoy the idea of special agent Leon Kennedy being secretly controlled by a sweater-wearing mouse.

Earth Day is coming up, and Xbox is joining in by revealing a controller made of other controllers. The Xbox Wireless Controller Remix Special Edition is a new version of the Xbox controller, partially made with reclaimed materials.
The Xbox Wire blog goes into deeper detail, but each Remix controller will have recovered plastics, specifically one-third of it made from regrind and reclaimed materials. This means that each Remix should have its own little touches of swirls and markings, to make yours very special.
Notably, this means that these Remix controllers are made up of, among other things, reground controllers. As Microsoft describes it, there are mechanically recycled leftover Xbox One generation controller parts ground back into raw material in there, which has been used as a component for the new controllers. The circle of Xbox life.
The Remix controller also comes with a special feature: the Xbox Rechargeable Battery Pack. This lets you dispose of those disposable batteries, and either charge while you play or afterwards, with up to 30 hours of battery life per charge according to Xbox. I have fond memories of these little packs from the 360 era.
The Remix to emissions
The Remix Special Edition Xbox Wireless Controller will go live on April 18, with an $84.99 price tag. It also comes with a textured grip, hybrid D-pad, button mapping, and Bluetooth built-in.
Xbox is also highlighting other sustainability efforts its making, and Microsoft Rewards members will be able to earn and donate points to support environmental organizations throughout April. This includes the World Wildlife Fund, Water.org, and the Nature Conservancy.

Fast forward 30 years, and Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo have finally delivered a cinematic adventure starring the iconic fraternal duo that is joyful, fun, exciting, and, perhaps most importantly, respectful of the source material.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new mod for Elden Ring adds one of the most important things a game can have: a really hefty kick to boot people onto their bums and over edges. This has come with an update to First Person Souls, an impressive mod which gives FromSoftware's game a good first-person camera view. And thanks to the mod's recent update, you can now punt ragdolling baddies across The Lands Between, following in the bootprints of games like Deathloop and Dark Messiah Of Might & Magic.

Cammy, who has been an extremely dangerous and notable Street Fighter character for many entries, looks to be living the "if it ain't broke" adage, and can be seen throwing out all manner of instantly recognizable normals and special. Ms. White's high-speed pokes are in effect, as are her tricky, ground-creeping lows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Stadium, the classic 3D battler/minigame collection for the Nintendo 64, just got a Nintendo Switch Online release date. While the game's imminent arrival to the online service was announced at a Nintendo Direct in September 2022, today is the day we finally know when we can play it. Pokémon Stadium comes to Nintendo Switch Online Wednesday, April 12. As is the case with all N64 games, you'll need the expansion pack in order to play it. Check out the full trailer below.


While some fans may have hoped this port would include trading with Pokémon Home, they're unfortunately out of luck. The fine print in the trailer specifies that "Pokémon cannot be transferred to this game." That said, there is also a notable improvement: four-player online multiplayer will be available, so you can play Clefairy Says or Sushi-Go-Round with friends all over.
Nintendo Switch Online's expansion pack had a slow start, but its library has gradually snowballed into a much more significant package. In February, the service added a Game Boy Advance library, which included fan favorites like The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap and Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. A month later, Metroid Fusion joined the lineup. Meanwhile, the base tier of NSO got an update last month that added another small handful of titles. To see all the retro games currently available on the service, check out our complete list.

It’s almost time to live among the waves, as Different Tales has announced that YYZ’s ambitious dock colony builder, Havendock, is coming to Steam Early Access on April 20, 2023.
A previous beta and a demo offering have shown that Havendock has got the gusto. It’s a colony builder set in the middle of the ocean, where you get your humble beginnings through gathering driftwood and eventually build up to a full micronation. You farm, craft, and invent to build up your oceanic paradise.
https://youtu.be/I_Kj4I71mu8
The sole developer, Yeo Ying Zhi (YYZ), has shown a commitment to including the community surrounding Havendock in its development. “I wish I could procrastinate everything, but I don't want to disappoint the people out there waiting for Havendock. It's a great motivation, though, now I actually need to set an alarm to go to sleep,” they said in a press release.
I appreciate that the trailer gets right into the action. The animation and character interactions are a little rough looking, but why hide that? It’s a solo-dev effort, and more games are just starting to own that title.
YYZ is planning on having Havendock in Early Access for the rest of the year. For its early launch, a lot of the building is already there, but the story still needs fleshing out, and the goal is to incorporate a lot of community feedback. It sounds like it will be an adventure to see where the concept goes.
Havendock is releasing on Steam Early Access on April 20, 2023 for PC.

I’m not really sure where to begin with Strayed Lights. It’s visually striking. It kind of has the vibes of 2012’s Journey or 2015’s Ori and the Blind Forest. Both of which are great inspirations. Designed as the first game by French developer, Embers.
I’m not sure I can spend that much time beating around the bush. From the time I’ve spent with Strayed Lights demo, I’m significantly underwhelmed. I want to stress that I’ve only played a small slice of the game; maybe 45 minutes. However, during that time, Strayed Lights failed to grab me. Beyond that, its core design is just kind of flat. So while there’s definitely a lot of potential that things could pick up, I can’t say I’m feeling optimistic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The loop brings you back
There's a new batch of games hitting Xbox Game Pass this month, and they range from recursive loops to a world of blocks. Microsoft has confirmed games like Loop Hero, Minecraft Legends, and more are on their way to the Game Pass this month.
Some of these new entries aren't particularly surprises. Minecraft Legends is a collaboration between Mojang and Blackbird Interactive, so that Day One launch on the Game Pass makes sense. And while Ghostwire: Tokyo was a timed exclusive even after the purchase of Bethesda by Xbox, it's now coming  to those consoles and hitting Game Pass.
Still, there are plenty of surprises and little gems in Game Pass this month too. Loop Hero is a great pick-up, and one I'd strongly recommend you check out if you haven't yet; it mixes concepts of auto-battling, idle games, city building, and more to make a very strange and interesting kind of RPG adventure.
There's also NHL 23 hitting on April 13 via EA Play, for all the Chel fans out there. Lastly, Iron Brigade arrives, a bit of an oddity in the development history of Double Fine. Still, if you've been watching the Double Fine Psychodyssey and wanted to dive deeper into the studio's catalog, Iron Brigade is an interesting part of it.
Here's the full lineup for this month's initial batch of games, as well as the games that are leaving soon on April 15.
Xbox Game Pass April 2023 arrivals
Loop Hero (Console, PC) - Out today
Iron Brigade (Cloud, console) - April 6
Ghostwire: Tokyo (Cloud, console, PC) - April 12
NHL 23 (Console via EA Play) - April 13
Minecraft Legends (Cloud, console, PC) - April 18
Leaving Xbox Game Pass on April 15
Life is Strange: True Colors (Cloud, console, PC)
Moonglow Bay (Cloud, console, PC)
Panzer Corps II (PC)
Rainbow Six Extraction (Cloud, console, PC)
The Dungeon of Naheulbeuk (Cloud, console, PC)
The Long Dark (Cloud, console, PC)
The Riftbreaker (Cloud, console, PC)

Publisher Devolver Digital has announced that it has acquired indie developer Doinksoft, the Orgeon-based studio behind fun, silly, and popular releases such as Gato Roboto, Demon Throttle, and the studio's current project, Gunbrella.
First announced in the summer of last year, Gunbrella is an apocalyptic noir adventure that sees a dangerous drifter crossing the badlands on a do-or-die odyssey of mystery and vengeance. Our anti-hero will seek such justice armed with little more than a mean attitude and an incredibly versatile rifle, which also doubles as a shield, a zipline, a floatation device and, of course, an umbrella.
Gunbrella is currently in development for PC and Nintendo Switch, and is tentatively scheduled to launch later in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Marek Markuszewski had finished working on The Witcher 3's Blood And Wine expansion, he wanted to go back to basics and make something by himself, Starward Industries' chief marketing officer Maciej Dobrowolski tells me at GDC. Something that would capture the same kind of cultural Polish heritage as The Witcher - originally adapted from Andrzej Sapkowski's six-strong series of novels - but that would take him on a new, more introspective kind of development journey. It took a while to find, but after a fateful encounter with an investor who'd just sailed across the Atlantic with only a copy of Polish sci-fi writer Stanislaw Lem's The Invincible for company, the signs were too good to ignore, Dobrowolski says. And after spending the best part of a year convincing Stanislaw Lem's son (and current rights holder) of the same thing, Markuszewski finally had his something - and a new partner to help him realise it.  
"People tell us, 'Don't fuck it up, this guy's important,'" Dobrowolski continues, and no wonder. During the course of our conversation, Lem is described as both a "national treasure" and "mandatory reading in high school" for Polish students, and his hallowed cultural status is something the team's "had to deal with" in bringing the book to life. Despite all this, though, Dobrowolski insists this "isn't a one-to-one adaptation" of Lem's interstellar rescue story gone wrong, and that fans of the book will still find some surprises on the surface of Regis III as they explore its strange canyons, caves and crash sites.

This year, though, Rachel and I decided to go one step further. We interviewed the teams behind four of the eleven 2023 finalists, asking the developers behind Go-Go Town!, Paper Trail, Slay the Princess and Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action about their experience of bringing their games to PAX, what they learned along the way, and what it’s like to spend four days standing on your feet talking to thousands of attendees (spoilers: it’s really bloody tiring).

Hitcents has announced that HardBoiled Studios' egg-centric climb-’em-up, Yolked - The Egg Game is leaving Early Access behind on April 6, 2023. If you’re eggs-pecting me to make egg puns throughout this article, I’m going to have to disappoint you. The egg is the cradle of life, and I cannot eggs-press the level of respect that demands.
Now, if I can have your attention, I would like you to eggs-amine this game.
https://youtu.be/Be0P8Ct6-28
Nope. I can’t go on like that. It’s horrible, and I can feel the shame starting to knot up in my chest. So let’s forget this ever happened. It's eggs-cruciating.
Yolked reminds me of Heave Ho or Endoparasitic. You play as an arm-having egg, and guide them across various environments and obstacles using the kind of grip that makes bass musicians jealous. You can also collect costumes for your eggs. That mostly sums it up, but the trailer demonstrates a lot of interesting situations, including some so bizarre that I want to see how they fit into the game.
As a writer in video game media, I sometimes get to abuse my platform. This is one such time. I don’t really have any time to play Yolked for review, so instead, I’m highlighting its impending launch as a way to try and get more people to play it, so I can live vicariously through them.
Yolked - The Egg Game is available on Steam Early Access right now, but you can eggs-pect the full version to drop April 6, 2023.

I don’t claim to understand whether this has something to do with “ray-tracing” or some manner of “screen space occlusion” or what have you – Digital Foundry, I am available for work – all I know is that there’s an option to crank up the gloss until you’re pretty much zooming around the galaxy in a big angry disco ball.

Everything on the earth is a wasteland. All is left to dust and ash, and by the time the player enters the frame in Terra Nil, all that's green is gone. There is nothing left to do but rebuild. And it's in restoring nature, in unpacking the very idea of a city-builder, that Terra Nil finds a smart twist on a traditional foundation.
It's fun to think that the same team behind Broforce and Genital Jousting made Terra Nil. It's not that I don't think a studio that's made games about bros and dicks can't also make a game about ecological restoration. But Terra Nil sees Free Live exploring an incredibly serene approach to puzzles and city-building. Free Lives has range, is what I'm saying.

Overwatch 2's next playable character is a support hero called Lifeweaver and he’ll be joining the roster alongside Season 4, expected to begin on April 11th.

It seems they’re making good on that promise, though, as Lifeweaver’s reported abilities have the potential to sway matches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Po dlouhé době byli strahovští Bastlíři na výjezdu - tentokrát na konferenci Hackaday v Berlíně. Rádi vám proto ukážou fotky, popovídají o zhlédnutých prezentacích a poreferují o berlínském hackerspace MotionLab. Ukážou vám také "Badge" - visačku, kterou dostali všichni návštěvníci akce a která obsahuje virtuální 4bitový procesor. Neuvěříte, kolik zábavy můžete zažít s instrukční sadou, která má délku instrukce slabých 12 bitů.

Ale nebojte - celá Virtuální Bastlírna rozhodně nebude jen o zážitcích z berlínského výletu. Jako pokaždé, budete jádrem diskuze Vy - účastníci! Pokud by ale nastalo ticho, Bastlíři z MacGyvera si nachystali dost novinek ze světa techniky. Jako obvykle se objevily nové procesory - ať už procesory fungující od 0.8 V z baterie nebo velmi levné ARMy od 40 centů (které ale nejsou výjimečně z Číny). Pak nový ST-LINK s velice šikovnou funkci pro embedded programátory. A Raspberry Pi Pico W bude mít konečně použitelný Bluetooth.

Samozřejmě jako vždy mají Bastlíři i plný pytel drobností a úsměvných zpráviček. Kupříkladu se dozvíte, jak se dá podívat neinvazivně do některých integrovaných obvodů, co je nového na Průša i3 MK4, jak prakticky uchovávat SMD součástky, jak se v Brně staví vesmírná loď nebo co je zač studentský vesmírný projekt SBUDNIC.

Ať už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat, chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl a nebo jste také byli na berlínské konferenci, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 5. dubna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

It doesn't try to take over your life, or be the Everything Game that invariably becomes the Nothing Game. It's just a neat little thing to have some harmless fun with. Sometimes that's what you want.

Most of them we managed to make videos for, but there were many more that we just didn't have the time to cover, and that were also very good! So here's a quick list of five more games I wanted to spotlight in written form while Liam's busy in the editing mines working on all the community videos we filmed (the first of which is out right now, chronicling the PAX Facebook group that takes a community photo every single year). It's very wholesome. We've got more community videos coming out this week, plus an article listing our absolute favourite games we played throughout the entire event, so keep your eyes peeled for those, too. For now, though, let's dive into some more indie highlights.

After playing four hours of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor last week, I can tell you it is exactly what you probably already thought it would be: a competent, big-budget action-adventure sequel, well made by talented people, that isn't breaking the mould but expands upon the first game in the areas you liked best. If, like myself, you enjoyed Jedi: Fallen Order, this will probably be a solid follow-up for you. But if you were less well disposed towards that first game, you'd probably want to swap "consistent" for the word "predictable".

When Respawn Entertainment announced it was making a third-person action game in the Star Wars universe, many fans didn’t know how to react; the studio was critically acclaimed, but at the time, Respawn was purely known for shooters like Titanfall and Apex Legends. However, 2019’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order surpassed the expectations of many, delivering a terrific adventure full of exciting action and memorable moments. Now, with all the learnings of Fallen Order, Respawn is ready to top itself in hopes of creating another unforgettable Star Wars adventure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graham (RPS in peace) text me yesterday and, with little warning, launched into what were clearly pre-prepared paragraphs of complaints about games he'd tried playing in his free time at the weekend and not enjoyed. I shall draw a veil of discretion over the names of the actual games, but his chief complaint was that none of them had, actually, very robust design or tutorialising fit for purpose (i.e. teaching you how to play the game), especially for people who aren't able to give games their singular attention for hours at at time. I agree with him, although his attention is divided by, e.g., having a child in need of stimulation, and mine is divided by, e.g., being a child in need of stimulation.
It's probably turning my brain into cottage cheese, but I often do things at the same time as playing a game, like listening to music or a podcast. I understand that podcast games are sort of a genre now, but I've started doing it with regular games. Is this a me problem? Sure. Does it mean I want games to bring back that thing where NPC quest givers will just explain the quest again to you if you ask? 100% also yes.

Hello! I am the second imposter covering for our dear Ed, who is currently away on holiday in Japan (and I’m definitely not jealous at all). Let’s get into some good words, shall we?
Wired’s Megan Farokhmanesh interviewed Richard Hofmeier, the developer of Cart Life - a sobering game about three street vendors trying to make ends meet. Hofmeier tells the story of his decision to remove the game from Steam ten years ago and his reasons for bringing it back.
His time away from game spaces made him appreciate the spectrum of expertise his colleagues had in things he’d never done. It was humbling. “So many people have talent and passion that gets entirely overlooked,” he says.

To compensate, they're going to instead release Ark: Survival Ascended in August, a remaster of the original Ark: Survival Evolved that moves it over to Unreal Engine 5. That's the good news. The bad news is you can only buy it in a $50 bundle with the sequel (which won't be finished for at least a year), and that the original Survival Evolved servers will be switched off when Ascended launches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pretty weird. I woke up this morning, and everyone was gone. The office (by which I mean our Slack channel) was cold and empty, and a shining beacon of light rose from my monitor screen and proclaimed that I was now an honourary Alice. And as such, the heavy responsibility of compiling everyone's weekend gaming plans fell to me. To entertain myself (and force those who left me in charge to think twice), I'll be writing a series of unhinged 90s-style "where are they now?" epilogues in italics for each person who neglected to send me words of their own.

        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20230401/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-01T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ScummVM project, a free and open-source software project that allows users to play classic point-and-click adventure games on modern systems, has announced a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence gaming.
Thanks to the innovative work of ScummVM developers, AI tools such as ChatGPT are now able to play point-and-click adventure games directly, without any human intervention.

"With this new capability, we hope to explore the potential for AI to learn, adapt, and evolve within the context of classic adventure games," said Eugene Sandulenko, lead developer of the ScummVM project. "Now AI can experience the joys of helping Putt-Putt join the parade or Adibou count things. We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans."
"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule."
Update: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:
Getting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.
Taking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream
Refusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!

It’s the biggest weekend of the year for WWE, but some folks may not realize that it’s also a massive event for the entire industry. The city Wrestlemania takes place in also hosts multiple shows from smaller wrestling promotions, various fan conventions, live podcasts, stage shows, and other events looking to capitalize on the giant influx of fans in the area. It’s a good reminder – or revelation for some – that there’s a lot of other great stuff out there besides Vince McMahon’s billion-dollar behemoth.
The same is true for video games, as wrestling games don’t often get a spotlight without WWE’s branding. Hopefully, this list rectifies that by bringing more awareness to other upcoming titles that replicate or reimagine sports entertainme…]]></summary>

As a lifelong fan of Nintendo, the experience was immense, providing me with one of my favorite amusement park experiences ever. Naturally, when the first Super Nintendo World in America opened at Universal Studios Hollywood, I had to make the trip to Los Angeles to see how the experience stacks up.
Universal Studios provided me with a day pass to the park for the purpose of experiencing Super Nintendo World. While the photos do little to show off just how cool the experience of visiting Super Nintendo World is, follow along with my experience in the gallery below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first chapter of Videoverse took me right back to the early 00s last night. I can still remember sitting at the family PC in our living room, begging my parents for more internet time because I wanted chat to my friend on MSN Messenger. We had to buy hours of internet in those days, and between my young teenage self and my three brothers, we absolutely devoured those meagre weekly limits, always pleading for more, more, more as we became absolutely captivated by this new world of the online. 
Luckily, Emmett doesn't have to contend with such antiquated restraints in Videoverse, as his portal to the internet is built right into his enormous Nintendo DS-like home console, the Kinmoku Shark. As well as using it to play games reminiscent of old 16-bit classics, there's also a Nintendo Miiverse-esque social network on the Shark that Emmett uses to chat to his friends, post fan art of his favourite game, Feudal Fantasy, and feel part of something bigger. What hasn't changed since those early internet days, however (or indeed, the internet today) are the types of people he interacts with - there are trolls, of course, but there are also plenty of nice people here to support him, and the emergence of seemingly new user (and budding fan artist) Vivi quickly becomes the main subject of Videoverse's current free demo that's available as part of Steam's Storyteller Festival.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the solemnity of Samwise Gamgee informing Mr Frodo that one more step will take him the furthest he's ever been from home, I recently realised that it'll soon be the longest we've gone without a new Life Is Strange game since the franchise debuted in 2015. I looked into it and sure enough, the current record-holder is the gap between the season one finale of Life Is Strange and the first episode of its prequel Before The Storm: 1 year, 10 months, and 12 days. That means that come mid-August of this year — specifically, the 14th, which marks the 683rd day since True Colors' Wavelengths DLC released — LIS fans will be leaving the Shire whether we like it or not.
I suspect that Life Is Strange: Steph's Story — the first prose novel tie-in to the franchise, released on March 21st — was commissioned with fans like me in mind. Fans who work out useless trivia like the above because they need something to occupy them when there's no new game on the horizon and they've played all the existing ones to death. Fans who know every character's canonical middle name and birthday. Fans who complain that it feels like they never have time to read any more, but nevertheless finished the novel and wrote a silly supporter post about it within ten days of publication. Of course I really liked Life Is Strange: Steph's Story. But will you, as a person whose relationship with this franchise is statistically guaranteed to be more normal than mine?

Windy Meadow is set in the same fantasy world as Roadwarden and similarly presents a slice-of-life story that can branch out depending on your choices. This time, though, you’ll be following three protagonists in their interweaving day-to-day lives. 


Windy Meadow’s press release teases the stories of Vena, Fabel, and Iudicia: “Will talented huntress Vena depart the harmonious but harmless village and leave her family behind in pursuit of riches with a merchant guild? Can Fabel finally embrace his talents, ditching the figurative shackles of his difficult past as he chases his dream of becoming a famous bard? And will outsider and herbalist Iudicia take hold of her love life, choosing not to marry a man she doesn’t really love at the risk of leading a lonely future?”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PAX East is a great place to play the latest games, sure, but as anyone who's attended the event will tell you the games are just a small part of a wider medley of things to see and do. Last year we highlighted the show's thriving pin collecting scene, for instance, interviewing a bunch of Pinny Arcade enthusiasts about the hobby and discovering that physical badges are just a minor part of the appeal.


Encouraged by the lovely warm feeling making that video left in my belly, we set out to shine a light on other lesser-known parts of PAX East during our time at this year's show. This led us to discover the PAX East Facebook group, a community of over 8,000 members brought together through their shared love of video games, pop culture and PAX itself.

Sometimes two or more of these horrors intersect, and by that I mean you can romance that tentacled man in this gothic, alternative-history dating sim. Spooky suitors will need to wait a while more, though, as Mask Of The Rose has been delayed to June 8th - previously slated for April.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s Wrestlemania week, and one would think that the last sport to get into the spirit would be golf. However, PGA Tour 2K23 defies expectations by announcing that 16-time World Champion and Hollywood star John Cena is joining the roster as a playable golfer.
On April 7, the invisible leader of the Cenation joins the game’s roster of celebrity athletes alongside Michael Jordan and Steph Curry. Given his well-documented freakish strength, Cena excels at hitting long drives and rocks a vaguely familiar red, white, and blue ensemble. Cena is set to compete at Wrestlemania 39 this weekend, challenging Austin Theory for the United States Championship. If he comes up short on Saturday, he can always bounce back and win the Masters instead. Or continue improving his K/D ratio in Fortnite. Cena is nothing if not versatile. 
PGA Tour 2K23 is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Xbox players can try the game for free on the weekend of April 6-9, while Steam players can play until April 10.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indie studio Majorariatto have released small, experimental games every March since 2017 - barring the cursed year of 2020 - and now they’re back with another thought-provoking adventure called Pineapple On Pizza, this time asking the profound question: can video games convey such a complex flavour? It’s out now, it’s free, and it’s only about ten minutes long.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wildfrost is excellent at creating moments of triumph. Early on in my playthrough while I was still getting to grips with the game, I came face-to-face with a boss who got stronger when hit. Its card art had become bigger, juicier, more tauntingly malevolent, and easily could have taken out any of my team with a single hit. Thankfully, three of my team members were due to act one turn before it. The first chipped away a little of its health (its job was mostly healing) but the next doubled a stacked debuff that I had set up and turned the goliath into a giant bomb, and the effect of my two cards combined was just enough to trigger it. BOOM! My backline leader didn't even need to lift a single finger.
Playing with turn order and setting up synergies is a key part of how Wildfrost plays as a roguelike deck builder. Each individual card on the stage is part of a counter system, with both delaying and advancing them on the playing field being strategic choices. Some actions are free, like moving your cards around the stage or withdrawing them for healing, but playing cards out of your hand or shuffling your deck will pass the turn.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2023/03/30/netflixs-scott-pilgrim-anime-series-reunites-the-live-action-movie-cast"/>
        <updated>2023-03-30T14:52:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We learned last year that Scott Pilgrim is getting another encore in the form of a new Netflix anime series. If that wasn't exciting enough, we now know that the cast from the cult classic 2010 film is reprising their roles.
As reported by Deadline, the still-untitled Scott Pilgrim show will be computer animated by Japanese animation studio Science SARU (Devilman Crybaby, The Heike Story, Inu-Oh). Scott Pilgrim vs. The World director Edgar Wright returns as executive director, with Scott Pilgrim author Bryan Lee O’Malley and artist Bendavid Grabinski will serve as executive producers, writers, and showrunners. The plot of the graphic novels/movie centers on slacker musician Scott Pilgrim battling the seven evil exes of his new girlfriend, Ramona Flowers. 


The primary actors from the live-action film are higlighted in the trailer above, which include:
Michael Cera - Scott Pilgrim
Mary Elizabeth Winstead - Ramona Flowers
Kieran Culkin - Wallace Wells
Satya Bhabha - Matthew Patel
Chris Evans - Lucas Lee
Anna Kendrick - Stacey Pilgrim
Brie Larson - Envy Adams
Alison Pill - Kim Pine
Aubrey Plaza - Julie Powers
Brandon Routh - Todd Ingram
Jason Schwartzman - Gideon Graves
Johnny Simmons - Young Neil
Mark Webber - Stephen Stills
Mae Whitman - Roxie Richter
Ellen Wong - Knives Chau
Unfortunatley, the series currently still doesn’t have a release window other than “coming soon.” Scott Pilgrim has always had a strong relationship with video games; the graphic novels and film incorporate a bevy of gaming references. Of course, we’d be remiss, not to mention the much-beloved 2010 beat ‘em up Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which was remastered for modern consoles in 2021. 
Are you excited to see Scott Pilgrim return as an anime? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Sure, in reality, I’m slumped on my couch in a position that my body will give me payback for when I’m thirty, but in my fantasy, I’m a musical prodigy whose guitar licks are so epic it would make Slash cry. My joy for virtual jamming came as a direct result of playing hours and hours of Guitar Hero. Harmonix held my music taste in its death grip, and almost breaking my fingers on those flimsy plastic buttons trying to conquer Through The Fire And Flames is a precious memory of mine.
So yeah, I love a good guitar sesh, so when I saw that Hi-Fi Rush was about a wannabe rockstar that smacks evil megacorp robots with his guitar to a catchy rock OST, Tango Gameworks had my attention.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Live A Live became one of our favorite RPGs when it launched on Switch last year, and the celebrated remake is making the jump to PlayStation consoles and Steam on April 27. 
Additionally, there’s a free demo on PlayStation available today that lets you play three of the game’s eight stories. Live A Live was originally released in 1994 for the Super Famicom in Japan, but it hadn’t been localized for the West for decades. Directed by Takashi Tokita, one of the lead creative minds behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV, the game consists of eight very different short stories, each starring its own protagonist and featuring distinct gameplay mechanics and presentations. While the battle system is turn-based strategy, sometimes the game flips that on its head in unique ways.
Last year, Square Enix resurrected the title by giving it an Octopath Traveler-style HD-2D facelift, a rearranged soundtrack, and full voice-acting. You can pre-order the game on PlayStation and Steam to get a 20% discount. To learn more, you can read our review of Live A Live here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A short animated sequence kicks The Last Worker into gear, reeling off the game’s backstory with breezy efficiency. It’s an apt start for this first-person satire set in a fully-automated dystopia, in that it underlines a very human aptitude for artistic communication. It’s surprising, then, that as The Last Worker continues its story, it takes less graceful turns, electing for verbosity over economy. For a game that takes critical aim at the future of work, frankly, it’s all a bit laboured.
So what does happen in that opening animation? First, we see everyman hero Kurt among thousands of recruits arriving at the gigantic distribution centre of megacorp Jüngle (like Amazon, get it?), to spend their working lives plucking products off shelves to order. Before long, though, any drop in output sees the employees themselves plucked off and given the boot, to be replaced by robots. As the numbers dwindle, top-performer Kurt remains steadfast, and even finds love among the boxes with a fellow product picker. But when she gets pregnant and quits, he stays behind, living full-time in the warehouse. Years pass. Jüngle smothers the entire retail market, and Kurt becomes, well, the last worker.

On paper, Crime Boss: Rockay City is bombastic, star-studded, and promises a city-spanning adventure about a criminal organization’s rise to the top. The actual game, however, is anything but. The gameplay is unbalanced, buggy, repetitive, and boring. The celebrity-filled cast is exciting at first glance, but crude and humorless writing weighs down the already-phoned-in performances of characters voiced by Michael Madsen, Michael Rooker, Vanilla Ice, and more. The single-player roguelite campaign lacks any of the genre’s typical hooks, and bu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alt.Ctrl.GDC is a regular fixture at the Game Developers Conference, and this year I spotted some properly incredible creations from its largely student-led group of exhibitors. There was a big focus on co-op games and time trial demos in this year's cohort, with nearly every stand having some sort of whiteboard pinned up that was constantly being scrubbed out with new fastest lap times and corresponding visitor names. There was also lots of friendly hooting emanating from them as well, as mates and strangers attempted to co-ordinate their gaggles of limbs to steer various game characters in the right direction. 
It was excellent fun, and I sampled a bunch of games that used toasters, intricate pulley systems, papier-mache tree stumps, bike wheels and more in place of your typical controllers and mice and keyboard. There were also plenty more I didn't get to try out, mainly due to time, and you can see the full list over on GDC's website. For now, though, here are some personal highlights of what I saw, including the largest bowler hat I think I've ever seen in my life.

Not a fan of trapping said friends into small balls, only letting them out to fight gangs and other Godlike creatures? Well, Cassette Beasts might be the game for you. It's a Pokémon-like where you’ll still be beating up wildlife creatures in turn-based combat, but rather than capturing them, you record their likeness on the titular tapes and then transform into those same street cone-wearing crabs and metal-clad wolves. It looks like an energetic, nostalgic romp, and it’s coming to PC and Game Pass on April 26th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forspoken may not have set the world on fire, but those who enjoyed it have a new reason to revisit the world of Athia. Square Enix has announced a new story expansion called In Tanta We Trust, and it takes place decades before the campaign begins.
The story sees Frey Holland follow a mysterious voice that leads to her being sent back in time 25 years before she first stepped foot in Athia. She arrives at the Purge of Rheddig, the battle that caused Athia’s collapse and pushed the Tantas to madness. Frey must now fight to save this era of Athia, and she has backup in the form of Tanta Cinta. Frey gains new magical powers, including tag-team-focused abilities that utilize Tanta Cinta’s talents. The DLC also features new environments for players to scale using Frey’s parkour skills. 
Forspoken: In Tanta We Trust is a paid expansion that launches on May 26. Those who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game can play it three days early, on May 23. For more on Forspoken, you can read our review here. You can also check out this story on how Square Enix recently absorbed developer Luminous Productions.]]></summary>

It's been more than eight years since Tekken 7 arrived in arcades across the globe. While the console version didn't hit for another two years, the gap since that seventh entry represents the largest distance between two mainline entries since the series began in 1994. Bandai Namco used that time to evolve the experience, adding several new characters by way of DLC en route to the announcement of a highly anticipated eighth entry.
With so much time since Tekken 7 launched, Tekken 8 represents not only the franchise's first game developed for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, but als…]]></summary>

More specifically, Atlas Fallen will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on August 10. This news comes after previewers recently went hands-on with the game as part of a press event and after the game was showcased at PAX East, which took place last week. As for why Deck 13 is delaying Atlas Fallen, the team says it needs more time with the game.

Deck 13 also revealed that this delay will allow the team to include a full German voiceover for Atlas Fallen.

But less romantically, the title evokes Internet Explorer or Acrobat Reader - sitting comfortably alongside the clearly and sensibly labelled Windows software of the mid-90s. It’s a reminder of just how early Westwood happened upon the blueprint for real-time strategy, right as many PC users were buying their first trackball mice.

Back then, the developer was fresh from Dune II, its unlikely David Lynch adaptation and progenitor of the RTS genre as we know it today. Inspired by the house politics and struggle for resources that consumed the desert planet Arrakis, Westwood had come up with an addictive formula for harvesting spice and converting that wealth into military power, which in turn could be used in the battle to secure more spice. The team was, quite frankly, surprised by how much fun that formula had turned out to be.

In The Tartarus Key, a PS1-style thriller/puzzle/horror game, it's definitely the latter.

Now she finds herself locked in a weird study in a poorly lit mansion, with only a stranger on the end of a walkie-talkie for company.

In IFPI's latest Global Music Report, insiders stress that music's 'human' element should stay at the forefront. According to Sony, the same applies to AI-synthesized voices, which should not replace human vocals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Balsa Model Flight Simulator launched into Steam Early Access last year, to positive reviews and few sales. It is, like its developer's previous game Kerbal Space Program, about building a machine designed to fly, crashing it back to earth, then constructing something better. 

Now its developer has announced they're doing something similar with the game itself. Balsa Model Flight Sim will relaunch later this year with a new name, Kitbash Model Club, a more ambitious physics construction sandbox, and a plan to release as a complete game rather than into early access. Existing owners of Balsa Model Flight Simulator will get Kitbash Model Club for free.

Today's release of its first major update, titled Operation Sapphire Jackal, may help address that disparity given that it promises to fix "hundreds" of bugs in the base game. On the other hand, it also adds cosmetics - both those that can be unlocked for free and via spending real money.

That's an exceptional price for a brand new laptop that's still selling for £1100 at Amazon - Spring Sale or no.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new character trailer for Tekken 8 showcases the action of the returning Jun Kazama. Jin’s long-lost mother is making her first playable appearance in a mainline entry since Tekken 2, and based on a new gameplay trailer, she hasn’t lost a step.
A gameplay trailer shows off Jun’s expert use of Kazama-style martial arts to cleanse opponents of their evils. That translates to beating the snot out of them if that wasn’t obvious. We also see a brief reunion between Jun and her former lover, Kazuya, and it goes about as well as you would expect from a mother meeting the father and repeat attempted killer of their son. 


For those keeping count, here’s the list of confirmed fighters thus far:
Jack-8
Jin Kazama
Kazuya Mishima
King
Lars Alexandersson
Marshall Law
Nina Williams
Paul Phoenix
Tekken 8 still doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[E3 2023 has taken another hit, as Ubisoft has confirmed it will not have a presence at the show. In a statement to Video Games Chronicle, the publisher reveals that it will instead hold its own live presentation on June 12 in Los Angeles. 
The publisher statement to VGC reads “While we initially intended to have an official E3 presence, we’ve made the subsequent decision to move in a different direction, and will be holding a Ubisoft Forward Live event on 12th June in Los Angeles. We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon.”
Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated in February that the company would commit to attending “if E3 happens”. If that's the case, this news certainly doesn’t bode well for the fate of what’s supposed to be E3’s big return. 
As for what Ubisoft could show at its event, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Crew Motorfest, and (maybe) Skull and Bones are slated to release this year. Other announced projects include the long-quiet Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia remakes, a multitude of new Assassin’s Creed games, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. A rumored follow-up to Immortals Fenyx Rising could also make an appearance.  
Ubisoft joins Nintendo on the list of major publishers that have declined to participate in this year’s show, following a previous report that Microsoft and Sony plan to follow suit. E3 is largely organized by ReedPop this year and will take place June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The event will open its doors to fans and press, with separate attendance days for each. It will be the first in-person event since 2019.

In a developer blog post, Player First Games CEO Tony Huynh explains that since MultiVersus launched in open beta (yes, open beta) last July, players have offered a ton of feedback.

It was a special edition that came with a code for Wind Waker HD and a gamepad emblazoned with a golden Triforce.

But while it was valuable to us, the Wii U struggled to sell and has ultimately gone down as one of Nintendo’s most disappointing consoles. Today, the system’s eShop shuts down forever, permanently closing a chapter of Nintendo’s history.

Despite the fact that we've gotten multiple trailers over the past few months, Nintendo has yet to reveal any clip of gameplay longer than a few seconds, and every new glimpse seems to raise more questions than it answers. What are those strange vehicles? Does Link have a new paraglider? And why does the game cost $70? Whether or not tomorrow's showcase addresses those questions, we'll all find out when Tears of the Kingdom releases on May 12.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of Sea of Star’s most compelling selling points is the involvement of Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. To know that a game heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger will feature music from the man behind its score is exciting. Still, it is worth being excited for the soundtrack that Mitsuda will not be directly involved with, as well.
The majority of Sea of Stars’ soundtrack is in the hands of the talented Eric W. Brown, who also composed the soundtrack for The Messenger. Brown’s musical history started with playing drums in metal bands. “I've been a drummer since I was a kid and I'm still a drummer now, but, you know, I got into music production via chiptune essentially,” Brown says.  Around 2006 he decided to focus on making music on his own in the chiptune genre, primarily on Game…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A video game based on the hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel The Last Ronin is in the works, Polygon reports.
The news comes from Polygon's interview with Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global. According to Rosen, The Last Ronin video game will be a single-player action role-playing title in the vein of the Norse-themed God of War series. Like the story it adapts, the game will feature a mature tone. The game’s developer has not been named, and the project is years away from release. 
The Last Ronin was published in 2020 as a five-issue mini-series by IDW. It takes place in a dark futuristic New York, where three of the four turtles have been killed. The surviving turtle, whose identity is revealed at the end of the first issue (we won’t spoil it), dons a black mask and seeks revenge by fighting crime using both his and the weapons of his fallen brothers. 
It’s a cool (and very grim) story if you haven’t read it, and we’re excited to see it translated into a game. Rosen also mentions in the same interview that Paramount sees opportunities to create different types of TMNT games that target young and adult audiences. 
The Turtles are enjoying quite the renaissance lately thanks to the launch of the well-received beat ‘em up Shredder’s Revenge last year, the nostalgia trip of the Cowabunga Collection, a Shredder-themed Call of Duty pack, and even a new animated film coming to theaters this August.

In 2021, however, it was delayed to 2022. In May of last year, Daedalic revealed Gollum would release in September but then, in July, announced it had been delayed once more. Now, today, Daedalic has revealed that Gollum will finally be released this May. 
More specifically, Gollum will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on May 25. There will be a Switch version of the game, but Daedalic says it's planned for later this year. Alongside today's news, Daedalic has released a new story trailer. Check it out below: 


"The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is a story-driven action adventure," a press release reads. "Embark on a perilous journey as Gollum, chasing the only thing that is precious to you. Climb, leap, and sneak your way past dangers or into advantageous spots. Gollum is skillful and sly, and torn by a split personality. It is up to you to decide whether to yield to the darker side of Gollum or trust the kinder gentler hint of Sméagol." 
Check out some new screenshots from the game below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Sonic Origins celebrated Sonic the Hedgehog's birthday by gathering Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD in one place with new features and some added bonuses. Despite some shortcomings, the compilation remains the best official way to experience those classic games from Genesis and Sega CD three decades following their original releases. Today, Sega announced the bundle is about to get better through Sonic Origins Plus, a premium upgrade that arrives a year after the collection's initial launch.
Sonic Origins Plus brings forward all the features of Sonic Origins delivered last year – Classic Mode, Anniversary Mode, widescreen support, added story animations, a virtual museum, and more – while adding a bunch of new content. First up, Sonic Origins Plus adds all 12 Sonic Game Gear games to the museum.
The full list of Game Gear games getting added is listed below.
Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine
Sonic Blast
Sonic Chaos
Sonic Drift
Sonic Drift 2
Sonic Labyrinth
Sonic Spinball
Sonic the Hedgehog
Sonic the Hedgehog 2
Sonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble
Tails Adventure
Tails' Sky Patrol
On top of that, Amy joins the roster of playable characters in the Genesis and Sega CD titles (Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD). One of the strangest exclusions in the original Sonic Origins release is also rectified, as Knuckles will become playable in Sonic CD. Sadly, this first press release does not make any mention of restoring the replaced music in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.


Sonic Origins Plus arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 23. If you don't already own the initial release of Sonic Origins, the digital version of Sonic Origins Plus costs $40. The physical version, which includes a 20-page artbook and reversible coversheet with new art, also costs $40. If you already own Sonic Origins, you can upgrade to Plus for $10.

The real-time tactical shooter pits a squad of marines against dozens of deadly xenomorphs, though we hadn't seen any gameplay footage until the release of a new video today.
A gameplay commentary video walks players through the basics, in which players command a team of marines to investigate a xenomorph outbreak on Moon Lethe. You’ll issue commands for teammates to attack or execute skills and can also slow time during firefights to select orders. However, your squadmates can perish permanently, but you can raise your survival odds by outfitting soldiers with various weapons and upgrades to ensure the best team composition.

More specifically, Lego 2K Drive hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on May 19. The game is being developed by WWE 2K and NBA 2K studio, Visual Concepts, and is reminiscent of Forza Horizon's open-world exploration mixed with Mario Kart-like racing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Night Dive Studios, the team behind the upcoming remake of System Shock, for roughly $10 million. 
Night Dive Studios is currently led by Stephen Kick and Larry Kuperman and is both a development studio and a publisher. It has published more than 100 games, and will add its remake of System Shock to that list on May 30 (on PC). Atari says a key to the success of Night Dive Studios is its proprietary KEX engine that makes classic games playable on modern hardware. Considering Atari is a retro company, and one that just acquired 12 classic retro games, it's easy to see what Night Dive Studios can do for it. 


"In addition, Atari, SA also announced that it intends to proceed in the near-term with a €30 million bond issue co…]]></summary>

        <id>120190</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/03/23/redfall-microsoft-canceled-ps5-version-after-bethesda-acquisition-arkane-director-says"/>
        <updated>2023-03-23T12:14:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arkane was developing a PlayStation 5 version of its upcoming first-person vampire shooter, Redfall, before Microsoft acquired Bethesda in 2020. However, following the acquisition, the PS5 version of the game was canceled by Microsoft, according to Arkane director Harvey Smith in an interview with IGN France (translated by IGN). 
Discussing this with IGN France, Smith said, "We got bought by Microsoft and that was a huge sea change. They said, 'No PlayStation 5. Now we're gonna do Game Pass, Xbox and PC.'"


Smith said Arkane didn't mind the decision, even if Redfall was originally meant to release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. 
"Support from Game Pass and having to worry about one less platform, one less complexity," Smith told IGN France. "And Game Pass has a ton of people that can play. It could be our biggest game ever because of the 30 million Game Pass [members] or whatever that number is." 
News of this canceled PS5 version of Redfall doesn't come as much of a surprise. When Redfall was revealed during a 2021 Xbox and Bethesda E3 showcase, it was revealed as an Xbox console exclusive. And considering it's par for the course for companies like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo to keep their first-party releases off of competitor consoles, it's also not surprising Microsoft opted to make Redfall an Xbox exclusive after it acquired Bethesda. 
A spokesperson for Microsoft responded to this story, providing the following statement: 
Redfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2. 
For more about the game, watch the latest Redfall story trailer that introduces some of the vampiric big bass and then watch this gameplay trailer that invites you out to a bloody night on the town.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer showcasing some of the impressive visual work going into its upcoming Lords of the Fallen sequel, The Lords of the Fallen. 
The Lords of the Fallen, previously known as Lords of the Fallen 2, has had a rocky development history thus far, but with Hexworks taking over development back in 2020, the sequel has begun to shape up.
We got a reveal trailer during Gamescom last year that showcased the game's darker, more gothic tone alongside word that this sequel will feature online co-op and a world five times larger than its predecessor. We got another look at the game's grisly world in a new trailer released during The Game Awards back in December, and now, thanks to Epic's State of Unreal presentation today, we get to see more of the game. 
Because it's a trailer released as part of today's State of Unreal presentation, it's less cinematic than previous trailers and instead, focuses on some of the visual design work going into the game.
Check it out for yourself below in this new trailer for The Lords of the Fallen:  


As you can see, The Lords of the Fallen continues to look great, and fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer to go hands-on with it because it's due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime this year. 
For more information about the game, head to our hub for The Lords of the Fallen and then read our thoughts on its predecessor in Game Informer's Lords of the Fallen review after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ninja Theory revealed Senua's Saga: Hellblade II during The Game Awards back in 2019 and while that initial trailer impressed us with its dark tone and beautiful visuals, not much else has been released about the game. Since 2019, the Xbox-owned developer has released two instances of behind-the-scenes footage, with one revealing the game is not a direct sequel to 2017's Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. We did get some gameplay during a trailer at The Game Awards in 2021 but since then, not much. 
Now, thanks to today's State of Unreal presentation highlighting the current state of Epic's Unreal Engine, we get another tease of what's to come in Senua's Saga: Hellblade II; this time, it's a look at the impressive facial animation Ninja Theory has pulled off in the sequel. 
Check out this new Senua's Saga: Hellblade II teaser for yourself below: 


As you can see, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II continues to look impressive. Unfortunately, we still don't know when we'll be playing the game, though. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice review and then head to our Senua's Saga: Hellblade II hub for more information about this upcoming sequel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has revealed Counter-Strike 2 and it will be released this summer. 
An official release date was not revealed, but Valve says Counter-Strike 2 will be a free upgrade to anyone who owns Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Plus, if you do own Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you can jump into a limited test for Counter-Strike 2 starting today. During this testing period, Valve says it will "be evaluating a subset of features to shake out any issues before the worldwide release." 
The company also says, "Counter-Strike 2 is the largest technical leap forward in Counter-Strike's history, ensuring new features and updates for years to come."
Alongside today's reveal, Valve has released three gameplay videos for Counter-Strike 2. You can check out all three below: 






Counter-Strike 2 will run in the Source 2 engine, which has tools and rendering features "available for community map makers to make it easier to build, experiment, and iterate." There will be a Source 2 Item Workshop as well, and it will be available at a later time during the Counter-Strike 2 limited test. 
The official Counter-Strike 2 has plenty of more nitty-gritty details about the game so head there if you want more information. 
Here are some quick-hit highlights players can expect in Counter-Strike 2: 
Upgraded and overhauled maps
Game-changing dynamic smoke grenades
Tick-rate-independent gameplay
Residgned visual effects and audio
All of a player's CS:GO items with them in CS2
Counter-Strike 2 hits PC sometime this summer.

News on Marvel's Spider-Man 2, the highly anticipated follow-up to Insomniac Games' Marvel's Spider-Man from 2018 and 2020's Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, has been light since the game's reveal in 2021. But back in December, PlayStation did reveal that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 would be out sometime this Fall. 
According to the voice actor for Venom in the game, Tony Todd (who we heard briefly in the game's reveal trailer), Marvel's Spider-Man 2 could be out this September. Strangely, Todd responded to a fan excited about the game and spilled the b…]]></summary>
