        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Feather Cluster is filled with some of the toughest challenges yet. It makes sense that the Lost Galaxy exits are a bit tougher to find. If you're trying to unlock the Djinny of the Lamp Lost Galaxy in Astro Bot, you've come to the right place.


Djinny of the Lamp is the first of two levels in the Feather Cluster to host a Lost Galaxy exit. The exit is also the most cleverly disguised compared to the others. At least, that's how I feel. Here's a clue: If you're looking for the Djinny exit, it's wise to think on your feet.


The Lost Galaxy exit is at the end of the Djinny of the Lamp level. You'll first need to beat the Djinny boss battle, leading you to a small arena that includes both exits. Obviously, you'll want to ignore the primary exit. Where we're going is much higher.

Digital Eclipse has released a substantial update for Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord on the Switch, adding in a bunch of new features and bug fixes.
Released on 23rd May 2024, Wizardry is a complete remake of the original 1980 classic, adding in revamped visuals and modern conveniences, yet retaining the same brutal difficulty and unmatched depth. We gave it a resounding score of 8/10 in our review, noting a few pacing issues and an inability to skip certain combat animations (which, by the looks of things, seems to have been resolved entirely with the new update).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lizard Doggo is a friendly creature and tameable companion in Satisfactory 1.0. The adorable, orange reptile has more going for it than just being a little cutie, as the Lizard Doggo can find and deliver helpful items back to your base.


The Lizard Doggo is willing to do some of the work on your behalf, albeit not anything massive, but this pal can collect several resources while you focus on the more important base-building tasks. 


Taming a Lizard Doggo in Satisfactory for gathering help


It's not a difficult task, but you'll need a few resources to tame a Lizard Doggo. If you're looking to make one of these critters a pet in Satisfactory, all you need to do is:



Have Paleberries in your inventory


Find a Lizard Doggo and toss a few berries in front of it


Let the creature approach on its own and eat 


While it's snacking, press the E button to pet the doggo



Once it's done eating and starts approaching you, it means it has been tamed. The process is quite simple and you can get a Lizard Doggo pretty early in the game.

A tamed Lizard Doggo collects and delivers items to you


So, now that you've got a pal, what can it do? Here is a list of a few items that a tamed Lizard Doggo can collect and bring to you:



Alien Organs


Cable


Caterium Ore


Coal


Cup


Limestone


Motor


Mycelia


Paleberry


Power Slugs (Blue, Yellow, Purple)


Raw Quartz


SAM Ore


Sulfur


Uranium



Out of all these items, SAM Ores are some of the rarest items you can find in Satisfactory 1.0, and collecting them requires a lot of effort. This is why players consider this resource for late-game phases for building structures such as an Alien Power Augmenter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has released a fresh update for Dragon’s Dogma 2. In addition to some pretty healthy tweaks, they’ve also thrown in a casual mode in case you want a softer journey.


Actually, taking a look at casual mode, it doesn’t seem massively easier. Here are the defining features, as per the patch notes:



Reduced inn fees for staying at an inn.


Reduced price of Ferrystones.


More difficult for weight carried to become "Heavy" or "Very Heavy."


Less Stamina expended when dashing outside of battle.


Loss gauge will not increase when selecting "Load from Last Save" after the Arisen dies.


Pawns will recover from dragonsplague without a "devastating calamity" occurring, even if the symptoms progress to a terminal stage.



That’s not nothing, but some of the tweaks are weirdly specific. It’s easier, but it’s not exactly dumbing things down to an unreasonable level. I wonder if there are less specific changes they aren’t telling us upfront, like a change in damage given/taken.


Speaking of oddly specific, the rest of the patch notes seem like that. A port crystal being added to Bakbattahl seems like the most exciting addition, since it will be a massive convenience. Aside from that, there are things like new idle animations and new items that can be traded with the Dragonforged. It’s nothing spectacular outside the new difficulty.


There are a lot of balance changes to vocations, as well. It’s a lot to take in, so I’m going to direct you to the patch notes again for the specific details. There are also a tonne of bug fixes. I didn’t notice very many issues when I played it back around its release, but this looks like a lot.


Dragon’s Dogma 2 is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC. The described patch is available today.

We've all been having fun with Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics over the past few weeks, right? If you answered "yes," then you probably haven't come up against a formidable online opponent called 'Wazzler'. That's because Wazzler is better known as Justin Wong, the fighting game legend and seven-time Marvel vs Capcom 2 EVO champ who has made it his personal mission to dish out devastation against anyone he meets online (thanks, IGN).
It all started on Steam (the collection doesn't support crossplay, fortunately, in this instance), with players quickly realising that Wazzler wasn't a foe to be messed with. In fact, platform reviews directly credit Wong as one of the game's downfalls — mostly as a joke, we should point out — with one user's 'Recommended' comment even asking Steam to "please make an achievement for getting bodied by the Wazzler".

By increasing the clock speed of machines, you increase their efficiency to produce more resources in less time. The best thing about this feature is that it can double the resources produced from a single piece of machinery and doesn't require you to increase their counts.

Much as was the case with, say, the Ritualist, the Warden is DLC-locked, and their specialty is drones.


More specifically, the Warden archetype is a headlining feature of the upcoming The Dark Horizon DLC, which launches on September 24 for $9.99. The general gist of the DLC is that it follows the exact same formula as its two predecessors, The Forgotten Kingdom and The Awakened King. Whereas these DLCs expanded upon Yaesha and Losomn, respectively, The Dark Horizon is all about N'Erud's horror sci-fi goodness, and the Warden ties into this idea remarkably well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re a Disney fan looking for a new mobile game to wind down at the end of the day with, then I’ve got good news: Disney Pixel RPG finally has a release date. 


Disney Pixel RPG will be releasing on Android and iOS on October 7, and pre-registrations for the mobile game have already surpassed 600,000. 




Once the game is live, you’ll be able to customize your own character and then set off across a variety of different worlds to discover the characters who reside there. You’ll be accompanied throughout the story by Mickey Mouse and friends, so you’ll never have to face any challenge alone.


Completing objectives in Disney Pixel RPG will unlock new outfits and customization options, as well as new characters who will fight on your side. Fighting can either be casual, with the option to send out your fighters to complete quests and objectives while you’re getting on with life in the real world, or you can dive right into the action and take control.

So far, various characters have been revealed including Baymax, Winnie the Pooh, Genie, Maleficent, and even Judy from Zootopia, and all of them are depicted in adorable pixel format. All of these characters and many more can be sent out on Expeditions, which will take place when you’re not playing, to bring back resources and materials.


I think it’s safe to say that I have a soft spot for Disney, pixel games, and RPGs, so this is just a perfect combination of three things that I love. If you want to join me on October 7 and neglect real life in favor of this pixel world, then you can pre-register for Disney Pixel RPG now.

It's a solid showcase, but it's also a potential disappointment in one key way: it seems to whitewash the Va'ruun into regular ol' spacefolk, with Chunks stores and all.


I'm sure not everyone is going to be quite as taken aback as I've been, but the fact that there's an honest-to-goodness Chunks storefront in the middle of Dazra gave me whiplash. Don't get me wrong: Shattered Space still looks very interesting if you're a Starfield fan, and the aesthetic on show is definitely on-point. It's just that I was a fair bit disappointed to learn that the Va'ruun really are every bit as ordinary as everyone else in the galaxy.

Early access goes live globally on September 20, and it begins at midnight local time for all console users.

Since the game launch depends on regional timings on consoles, there's a popular way to start playing earlier if you're on Xbox.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unlike some other games, the Map doesn't come unlocked right out of the bat in Satisfactory 1.0, and you need to complete a few steps before reaching there.


For a huge open-world game boasting features and resources to collect such as Satisfactory, the map plays one of the most important roles in tracking your progress. It gives you an idea of all the areas you've discovered so far and mark down places for, you know, future reference.


How to get the Map in Satisfactory


Screenshot by Destructoid


To unlock the map, you first need to complete the Tier 1 Field Research Milestone. This comes right after completing the Onboarding process or tutorial.


Like the Onboarding process, the Field Research Milestone also costs a few resources, and here's a rundown of it:



300x Wire


300x Screw


100x Iron Plate



These resources are pretty easy to collect during the early game, and it's best if you set up an automated system including Miners, Storage Containers, Smelters, Conveyor Belts, Constructors, and a lot of power.


How to access the Map


Once the map gets unlocked, you can access it by pressing the 'M' button. The shortcut also shows up on the bottom-right of the screen along with other shortcuts, so you won't miss out on it.


You can then place different markers for different locations. Let's say you've chosen Grass Fields as a starting location and discovered a pure SAM Ore spot nearby, you can mark it down for later.


You can zoom in between 1x to 8x by either dragging the slider on the bottom-right corner of the screen or using the scroll wheel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Darksiders II: Deathinitive Edition is nearly 10 years old at this point, but it's finally making its way to current-gen consoles. THQ Nordic announced plans to release the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions on October 15, 2024. 


You'll be able to hop back in Death's ethereal saddle for $29.99. Those who already own the PS4 or Xbox One versions, however, can snag Deathinitive Edition as a free upgrade. For everyone else, there's a half-off discount in place for pre-orders until October 14. 


Previewed below, the PS5 and Xbox Series version of Darksiders II adds 4K resolution, ray tracing, and enhanced lighting. There are also haptic feedback features in place for PS5's DualSense controller, and both versions have improved loading times. 




Darksiders II was fantastic when it debuted on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 way back in 2012, and the upgraded edition has been a great way to play for nearly as long. Beyond the upgrades unique to current consoles, Deathinitive Edition adds in all the downloadable content and some fine-tuning to the loot distribution and game balance. Other aspects — including character, and environmental visuals — have also been tweaked since the initial launch. 


Most of all, I respect THQ Nordic for sticking with a title as silly as Deathinitive Edition for so long. Hopefully, the game itself holds up better than the name in 2024. I've been itching to dive back into this series for a while now, so this is as good an excuse as any to do so.

Rather than retread the same "prepare for ultra-Winter" ground, your biggest obstacle will likely be your own people, now formed into shifting political parties, and looking outward with colonial eyes. The result is a complicated, laborious survival citybuilder that's two parts compelling, and one part frustrating for the wrong reasons.

Moving forward, Gorman says things will be a little different. When asked specifically if there will not be a Sims 5, Gorman says, "It's not 'Sims 5' as a replacement for 4."


During the interview, Gorman elaborates on multiple games in the franchise, with The Sims 5 being the main discussion topic initially and Maxis' plans to avoid making it "'Sims 5' as a replacement for '4.'"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has announced that the next game in the skate. series is scheduled to drop into Early Access in 2025. This will be the first entry in the series since skate. 3 in 2010. Shortly after, EA laid off most of the developer’s staff and shut down the studio. Last we heard, Deran Chung and Chris Parry who worked on the original run of games, are part of the team handling the new skate.


I haven’t really been keeping up with the development of the new skate. (which is apparently just called skate.). I think I lost interest when it was announced that it would be free-to-play and multiplayer focused. Actually, repeating that still sticks in my craw since my wish for a new skate. game did not include GaaS.




If you’re down for that sort of thing, EA has been holding playtests since 2022 to collect player feedback. The developer has said that there will be no loot boxes, no maps locked behind paywalls, and no pay-to-win. So, that’s maybe comforting, but that still leaves cosmetics as microtransactions. We’ll have to wait and see.


I loved the skate. series. I love Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, as well, but they’re two completely different approaches to skateboarding. skate. feels a lot more authentic. You try and find the perfect line to build the most gnar gnar combo possible. The stick-flicking controls gave everything a more tactile feel.


But really, I have no interest in a live service multi-player game. Thankfully, I still have the original three games on PS3, so I can always turn to them. They’ve aged well.


skate. is coming to early access on 2025. More details to come.

There's no shortage of adorable animated Pokémon content out there (heck, most of it is enough to bring a smile to our faces), but The Pokémon Company's latest effort, 'Chasing the Moon,' is one of the best-looking ones we've seen in a while.
Released by TPC's official Japanese YouTube account to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival, this new short sees a lonely Pikachu trying its best to hunt down a Lunala and get a good view of the full moon. Okay, it might not be the most riveting story, but the visual style is super cute, with each 'mon looking almost like it's made of card against the gorgeous hand-drawn backdrops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even after ten years, GTA 5 is still one of the biggest releases in modern gaming. With almost 160,000 people logged into the game on PC in the past 24 hours, it's no wonder it's one of the most played releases on Steam. But there's been one thing missing all this time, until now.


As noted in a recent report from Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson, it looks as though Rockstar has finally added anti-cheat software to GTA 5. More than nine years after releasing (bearing in mind the console versions came out in 2013), the hit Grand Theft Auto installment comes packed with BattlEye, at least on the PC version.




Screenshots from X user Tez2 – who's pretty noteworthy when it comes to tracking all things related to GTA – initially showed the software listed in the patch notes over on SteamDB. Rockstar has since updated its patch notes thread, dropping in its official notice that GTA 5 now comes with a Battleye install. 


Is this the end of GTA 5 silliness?


Over the years, studios and publishing houses have taken strides to protect intellectual properties, especially when it comes to guarding against online cheaters. This is basically what BattlEye is all about, but the report from Henderson points to a few concerns.


For one, will having anti-cheat software in the PC version of Grand Theft Auto 5 have any effect on modding? It can't be said at this stage what the result will be, but no doubt the community will let us know post-haste.


In general, it seems fans are quite pleased with BattlEye finally making its way to the game, about a decade after it came out. But given how long it's taking for GTA 6 to arrive, we already know that Rockstar can be a bit slow on the uptake at times.

Yes, it's lovely to look at. Yes, hopping out of a storybook and making friends with an illustration on a coffee mug is cool. And yes, everyone can have a mildly fun time with its puzzles and fights. But that's the problem: who is everyone? At first I thought, "This game is for young kids and that's fine!", given its relative simplicity. Then I hit some puzzles and thought, "Ain't no kid figuring this out".
Then it hit me. It struggles to balance the fine line between being approachable for tiny tots and layered enough for people who've graduated from "goo goo ga ga" to "oo oo aa aa my back hurts". And that's down to how plucky you're allowed to squire at any given time, because it can be surprisingly limited and, sadly, a bit underwhelming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been excited about The Plucky Squire since Devolver Digital first announced it back in 2022. Even though I don't usually love platformer games, I was instantly drawn to its peculiar, dimension-bending mechanics and a particular type of art style I've been familiar with for years.


I was worried at first, too. I've had my heart broken one too many times, banking on my admiration for its style, only to wind up with a messy, incoherent, or straight-up boring ordeal. There was a small part of me harboring hesitancy, hoping this wouldn't be the same. Thankfully, making an optimistic-fueled gamble with my time paid off, and I walked away happier than ever before after venturing out of my comfort zone. Well, except during a few puzzles, but that lies entirely in my problem-solving abilities…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lost Isles update introduces a new wood type to diversify your collection. We're here to show you where to find Mahogany Wood in LEGO Fortnite, including some recipes you can use it with.


How to get Mahogany Wood in LEGO Fortnite


You can find Mahogany Wood in LEGO Fortnite's new Lost Isles area, a lush and vibrant region with unique flora and fauna. Look for trees with darker brown trunks, as these are the ones that yield Mahogany Wood. Keep in mind that regular trees showcase a lighter appearance, so make sure to note their differences.

If you need help getting to Lost Isles, you can either start a new world and spawn there or use fast travel with the Bus Station. Once you get there, you should encounter some Mahogany trees in no time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spice, spice? Maybe.
Those who have experienced any of the Jackbox Party Packs will know that, sometimes, things can get a little spicy. An odd question thrown into a family-friendly round of Fibbage that leaves you frantically scanning the in-game moderation options or a well-endowed Drawful sketch that leaves everyone chuckling like embarrassed teens — we've all been there before. The Jackbox Naughty Pack is all about that feeling, a party game collection for adults that lands high on the ‘Rude Scale’, even if it’s not quite as blushing-ly bold as it seems to think it is.
Unlike the previous packs, this Naughty edition is a three-game collection, with each game providing a cheeky twist on an otherwise ordinary Jackbox formula. At an initial glance, this isn't a lot of bang for your buck. The three games provide some decent variety, but at £19.69 / $21.69, it feels a little pricey compared to the usual full-fat, five-game ~£25 options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can't travel back to the 1980s. But what if I told you it was possible to gently warp your memories of that time? UFO 50 is a kart of 50 games that once existed for an old computer system, all lovingly restored by a gang of coders. The old console, of course, is a fiction. The LX-I never existed. But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why is every blockbuster video game now some kind of live service game? Speaking as a clueless idiot, the explanation I find most convincing is that it's an attempt to bridge the gap between the returns publishers want from video games, versus how much we're able or willing to pay upfront. "Triple-A" projects now cost exorbitant sums to develop, partly thanks to wider economic inflation, but also because publishers have spent decades teaching players that every sequel has to be More and Shinier. Premium game prices have not risen in proportion, and investors want growth, as they do.
Live service games sneak around this difficulty by dragging out the time we spend playing them. Whether premium or free-to-play, they seek to install themselves as habits by means of regular, planned updates and additions. This is time that can be monetised by way of a subscription model, time in which other products may be sold to you, like skins and paintjobs, and time that becomes a commodity in itself, "engagement", which can be transmuted and exploited to various end. I'm not sure it's ever been expressed this way in any press release boast about longevity, but the unspoken principle/logical extrapolation seems to be that ideally, a live service game should keep us plugged in and plugging away till we die.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strange Scaffold’s newly released FPS I Am Your Beast is very fun for quite a few reasons, but chief among them is a deep appreciation for the poetry of good videogame violence. I’m not using the big P word just to throw out an overly worthy comparison to something we might associate with craft or beauty, but as a nod toward the game’s playful application of what I previously called ‘a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage’ one morning where I had clearly eaten my wordy Weetabix. The way its hurled knives and curb stomps and inexplicable decapitations flow together have an assonant, almost Suessian quality to them.
But it’s also, well, just a bit like Mad Libs. You play as Harding, a man who’s mythical lethality is established very early on. The showing is there in the moment to moment, but the telling is conveyed through cute tricks like how everyone you meet is so deeply afraid of Harding that they loudly keep track of exactly what weapon he’s holding at all times. The Mad Libs comes in through the fact that you can draw Harding a route between A and B, and it’s a given that multiple heads are going to come unstuck from necks along the way. You’re sort of just casually filling in the verbs that seem the most fun to you in the moment. One of the verbs is ‘hornet’. Hornet is a verb now.

Masahiro Sakurai is back with another video, and in this week's 'Grab Bag' episode, the legendary game creator delves into the world of CRT displays.
Now, if you've been around long enough to actually own and play games on a CRT (which, yes, you can still do now if you happen to find one out in the wild), then Sakurai's video will no doubt make you feel incredibly old. It certainly had that effect on us, at least. Nevertheless, it's an interesting look into the technology that shines a light on why many retro games prefer it over more modern LCD displays.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started playing and enjoying battle royale wizarding sim Spellbreak just in time for Spellbreak to get shut down. Developers Proletariat, Inc announced plans to yank the servers back in August 2022 in the course of being acquired by Activision Blizzard, bringing an end to many happy hours spent skating on conjured ice ramps and hurling boulders around like bunny rabbits. Yes, I am the kind of wizard who hurls a bunny rabbit, if there are no boulders to spare.
Happily, it transpires that Proletariat have resurrected their creation and handed it over to posterity in the shape of a free standalone Community Version, available on Itch.io. You’ll need to host your own server or join another group if you want to play multiplayer, but all the same, this is a lovely gift and one I’m delighted to transmit unto you, the active and efficient Magenauts of Rockus Paperus Shottegonne.

You’d be hard-pressed to find a “bad” film from the Studio Ghibli co-founder, so this piece is more about ranking from great to masterpiece rather than from good to bad. Miyazaki’s…

Pathea Games has revealed My Time at Evershine, the successor to My Time At Portia and My Time At Sandrock. There's no release window available yet, as it's revealed that development is still in the early stages, with a Kickstarter campaign planned to go live on 24th September 2024.
Now, the interesting thing with this one is that it's actually not confirmed for the Switch. Instead, Pathea Games has stated that it is "committed to launching My Time At Evershine on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5 and future Nintendo platforms yet to be announced". Oof, the upcoming 'Switch 2' then, or whatever you want to call it!

It's a fool's errand to try and predict Nintendo's plans but come with us as we don our red noses and white facepaint because we're about to do just that.
It's September, and that usually means there's a Direct in the works. Sure, Nintendo has been known to mix things up when it comes to showcases (just look at last month's back-to-back Indie World and Partner Direct), but a September appearance has been the safest of bets throughout the Switch lifecycle. In fact, as long as the Switch has been around, Nintendo has had something to show in September, as you can see in our Nintendo Direct broadcast history guide, and as Andy Robinson of VGC pointed out on Twitter yesterday.

According to EA studios group general manager and Respawn chief Vince Zampella, the new, currently untitled shooter will be one of those "back to basics" sequels that tries to rebottle the lightning of Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4 - these being the "peak" Battlefield games, in Zampella's view.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We love them as partners".
Unlike Call of Duty, Nintendo fans have had zero exposure to EA's Battlefield franchise, with the series mostly focusing on large-scale, 'AAA' releases on Sony and Microsoft's console platforms alongside PC. There's nothing to firmly suggest that this will change anytime soon, but thanks too a recent IGN inteview with Respawn Entertainment's Vince Zampella, there may be some hope that the franchise could see a release on Nintendo's eventual Switch successor.
Now, it's important to make clear that Zampella does not comment on the 'Switch 2' specifically, noting that it "isn't announced and it doesn't exist". However, his praise for Nintendo certainly leaves the door open to some future partnerships when the new hardware finally sees the light of day.

Despite this, actual vampire-themed immersive sims are rare. My list starts with Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines... and sort of ends there. In a devastating betrayal, Arkane Austin's Redfall wasn't an immersive sim but an open world co-op shooter (a not very good one). The much-delayed Bloodlines 2 was recently downgraded from immersive sim to RPG by new developers The Chinese Room. Arkane Lyon's Blade adaptation seems promising, but it's a ways off. 


Here to paper over the immersive vamping gap in the market is Byte Barrel's Trust, "a new first-person shooter with immersive sim elements". It takes place in a world where the vampires are hunted for their blood, which has become an everyday human energy source, used for everything from car batteries to streetlights. The irony! I feel like, in the circumstances, the ideal solution would be for humans to let vampires suck their blood in return for vampires letting humans use their blood for electricity, but that wouldn't make for a very thrilling shooter. Anyway, here's the trailer.

Netflix has announced that Season 2 of Castlevania: Nocturne will premiere in January 2025.
This news comes via a brand-new trailer (thanks, Gizmodo) which gives us a tantalising glimpse at what we can expect to see from the acclaimed animated adaptation. Crucially, it looks like legendary characters Richter Belmont and Alucard will be teaming up to take down Erzsebet Báthory in what seems to be a very loose take on Symphony of the Night. Alucard, of course, cropped up at the end of Season 1, so if you've not watched it yet, then get on it.

The Booster Course Pass DLC is not included. (We originally stated that the DLC was not confirmed, though the box states that it includes 'Full Game Download', not mentioning DLC.

An update now lets you fiddle the difficulty options a generous amount, say developers Ironwood Studios, making the game easier and bringing crafting needs right down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tiny Glade has been a constant presence on TikTok for the last year or so. It's never far away. In between burrito recipes and hymns to the Fujifilm X100v, this gorgeous toylike art tool's gamely turning stretches of balmy meadow into semi-ruined castles, semi-ruined villages and semi-ruined citadels. 
Dreamy and slightly haunted, it's conjured words like "bewitching" and "spellbinding" in the comments sections, too. It makes sense, really. Tiny Glade's a game about making rustic dioramas and then photographing them. It's not hard to imagine some exiled magical person might live in here among the rocks and reeds and wild heather.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alruna And The Necro-Industrialists opens with paired quotes from T.S. Eliot's The Wasteland and Mad Max: Fury Road - a blend of influences that would typically get you kicked out of the Creative Writing Club for being simultaneously too fancy and too obvious, but the game beyond the epigraph looks pretty swish.
It's "a compact and high-density Metroidvania, with a focus on sequence-breaking and playing things out of order". It uses a square aspect display ratio calibrated to give wizened Game Boy enthusiasts the shakes, and is made up of 200 single-screen rooms that "slot into the larger puzzle-box of the world". Also, you play a thorn witch who looks a bit like 1950s Tinkerbell, with a touch of Betty Boop. Here's a trailer.

The latest update for the physics-based open world build-a-car game introduces a mountable theodolite, which lets you stitch together monorail networks you can then ride about on.
If monorails strike you as frivolous, don't worry. It's more of a Shelbyville idea. And in any case, the theodolite also lets you construct networks of pipes, power lines and rail-less tarmac roads - the ready-salted crisp of the road family. It’s a chonky expansion that, in the words of lead developer Ian MacLarty, has only “scratched the surface of where this new system could go”. I am predicting an eventual pivot into either themepark management or factory simulator.

Twenty hours ago I placed my first manufacturer somewhere around here. Back then it represented the state of the art, hatching me a pristine batch of 1.25 computers every minute - now I’ve forgotten where I put the damn thing, after delving into my factory’s guts to hook that piddly yet still useful batch of old relics up to my main production line. I’m building supercomputers now, and the many manufacturers that make those are hungry.
Something is always hungry in Satisfactory, and that hunger pulls you from task to task in a near-seamless and frankly beautiful daze of ever-escalating industry. It is mesmerising and it is fearsome, and after five years of early access it’s finally complete.

Well, we thought this might be the case. After a weekend of splatting in the Grand Festival, Nintendo has announced that Splatoon 3's "regular updates" will come to an end.
The announcement tweet was quick to clarify that just because this is the end, it doesn't mean it's the end. While we might not be seeing any more regular updates to the game, seasonal events like Splatoween, Frosty Fest, Spring Fest, and Summer Nights will still be popping up with some returning themes and Big Run, Eggstra Work, and Monthly Challenges are sticking around "for the time being" too.

All pretty and crunchy and satisfying. It's just a shame it only lasts a week or two before turning into mulch on the pavement. Reminds me of a Regina Spektor lyric: "Leaves become most beautiful when they're about to die". And now, inevitably whatever I write below this will be a lie, because I'll actually spend my weekend listening to old Regina Spektor songs, because she's just the best.

You get a Diablo-ish combat system, the ability to shapeshift into a spider, and a whole castle to prance around in, crooning at the moon. I like this premise almost as much as I dislike the fact that V Rising is also a survival game, in which you must fell trees and master a crafting system like a common turnip farmer.


What do we hope for when our interest in a game is almost perfectly balanced by our disinterest? We hope that the developers will treat us to a free-to-play weekend, in which our perhaps-unfounded reservations might be strategically offset by the endorphin rush of not having paid any goddamn money. This, V Rising creators Stunlock have now done. The game is free to download and play on Steam from right now until Monday, 16th September at 5pm UK or 10am PST.

It's an "aggressively random" response to what the developers call the "lock-and-key" philosophy of certain immersive sims. It's also just been Major Updated, with new two player cooperative local and online multiplayer, various quality-of-life tweaks, new recording functionality, and a suite of gameplay changes or fixes to make Larian's eyes water. If you've been holding out for a sim in which "frogs can jump off of other frogs" and "delete that's deleted by delete triggers the delete's deletion as it gets deleted", well, I encourage you to get involved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A European consumer advocacy group have published an open letter to the European Union Commission expressing their concerns about video games that make use of premium in-game currencies - aka, make-believe money you can buy with real money, such as Minecoins in Minecraft's Bedrock Edition. 


The group in question are the Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs, or BEUC, who represent 44 non-governmental consumer organisations from 31 countries, and have been around since 1962. They're accusing the publishers of Fortnite, EA Sports FC 24, Minecraft, Clash of Clans and others of misleading people -  specifically children - with their in-game premium currencies, and breaching European Union consumer protection laws. On a press site that summarises the results of various longer studies, they offer the below broad complaints about the practice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I could have described the multiplayer racing game Faaast Penguin a lot of ways. It is Fall Guys meets Snowboard Kids. It is Diddy Kong Racing but all the courses are water slides. It's Cool Runnings but there are 40 penguins instead of four Jamaicans. Okay, that last one is a bit of a stretch. But basically, yes, this brightly coloured free-to-play knockout racer feels like that one Super Mario 64 level where you race the big penguin down a slide, only this time there are a ton of other players trying to beat you to the secret shortcut. It's coming out next week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're having a bit of an indie freebie morning, it seems. My humble contribution is 50/50, a downloadable or browser-based game which I suspect will fill some of you with the deepest aggravation. As the name suggests, it's about cutting things in half - specifically food items, such as fried eggs (easy enough) and candy canes (WTF). You draw a line down each object with your mouse, then click or hit space bar to perform a slice. Then, the game calculates a percentage.  If it's bang-on or very close to 50/50, you'll pass. If not, you'll have to start over. I know: this is how entire days are wasted. Sorry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive - the publisher behind games such as Cocoon, Stray, and Neon White - have seen their entire staff resign after an internal dispute this month, via Bloomberg.
The resignations came in the wake of a dispute between Annapurna Interactive president Nathan Gary and Annapurna studio head Megan Ellison. As Bloomberg report, negotiations were taking place to "spin off the video-game division as an independent entity." After failing to reach an agreement, Ellison pulled out of the negotiations, resulting in the resignation of Gary and “other executives.” Further resignations followed, with a reported two dozen other staff leaving the company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier today, Nic covered the full release of Steam Families, a feature which makes it easier for families to share a game library and for parents to manage kids' purchases and playtime on the digital storefront. It's a neat improvement over the old system.

Unfortunately I can't think about anything other than the Steam Families logo, which is pictured above and is clearly a shocked, possibly aghast face. Or so I thought at first. The more I stare at it, the more it seems to reveal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Serie A CEO Luigi De Siervo's dramatic take on Italian football's piracy problems isn't new, likewise his insistence that only coercive action will produce results. "Football is being killed," he said in a recent interview. "However, at the end of this battle we will win. Because it's either them or us." How this will be achieved isn't clear. Pirates keep jumping to new servers and if promises are kept, fans are getting sued next.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are many reasons to play and write about Arco. The Mesoamerican pixelart landscapes, for example - radiant, cloud-hung platters of land with people and buildings reduced to daubs of paint in the foreground. The fact that it's about witnessing and surviving colonial invasion, rather than the more familiar European or North American video game fantasy of searching a New World for plunder.
The ensemble storytelling, with four, successively playable characters setting their own lenses to thickly entangled themes of sorrow, vengeance and growing understanding. The sparse, expressive dialogue, each phrase carefully tucked inside its speech bubble. The music. And the little things at the level of how you move, what you do. When you pick a faraway destination on your map, your character makes the journey screen by screen, which gives you a second to lean back and be a passenger, watching the horizon, at least until you're ambushed by a giant beetle.

Mere weeks from release after years of delays, plopped in front of me at a cramped, lightly vibrating Gamescom booth, and you still won’t reveal your secrets. I did get to play a brief whizz through GSC Game World’s eerie FPS – enough to feel encouraged, even – but be it time constraints or the darkness of my nighttime raid into the radioactive Zone, I would have liked to have quite literally seen more.
Then again, keeping the mystery intact may have been the point all along. "As a game director, I want to hide everything from the player", GSC’s CEO Ievgen Grygorovych had told me minutes earlier. "I'm fighting with the marketing team because they want to show as much as possible!"

Either way, Frontier are hoping to cater for all humankind's quirky day-out desires with Planet Coaster 2, by adding water slides and wave pools to the teacups and train rides of their management sim. I had a short go on it, and while there's no chance two hours of hands-on time could give me a full impression of the building game's suite of creative tools, I was quietly pleased with the jungle-themed pool I nestled into the earth. And with the little shark mascot I hired to patrol it.

The horror nous required to impart unease in the middle of the day are somewhat eased up on when you’ve got all that serotonin-begone drizzle to work with, sure. But this feels more poignant than that. There’s a soulful drearines and utterly heartbreaking inevitability to the vibe here, as your character and rubber suited activist pals try to get the bottom of a horrific incident. It’s got best British indie horror film of the year written all over it.

According to a leaked memo, Microsoft are laying off around 650 people "to organize our business for long term success". This is the same Microsoft that parted with around 1900 employees in January, and the same Microsoft that washed their hands of around 10,000 staff in January 2023, all in the name of shoring up the business for future prosperity. That "long term success" is certainly taking its sweet time. Or at least, it is if you're one of the poor saps in the trenches of, in this case, "corporate and supporting functions".

I've never been able to perform it consistently. It's one of many moderately fiddly special attacks - written down for posterity in a tear-stained journal I keep sorrowfully beneath my pillow - which have walled me out of enjoying fighting games, much as I love thinking about them. 


That wall grows ever higher as I age and my digits turn to dust and my dreams of launching Ryu like a sack of potatoes fade into the twilight. Still, at least I can still play and have fun with shooters, right? All you have to do in shooters is press a button once to make stuff go boom. Wait, Nightmare Operator, what are you doing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Better check those desert dunes again Caravan SandWitch, someone’s buried the lede. An open world you can explore in a few relaxed evenings? One that favours the joyous freeform sightseeing of an Elden Ring or Breath Of The Wild; where you’ll scramble up vast industrial concrete ruins on scavenging missions for inquisitive frogs, instead of being nagged by bothersome checklists?
Ok, rain check on that last point. SandWitch can’t help but eventually funnel the freedom of ambling around in your chuffy yellow van into restrictive collect-a-thons. Still, for much of its breezy runtime, this one’s a real panacea for gaming’s more bloated map-scourers. Plus, even when you are sent off to hamster-cheek scavenged components before making progress, there’s very little in this world that doesn’t feel intentional. Sidequests and storytelling crumbs are deliberately scattered throughout, and each building is a thoughtful concrete puzzle box. It is, in brief, a nice time.
You play as Sauge, a spacefarer returned to her planet of Cigalo after receiving a distress signal from her missing sister. Cigalo’s a cheery place, though economically and environmentally devastated after being exploited by an evil spacecorp named The Consortium. It’s populated by small settlements of people, some large talking frogs named the Reinetos, and the occasional friendly robot. Everything’s friendly, as it goes - even gravity itself. There’s no danger, no death, no damage from flinging yourself off the tallest building you can find. Just helping out your desert buds, upgrading your van with more gadgets to solve puzzles, or working on finding exactly where Sauge’s sister has go to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam’s family sharing feature Steam Families is now available to everyone on the platform, letting up to six total people share games from a single library, with each individual having access to their own saved games, achievements, and workshop files.
This means that, yes, when you all sit down together in the evening, you can enjoy a hearty family meal in the knowledge that between you, you technically own six copies of the Cities Skylines Big Butt Skinner Balloon.
Each person on the account will have one of two roles: adult or child. Adults can manage parental controls, set hourly or daily playtime limits, approve purchase requests, and control store access. Valve appear very proud of making it easier for parents to spend money, streamlining the “time-consuming” task of buying games for their kids.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are cold opens and there are freezing ones. Sci-fi roguelike shooter Wild Bastards doesn't start on its strongest cowboy boot. You are dumped into the middle of an interstellar chase and summarily shown the ropes. The guns feel simplistic, the arenas bare, the loot vanilla, and the entire loop of beaming down to a planet and getting into small-scale "showdowns" threatens to become stale within the first hour or so. But then you find an outlaw buddy who offers a new way to shoot human dirtbags. Then another fellow bandit. And another. By the time your spaceship is half-filled with scoundrels and weirdoes shouting at each other, the game has warmed up enough to reveal its central idea. This ain't no grand FPS campaign, nor is it quick as roguelikes go. It's a snacky shootout sim with tumbleweed towns that feels best when you savour the pre-fight suspense.

I used up all the mushroom lore I've ever gleaned from real-life foraging when I wrote about Morels 2, and I spent most of that article whining about unicorns. The best I can do as regards Shroom And Gloom is to say that these Shrooms do indeed look very Gloomy, possibly because some mad human has wandered into their warren and is now stabbing and eating them.

That’s a lot of cheddar for a living room games box, and while us Windows lot can’t quite claim pointing and laughing privileges – speccing a 4K-capable, DIY build desktop for seven hundred quid is certainly beyond me – the fact is that if you can get some pretty nifty PC kit for less. While still, let’s not forget, being able to play most of the PS5’s best games. It would not surprise me if someone from Sony’s PC division is already trying to entice Astro Bot underneath a cardboard box held up by a stick.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there's one thing I've heard from Minecraft modders when I've asked for their thoughts on the future of Minecraft, it's some variation on "fewer updates, please". This might seem unreasonable if you're not into modding, but the price of updating a game is often that you break any mods designed for it. Hence, the parts of Minecraft's history many seasoned Minecraft modders - together with server owners and pro mapmakers - remember most fondly are the longer lulls between updates.

Given that The Crew is an online-only game, that signalled its death knell… or death horn, more accurately. Then in April, they tow-trucked the game out of people's libraries and revoked their purchases. This led to a backlash, as you'd expect, and Ubisoft are accordingly taking a different approach with The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. They're giving both an offline mode to "ensure long term access to both titles".

Whenever I visit family in the States and find myself in a derelict shopping plaza or some other place affected by America's depressing sense of architectural planning and overreliance on cars, I can't help but feel a sense of dread.
Devil's Hideout, a point and click horror game made by indie dev Cosmic Void, takes place in one such abandoned American city, and manages to deliver on this sense of dread even if its eerie hellscape is rough around the edges.

All those onscreen 'Nids, yeah? And the stutterfest that was the recent preview build? Surely enough to make a Tech-Priest shed at least one oily tear.

Pretty good, actually – perhaps not to the extent that you should tackle Space Marine 2 on a crusty notebook (or, for the record, a Steam Deck), but it runs decently on minimum specs and is noticeably more stable than in that preview.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following major layoffs and project cancellations at Bungie, the company has since announced their plans for Destiny 2, a game whose future was very much unclear. In their latest blog post, they've announced that they're taking "Destiny to places it has never been before". This means it'll get two expansions per year, alongside four free major updates.

I like to walk in the woods around evening time, after a hard day of writing stupid listicles about Call Of Duty. Forests are a critical preoccupation of mine, actually - check this lumpen thinkypiece I wrote about Alan Wake 2 - but they're also spaces for retreat and reflection, where I can shrug off the angst and lose myself in the spectacle of sycamores and silverbirch, arching over the path.

A modder has cracked open some previously disabled abilities in the official modding toolkit for Baldur's Gate 3, making it possible for folks to create their own levels or alter the game's existing environments. The toolkit (which was only made available last week) previously wouldn't let you do any of that, due to "technical constraints and platform-specific guidelines," according to developers Larian. But modders neither care nor sleep. It took them just two days to worm their way into the devkit's innards and make the impossible possible.

When we last checked in with it back in January, it was funding via StartEngine with an ambitious eye towards a spring Early Access release.

These were among Molyneux's predictions for where video games would be in 25 years.

American boxer Chris Algieri has an even more drastic idea: "Make it free," he says. UFC CEO Dana White, meanwhile, sees more mileage in prosecuting pirates.

With an estimated 120 million visits over the last 12 months alone, KimCartoon was a very busy site and with that kind of traffic, life can get complicated. The site's operator says the site was shut down "due to DMCA" but, after weathering many storms over the years, maybe there's a little bit more to it than that.

Beyond that, colour me fairly enthused.

It's as though a toddler were actually an undersung class of special operator from a Tom Clancy shooter, rather than a wailing, hyperactive ball of tears and poop. Then again, I imagine Sam Fisher was a toddler once. Perhaps this is how he got started: escaping a smashed-up house full of roaming demon toys.

They've now published another blog post that torches the vagueness of the previous post with the righteously democratic flames of specificity. Overhauls to enemies are on the way, less-loved guns will be more effective, reworks to armor penetration and health values are on the boil, and they're taking inspiration from "player fantasies" for certain weapons and stratagems. All of these tweaks are set to go live on the 17th September, so not long to wait.

The recent DLC for the action roguelike came out of the oven a little doughy, with enough game-breaking bugs to thoroughly upset some fans. Including one bug that sometimes made the game's final boss accidentally invincible. Ah. Yesterday's patch seems to target the worst of these bugs, and the dev team promise there are more fixes are to come.

That was then and this, thankfully, is now. Byrne has tentatively returned to the project and begun sharing screens on social media.

It's a crying shame that it's not currently available to buy anywhere digitally, presumably because the rights are soaked in a gutter between EA (the original publisher) and Microsoft (who bought and closed developers Lionhead).

If you do still own a physical copy of Black & White however, you might be interested in Openblack. It's a fan-led project to create a modern, open source engine for running Black & White, and its first build was just released yesterday.

It looks like an illustration from an old botanical or geographical textbook, although the inviting emptiness around the visible area also dimly reminds  me of certain elder RPGs I used to play on Macintosh.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did you forget about Baldur's Gate 3? Because Baldur's Gate 3 did not forget about you. Specifically, it did not forget about the incorrigible evil-doers amongst you who've been gunning for some additional plot catharsis. Larian's very bestest RPG has been biding its time in the shadows while you've been busy with other games. It has lingered silently while you've been off heisting on Tatooine or getting all messed up by Golden-Eyed Beasts, waiting and watching for the perfect moment - and now, it has finally struck with an unholy new patch, which adds 13 new Evil Endings, revamped splitscreen and an official modding toolkit. Foolish summer child! It is too late to flee.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Do not forget to turn the system off before touching anything," says my astronaut colleague over the radio. I grab the faulty power transformer without listening, and am immediately electrocuted. Worse still, I have to hammer a quick-time button to recover. This is what it is like to be Jerry, the janitor of a cheap and poorly maintained space station. Jerry is being tasked with repair work beyond his job description, learning the ins and outs of an escape pod's machinery from his co-worker via radio. This may come in handy, as the station is about to explode. Tin Can is not a new game (it came out in 2022) but it is on sale as part of Steam's space exploration fest. And I enjoy a space game that makes me panic while alarms go off everywhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dobří herci, dobrá atmosféra, slušně řemeslně natočeno, občas dobrý vtip, ale scénář není nic moc a pokud o titulní postavě nic nevíte, je to místy dost zmatené (kdo je kdo, proč dělá to, co dělá, a proč by vás to mělo zajímat). Až na konci zjistíte, že je to jen polovina příběhu a na zbytek budete muset jít do kina za půl roku, což bych se odvážil označit za podraz na diváka. (Ilča 60 %)]]></summary>
