        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You be there
Ubisoft is making plans to be at this year's E3. Following comments from the publisher during an investor's call, Ubisoft has confirmed it will be in attendance at E3 2023.
During an investor's call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot responded to an inquiry on whether the company would be in attendance at this year's event. "If E3 happens, we will be there and we will have a lot of things to show," said Guillemot at the time.
In a follow-up to GamesIndustry.biz, Ubisoft clarifies the wording:
"E3 is a special moment for our industry and we are excited to showcase our strong line-up in Los Angeles in June. We are still finalizing the details of our plans and look forward to sharing more soon."

It's a good clarification, at least, for those who may have thought E3 was changing things up once again following Guillemot's comment. ReedPop did reaffirm that E3 is "full speed ahead" after Guillemot's initial comment, but with this clarification, that's at least one company that looks set to show something in Los Angeles. [Disclosure: I was previously employed at USgamer, a former ReedPop website.]
The summer of games awaits
Questions of who's attending E3 2023 are still up in the air. An IGN report confirmed Sony, Nintendo, and Xbox wouldn't be on the show floor, though Microsoft is planning to host a summer showcase in Los Angeles.
The current plan has E3 2023 running from June 13 through 16 in Los Angeles, with both industry and consumer days planned.
Meanwhile, Ubisoft says it is bringing a "strong line-up" to bear for its Los Angeles showing. The publisher has been on a bit of a roller-coaster, announcing a bevy of Assassin's Creed projects while also cancelling a number of unannounced projects and delaying Skull and Bones. It'll be interesting to see what it shows up with in June.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Laser imaging, detection, and range
Steelkrill Studios, the makers of lo-fi horror game The Backrooms 1998, have announced that they’ll be releasing The Voidness into the void of Early Access on March 17, 2023.
The Voidness is a unique horror game with an experimental twist. For much of the game, you’re immersed in complete darkness and are only able to perceive your surroundings with a lidar scanner. A lidar, or laser imaging, detection, and ranging scanner, is a device that uses lasers to create a constructive image of the area it’s pointed at. It has many uses, as it can create 3D maps of geographic locations and features.

For The Voidness, however, lidar will be your only means of seeing what’s around you, and that includes anything that might be trying to eat you. The developer also touts that, like in The Backrooms 1998, enemies will listen in on your PC microphone. That sounds more like a feature utilized by streamers, as I don’t make it a habit of talking to my computer monitor. However, I’m always down for an experimental approach to game design.
I haven’t personally played The Backrooms 1998, but I’ve seen it spoken of fondly in the indie horror circles I observe. It has also been picked up by popular streamers and has enjoyed it reasonable amount of success as a result. I might have to give it a good look-over once it leaves early access. The Voidness is another game to add to that list, as the developer states that its Early Access period will last anywhere from “a few months or a couple years.”
The Voidness will launch on PC via Steam Early Access on March 17, 2023.

At the climax of this weekend's Capcom Cup, the last such tournament to be held on Street Fighter V, the publisher revealed that its next pro-season, Capcom Cup X, will have a $2 million USD prize pool, with the first crowned Street Fighter 6 champion walking away with a cool one million dollars.
Street Fighter 6, which launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms June 6, will be the exclusive game of Capcom Cup X, and will see players from all over the globe become literal World Warriors, catching flights to a wide variety of official tournaments in order to bag the CPT points necessary to make it to the grand finals — expected to be held in early 2024. The huge prize pool is expected to see many players, perhaps even retirees, dust off the arcade stick and go for their moment of glory.
https://twitter.com/StreetFighter/status/1627566668821172224?s=20
Of course, the promotion of such a lucrative tournament also works in Capcom's favor, as it keeps hype for the new sequel high, as well as encourages large turnouts at the many events that will be held all over the globe between Street Fighter 6's launch this summer and the ultimate showdown next year. Street Fighter 6, as I have iterated many a time, is already shaping up to be a fantastic release, one that hopes to see the brand reestablish itself as the competitive fighting game.
Me? Well, while I will no doubt continue to attend every tournament I am able — much as I did for Street Fighter V — I simply have far too much work to do to grab for the brass ring...

The fan group Team K4L have announced that their translation of Kurohyou: Ryu Ga Gotoku Shinshou will be released this August. Initially, they had hoped to release it last year, but unfortunately had to delay it.
Sega has come a long way when it comes to localizing their Yakuza/Like a Dragon series, so we’ve been eating well. Like a Dragon: Ishin! was once argued by Sega as being a poor choice for localization, but despite that, we just recently finally got it over here. However, in a recent interview with The Gamer chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto said of Kurohyou, “I think if we wanted to develop something, we're not really looking at the past, we're looking to the future, and we think that we want to put our efforts and our priorities at making new titles for Like a Dragon.” That’s not a “no, definitely not,” but it’s not looking good, so it’s always great to see fans step in to bring a title to a wider audience.
[embed]https://youtu.be/dkkGKxAhNr0[/embed]
Kurohyou: Ryu Ga Gotoku Shinsho is a 2010 spin-off of the series for PSP. Rather than an attempt to simply transplant the Like a Dragon/Yakuza formula to the portable, Sega enlisted AKI Corporation (now known as syn Sophia) to put their own spin on it. AKI should be a familiar name to anyone who played N64 wrestling games, as they’re the developers behind WCW/NWO Revenge and WWF No Mercy. These titles, as well as the others they put out on the console, are still regarded as some of the best pro wrestling games ever released.
The gameplay focuses more on one-on-one combat, but the narrative features the familiar neighborhood of Kamurocho and is packed with mini-games and side quests. Combat is modeled closer to Def Jam Fight for NY, rather than the more beat-’em-up brawling of your typical Yakuza/Like a Dragon game.
K4L will be releasing the translation patch this August under the name Kurohyou (Like a Dragon: Black Panther).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a year and a half since release
If you missed Monster Hunter Stories 2 when it came out in mid-2021, I don't blame you. There's a host of reasons why a lot of folks skipped out on it, but the good news is that Capcom is permanently reducing the price of the game: which will also impact the aftermarket.
Announced openly on Twitter, Capcom had this to say:
"Ride on! Grab Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin for #NintendoSwitch and PC/Steam at a new price of $39.99. Start your journey today with the demo and transfer your progress over to the full game."

That price is already reflected in the digital edition of the game on both Switch and Steam. Note that there is a "Digital Deluxe Edition" though, which is now $50. The new $40 standard isn't present everywhere though, as a search through various digital storefronts came up with a $60 digital voucher code price. Keep that in mind if you're ever shopping for the game! It'll take a bit for everything to really sink in everywhere, but used copies are already dropping to $30 and below in some marketplaces (like Amazon).
There's also the chance that Monster Hunter Stories 2 will be part of the ever-present Capcom sale periods, so you could get it for even cheaper. In this economy, it goes without saying that we could use more price drops.

The latest UK charts are in, and without any new releases to speak of in the top ten this week, there is merely a slight reshuffling of the deck.
In the top ten, Splatoon 3 has made a bit of a comeback this week, climbing up six spots from position sixteen to position ten. Meanwhile, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe maintains its current position at number four, which it has held for the last three weeks running. Animal Crossing New Horizons has dropped a few spots, but is still holding on strong, while Nintendo Switch Sports maintains its own position at number eight for the second week in a row.

A heads-up for those looking to stay spoiler-free ahead of the launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom: it looks like the art book as leaked online.
Over the weekend, over 200 pages of what looks to be The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom art book leaked online and seeped through various channels. We won't be sharing any links or posting any of the leak here, though we've taken a look ourselves to verify its existence.
Without divulging any details, it does look like the art book for the upcoming Breath of the Wild sequel. And the nice part is, from a cursory scan, nothing jumped out as an obvious spoiler. Still, it's worth being aware that this info is out there, in case you want to go into Tears of the Kingdom as fresh as possible.

Art of the kingdom
It's especially interesting that an art book would leak so far ahead of the release date. We're still a ways out from Tears of the Kingdom's release date of May 12, 2023. This art book is part of what's included in the collector's edition of the game. It is strange that so much info would make it out from the book, three months ahead of time.
Still, fans are likely hungry for more information, as it feels like we don't know a ton about this new Zelda. Points like the main antagonist, or the reason why Hyrule is now home to so many floating islands, are all still theories at this time. I'm sure fans are likely to pick this Zelda art book apart looking for any info on what could be arriving in May.
In the meantime, rev up those muted keywords and hashtags if you're looking to avoid all of it. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom arrives on May 12, 2023.

Metroid Prime has long been considered one of the crowning achievements of Nintendo’s GameCube library. The series’ seamless transition to the first-person genre was defined by its frenetic action, massively explorable environments, clever puzzles, and daunting boss encounters. However, the subsequent two decades have worn on the original release, but much like Samus by the end of each game, Metroid Prime Remastered brings the title back to full power.

The Horizon series came out of nowhere when it was announced, and now it's sort of synonymous with Sony's entire IP stable, alongside of juggernauts like God of War and The Last of Us. It turns out people really like robot dinosaurs, amid all of the other (sometimes silly) lore therein. It's fun to explore and experience this wild universe in a traditional third person format; but now we have a VR option in Horizon Call of the Mountain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the mud and forests of Normandy, and the grim, snowy climes of the Eastern Front, Company Of Heroes 3 feels like World War II on its summer holiday. With two campaigns spanning each side of the sunny Mediterranean, this is arguably Relic's breeziest and most colourful theatre of war yet, evoking the same kind of swagger and gung ho optimism as a Hollywood action flick. It's a feeling that might seem out of place given the current climate, especially now, just days away from the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But while your main objective is always one of domination, gradually turning the map from red to blue on both a micro and macro scale, this is ultimately a game about searing comebacks - of beating back seemingly impossible aggressors, and finding hope where previously there was only despair. I think we could all do with a bit of that in this day and age, even if the battles before you end up feeling like nothing more than the digital equivalent of plonking down a big box of toy soldiers on your living room floor and going daka-daka-daka as they all fall over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kiss the moons
Roughly a year after launching Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, Square-Enix has circled back to address some of its glaring issues with a patch this month. The patch is expected to address issues relating to the title's frame rate, tweak the growth system for Pip, and fix numerous bugs.
Chrono Cross was the anticipated sequel to the SNES classic, Chrono Trigger. It was extremely well-received at its time of release but has since developed a reputation as “not Chrono Trigger” (source: my old college friends). When Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition eventually hit the scene, I found the game to be decent, but not one of Square’s best PS1 titles.

That’s fine. It’s still a worthwhile game, especially if you love Square’s PS1-era RPGs. This recent port, however, I found to be kind of stinky, although that’s not what I actually said. My sentiment was more along the lines that it was a barebones port that was serviceable but had framerate issues that made it feel like it failed to reach my bare minimum expectations. Hopefully, this patch will bring the port up to more acceptable standards.
Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition is available now on Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. No date was given for the patch.

From the look of the screenshots, I was expecting a creepy story in the vein of Little Misfortune or Fran Bow, but instead Birth is infinitely more introspective. Sure, it’s a game about death, decay, and loneliness, but it’s told in the most gentle and genuine way possible. Its themes are heavy, but the game could not be more light-hearted. I have no idea how it does it, but Birth is weirdly the most wholesome yet creepy game I've ever played.

Last week saw Sony Interactive Entertainment release dazzling space shooter Returnal on the PC platform, and while the PS5 Housemarque gem has been suitably well-received by critics and players, that doesn't mean that it hasn't come without a few minor bugs that need blasting into the stratosphere.
A new patch, available to download right now, takes an initial pass at some of these issues. The priority here is removing a bug that caused grasses to pop-in when Returnal is played on its "Epic" particle settings. This issue should now be resolved. Additionally, the new patch fixes a bug that was causing music to pause on rare occasions, along with auto-sync problems with certain resolutions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKZV00Esu54&ab_channel=PlayStation
"We are honoured to have so many new players experiencing our dark, deep and beautiful action thriller, Returnal!" reads a message accompanying the patch notes. "Bringing Returnal to PC and capturing that PlayStation 5 experience took a lot of work and focus from the team at Climax Studios, with support from Housemarque and XDEV. We have been blown away and are so thankful for the amazing reviews, feedback and reports you have shared with us so far."
"We have continued to work on Returnal since launch, monitoring your feedback and will continue to work on patch updates to support the game ahead."
Returnal, originally launched on PS5 in the spring of 2021, is a visually compelling shooter that tells the tale of a space explorer trapped in a time loop. The adrenaline-pumping adventure is renowned for its dazzling visual design, strong use of light and color, compelling challenge, and frantic, trigger-pumping action. The PC port is the latest in a series of PlayStation titles added to the desktop platform, such as God of War, Uncharted 4, Death Stranding, Marvel's Spider-Man, and Horizon Zero Dawn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The release of the Pinocchio-inspired Soulslike Lies of P has been narrowed down to this August. A new story trailer introduces a seemingly villainous character, Simon, while highlighting some of the dangerous monstrosities waiting to dismantle players. 
Lies of P unfolds in the fictional, Belle Époque-era French city of Krat as players control Pinocchio, a mechanoid puppet on a quest to become human. A certain Mr. Geppetto might be able to help with that, but Krat has been overtaken by sinister creatures Pinocchio must cut down using his multi-purpose mechanical arm. 


The gameplay takes heavy cues from From Software’s work – Bloodborne in particular – as players take down enemies with deliberate sword attacks, while various mechanical arms grant abilities like firing lightning bolts or a grappling hook to reel in targets. Outside of battles, sidequests present the option of lying to characters, and the truthfulness of your answers alters the direction of these stories. 
Lies of P will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC. You can learn more by reading our hands-on preview from last year’s Gamescom.]]></summary>

Get ready for some heavy mech action, as Rainmaker Productions and M2 have announced they’ll be dropping their uncensored port of Assault Suit Valken on Switch this Spring. If you’re not sure what I’m so excited about, Assault Suit Valken was released in North America under the name Cybernator. If you still don’t know what I’m excited about then I’m deeply hurt.
[embed]https://youtu.be/Mc_EQ0HjkjM[/embed]
Cybernator was published by Konami back in 1993, and it was awesome. However, the SNES version published in North America and Europe was censored and its translation was extremely barebones. While I could probably live without the censored content’s depictions of suicide, I definitely welcome the re-translated dialogue. Along with the translation comes standard features including like save states, retro screen filters, and unlockable cheats. You can also choose from arranged and original music, view production artwork, and check out an 80-page translated guide. Finally, they’ve included an interview with Satoshi Nakai.
But what you should be saying is, “Shhh… You had me at Assault Suit Valken is Cybernator.”
Interestingly, what is shown in the trailer is a port of the SNES original rather than the 2005 PS2 remaster. Personally, I prefer the game's original pixel-art look. It’s surprising but welcome to see that M2 feels the same way.
Assault Suit Valken Declassified is coming to Nintendo Switch this Spring.

Metroid Prime Remastered had a surprise digital release on February 8, but folks will have to wait until February 22 for the physical edition of the game (myself included, who ordered one!).
Early copies are now in the wild, including this one from Reddit user LegoFan12345. But the real story here is that the physical edition includes reversible box art. So what's on the reverse side? It's the Japanese box art for the game. Neat! You can peruse both options and the back of the box in the gallery below.
After all this time, it's wild to see so much focus on Metroid. Between Metroid Dread selling well and Metroid Prime Remastered seeing widespread acclaim, it would stand to reason that we'll get more Metroid Prime re-releases leading into the question mark release of Metroid Prime 4. That thing is likely so far away that we could even see another 2D Metroid before it comes out.
That said, Nintendo has surprised us before. One E3 Direct and a title announcement: and it could even get a release window. That sort of stuff is why Nintendo is such a wild card, and the industry is better overall with them in it. For now, you can enjoy Metroid Prime again (or for the first time!), over 20 years after the original release.

It looks like a bloody visual feast, but the bigger news is how Redfall’s open-world multiplayer is untethered, meaning a four-player squad can separate and fight bloodsuckers in different parts of the coastal town.

Various videos featuring the rumoured Legend of Zelda Deku Tree Lego set have been removed from YouTube. Lego has been issuing copyright strikes to a number of people who have spoken about the video on the video sharing platform, with Nintendo Prime sharing the notice they received.
Fans have been begging for a Zelda-themed Lego set for years, with various rumours and Ideas popping up over the years. Last year, Lego started blocking submissions for Zelda sets, before a Breath of the Wild one reportedly became eligible for review. Then, in February 2023, a Deku Tree set was reportedly seen by someone who was sent a marketing survey for future Lego sets.

From an Nvidia tech demo back to in 2019 to an RTX-branded trailer released just last month, this souped-up lighting and reflection tech has been a key piston in propelling the Soviet sci-fi FPS’ hype train. Some slightly awkward news, then: the PC version won’t support ray tracing at launch.
I noticed the lack of ray tracing options in the review build we received last week, and got in touch with the game's press relations team to check if I was missing something, or if they were due to be added via update. The response confirmed that their absence was not an error, and that "the devs will be looking into implementing this post-launch." Well then!

Publisher Neowiz has tightened up the release window for its upcoming steampunk soulslike, Lies of P, and now expects the intriguing-looking adventure to launch on PC and consoles in August 2023.
Developed by South Korean studio Round8, Lies of P is the latest in a long line of adaptations of the Pinocchio story, and sees a puppet mechanoid endeavoring to find his lost creator, Mr. Geppetto, who is located somewhere within the dark, overbearing, Belle Epoque fictional city of Krat. Utilize Pinocchio's mechanization to adaptively combat your opponents, while twisting elements of truth in order to further your goals, survive the hunters, and reunite with your "father".
You can check out the action in the new trailer below, courtesy of IGN.

Appealing to me on a variety on conceptual and aesthetic levels, Lies of P is one of my most anticipated titles of the year. While I'm not yet entirely sure of its quality, the world, characters, style, and interesting use of the Pinocchio lore have piqued my interest, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing whether Round8 has successfully created a worthy entry to the rapidly over-stuffed Soulslike genre. While "August" is not exactly a release date, it's the closest to a definitive launch we've had...
...Provided, of course, that someone isn't fibbing to us.
Lies of P launches August 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

This week sees the release of the exciting, multi-threaded RPG Octopath Traveler II, and publisher Square Enix is hoping to whet the whistles of adventure fans everywhere by offering up a slice of the anticipated sequel — with a new demo now available on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch platforms.
The Octopath Traveler II demo offers up three hours of folk-town shenanigans, allowing players to experience some time from each of the sequel's eight protagonists — each destined to follow their own paths to fate and glory. Choose your hero and set foot in the 19th-century world of Solista, speaking with the locals, embarking upon quests and missions, and exploring the new and potent "Latent Powers" mechanic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hUi_GTHn-Y&ab_channel=SquareEnix
Each of the adventure's eight protagonists has their own background, purpose, and skillset, but whether you choose the vengeance-filled path of Osvald the Scholar, the slick-tongued world of Partitio the Merchant, the shadowy past of Throne the Thief, or the mythic life of Temenos the Cleric, Octopath Traveler II hopes to deliver a layered tale of intrigue, suspense, adventure, and action for all lovers of the fantasy RPG genre.
Go check out the demo and see whether it encourages you to don your walking boots.
Octopath Traveler II launches February 24 on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

Jeff Minter, international man of gaming mystery, is back in action. If you’ve never heard of him, the 60-year-old has been in game coding and development, and seemingly happily off his rocker since 1979. Going by the moniker ‘Yak’, Minter cut his teeth on the Sinclair ZX60 in the early '80s, going on to form his own development studio, Llamasoft.
Having won a loyal following over the years thanks to visually disarming, aurally arresting and crudely dazzling arcade game score challenges, Minter is probably best known for Tempest 2000 (1994), a launch title for the Atari Jaguar that remains the system’s best exclusive. Its unique hallucinogenic style and breakneck urgency has gone on to define much of his output since, from Space Giraffe to Polybius, leading to the unsubstantiated but common inference that the programmer dabbles in psychedelic drugs.

Personally, I’m what they called a “Speccy” kid, and I have carried a deep and profound love of the elderly microcomputer’s cassette tape screeches, colour clash and long, long load times into my adult life, despite the fact that – and please don’t get upset, purists – many of the great Spectrum games don’t hold up in the cold light of the modern day. It’s not that the games are necessarily bad, more that they were tremendous for their time. Still eminently enjoyable, but they require the player to get their head into a certain zone, to put up with what are inarguably quite archaic controls and mechanics. 


Oddly enough, there are some Spectrum games on Steam, thanks to a publisher called Pixel Games. However, with the utmost respect to their output… these are not the kind of games that are going to foster interest in the Speccy amongst modern players. Of course, that may well not be the point, but I’d be a little taken aback if even avowed old-school gamers were going to bother picking up the likes of gardening simulator Pedro, a game that scored 63% in Newsfield’s iconic Crash magazine back in the day, or Sam Stoat: Safebreaker, which did a little better at 68%.

Akka Arrh is a reimagined version of a prototype Atari arcade machine from the ‘80s. Originally scrapped due to a lack of interest, the trailer for the re-release claims that only three cabinets have ever been seen. 40 years later, when Atari reached out to veteran designer Jeff Minter (Tempest 2000, Polybius) to remake one of its games, he chose Akka Arrh. The result is a reimagining of the original concept, fused with Minter’s signature psychedelic visuals and some modern-day improvements. While the game can…]]></summary>

FUR Squadron launches on the eShop on March 17th, 2023 at a price of £6.29, and judging from the above trailer and accompanying screenshots, it looks very much like classic Star Fox, but with an extra burst of colour and flair. Heck, even the main characters look pretty similar to Star Fox himself, Peppy Hare, and Slippy Toad. Overall, we're liking the vibe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the motherland
Before I get into this Review in Progress, I should probably discuss the elephant in the room. Atomic Heart is the debut title from developer Mundfish, who, in recent weeks, has come under pressure to be more transparent over its ties to Russia. According to a Eurogamer article, which goes into far more detail on the matter than I will here, Mundfish's investor is the Russian firm GEM Capital, which is run by Anatoliy Paliy, who used to work for the state-owned Gazprom. The developer bills itself as a multinational developer with team members in 10 different countries, including Poland, Ukraine, and the United Arab Emirates. However, the original development team was based in Russia, and Russian-state media has referred to the studio as Russian in reports on the game.

With Nintendo Switch Online now having Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games, and Pokemon Day fast approaching (27th February), it's got a lot of people speculating — will Gen 1, 2, and 3 make the jump to NSO?
YouTuber and content creator Austin John Plays is one such person who's been pushing those ideas forward, and over the weekend, he posted a video looking and the possibility of Pokémon trading in the generation 1 remakes, Pokémon FireRed & LeafGreen. Contacted by his friend MelonSpeedruns, who has tested these games (along with the original Red & Blue and Yellow on the Game Boy) on NSO, Melon says that the games "run flawlessly" and — not only that — but you can trade Pokémon on NSO with another player.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve played a lot of strange games, but never one that lurches between greatness and bafflement as hard or as fast as Atomic Heart. It’s a fascinatingly chaotic medley of ideas, and a rare FPS that lacks even the slightest whiff of battle pass-peddling live serfdom, but those ideas so often fail to gel that it can feel like a game made by several different dev teams. For a shooter set within an alternate history Soviet Union, it could perhaps have used some more central planning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see novelty games on Steam every couple of days; things like gun-wielding slime shooters, or hyper-realistic dog-walking sims. They all force a little chuckle out of me, but none of them have made me belly laugh like I Am Jesus Christ, a first-person retelling of Christ’s tale from birth, to death, to rebirth.  


I Am Jesus Christ’s genre is slightly murky, although, it almost looks like a giant Skyrim mod complete with unfeeling NPCs, first-person spellcasting, and an open world full of quest markers. The newest trailer shows some of Christ’s cool abilities like walking on water, shooting light beams at Satan, and fishing - which is incidentally what I’m looking forward to the most. 


In fairness, the Christ sim looks like a pretty robust and thorough retelling of his journey, depicting scenes like the Last Supper, only this time all the disciples have exclamation marks above their heads. The Steam page also details 30 different miracles (or spells) and a number of different areas to explore.

What's a better promotional tie-in than sweets, hey? Bandai knows that, and it's releasing some The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom-themed gummies in May in Japan to celebrate the release of the highly anticipated game. But they're not rupee-shaped or even Triforce shaped, oh no. They look just like Chuchu (via Tokyo Game Life on Twitter).
It just makes sense, doesn't it — edible Chuchu sweets? They look like bouncy little bits of jelly in the games anyway, and as they come in different colours. They're tailor-made for this kind of tie in, and we're quite surprised that this is the first time this has been done. But despite being different colours, they don't come in different flavours — they're all grape-flavoured. No apple-flavoured sweets for the green one? Really?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like all good fairytale characters, Pinocchio gets a revision every couple of years - except for 2022, when he was adapted thrice (mostly in bad films, except for the Del Toro one). The loveable puppet isn’t waiting too long for his next comeback, as the RPG Soulslike Lies Of P is coming to PC and Game Pass in August. 


Lies Of P’s newest trailer is mostly a black screen with a lot of VO, but we get a clear look at Pinocchio's daddy Master Gepetto this time. The trailer follows a blob wobbling through very Victorian streets before it slides into some automation and uses the machine’s body as a puppet. The result is a boss-sized monstrosity that sits halfway between Lovecraftian horror and industrial defect. It also reminds me of Gears 5’s weird infected robots, with tentacles and slime hanging off their metallic arms - equally gross and cool.


The newest trailer doesn’t show off any Bloodborne-style combat, but we’ve had plenty of looks at that already, including a fight with a gorilla robocop. This Soulslike looks just as aggressive as you’d expect, emphasising quick dodge rolls and last-minute, anxiety-fueled parries. Pinocchio’s arm doubles up as a grappling hook to pull enemies in, which is always cool in a hack n’ slasher, and makes even more sense when you’re playing as a puppet. Also, is it just me or is Pinocchio pretty this time around?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To Hell with It
Blizzard Entertainment has announced that it will hold beta tests this March from its grim-looking dungeon-crawler Diablo IV this March. The grim 'n' gothic sequel is currently scheduled to launch June 6 on PC and consoles.
The beta, confirmed during this weekend's IGN Fan Fest, will be live across all platforms and will allow players to battle through most of the sequel's first act, set within the locale of "Fractured Peaks". All character classes are available to play up to a level cap of 25, and most of the main quests and side objectives will be included in the beta. It sounds similar to the beta test for Diablo III, which was held back in the spring of 2012 and offered up the same experience and limitations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhu26227MD4&ab_channel=Diablo
Players who pre-order Diablo IV will receive early access to the beta for the weekend of March 17-19. The beta will be fully opened up to the public on the following weekend, March 24-26. Progress from the closed beta will carry through to the open beta. You can check out full details on what to expect from this trial over on the official Blizzard website. Additionally, the publisher released the cinematic intro movie for the sequel, which you can check out above.
Diablo IV launches June 6 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel charcoal is a perfectly valid medium
Freedom Games has announced that 9 Years of Shadows, the musical Metroidvania from developer Halberd Studios, will arrive on March 27, 2023.
While, on the surface, 9 Years of Shadows looks like a pretty close follower of a particular 1997 Castlevania title, it has some unique wrinkles to make it more than another gated exploration title. Appropriately taking place after the world has spent the aforementioned nine years in darkness, you play as Europa, who refuses to let that timespan build into a full decade. Bringing with her a “healing teddy bear,” she sets off to the cursed Castle Talos to try and bring color back into the world.
[embed]https://youtu.be/XIm-ss9L3pA[/embed]
Music will play an important role in the narrative. Some bosses wield “musical attack patterns.” Serving as guest composers are Metal Gear Solid veteran Norihiko Hibino and Iga-era Castlevania fixture Michiru Yamane. On top of contributing to the soundtrack of 9 Years of Shadows, these two absolute legends will make appearances within the game as NPCs. Damn.
The Symphony of the Night corner of the indie marketplace is a rather crowded one these days, but I’m rather stricken by the colorful pixel art that 9 Years of Shadow is showing off. It reminds me of the way Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance used bright colors to appear more visible on the Game Boy Advance’s light-hungry screen. I sometimes feel like I’ve had my fill of gated exploration titles, but they more often resemble pickles; I always seem to have room for one more.
9 Years of Shadows will be available on PC via Steam and Epic Game Store on March 27. A Switch version is in the works and will drop in the third quarter of 2023.

Ah, special edition consoles. There is nothing else quite like them, is there? From the flashy to the subtle, these decked-out devices are a reminder of the series' that we love, the titles we cherish and the designs that make us ooh and ahh. They are a special way to stand out from the crowd and have something that feels a little more 'you'. So, when it comes to the Switch (Nintendo's second best-selling console of all time) there are a boatload of them.
A few months ago we collected together all of the Zelda-themed consoles from Nintendo's history, revealing a long list of some of the sexiest designs out there. But the Switch was notably absent from this ranking (in an official capacity at least — those Tears of the Kingdom OLED rumours intensify by the week), so we thought that it was only fair to shine the light on Nintendo's latest and (second) greatest in response.

Speaking to Polygon, Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto mentioned how Splatoon was one of the series considered outside of the company's key franchise, Super Mario. Nintendo instead decided to make this new venture "easier" by narrowing focus on its lead mascot:

I’ve made it clear by now that ranking games in a franchise or a system’s library is not easy. Even if these rankings are subjective, deciding which games are “best” wracks my brain for hours before I finish a rough draft. This is why I do not say lightly that all my lists to this point pale in comparison to the difficulty of ranking the best SNES games.
Lord Spencer elegantly described my 10 best Mario games list as “a list of nines rolling into tens.” As I jotted down my picks for this list, I realized they were all potentially tens. The SNES is so jam-packed with incredible titles that we upped the count to 15 to represent it. This is a system where legends were born, franchises were codified, and memories were made magical.

There's been a lot of conversation in recent times about the price of video games being raised and games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom have even been bumped up to $70.
It seems Capcom is doing the complete opposite with its older library of titles - announcing the 2021 release Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin now has a new price. It's dropped from $59.99 USD down to just $39.99 USD. This applies to the physical and digital versions of the game.

Listen, I know that’s not everybody’s favorite game, but this was the first time I saw big, explorable worlds in a video game. I thought every game was one day going to be like that, before someone decided that the only way for a world to be worthwhile is if it was peppered with animals to skin every five feet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tank you very much
After spending several weeks in the land of Taito, retro purveyor Hamster is taking another trip into Namco's past, with the arrival of the obscure cyber-tank battler Grobda, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to the arcade market in 1984, Grobda is a side title in the Xevious shmup series, and sees one of the enemies of that game repurposed as a mighty battle tank. Essentially a futuristic version of the golden age Atari game, Combat, Grobda sees players control the titular tank against a battalion of enemies in top-down, maze-driven action. The player must utilize the Grobda's laser weaponry to destroy their opponents while dodging return fire across a gauntlet of 99 stages.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Old Classic Retro Gaming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAXdlXLPlRQ&ab_channel=OldClassicRetroGaming
Having launched just on the verge of the Video Game Crash, Grobda would swiftly vanish into the void, though home versions were developed for Japanese platforms such as the Sharp X1 and the NEC PC-6001. Grobda development team featured some notable Namco luminaries, including Tower of Druaga designer Masanobu Endo, and Dig Dug composer Yuriko Keino. Always a pioneer, Keino devised a mechanic that allowed Grobda to speed up her score as the action heated up, a fun little gimmick for the time. Development was smashed out in a mere three months from conception to release. Wild days.
Grobda is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

On February 16, Bungie shared a 16-minute video documentary that gave fans of the series a deeper look at Lightfall and what comes next. There was plenty of information to sink our teeth into, and we'll dissect the Lightfall ViDoc and bring you all you need to know about its contents.

I haven’t done much diving into deck-builders, which seems to be riding the trend wave in the indie market. I’m honestly not sure why, since every time I’ve interacted with one, I’ve enjoyed it. Take, for example, Mahokenshi.
I tried the demo of Mahokenshi a long while back and came away impressed, yet somehow the final release still snuck up on me. Its mix of board-game style, turn-based, card-centric gameplay felt rather powerful in my first experience, so I was excited to see how the whole package turned out.

Ghost Ship Games, the independent developer behind 2018's smash hit Deep Rock Galactic, has announced that it has founded a new publishing wing, named, naturally, Ghost Ship Publishing. The new label is the next step in the evolution of the studio, following its purchase by Embracer Group in 2021.
"Becoming a publisher is a way for us to give a bit back to the industry, and to help lift up both the Danish gaming scene and other small developers like ourselves across the globe," said CEO of Ghost Ship Games Soren Lundgaard in a press statement. "Our goal is to assist fellow developers with funding and marketing expertise, while also helping them establish a solid business. Founding a publishing brand is a passion project for us, and we are very excited to make this a reality.”
https://twitter.com/GhostShip_Games/status/1626153169255297024?s=20
"Starting a publishing company is a natural next step for Ghost Ship," adds CCO Mikkel Martin Pedersen. "We love games and the success of Deep Rock Galactic has now enabled us to help other developers create theirs. We can’t wait to get started."
Ghost Ship Publishing is believed to already have several titles waiting in the wings for release in 2023 and beyond. The new label will work with independent studios in order to help conceive, finance, and release their respective projects. Ghost Ship Games was originally brought under the EMbracer Group banner in August 2021, as part of a huge acquisition period that also saw the holding company pick up 3D Realms, Easy Trigger, Slipgate Ironworks, CrazyLabs, and several other fledgling studios.

After the success of Resident Evil, Capcom followed it up with a spiritual successor called Dino Crisis.

The game stars Regina, a special ops soldier sent with a team to investigate an island research facility that has been taken over by these prehistoric lizards. Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction.

If you’ve been following these events as they’ve gone live, you know what to expect. Garchomp and Sylveon will have boosted appearance rates in Tera Raids at either 4 or 5-Star difficulty. They will spawn as any Tera Type in the game, so it’s impossible to choose a dedicated Pokemon to counter them like in 7-Star raids. That said, Sylveon will more commonly appear with the Fairy Tera Type, while Garchomp will commonly sport the Ground Tera Type. These events typically don't boost the the appearan…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[They think we know nothing
Survival town-builder Outlanders is the latest game that will be leaving Apple Arcade to plant roots on new platformers. Pomelo Games' builder is dropping on March 7, 2023.
First released on the iOS Apple Arcade in 2019, Outlanders is a survival town-builder, a genre that has been growing in popularity since Shining Rock Software’s 2014 hit, Banished. Since then, the formula has been expanded by games like Frostpunk and Settlement Survival. The focus of these games is on resource management, as your townsfolk suffer from a fatal condition known as mortality. Fail to keep them fed and healthy, and they will succumb to their diseases.

Outlanders attempts a more relaxed approach, but you’ll still be tasked with filling hungry bellies. It has a narrative campaign that has you follow the paths of various leaders. There is no combat, but the media around it shows construction near a volcano. Like other games in the series, you manage the workload of the town’s inhabitants, and you can pass decrees to work the ungrateful peons to an early grave. Improvements have been made to the UI and graphics to make it better suited to the good old mouse and keyboard setup. A sandbox mode will also be available if you do better without having to worry about goals or expectations.
Outlanders is currently available on iOS via Apple Arcade, and will be coming to PC on March 7, 2023. There is currently a PC demo available on Steam if you want to kick the tires.

I will probably regret not keeping Ozymandias aside for the traditional "summer strategy game for when your brain is a gas" bit, but the scene is looking healthy enough to chance it.
You know that cliché feeling of "just one more turn"? Ozymandias is a bronze age 4X that builds momentum enough to turn that into "just one more game". It is incredibly easy to learn, and despite looking a little dry and number heavy, becomes more effortless, more pleasant the longer you play. It also becomes more clear how much depth there is hidden away in such a light design. It's about proving yourself the most prestigious civilisation, not through total conquest, but by exploiting the lay of the land, and leaning into your strengths.

Through some quirk of bloodline or destiny, wizards can access impossible forces simply by saying magic words. This does not engender caution. A wizard's not a real wizard until they have accidentally set themselves on fire or unleashed an ancient evil. And if you throw four of this dim demigods together? Well, you get the co-op wizard action of the Magicka games, where freestyling elemental combinations can (and often will) lead you to heal a boss or torch your pal's face. Splendid chaos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jake Solomon, the director of Marvel’s Midnight Suns and the modern XCOM games, has announced his departure from Firaxis. 
Solomon has worked at Firaxis for 23 years and is best known as the lead designer of XCOM: Enemy Unknown and the director of XCOM 2, including its War of the Chosen expansion. He most recently directed Marvel’s Midnight Suns. 
In a statement posted to Twitter, Solomon doesn’t state a specific reason for his resignation but does tease his next project by stating, “My brain is on fire with a new dream. Time to go chase it.” Whether or not this dream keeps him in the game industry is a mystery for now. You can read his full statement below.
Some of our favorite memories of Jake’s time at Firaxis include this funny video of him visiting a game store to convince shoppers to buy XCOM 1. He was also a great sport on our Marvel’s Midnight Suns Rapid-Fire interview. You can read our review of his final project at Firaxis, Marvel's Midnight Suns, here.]]></summary>

Late last year, turn-based indie RPG The Outbound Ghost was delisted from Steam after a statement from lead dev Conrad Grindheim claimed his relationship with publisher Digerati had “dissolved.” Soon after, Digerati filed a lawsuit against developer Conradical over a breach of contract and “several false defamatory” statements. When reporting on the original news, CJ thought the messy situation could get messier, and he was right. Grindheim has now DMCA’d his own game on console storefronts and accused Digerati of withholding royalties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am legendary ronin Sakomoto Ryoma. I shout "yosh!" as I harvest six (6) gleaming radishes from my allotment. I shoot a bandit in the head with a revolver. I send my adoptive daughter to trade some homemade pickles. I partake in a brooding chat, then stamp on a dude's head. I help a recluse regain his confidence. I have totally forgotten what I was meant to be doing.
Like A Dragon: Ishin feels like a step backward, but in a brilliant way. Kiryu and co. may have moved onto a turn-based future, yet Sakomoto Ryoma and his pals have turned back the clock to an Edo period of brawlin' and chicken betting that's most reminiscent of Yakuza 0, only it's not the roaring 80s but the bloody 1800s. There's nothing here that will convert those who aren't keen on the series, but if you're an ardent fan or a newcomer eager to experience its wild swings between serious and silly, Ishin is an excellent place to start.

Like a Dragon: Ishin is not a new game. It's a remake of an old game – 2014's Ryu Ga Gotoku: Ishin, released only in Japan on the PS3 and PS4. And yet, despite the age of its skeleton, in some ways, the game stands out as one of the more impressive games in developer Ryu Ga Gotoku's (RGG) portfolio – even with a few noticeable weak points. 
Ishin takes place in the 1860s, at the end of Japan's Edo period. You play as Sakamoto Ryoma – a real-life historical figure – who, amid his own revenge scheme, finds himself embroiled in the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tetris is a new original film coming to Apple TV+, the iPhone maker's streaming service, and if the first trailer for it is any indication, it looks like a great time. 
Released yesterday, Tetris begins with the classic Europe song, "The Final Countdown," which then aptly transitions to Korobeiniki, the main theme of Tetris (you know the one). The trailer then showcases how Taron Egerton's character is deadset on bringing Tetris to everybody after playing it once. Unable to get falling tetrominos out of his head, Egerton's character heads to the Soviet Union to convince the game's creator that he can make him a millionaire. 
Check it out for yourself in the Apple TV+ Tetris trailer below: 


As you can see, Tetris looks great – funny, suspenseful, dramatic, and a seemingly great retelling of how the "greatest game ever made" made its way to our hands via the NES and Game Boy. 
Tetris is directed by Jon S. Baird and written by Noah Pink. It begins streaming on Apple TV+ on March 31. 
Are you going to check Tetris out next month? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

I'd say building a romantic connection with a wrestler entirely formed of green ooze, or training your M.E.A.T. at Mrs. Muscles gym counts as magic – pure magic, even. And that's what Wrestling With Emotions: New Kid On The Block offers. It's a wrestling dating sim with a splash of RPG, and almost certainly a game that'll pin your heart in a bear hug and never let go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know that famous saying about those who forget the past are forever doomed to make the same mistakes? That's Octopath Traveler 2 in a nutshell, a JRPG that follows so precisely in the footsteps of its predecessor that you'd be forgiven for thinking it was suddenly 2019 again and that the last few pandemic years were nothing but a terrible existential nightmare.

This SSD is only really rivalled by the more expensive Samsung 990 Pro, our overall 'fastest SSD' recipient, with both options offering random write performance well over 1M IOPS and sequential read speeds of up to 7300MB/s, at the very limit of the PCIe 4.0 standard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel’s Midnight Suns gets its second story expansion next week in the form of the aptly titled “Redemption.” It stars Venom, looking to right the wrongs he’s committed, but he’s going to have to overcome the powerful demon Mephisto to do it. 
The trailer shows Eddie Brock, having recovered from the events of the main campaign, making a deal with Mephisto to help rid himself of his darkness. Naturally, this goes about as well as you would expect, leading to Venom joining the Midnight Suns as a playable character to battle this formidable demonic threat. 


Redemption will be available on February 23. It comes included with the game's season pass. Firaxis' role-playing strategy take on the Marvel universe has already received DLC in the form of a Deadpool character and mission pack. Despite the game receiving positive reviews (including cracking Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2022), it was recently revealed to have underperformed in sales.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot diggedy daffodil, am I glad I picked Casual difficulty in Veil Of Dust. Unlike some games, Veil Of Dust doesn't make it sound like any sort of concession; the middle difficulty is called Challenge, and says "it's pretty tough - you've been warned". I took the warning seriously, and thank God, because even the easiest difficulty had me pouring dandelion tea down my brother's throat like he was doing a kegstand (and in the game).
Áine and Shane are a pair of Irish siblings who've moved to Oregon to start a new life, which, in the main story, involves eating potatoes and trying not to get depressed. It's difficult enough that I didn't think I would like it at first, as even basic tasks deplete your stamina and sleeping in your 1860s hovel with a hole in the roof doesn't restore very much per night. Áine can do spells, but they're simple and only really take the edge off what is a very hard life. Magic isn't a cure-all in Veil Of Dust, and using it has to be weighed up, just like everything else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the heady mists of 1994 once came Master Of Magic, an all-time best 4X loosely summarisable as Civilisation crossed with Master Of Orion.
In the... uh, semi-heady fog of 2019 came the news that it was getting a remake, and I was muchly excited, for in the interim I'd actually learned the original existed and how good and somehow unrivalled it still was. And finally, in the slight damp of late 2022, that remake arrived. It is a remarkably faithful remake, to a degree I may not ever have seen for such an old game. Some details and flourishes aside, it's basically the same design, with all the same parts.

Coincidentally, I've also finally got into Total Warhammer lately, and spent some time reacquainting myself with Warlords Battlecry, and in between building city walls and crushing stupid aryan elfs, I've realised what truly connects all three: balance. They all, correctly, reject it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sound design is an often overlooked and underappreciated element of many games, but it's an element Capcom takes very seriously in Resident Evil 4. As horrific as the game looks, it's the soundtrack and creepy sound effects that do much of the heavy lifting in building fear and tension. To understand how the remake remixes and enhances the original game's soundscape, I picked the brains of RE4 sound director Hiroshi Tamura and lead composer Kota Suzuki to learn how they're making the game sound as good as it plays. 
Game Informer: A goal for the Resident Evil 4 remake is to create more believable soundscapes. Can you discuss what that means, with examples, and why that's important to the team?

Like Monster Hunter, you track big game, craft new armor and weapons, and do it all over again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s the dead of night. I’m in my little tugboat out on open waters. I can barely see three feet in front of my nose because of the thick blanket of fog, but I'm trying my hand at night fishing, hoping to hook something really good. I find a squid spot and start to fish, reeling in one or two fine-looking catches. The third one, however, is monstrous, a mess of jagged teeth and sickly pale flesh. Yes, this should make for a fine amount of cash. The more morbid it is, the more money I get. Suddenly there’s a deep rumbling in the ocean and panic starts to creep in. I chuck my prize into my cargo and speed back to town, the phrase ‘fuck round, find out’ circling my brain.
I’ve not been playing Dredge long, but I’m calling it one of my favourite games of the year, right now, in February. Black Salt Games' sinister fishing RPG is gripping and enchanting in a way I didn’t anticipate. I’ve spent hours exploring its murky waters and my constant shock at what unsettling creatures my hook brings in is seemingly never-ending. Its eldritch world keeps pulling me back with its mystery and malevolent horror, and its sense of atmosphere and tension is incredible. Basically, I'm completely enraptured, hook, line, sinker. Dredge already feels like one of this year’s greatest indie horrors and all this, from a fishing game of all things.

The original PlayStation VR, from the outside at least, seemed like a moderate success for Sony. It was a functional VR alternative for players who were not interested in entering the world of PC gaming and it had at least one undeniable, exclusive hit with Astro Bot Rescue Mission.
PlayStation VR2 is the next logical step for the sub-platform. It works with Sony’s latest hardware, it improves on basically every aspect of PlayStation VR, but it’s not quite the virtual reality revolution I feel like we’ve been waiting for since the advent of the medium.

Call of the Mountain is meant to be PlayStation VR2’s showcase piece, and in some important ways, it functions as exactly that. Firing off an arrow with a bow in VR feels great, and getting a chance to see the world of Horizon from a novel perspective can be exhilarating. The primary gameplay of Call of the Mountain, however, struggles to find fun at a basic level which ultimately sours the larger experience.
Call of the Mountain features a perfunctory cameo from Aloy to remind you that you are in her world, but this gam…]]></summary>

I’ve put together this settings guide – based on the game’s early trial build – for those who want to join the hunt pronto, but above all else my advice is to wait until developers Omega Force get the promised performance improvements up and running. From what I’ve played, Wild Hearts’s bad shape is doing an otherwise enjoyable Monster Hunter-like a huge disservice.

What may surprise you, however, is how deep these historical details run throughout Pentinment’s DNA, right down the game’s text fonts. Obsidian design director Josh Sawyer told me all about how the team revived long-dead historical fonts, to give them a new life in a modern format.

Like previous Playstation port Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered, it’s not the most easygoing game either, but I’ve cycled through my share of deaths and rebirths and can report that Returnal will make do with older graphics cards and middling RAM counts. It’s a mostly well-considered porting job too, with optional ray tracing, various upscaling tools, ultrawide support for 21:9 and 32:9 monitors, and pages upon pages of customisable display and control settings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last thing you need when you’ve just crash-landed on an unknown planet teeming with predatory wildlife is to discover you’re also stuck in a time loop. But that’s the fate of deep-space astronaut Selene in Returnal, when she ditches her single-seater vessel on a remote rock called Atropos. Each time she falls foul of the local fauna, she pops back into existence right next to her broken ship, with no obvious means of escape. Forget Aliens vs Predator, this is Aliens vs Groundhog Day.
But what a day it is, as Returnal combines a best-in-class third-person shooter with a deep dive into the psychology of its protagonist. Selene’s journey into Atropos, through a thick jungle, a burning vermilion desert and beyond, sends her circling through a smorgasbord of emotions – from confusion to hope, despair to determination. And so often, her mood dovetails with your own highs and lows of elation and frustration, until every part of Returnal encases you in its loop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games released a promotional video this morning revealing its plans to release three League of Legends spin-off games this year. Two of these titles, Song of Nunu and Convergence, had been previously announced, while the third game, The Mageseeker, makes it debut. 


The Mageseeker is set to arrive first sometime this spring. Developed by Digital Sun, the team behind Moonlighter, it’s described as a gritty 2D action RPG. It stars Sylas and takes place in Demacia. You can find The Mageseeker on PC and unspecified consoles. 
Convergence launches this summer and was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2019. Starring Ekko, it’s a 2D action-platforming adventure by Double Stallion that features parkour and time-manipulation mechanics. Convergence launches for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. 
Song of Nunu closes out the year. Releasing this fall, it centers on the young Nunu and his yeti partner Willump on a search to find Nunu’s mother. The charming adventure game focuses on the pair working together to solve environmental puzzles. Song of Nunu comes from the folks at Tequila Works, the developer of titles such as Rime and Gylt, and it will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. 
Riot released its first League of Legends spin-off Ruined King in 2021 to generally positive reviews, so we're curious to see how these other projects fair and if they'll attract new, non-MOBA fans coming off Netflix's well-received Arcane series. Which League of Legends title are you most interested in?

You are the Sandman, and you are neither sprinkling happy dust on Danish eyelids nor delivering Liberace-haired boyfriends to vocal quartets. Instead, you’re an active fighter of nightmares, diving into the brains of restless kids to explore their most traumatic memories and, ultimately, defeat the monstrous embodiments of their fears.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[March is fast approaching, which means we’ll need to say goodbye to another batch of Game Pass games very soon. This month’s list of leavers includes a few heavy hitters, like the horrifying Alien Isolation, and a duo of big JRPGs that are likely impossible to binge in just two weeks.

"Omega Force are working continuously to improve performance and optimise the game for a wide variety of hardware specs across future updates", the note reads. It also confirms that support for both DLSS and FSR upscalers is on the way, and asks those who’ve found their hunts scuppered by dodgy performance to report their issues to EA’s support team.

        <updated>2023-02-15T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Loathe as I am to become one of those "want to feel old?" types of posters, this review requires me to point out that the original Pharaoh came out in 1999, almost 25 years ago. It was one of that era's City Building series that included Zeus and all of the Caesars, a run of games so good that they earned the capital letters. Pharaoh also happens to be one of my foundational video games, and I played it when I was knee-high to my big brother's desk, at a time when family homes had one (1) yellow-grey computer with a CRT screen. And now it's back, baby.
Pharaoh: A New Era means I can play that game of my childhood on my shiny black RGB-lit bastard. Honestly though, the "A New Era" part is a bit much. Sure, the updated graphics are fabulous and the quality of life changes mean it plays like smooth peanut butter to the 90s' extra crunchy. It's a good remake of a solid game, but the mummy in the casket is fundamentally the same.

I first became aware of this upcoming game while covering last summer's Future Of Play Direct, and I've been itching to write something about it ever since. Happily, as part of RPS Magic Week, I've had the opportunity to speak with Florian Mann, CEO and co-founder of Spells & Secrets development team Alchemist Interactive.

Yes, they're cheap per gigabyte, yes they're fairly reliable, yes they're absolutely the way to go if you need to store a lot of data and don't care how long it takes to access it. But. But. These drives are hard to go back to after you're used to SSDs, with their near-instant access times, completely silent operation, resistance to shocks, drops and magnets and of course their overall SPEED. 
So when I had the chance, I bought the biggest SSD I could afford, a 4TB model at the time, and copied literally every bit of data from the four or five 1TB or smaller hard drives that I'd bought over the years and stuck into my increasingly full PC tower. It was expensive, and it took ages to copy everything across, but as soon as I turned my computer on for the first time and I didn't have to listen to the clicks and whirs of a mechanical drive, I was completely convinced I'd made the right call to ditch spinning rust.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: if there’s a cute animal game that looks like it’s going to make me cry, then sign me up, I’m ready to go. In fairness, though, co-op adventure Blanc looks like it's going to be a lot lighter than games like Endling: Extinction is Forever and the notoriously upsetting Shelter series at first glance, but I’ve learned to never let my guard down around these kinds of games. Those cute art styles are almost always a front for a brutal sneak attack on your emotions.
Blanc is very much aiming for your heartstrings with its adorable animal duo and picturesque snowy landscapes. The first half teases massive potential for a cutesy story with fun puzzle antics, but the game is majorly let down by a repetitive and often frustrating second half and lacklustre ending. After the promise of a warm, cosy adventure, I watched the end credits roll and couldn't help feeling like I'd been left out in the cold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The upcoming theme park management sim Park Beyond gave us a lovely Valentine’s Day-themed trailer, except, wait a second, this isn’t lovely at all, Oh God. I’m sure Park Beyond will be a wholesome bit of fun - creating outlandish rollercoasters and managing the nuts & bolts of a made-up business is always a good time. But, good grief, there’s something seriously disturbing about its latest trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been five whole years since the Firewatch devs announced their tomb-raiding adventure, In The Valley Of Gods, and in that time the idea of the game itself has fossilised. The first-person archaeology game was put on hold in 2019 after Valve acquired Campo Santo and had them support other Valve projects like Half-Life: Alyx. Now Campo's in-limbo game has a December 2029 listing on Steam, which almost certainly means nothing, but it’s fun to dust off some memories.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2’s third season is well underway, adding more of the usual maps, modes, and cosmetics. The big surprise this season is the Valentine’s themed Loverwatch, a non-canon text adventure that allows you to court either Mercy or Genji. Naturally, I chose to date Genji (described as Overwatch’s “bad boy”), and the results were surprising. It’s cringe-y and occasionally grating, but it’s also surprisingly charming and stuffed with referential humour that OW fans will surely love.

It's one of those classic, age-old moments where you're suddenly walking on the ceilings and jumping over gaps upside down to further test your skill and overall dexterity. Gravity Castle, on the other hand, has seemingly made it its entire premise, making for a brilliant Next Fest demo that's still available to download on Steam right now. It also looks absolutely gorgeous, channelling Ico and the rest of Fumito Ueda's oeuvre in all the right ways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think Wanted: Dead wants to be a singleplayer, third-person action game with kickass combat and a colourful cyberpunk universe that slides effortlessly between gritty and silly. And I'm guessing it wants players to experience the joys of shredding goons, and a story told through unpredictable cuts to karaoke and anime. I'm sad to report that it isn't any of these things. Aside from the tiniest glimpses of cool when a combo comes together, the game clearly doesn't know what it wants to be, or if it did once upon a time, its original vision must've gotten lost under a dogpile of ideas. I rooted for it when I first saw it way back when, and got excited when I heard it was being made by devs behind Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive, but what's arrived is a jumbled mess that fights you at every turn. If I were Debra Meadon playing it for the first time live on Dragon's Den, and someone sidled up behind me and pressed a katana to my throat, I would still carefully put the controller down and say, "It's a no from me".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Magic is weird. And, since an Ordinary (non-magical person) suddenly getting magic is also deemed weird in Ikenfell, it stands to reason that it’s practically guaranteed to happen. We can only assume the odds become even higher as the Ordinary ventures closer to the big magical fantasy school, which protagonist Maritte quickly discovers. Upon approaching the gate in search of her missing sister, Safina, Maritte suddenly starts to sling fiery spells.
Those new spells certainly come in handy, as Maritte finds herself fired up (hehe, geddit?) and ready to fight through this Paper Mario-style tactical RPG. Along with some of Saf’s old friends, you explore the titular school and surrounding areas, searching for clues that might help unravel the mystery. Ikenfell has challenging combat and lots of little secrets hidden in its 8-bit world, but it’s the loveable bunch of pals (both allies and rivals) that really made me smile. Oh, and some of them have killer theme tunes that I can’t stop singing.

I swear, if it weren't for the smattering of autumnal trees in the tutorial level, its grassy plains, tall mountains and bright blue river would have been a dead ringer for Okami's Kamiki Village.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Illumination has taken its promotion of The Super Mario Bros. Movie to the next level by launching a website and commercial promoting the brothers’ New York City plumbing business, and it's actually pretty cool. 
You can visit the website here, which features a commercial promoting the Mario Bros. business. Older fans will likely recognize the catchy jingle as the theme song of the 1989 Super Mario Brothers Super Show, which is a nice homage. 


The website also features humorous testimonials, job opportunities, and even a working phone number. Calling this number (929-55-MARIO) plays a recorded message by the Charlie Day-voiced Luigi, which provides a nice sample of his performance as the green-glad sidekick. Texting the number returns a message, which, depending on when you sent it, may return a digital poster for the movie. GI editor Kyle Hilliard got this Toad poster when he texted the number yesterday:
In my case, I only got a message thanking me for my interest in Super Mario Bros. Plumbing with a link to a form submission on the website. I'm not sure what you get for submitting this form, but feel free to find out yourselves. 
The Super Mario Bros. Movie premieres in theaters on April 7. You can check out the official movie poster here. Watch the latest trailer featuring Donkey Kong and Cat Suit Mario here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Too many spells in games are just variations on the old reliable fireball. Wizard sends projectile towards target. Target dies. Perhaps they deviate a little in how quickly they die, or how large the area of effect is. Maybe instead of a fireball it's a thunderbolt, or a poisonous gas, or a beam of light. Pish, I say. Pish! Where's the real magic? Where are the cataclysmic spells that take days or weeks of preparation, and then change the world with a single fateful ritual?
These games could learn something from The Last Spell, a roguelite turn-based tactics game about defending your village each night from hordes of mutant beasts that emerge from the purple fog surrounding the entire world. Whenever I start a new game in The Last Spell, I always rewatch the excellent opening sequence, which succinctly sets a harrowing scene of magic pushed further than we're used to seeing in most fiction in general, let alone games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2’s third season released last week with a new Antarctic-themed map, a promised Valentine’s dating sim, and, of course, another battle pass featuring various in-game cosmetics. Blizzard had already announced that this battle pass would have in-game currency for the first time, allowing players to buy their choice of cosmetics, rather than just the passes’ selection of skins and souvenirs. But fans on Reddit have accused Blizzard of deliberately misleading players with these rewards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Island 2 has been in development hell for years, and the fans eagerly awaiting its launch now have one less week to do so. Dambuster Studios has announced it’s bumping the game’s release from April 28 to April 21.
The news came in an announcement tweet declaring the game has gone gold, meaning it's essentially complete and ready to be printed on discs. Dead Island 2 had previously been scheduled to launch on February 3 before it was delayed to April 28. Speaking of April 28, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was recently pushed to that same day. It wouldn't be surprising if Dambuster moved its launch forward to steer clear of Star Wars' blast radius. 
You asked for it, you got it. Dead Island 2 went gold and it's coming out a week early.

For six hours, you do this, and eat your dinner feeling sick with unrealised potential.
Match-3 games are compulsive for a reason, and I don't have beef with them as a concept. I actually like them! But I don't like that to play a match-3 game I usually have to play a mobile game that wants me to spent money on Fairy Dollars so I can buy barrels of Explosive Wand Dust, making it easier to earn stars and incrementally furnish the Magic Toilet Goblin's bedroom, or whatever. It's the empty consumerism vibe of freemium mobile games that makes me feel like I've been eating the time-spending equivalent of junk food. Spirit Swap, which has a demo out now in the form of an endless mode, isn't that. It's beautiful, difficult, customiseable, and it'll swallow you time in a good way, not a faintly unsettling one.

“Here is what may be the final edition of Blood Bowl,” read the opening page of that community manual. “This is the rulebook designed to send Blood Bowl into a perpetual format. The Games Workshop is no longer interested in providing true support for this game.”

The book follows three aspiring game developers from their time as kids to their careers in the industry, in part detailing the games they make along the way, and found itself on several best seller lists on its release. Over the weekend, veteran game dev Brenda Romero called out the novel for excluding her from the acknowledgments, despite the similarity, confirmed by the author elsewhere, between Romero’s board game Train and an in-book video game Solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2 Player Productions, the film crew behind the acclaimed Double Fine Adventure! series chronicling the making of Double Fine Productions’ Broken Age, has suddenly released a new documentary series following the development of Psychonauts 2. Best of all, you can watch every episode right now. 
The series, called PsychOdyssey, consists of a whopping 32 episodes, all of which are available to watch for free on Double Fine’s YouTube channel. Double Fine Adventure! earned praise for its raw, intimate look at the good, bad, and ugly sides of game development as the crew spent years filming in Double Fine's studio as Broken Age came together. Psychonauts 2's tumultous road to release, from crowdfunding campaigns to Microsoft's acquistion of Double Fine, makes its creation a fascinating subject, and we're excited to see how 2 Player Productions captured it.

Capturing the essence of an established fiction is tricky business, especially when translating into a new medium. It’s a big reason licensed games frequently miss the mark, sometimes failing to find the tone and nuance that made the original version shine. Avalanche Software navigates those challenges with a deft eye and an evident appreciation for the source books and films. Hogwarts Legacy…]]></summary>

The reveal of Pacific Drive last year immediately grabbed me. I liked what I saw in the initial trailer, sure, but what I found especially intriguing was that most of the game happens through a first-person view of someone driving an old station wagon through a beautiful but distraught Pacific Northwest forest. Rarely do driving games force a first-person view, and even fewer deviate from being a racer. 
Pacific Drive does both, and after viewing roughly 30 minutes of gameplay during a virtual preview, I’m even more intrigued. In a way, Pacific Drive is a racing game, but you’re not racing against other players – you’re racing against a biome ravaged by a mysterious sci-fi force that controls anomalies set on…]]></summary>

The gear system changes, due to arrive in the next patch, do sound like improvements to the current state of things. These plans do not sound better than entirely ending the tedious grinds of random rolls and making numbers bigger. Why improve when it would be better to remove?

It has a great premise, for starters - change history by meddling with your memories and playing out different versions of events to arrive at the 'correct' solution - and executes it brilliantly. Its GBA-style visuals and larger-than-life character portraits give it a real sense of charm and personality, and its mystery story of murder and corporate conspiracy had hooked me in real good. 
Then it abandoned its cool premise halfway through and became a different game entirely for its remaining run-time. I was heartbroken.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maybe it's because I've been bouncing between a lot of weighty games lately, but I've found a great diversion in The True Slime King, a simple three button platformer that recently left early access.

Speaking pedantically, this isn't "as simple as it gets", but you'll get what I mean if I describe it that way anyway. You move and jump, dodging spikes and lasers and ISO 13370 compliant death pits, and ideally collecting all the hard to reach thingies along the way. These are far from my favourite genre, but I've played enough to realise I'm partial to a good one, and this is a great one.

On the reasoning for the $69.99 price tag for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom:
On if this is the trend for Nintendo titles going forward:
Original Story (Published at 5:49 pm Central on February 8, 2023)
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom could very well be the most anticipated game of 2023 and is certainly one of the most exciting releases in the history of the Nintendo Switch. During today's Nintendo Direct, we got a new look at gameplay, plus the announcement of the Collector's Edition and a new Amiibo figure starring Link. However, we also got some unfortunate news surrounding the upcoming launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
In its press release for the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo announced that the upcoming Zelda entry will retail for $69.99. This makes Nintendo the latest major publish to test the waters of raising the price of its triple-A titles in recent years. This follows other major publishers like 2K Games and PlayStation, who started pricing their major releases at $70 with the start of the new console generation in 2020. Last year, both Xbox and Ubisoft announced that their triple-A games would cost $70 going forward.
We reached out to Nintendo for comment regarding the reasoning for the price increase and if this will be the trend for its triple-A releases going forward, but did not immediately receive a response. We will update this story if Nintendo provides a statement.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launches on Switch on May 12.]]></summary>

Professor Layton's last title to star him was 2014's The Azaran Legacy. In 2017, a spin-off starring Layton's daughter called Layton's Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires' Conspiracy was released for 3DS and was ported to Switch in 2019.]]></summary>

First up, Nintendo revealed The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Collector's Edition.

Re-Boot Camp has had an uphill battle hitting any release date. Originally announced for a release on December 3, 2021, in October of that year, it was pushed to spring 2022. And then, well, that didn't happen. In March 2022, Nintendo announced an indefinite delay "in light of recent world events," perhaps referencing the war in Ukraine, which had just broken out at that time. 
Check out a trailer below.

This follow-up game to The Messenger is set in the same universe, but set many years prior to the team’s first game, and with an entirely different style and genre, recalling the early era of console RPGs, represented by games like Final Fantasy VI. 
Sea of Stars features some stunning pixel art visuals, and also boasts guest musical compositions from Yasunori Mitsuda, whose music enhanced such games as Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3.
The new trailer helps to show off the wide variety of locales players visit in the game, along with some intriguing turn-based battles.
Sea of Stars increasingly looks like a major treat for anyone who has fond recollections of that golden age of early console RPGs.
The game is headed to Switch on August 29, and a free demo is available later today on the Nintendo eShop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo announced today plans for a paid expansion pass for Splatoon 3. The first of two planned waves will be available spring of this year. It will allow players to hang out in Inkopolis from the original Splatoon game, and even meet and interact with characters from the original game, like the Squid Sisters, who will perform during Splat Fests.
No date or details were offered for the second wave, but it showed a Squid Kid in what appeared to be a snow-covered city. It also seems to have a more melancholy, sad tone. The second wave will be called Side Dish.


The Splatoon 3 expansion pass will be available to pre-purchase today.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Honestly speaking, I didn't want to do it."
Those were the words of Capcom's Yasuhiro Ampo, the main director of the Resident Evil 4 remake. Alongside fellow director Kazunori Kadoi, their team has taken on the lofty task of reinventing the 2005 classic for a modern audience, recapturing the game's magic while also expanding it with new features. During our cover story interview with the two designers, they spoke candidly about the early phases of the game's development, their initial hesitation to tackle such an intimidating project, and how the team's approach in identifying areas for improvement gave them the confidence to see the project through. 
Ampo and Kadoi have plenty of experience working on Resident Evil. Their combined credits span the original 1996 game to titles such as Res…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since the first bundle arrived in 2014, The Jackbox Party Pack has been a staple in many households when friends and family come over. The zany, creative, and often-irreverent games have proven to be crowd-pleasers over the last decade of annual iterations, with Jackbox Party Pack 9 releasing last October. Today, Jackbox Games announced a tenth edition of its party-game bundle, The Jackbox Party Pack 10, which will arrive this fall.
Like its predecessors, The Jackbox Party Pack 10 promises five games that offer players the ability to be creative, funny, and intelligent, often in an effort to earn the approval of their competitors and/or spectators. While we don't know what games will be included in The Jackbox Party Pack 10, Jackbox games will announce and detail the included titles in the coming months. The included games will be playable in English, Spanish, French, German, and Italian.
On top of that, Jackbox Games will highlight one previous Party Pack per month in the lead-up to the launch of 10. These celebrations will include behind-the-scene glimpses, special livestreams with the development team, and discounts in the official Jackbox Games shop.
The Jackbox Party Pack 10 arrives on all major platforms this fall.]]></summary>

Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)

        <updated>2023-02-03T18:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Soldier Boyz
GLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)
GLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)
Obsidian
Pink Panther: Passport to Peril
Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink
Driller/Space Station Oblivion
Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
As usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!
Speaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More Director games are ready for public testing!
ScummVM has made huge strides in Macromedia Director support. Many Director 3 games are now fully completable, and several Director 4 games are also now playable. 18 new games are officially supported, and we could use your help testing them. We also welcome reports of any other Director games which are fully playable or completable. To test these new games, please use the latest daily build of ScummVM. Any bugs or problems can be reported to the issue tracker.
Some highlights from the new list of games include:
Chop Suey by Theresa Duncan, an important classic of "girl games".
Eastern Mind, the cult classic from artist Osamu Kato.
Ganbare! Inuchan, based on the comic by singer Kenso Kato, which was the first Director 4 game to be fully completable.
Over-Ring-Under, by the same developer as Alice: An Interactive Museum. ScummVM's new support for CD audio in Director games lets players enjoy the soundtrack by Carl Stone.
