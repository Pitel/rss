        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It might be a while until we learn more about the Ghost of Tsushima movie adaptation currently in the works.
That‚Äôs because director Chad Stahelski, who‚Äôs perhaps best known for directing all three John Wick films (as well as the upcoming fourth one, too), told IGN in a new interview that the team behind it wants to do right by the game. To do that, the team is taking its time.¬†

‚ÄúWe just want to do it right,‚Äù Stahelski said. ‚ÄúYou know how video game adaptations can go. So we‚Äôre taking our time and doing it right. We‚Äôre working very closely with game developers to make sure we stick to what‚Äôs great about it.‚Äù¬†
IGN notes that Stahelski stated¬†that a script is still being developed for the movie. He also said that fans of Ghost of Tsushima ‚Äúwould be very happy with what we‚Äôre working on,‚Äù noting that he‚Äôs played it ‚Äúmany times,‚Äù which is something that initially drew him to the project.
When asked if Jin Sakai English voice actor Daisuke Tsuji would be reprising his role in the film, Stahelski said, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see,‚Äù and they ‚Äúhaven‚Äôt gotten that far yet.‚Äù Only time will tell for now.¬†
For now, read about the original announcement of a Ghost of Tsushima movie and then read about how Tsuje really wants in on the film ‚Äì he even said he entirely agrees to butt-nudity in it. Read our thoughts on the game in Game Informer‚Äôs Ghost of Tsushima review after that.¬†

Those attempting to collect Switch physical editions have an increasingly tough task, with more and more download-only Indie titles getting limited releases. The latest is Warlocks 2: God Slayers, with QubicGames teaming up with Red Art Games for the release.
Released on the eShop back in June 2019, Warlocks 2: God Slayers blends sidescolling 2D fighting with RPG-style quests and storytelling. There are five characters to master, and we rather liked it in our review while bemoaning the absence of the online co-op seen on other platforms; it does have local co-op, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ancient Egypt of Assassin‚Äôs Creed Origins is a visually stunning place to explore, and it could soon look even better.¬†
That‚Äôs because Ubisoft has revealed that it‚Äôs looking into adding 60 FPS support to the Bayak-led Assassin‚Äôs Creed title. This news was announced today, December 21, which also happens to be Assassin‚Äôs Creed Day. No, it‚Äôs not an anniversary for the first Assassin‚Äôs Creed title or any title in the franchise. It‚Äôs the day of the Winter Solstice, and in Assassin‚Äôs Creed lore, December 21, 2012, was supposed to be the end of the world.¬†
Happy #ACDay üíù

December 21, 2021
However, Desmond Miles sacrificed himself to save the world from the destruction of Juno. That happened in 2012‚Äôs Assassin‚Äôs Creed 3. Assassin‚Äôs Creed Origins would be released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC five years later. As the name implies, its story represents the origin of the Assassin Brotherhood (or at least what would one day become the Brotherhood). It sounds like soon we‚Äôll be able to experience that origin story in 60 FPS.¬†
Unfortunately, those looking for more will have to wait and see what comes of this update, as Ubisoft did not reveal anything else. There‚Äôs no word of when this 60 FPS patch might go through, nor is there a definitive guarantee it will happen ‚Äì just Ubisoft‚Äôs assertion that it‚Äôs ‚Äúlooking into adding 60 FPS support for Assassin‚Äôs Creed Origins.‚Äù¬†
While waiting for this update, check out Game Informer‚Äôs Assassin‚Äôs Creed Origins review and then check out our thoughts on Assassin‚Äôs Creed III. After that, read about the now-live crossover between Assassin‚Äôs Creed Odyssey and Assassin‚Äôs Creed Valhalla, and then check out Game Informer‚Äôs ranking of all Assassin‚Äôs Creed games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks. It's been a funny old year, 2021. On the games side, it's often felt like a year of shifting goalposts. Games that were delayed by the pandemic last year finally got their due in 2021, but in turn many of the releases we were expecting this year have inevitably slipped into 2022. The pandemic has affected games of all sizes this year, and I don't think it will go down in the history books as one of our all-time greats. There were still plenty of fantastic games that came out this year, mind, and we're still counting down our absolute favourites over in our Advent Calendar. 
That said, I do think 2021 will prove to be a pivotal year for RPS - and not just because I stole Graham's key card and changed the locks on the front door of the Treehouse. It's been a year of immense change here at the site, so I wanted to take some time to reflect on everything that's happened this year, and look forward to what we've got in store for 2022.

This news comes from Nintendo Life, which reports that Konami announced this news alongside many other features players can expect in Master Duel during the Jump Festa 2022 event recently held. The game is not yet out, but it‚Äôs expected sometime this Winter, which means its release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, iOS, and Android could be imminent. For now, you can check out its official trailer.¬†

As noted by Nintendo Life, duelists can expect the following features in Master Duel:¬†
4K resolution duels
Over 10,000 cards to unlock across the series‚Äô history¬†
A Solo Mode campaign
Deckbuilding and a large database with Decklists
Tutorials to teach players how to play¬†
Special events and tournaments¬†
Because of today‚Äôs news, duelists can now expect to be able to play their Xbox-owning friend while on a PlayStation, for example. Or, they could play on their mobile device while their opposition plays on PC, thanks to Master Duel‚Äôs crossplay support. And thanks to cross-save support, players can freely switch between platforms. You can play primarily at home on a console or PC and then take your progression with you on the go via your mobile device.¬†
While waiting for Master Duel, read about its reveal and the reveal of Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel Saikyou Battle Royale that happened alongside it. Check out why one Game Informer editor believes Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel might finally be what fans are looking for after that.¬†

Disco Elysium: The Final Cut is a critically acclaimed RPG that's won over a lot of gamers. It arrived on the Switch eShop in October in that 'Final Cut' guise, with enhancements and additional content that wrap up the game's development journey.
It's not quite done though, with its physical editions now given a release date for Switch - 15th March. Developer ZA/UM has teamed up with iam8bit and Skybound Games for the physical release, with two editions up for grabs. The standard edition will be ¬£34.99 / $39.99USD / ‚Ç¨39,99; that's a pretty sweet deal as it matches the eShop price while including a poster and digital artbook. It should start to be available for pre-order today at a variety of retailers, though at the time of writing the shortcut page is only showing us the PS4 version in the UK.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not so fantasmic.
You‚Äôd struggle to find a set of games better suited to a convenient retro compilation than Valis: The Phantasm Soldier. The late '80s/early '90s platform-shooter Castlevania-ish hybrid series spans at least half a dozen formats from esoteric Japanese computers to the Mega Drive, each release ‚Äî even when they‚Äôre supposed to be representing the same game ‚Äî often remarkably different from the last; each one worth playing in their own right even if only for historical curiosity‚Äôs sake.
Sadly that‚Äôs not what Valis: The Fantasm Soldier Collection is. Instead we get a trio of PC Engine Valis‚Äô with Japanese text and speech only in the import version we reviewed ‚Äî the upcoming localisation for the West will feature English subtitles on eShop and the Limited Run physical release. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with just the PC Engine versions in theory (it is certainly the format that tends to spring to mind when most people think of the series), but this isn‚Äôt described as ‚ÄòValis: The PC Engine Collection‚Äô and 'rewriting' an entire series‚Äô history purely for commercial convenience isn‚Äôt something any of us should be encouraging. And even if PC Engine Valis is all you‚Äôve ever known, wanted, or cared about, there‚Äôs still a problem: this collection is incomplete.

Hamster has done a fantastic job in bringing a host of cult arcade games to home systems of late, and it's continuing the trend with the cult classic Xexex (pronounced "Zekseks"), which joins the Arcade Archives range next week.
Originally released in 1991 and powered by hardware that was far more advanced than the current home systems at the time could manage, Xexex mixes elements of Irem's R-Type with Konami's own Gradius and X Multiply to create one of the most unique and distinctive experiences in the shmup genre. It didn't see a domestic port until 2007, as part of the Japan-only PSP collection, Salamander Portable. Its release on Switch will thankfully make it easily accessible to millions of potential players.

However, many expected a December release, but now we know it‚Äôs coming later. Square Enix has now revealed that we can expect this remaster on PC, iOS, and Android in February, although a specific release date was not given.

‚ÄúIn order to bring you the best experience possible, we‚Äôre giving ourselves the necessary time to apply final polish while finishing development on the game,‚Äù a Steam post from Square Enix reads. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre adding some new items for those that pre-purchase either the game individually or have purchased the bundle. We‚Äôre looking forward to sharing the final title in our pixel remaster series with you all early next year and we hope you‚Äôre looking forward to it.‚Äù¬†
As far as pre-purchase items go, players will get Locke‚Äôs Theme (Timelapse Remix), The Decisive Battle (Timelapse Remix), Terra‚Äôs Theme (Timelapse Remix), Searching for Friend (Timelapse Remix), and Aria di Mezzo Carattere (Instrumental). They‚Äôll also get two Final Fantasy VI wallpapers, and two more wallpapers from the pixel remasters of the first six Final Fantasy games.¬†

The goal with this is to be able to take AMD HIP code and ultimately be able to run it on Intel graphics processors but potentially other vendors/drivers too given the vendor-neutral SPIR-V. More of that HIPSPV work is now hitting mainline LLVM...]]></summary>

Two Tribes is a name that's likely familiar to eShop enthusiasts, in particular from the 3DS and Wii U era. Well known for its original Toki Tori, which recently had a re-release of the Game Boy Color original through Limited Run games, on the Wii U and 3DS the company developed and published a range of excellent games, like EDGE, RUSH, Toki Tori 2+ and RIVE. The latter two are particularly relevant in relation to the company's latest announcement, which is that it's made the PC version of its bespoke game engine open source.
You can read the full details and access the files on Github, which includes plenty of information to help prospective programmers get started. In terms of Nintendo releases that utilised the engine, Toki Tori 2+ and RIVE are good examples on Wii U and more recently through their Switch ports. RIVE was the studio's last game developed in-house, and has some excellent 2D visuals that move along at a solid 60fps.

Not so long ago, we reported on the Up-Switch Orion, a crowdfunded accessory that promised to make up for the "underwhelming" and "minuscule" Nintendo Switch screen (Up-Switch's words, not ours). "By increasing your actual gaming screen size by 188% and upgrading your audio experience with the integrated stereo speakers, your Nintendo Switch combined with ORION will deliver the gaming experience that every gamer deserves!"
The pitch was clearly convincing because more than $165,000 was raised, totally blasting past the $50,000 funding goal. Shortly after we ran our news story, we were sent one of these $299 devices free of charge to test out, but sadly, the final product is a bit of a disappointment.

And sure, those games are lovely and pretty and photorealistic...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mass Effect 2's final moments carry the potential for death. Commander Shepard is tasked to lead a team on a suicide mission, and the choices made during it could lead to a beloved teammate losing their life. This mission can be completed without any losses (a strategy we detail in a handy flowchart), but most players lose one or two characters two during their first playthrough.
Many of you took on this mission for the first time in Mass Effect Legendary Edition. Following the game's release, Electronic Arts and BioWare collected player data from this mission and have revealed the survival rate for each squad member.¬† This info is a small part of Electronic Arts' extensive, numbers-filled year-in-review.
As the numbers show, the fan-favorite Garrus often lived to see another day, making it through the suicide mission in 98 percent of players' attempts. The loveable singer Mordin died the most, surviving in just 90 percent of players' games. You can see all of the survival rates in the image below:
Electronic Arts' also revealed the most liked squadmates from the Legendary Edition, and they are not who you would think. Garrus is third on that list, trailing Kaidan and Ashley, as one and two. A quarter of players also apparently didn't have the time to change the name of their Commander Shepard, which defaults to John/Jane. The numbers show 23 percent of players played the game under one of these names.
If you still haven't played through the Mass Effect trilogy, there's no better way to do it than through Legendary Edition. Kimberley Wallace gave this collection a review score of 9 out of 10, and said: "Even all these years later, Commander Shepard is a powerful force that lives up to their iconic status, and the trilogy is still captivating and worth your time."]]></summary>

Original Story: This year had us stuck in many video game time loops, but one of my absolute favourites was Loop Hero. I never thought an autobattler RPG would hook me the way it did, but I spent hours upon hours helping a little knight circle a seemingly endless void, and had a wonderful time doing it. If you didn't have a chance to play it earlier this year, it's now free on the Epic Game Store until tomorrow. I heartily encourage you to pick this one up, it's one of our favourite games of 2021.

While some traditions feel more real because they're embedded deeper in our culture, you can start your own whenever you want, and jettison any you don't care for. Anything can be imbued with special meaning and, over time, grow into a tradition you cherish and come to anticipate. So here I am, approaching Christmas, so ready for my annual play of Skeal.

Connoisseurs of both gaming and rap music will no doubt be aware of Rap Quest, an ill-fated Game Boy title with the working title 'Rap City' that originally featured '90s rapper Vanilla Ice before rights issues meant his music couldn't be used. As we've reported before, Equilibrium Software completed work on the game and submitted it to Nintendo, although it was never released.
Fast forward past the Nintendo 'gigaleaks' of 2020/21 ‚Äî when a host of historical internal Nintendo-related development material leaked onto the internet and the pre-release lot check Rap Quest ROM found its way online ‚Äî and anyone with an internet connection and the means to write to a blank Game Boy cart can play the game in glorious pixel-perfect upscaled fidelity on one of those lovely new Analogue Pockets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the midst of its initial open beta, DNF Duel received another trailer, showing off its¬†eleventh confirmed¬†character and announcing its intended release window of summer 2022 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC.¬†
Ghostblade will be joining the cast when the game releases next year, making him the second male Slayer class from Dungeon Fighter Online to be included. He wields a katana for a weapon, but more importantly, he¬†has a spooky ghost living in his arm, making the appendage glow with a spectral blue hue. The trailer shows off Ghostblade's intro cinematic and a tease of what his Awakening attack can do.¬†Here's a hint: a ghost and a blade are involved, and it looks fantastic.

Eagle-eyed fans who watched the trailer's debut during yesterday's DNF Winter Fest¬†have spotted a couple of new roster members in the new footage, which didn't make it to the official trailer release. One shot revealed¬†Ghostblade¬†attacking the unannounced Mechanic, while another has people thinking they saw the Troubleshooter Agent variant, though that one is more speculative. Either way, I'm excited to see how both of them play if they are added, considering how varied and fun the rest of the cast is.¬†
While the trailer above doesn't have that footage attached, you can check out the images over on Event Hubs' story. But¬†watch the video¬†anyway to see some cool characters doing neat moves and get hyped for whenever we'll be able to get our hands on DNF Duel again.¬†

I'd have given up on the game if it weren't so interesting. For one thing, none of those deaths were final. He died as a child and came back. He died as a teenager and came back. These were not saved games, but ordinary occurrences. It's an interesting world made infuriating by awkward design choices.

The Switch may be approaching its 5th Birthday, but it's still the best-selling game console on the market at present; there'll no doubt be a lot of new owners and systems going online this Holiday season, too. When that happens, of course, we can often see some server issues that can impact eShop access and account creation.
Nintendo is eager to warn new Switch owners, we suspect especially parents giving them to children, to set it up ahead of the big day. Nintendo's Japanese customer service account has put the word out (thanks, Siliconera), and we suspect regional accounts will promote a similar message in the coming days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot off the heels of the release of The Witcher Season 2 on Netflix, the subscription streaming company has released the first¬†teaser trailer for its upcoming prequel to the show, The Witcher: Blood Origin.¬†
As previously announced by Netflix, this prequel show takes place in the same world as The Witcher Continent that Henry Cavill‚Äôs Geralt of Rivia inhabits, but it‚Äôs more focused on the elven side of things. The trailer features plenty of Michelle Yeoh‚Äôs Scian, as well as new looks at Sophia Brown‚Äôs √âlle, Jacob Collins-Levy‚Äôs Eredin, and more. This is just a taste of who we‚Äôll be seeing in the six-episode prequel when it hits sometime in 2022.¬†

‚ÄúWitness the untold history of the Continent with The Witcher: Blood Origin, a new prequel series set in an elven world 1200 years before the events of The Witcher,‚Äù a tweet from the official Witcher account reads. ‚ÄúThe Witcher prequel series Blood Origin will dive into the events that lead to the pivotal ‚ÄòConjuction of the Spheres,‚Äô when the worlds of monsters, men, and elves collided.‚Äù¬†
As you can see in the trailer, there‚Äôs no Geralt to be found in this series. However, as Netflix notes, Blood Origin is about the Conjuction of the Spheres, which paves the way for Geralt‚Äôs story on the Continent 1200 years later.¬†
While waiting for Blood Origin, check out Season 2 of The Witcher, which just hit Netflix on Friday. Read about how The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is getting DLC inspired by the Netflix TV series¬†after that and then check out Game Informer‚Äôs The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt review.¬†¬†

The RPG had been eagerly anticipated and seems to have delivered a sizeable, engaging game that was also a top performer for the franchise at launch in the US, for example.
Digital Foundry has now taken a look at it, assessing its general design and of course all of the technical details you'd expect of the channel. There's praise for some of the visual aspects, with the game running on Unreal Engine 4, but performance is certainly an issue as it seems to rarely hit a stable 30fps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joe Juba awarded Final Fantasy VII Remake an 8.75 when it launched back in 2020 on PlayStation 4, stating, ‚ÄúWith smart (and surprising) additions to a classic world and its inhabitants, Final Fantasy VII Remake artfully appeals to nostalgia without being bound by it.‚Äù Remake Intergrade dropped this past summer exclusively on PS5, which disappointed fans who couldn‚Äôt get their hands on the next-gen console. Nevertheless, PS Plus subscribers who redeemed the vanilla Remake through the Sony-owned game service will get a free Intergrade upgrade. What‚Äôs more, the Yuffie Intermission DLC is available at a discounted price for a limited time.
Starting this Wednesday...
@FinalFantasy VII Remake via @PlayStation Plus will be able to upgrade to the PS5 version of the game.

The F-Zero series is currently in extended hibernation, and we've not seen a fresh entry in the franchise for almost 20 years. While the idea of playing the game on a Sinclair ZX Spectrum might not be exactly what fans are wishing for, it has happened ‚Äì thanks to the talents of a small homebrew dev by the name of Voxel Tower.
Space Racing naturally has no official blessing from Nintendo itself, but it does a remarkable impression of F-Zero running on the classic British home computer. It uses many of the same ships from the series, and also includes artwork that is lifted directly from F-Zero.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Mystery Gift event for the latest Pok√©mon games, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl (BDSP),¬†is now live.¬†
This news comes by way of Serebii.net, which reported¬†that the mystery gift event is now live for all players. Unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt offer something like the shiny Zacia and Zamazenta recently distributed via Mystery Gift in Pok√©mon Sword and Shield. Instead of an actual Pok√©mon, this event is giving players some statues for their secret¬†bases.¬†
Click here to watch embedded media


More specifically, the Mystery Gift code,¬†MERRYCHR1STMAS,¬†will give all players a jade-colored statue of Pacharisu, Lucario, Rhyperior, Electivire, and Glaceon. The smaller statues such as that of Pacharisu and Glaceon are quite cute, but if you‚Äôre looking for something more intimidating for your base, the Rhyperior and Electivire statues have you covered. The Rhyperior statue, in particular, is massive, standing nearly twice as tall as your player character.¬†
Players have until December 25 to redeem this Mystery Gift.¬†
Serebii.net also points out another Mystery Gift event that‚Äôs currently ongoing. From now until May 22, 2022, players can enter the code BDSPUNDERGROUND to get statues of Turtwig, Chimchar, and Piplup ‚Äì the starters of BDSP.¬†
For more about BDSP, check out our thoughts on it in Game Informer‚Äôs Pok√©mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl review and then check out Game Informer‚Äôs list of the top 25 Pok√©mon in Diamond and Pearl.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, acclaimed writer George R.R. Martin (A Song of Ice and Fire) took to his blog to make a few comments about his role in the development of From Software‚Äôs upcoming Elden Ring. While the blog is short, the author is clear that his work on Elden Ring took place years ago, and focused on worldbuilding the fantastical realms¬†that players will be investigating come February. In the blog, Martin comments that video games aren‚Äôt really his thing ‚Äì but then goes on to say he played some old-school strategy games like Master of Orion, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and Railroad Tycoon. Apparently Martin has some excellent taste with the games he chose to play back in the day!¬†

Martin‚Äôs post is pretty clear, in that he worked on worldbuilding for the realms of Elden Ring. Exactly how this translates to the final game is unknown, but with what we saw in the network test, the world is full of discovery, even in that small slice. While the core foundational tale of the Tarnished and The Lands Between appear to have some significant similarities to the Dark Souls series right now, the world itself and much of that history is yet unknown, so we‚Äôll have to wait and see exactly what happens. Martin also notes how video games have become bigger than films in the entertainment world these days. You can check out the entire post over on Martin‚Äôs official blog here. Martin also notes that Elden Ring looks ‚Äúincredible.‚Äù On that final point, I‚Äôm inclined to agree.
Elden Ring is scheduled to arrive on February 25th on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. Are you looking forward to it?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. Over the next several weeks, we'll¬†examine all of the mainline shooter entries up to Halo Infinite, so sit back and relax as we kick the season off with Halo: Combat Evolved.¬†¬†
Developed by Bungie, Halo: Combat Evolved was positioned as the launch title for Microsoft's¬†promising but unproven Xbox. Released on¬†November 15, 2001, Halo redefined the first-person shooter and immediately solidified the Xbox as a must-own console. It's tough to imagine what Microsoft's place in the game industry would be today without Halo's success. Bungie became a household name, but the studio existed long before Halo and struggled financially prior to its launch. Twists and turns¬†such as axing Halo's¬†original PC exclusivity and going through bizarre working titles such as¬†The Santa Machine¬†are just some of the fascinating topics we'll unpack in this week's episode.¬†
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Game Informer¬†Editor-in-Chief Andrew Reiner (@Andrew_Reiner) as we unpack the history and impact of Master Chief's video game debut.¬†¬†

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Handheld consoles are often home to a variety of niche games and genres, and the PlayStation Vita keeps that streak going. The system is a great buy for people who can't get enough JRPGs and adventure games, but that's not all it has to offer. We've compiled some of the top games for the system, including some fresh and familiar faces.
Sony doesn't seem to be supporting the system as aggressively as it did when it launched, but it's far from a barren wasteland. Japanese developers have taken advantage of its high-end portable specs to deliver gorgeous-looking RPGs, and indie developers have found a place to explore their comparatively smaller and quirkier ideas. There's a wide variety of gameplay to be found on Vita, as our list highlights.
Here are Game Informer's picks for the top 10 games on the PlayStation Vita, as it currently stands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its re-release earlier this year on consoles, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance has finally released on PC today. No, not the sort-of-reboot from this summer. That's Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance, a very different game. We're talking about¬†the OG!¬†It's been a 20-year journey for the action RPG, first released on PlayStation 2 in 2001, that saw ports on Xbox and Gamecube, but never Windows until now.
While its store description says it uses the 3rd Edition Dungeons & Dragons rule set, Dark Alliance plays out more like Diablo than the more strategic-feeling Baldur's Gate titles. You'll play as one of three characters representing the archer, fighter, and sorceress classes, fighting hordes of mystical minions, and taking quests through Black Isle Studios' rendition of the Forgotten Realms.¬†
This updated release features higher resolutions (up to 4K!), solo or co-op play, and full controller support on PC. For those reading this, who prefer playing on console, you're in luck. Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch, too.¬†
And now we wait patiently for Dark Alliance 2 to surface on current hardware. Once, again, we are not talking about a sequel to this summer's game with a similar¬†name.
Have you played the PC version of Dark Alliance yet, or even the console ports? How does the game hold up after all of these years? Conviene in the comments and chat with us about it!]]></summary>

It's not easy to release a kart racer in a world where Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continues to sell gangbusters on Switch, but alas, Nexon is bucking the trend and not only releasing their own kart racer, but it's a free-to-play game, too. And it's a fun time!¬†
Game Informer editor Wesley LeBlanc recently went hands-on with KartRider: Drift during the closed beta that¬†ran from December 8 through December 15. During the beta, players were able to progress through 20 levels of both the free Battle Pass and Premium Battle Pass. Plus, two licenses of unique minigame-like challenges were available to play through, as were races in both the Item Mode and the Speed mode.¬†
In this New Gameplay Today, your hosts Wesley¬†and¬†Alex Stadnik¬†will walk you through all¬†that this beta had to offer. Thanks for watching, and be sure to let us know what you think of this upcoming free-to-play kart racer.]]></summary>

Henry Cavill has returned to reprise the role of the silvery-haired¬†monster-slaying hunk Geralt of Rivia. Season two continues Geralt's adventures, this time with his apprentice Ciri (played by Freya Alan) in tow. Also returning this season are¬†Yennefer (Anya Chalotra), Vesimir (Kim Bodnia), Triss (Anna Shaffer), Lambert (Paul Bullion), and everyone's favorite bard Jaskier (Joey Batey), among a bevy of newcomers.
Have no fear; this won't be the last you'll see of these characters! Season three has already been confirmed, so feel free to take in the show at your own pace ‚Äì like me, who has yet to watch any of season one, though I'd like to very soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy¬†we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio‚Äôs first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he‚Äôs outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are¬†elite Jedi hunters.¬†
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware‚Äôs Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas.¬†

Fallen Order was released November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can¬†still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we‚Äôre revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon.¬†
Join Marcus Stewart, Daniel Tack, and Andrew Reiner on Twitch today at a special start time of 3 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis‚Äô adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat. Just as a reminder,¬†subscribing¬†to Game Informer on Twitch rewards access to the official Game Informer Discord channel where you can interact with our lovely community as well as the editors. See you in chat!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tencent is making another big game development acquisition with the purchase of Turtle Rock Studios' parent company Slamfire, Inc, which includes¬†Turtle Rock in the deal.
According to a press release shared with Game Informer, the Left 4 Dead and Evolve¬†developers will remain an independent operation at its current Lake Forest, California office. It was also noted that despite the studio's most recent release Back 4 Blood, which was published by Warner Bros. Games, the game and its continued¬†development¬†will not be affected.¬†
Steve Goldstein, president and general manager of Turtle Rock, had this to say about the acquisition, "Tencent‚Äôs outstanding partners, global reach, deep knowledge of gaming and unprecedented support will help us create the kinds of ambitious games we dream of, while allowing us to retain our autonomy and independent spirit.‚Äù
Tencent, for the uninitiated, is a massive Chinese holdings company that has investments all over the video game landscape. Here are some other companies you may or may not know that Tencent has a stake in:
Riot Games
And many more. The above names represent anywhere from 100% ownership in the case of Riot Games to a small stake like Tencent's 5% ownership in Ubisoft. With this newest acquisition of Turtle Rock and Slamfire, Tencent is bolstering its gaming portfolio even further with the veteran development talent.
No sale price was given at the time this story was written, nor were any details of any new games Turtle Rock may be working on past its current responsibilities regarding Back 4 Blood.

PC folks can finally try out the Baldur's Gate that console users first experienced 20 years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot on the heels of Ghostbusters: Afterlife, it seems a new game based on everyone‚Äôs favorite busters could be on the way.¬†
That‚Äôs according to Winston Zeddemore actor, Ernie Hudson, at least. Hudson told YouTube channel Countdown City Geeks that a new one is on the way and that scheduling for recording voice-over is underway, as reported by Nintendo Life. Hudson also said fellow Ghostbuster Dan Aykroyd, who plays Ray Stantz in the films, is attached to the game as well.¬†

‚ÄúI just got an email because we‚Äôre doing another video game,‚Äù Hudson told Countdown City Geeks. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre scheduling it now to do the recording and I‚Äôm not too sure [who is] going to do it. I know me and [Dan Aykroyd], I think. I‚Äôm not sure [if Bill Murray] will do anything on it. So, there will be another video game‚Ä¶When they‚Äôll bring it out, I don‚Äôt know, but it‚Äôs definitely happening.‚Äù¬†
Speaking further about the game, Hudson said whoever is developing it is sending him ‚Äúprototypes of the character to get the image right.‚Äù He said the team seems to have a hard time creating his image, citing that while whoever is developing it is able to nail down Murray and Aykroyd‚Äôs likeness, he always ends up ‚Äúlooking like Eddie Murphy or somebody.‚Äù¬†
At the time of this writing, whatever Ghostbusters game Hudson is referring to has not been officially announced so it seems the actor let slip something he (probably) wasn‚Äôt supposed to. While waiting to learn more, check out our thoughts on the 2009 game in Game Informer‚Äôs Ghostbusters review and then read about how it was recently remastered and re-released in 2019. Check out Game Informer‚Äôs review of the 2016 Ghostbusters game after that.¬†¬†

They didn't have much to say about it at the time, but last night they announced it properly. Named Nine Sols, it's an action platformer with combat inspired by Sekiro.

Announced today, this collection will launch in 2022 and feature six unique shoes, each inspired by one of the Guardians.

However, Square Enix did not reveal the price for any of these sneakers so we‚Äôll likely learn more sometime next year.¬†
‚ÄúA key starting point for the design of each sneaker was the unique visual cues from each of the characters ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs the stitching details on Star-Lord‚Äôs leather jacket, Groot‚Äôs earthy color palette, or Drax‚Äôs unmistakeable tattoos,‚Äù Adidas senior designer James Liu said in a press release. ‚ÄúFrom there, we wanted to inlay various design discovery elements that helped further bring the story of reach character to life. Bringing it all together across the collection are unique signifiers for this original take on Guardians of the Galaxy as a Super Hero team ‚Äì with matching sockliners, hang tags, labels, and packaging.‚Äù¬†
For more information about the collaboration and how the shoes came to be, you can read Square Enix‚Äôs full interview with Liu here. As for what the shoes are, here‚Äôs what you can expect: Star-Lord Forum Hi 84, Star-Lord Forum Mid, Gamora ZX 2K Boost 2.0, Drax Ozelia, Groot NMD R1, and Rocket ZX 1K Boost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The makers of Arma and DayZ have revealed Enfusion, the new cross-platform game engine they plan to build future games on. No, Bohemia Interactive haven't announced Arma 4, but they do say they would use Enfusion for "any potential new Arma game", so maybe that's something to bear in mind while looking at its screenshots of vast landscapes. While they don't have much more than screenshots and a wee video to show right now (sorry, engine enthusiasts), they do hint that they'll release some sort of "playable demonstration of its features" at some point "soon".

Epic are also going wild with coupons again, giving a ¬£10 (or $10) coupon on every game you buy which costs at least ¬£13.99 (or $14.99). Given Epic's habit of paying for timed exclusives, they do have discounts on some games you'll not get elsewhere, or at least not with those vouchers.

Halo Infinite's best place is its open world, through which you can swing like a honking metal Tarzan and do sweet Warthog jumps from cliffs. But its best level, the most satisfying A-to-B gun boulevard, comes late in the campaign (spoilers ahead). The House Of Reckoning is a series of rooms where contrived artificial battlefields have been constructed inside an alien fortress. They are abstractly human structures surrounded by sand, as if your extraterrestrial enemies have been playing house but believe a homo sapiens' house looked exactly like a chunk of Normandy beach circa 1944. The narrative reasoning behind this level is absurd. But the fights that occur within are excellent.

The studio released a brief clip of a 2D action game labeled as a work in progress, and today we have a title and a hint at what the adventure¬†entails.
The game is called Nine Sols, and Red Candle Games describes it on Twitter as a ‚Äúhand-drawn 2D action platformer with Sekiro-inspired deflection-focused combat.‚Äù The game stars a vengeful hero on a journey to kill nine¬†rulers, called¬†Sols, of a forgotten realm inspired by Asian fantasy. This world was also home to an ancient alien race. The official art posted below reveals the protagonist‚Äôs cat-like appearance¬†(which was obscured by a hat in the demo clip).
Nine Sols doesn‚Äôt have a release window or announced platforms, so it‚Äôs probably a ways off. Still, given the quality of Red Candle Games'¬†horror titles, it‚Äôs exciting to see the team tackle something outside of what's become their usual wheelhouse.¬†

Before we get to that, though, we must first discuss (at length) whether 200 t-shirts is a lot of t-shirts, what Nate is having for his Christmas dinner, what kind of cop duo would be named Halloumi & Date, and also what our favourite Christmas songs are.

The original's bombing mission sequence, which sees Cloud and co. blow up a planet-killing mako reactor in the industrialised hellhole of Midgar's city centre, was already one of the Final Fantasy series' best openers, but here we get to really luxuriate in every last detail of its twenty-four-year glow-up. Director Tetsuya Nomura may have a reputation for excess in JRPG circles (both in his tangled storylines and his passion for buckles and belts), but in FF7R that tendency toward indulgence has been applied with deadly, laser-like precision.

As space haulers Rani and Becks touch down on a forgotten planet in search of a strange energy signal, the place is absolutely gummed up with the stuff. It oozes and throbs in the caves, plains and rivers of this once vibrant landscape, and the urge to suck it all up into Rani's chunky power glove (a literal hand vac in this case) is overwhelmingly strong. After all, when it turns the ground black and saps the world of all its colour, this is one case of Extremely Bad Vibes you'll want to remedy as soon as possible. 
Your reward for scooping up all the gunk in any given area is the kind of graphical wizardry video games do best. A burst of light, a shruum of sound, and the world is instantly transformed back to its former glory. Despite its gloopy namesake, The Gunk is frequently stunning, its soft pastels and coral-esque flora showing such an eye for jaw-dropping visuals that it's hard to believe this is SteamWorld developer Image & Form's first ever 3D video game. If this is what they've been holding back on all these years, then their upcoming action adventure SteamWorld Headhunter should be a real treat for the old eyeballs. That said, while Image & Form have clearly navigated their 2D to 3D transition from an art perspective, their typical flair for adding their own spin to different genres has been less successful. There's a lot to like about this 3D action platformer, but it's missing that spark to really make it sing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roll7 have announced that their next skating game OlliOlli World comes out on February 8th, 2022. This latest OlliOlli game swaps out the 2D style for a cel-shaded 3D world that looks absolutely lovely. Or radical. Or sick. Or other skater words. The action-platformer's plot sounds great too, it drops you into Radlandia on a search for the skate gods. Skate gods! Don't anger them, kiddos, they'll break your collarbones.

Babble Royale is a new Scrabble-like battle royale where 16 players fight to be the last letters standing. You have to make words in such a way that you escape a zone that's closing in, and attack other players by building words off of theirs. I honestly didn't think it would work, but man, it absolutely does.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nerves have been sufficiently jangled as of late, not least thanks to the slew of action packed games that have landed in recent months. I crave an altogether more sedate beginning to next year, and so my mind turns to games in which violence, reflex or any other kind of unblinking attentiveness takes a back seat. 
Looking for a broader mixture of games? Check out our regularly updated list of the best PC games you can play right now.
Primarily we're talking violence-free games here, but I wanted to drill a little deeper than that - so nothing that generally requires a competitive streak. I'm chasing a certain feel rather than a certain category. Flying, walking, puzzling, driving, building, dreaming, climbing, stretching, swinging (not like that), swimming, wondering: these are just a few of the ways in which flashing pixels can make you feel a very different sort of accomplishment.

My hands weren‚Äôt exactly ‚Äúon‚Äù, but more ‚Äúaround‚Äù, actually. That‚Äôs one thing I learned from my time with this kung-fu caper. To keep my fists flowing, I needed to be patient, and not mash the buttons. Seriously, slap those buttons with zero thought and you‚Äôre dead.
Death in Sifu means you age, and if you die lots, you age faster. Hit 70 and you won‚Äôt be rising from the dirt again. Instead, you'll have to start your quest for vengeance over from the beginning. While it can be tempting to cling onto your youth for this reason alone, I actually liked growing old, with my beard and my harder-hitting attacks. Not only do you develop a relationship with your body in Sifu, but your trips to the afterlife also help you master its myriad of moves. Sifu really does get better with age.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my absolute favourite platformers, Rayman Origins, is free to keep on Ubisoft Connect right now. Ubisoft are giving the 2D side-scroller away as part of their 35th anniversary celebrations, which is wonderful news. It's one of the best co-op games I've played, so it's a perfectly timed freebie if you're in need of something to keep friends and family entertained over the holiday period.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inscryption is, without a doubt, the best game I've played this year. It's creepy, surprising, and superbly fun, and now you can play the best part for as long as you please. Developer Daniel Mullins has released a "mini-expansion" in beta on Steam, which (minor spoilers ahead!) makes its animal-based card game a standalone roguelike experience. Named Kaycee's Mod, it's slightly tougher than what you might have played already, and adds new challenges too, so you can keep going back in for more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I finished watching The Game Awards reveal trailer for Rumbleverse, the new Epic-published battle royale game that looks a bit like Fortnite but with melee combat, I raised a practiced eyebrow of derision. "Well, that looks terrible," chortled I, knowing full well that I'd still give it a go at the earliest opportunity because I am an absolute sucker for battle royales.
Two things happened later that day that I did not expect. First: I got the opportunity to dive into Rumbleverse's action-packed 40-player matches far earlier than I'd anticipated, as part of a one day early look at the game. I downloaded and installed it in short order, and jumped right in. Two hours later, at 1am in the morning as the servers shut down, I happened across a second, far more unexpected thing. I found myself absolutely desperate to play more. I've sunk thousands of hours into Apex Legends, Fortnite, Plunkbat, Hunt: Showdown, Warzone, and various other behemoths of the genre. Yet those two hours I spent playing Rumbleverse might be the most fun I've ever had in a battle royale.

The video is pre-alpha footage and it emphasises that this is still a work in progress, but the character creator (called Paramaker, a name chosen by the game's community) looks ridiculously detailed even so.
Paralives is a life sim game that may even have the chops to topple The Sims' supremacy when it launches. This video of the character creation is the beefiest look at Paralives we've had for a while. Marvel as the Paras change musculature, fat distribution and weight before your eyes. Importantly, you can give your Paras some sick tattoos and amazing patterned jackets, because what's the point making a tiny puppet to play with if they're not well cool?

Current and former employees of the Destiny developers claim they've experienced "overt sexism, boys' club culture, crunch, and HR protection of abusers, as well as more complex stories of microaggressions, systemic inequalities, and difficulties in being heard". CEO Pete Parsons has since issued an apology "on behalf of everyone at Bungie", acknowledging that the studio needs to listen to these accounts, and do better.

In an internal email, chief administrative officer Brian Bulatao discourages staff from signing an agreement with the Communications Workers of America union (CWA) - because "active, transparent dialogue between leaders and employees" is better than unionisation, apparently.

        <updated>2021-12-13T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fights In Tight Spaces is about one specific trope that all the spy movies I‚Äôve seen love to use: our main character‚Äôs got to a part in the story where they can relax a bit, inevitably they let their guard down, and on cue, a mystery assassin erupts from the shadows to take advantage of the opportunity. The hero‚Äôs got nothing but their brawn to make it out, but then, surprise! They actually use brains instead. Nobody ever saw it coming. The thing is, watching those movies, we all know the main character‚Äôs not really going to die. I mean, it‚Äôs called The Bourne Identity. There‚Äôd be no movie without a Bourne! (The Jeremy Renner one doesn‚Äôt count.)
Instead of non-stop fast and frenetic action, Fights In Tight Spaces goes for a different approach, and dissects those same action sequences into a turn-based battle. Rather than the scene being a choreographed piece of stunt and camera work that‚Äôs over in a matter of seconds, it‚Äôs a roguelike deckbuilder that puts the player in charge of every minute decision an action hero would have to make in one of those situations. Which means, if that untouchable main character dies at any point, it was because of what you did. Most of the time anyway.

It's a game that features a monotone colour pallette, a dystopian setting, an incredibly abstract story and the first few minutes had me pushing around boxes to get past obstacles, so yes, it will remind you of Playdead's Limbo or Inside. White Shadows gets close to growing its own wings and taking off, thanks to an incredible emphasis on musical sections and cinematic presentation. Sadly, some uninspired puzzles and an incoherent final act clip its wings before it gets to soar.

According to supposed screenshots and store info, it's an expansion named Dawn Of Ragnarok with a lot of fantasy fanciness, journeying into Norse legend with Odin and dwarves and giants and that.
