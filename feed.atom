As you may expect, it'll be relatively tricky to handle with the increasing brutality of the zombies and a formidable boss. So, to better prepare you for the fight, we'll show you how to complete the Ascension Act 4 Story Mission in MW3 Zombies.


MW3 Zombies Ascension Story Mission guide


Before you begin the Ascension Story Mission in MW3 Zombies, you should start preparing with Pack-A-Punch weapons and Perk-A-Colas. The zombies inside the new rift will be at a Tier 2 threat level, so you don't need to PAP your weapon to Level 3. However, the gun should at least have a Rare or Epic rarity equipped to it.

DESTRUCTOID: I noticed when you pick your civilization at the beginning of the game, at least all of the civilizations currently available seem to have two Legacy Path focuses, such as Militaristic, Culture, Economic, etc. Is this the case for all civilizations, and how realistic is it to actually succeed at both of those focuses as opposed to hyper-fixing on just one?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many of the exotics in Destiny 2 are fairly easy to obtain. Provided you snag yourself a few exotic engrams and take a stroll over to Master Rahool, you'll get a good handful to get you started. Exotic engram focusing and the Monument to Lost Light are more difficult methods for obtaining exotic items but still aren't too bad. 


However, some exotics come from the game's hardest pieces of content. Here's how to get the Euphony linear fusion rifle in Destiny 2.


Where to find the Euphony in Destiny 2


Image via Bungie.


The Euphony is rewarded as a random drop from completing the final encounter of the Salvation's Edge raid, The Witness. Each successful completion will give you a legendary item and a 5% chance to receive the Euphony. With the way that raid loot works, that gives you three chances each week provided you have three separate characters at the right power level for it.


There are two ways to increase your chances of getting the Euphony. The first method is to simply complete that final encounter and not receive the Euphony. Each time you don't, you'll increase your chances to get the Euphony slightly more. This chance resets upon receiving the Euphony. The other method is through triumphs. If you can complete certain challenges during different encounters for the raid, you can claim them on your Triumphs page (found under Journey in your Inventory) to increase the drop chance.


Is the Euphony worth using?


The Euphony's main perk causes sustained damage with the weapon to spawn Threadlings. Alongside this, any Threadling damage from the Euphony or otherwise will add a stack of Spindle, increasing the weapon's damage by 2%. This stacks 25 times. This naturally makes the weapon great for a Threadling build, though on its own it's mediocre at best. It should also only be used on Warlock since it's the best class for it thanks to the new Swarmers exotic leg armor.

Once you've watched an eligible stream, your skins will be added to your Twitch Drops Inventory. This gives you a code to use in-game so you can actually unlock the skins. From there, all you have to do is visit the Pal Dressing Facility in-game and swap the skins directly on your favorite Pals. The new skins blend perfectly with the Sakurajima update, which added a massive new island, an Oil Rig location, and dozens of Pals to the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you start playing Madden NFL 25, training points might not be on top of your priorities. After all, this specific currency is exclusive to the Ultimate Team. If you're like me and enjoy the Franchise mode now, you won't have to bother too much. 


But if you're passionately into building up the best possible fantasy team with colorful cards, having a healthy stack of training points will be necessary.


Best way to get training points in Madden NFL 25


The simplest and easiest way to get training points is to sell the player cards you don't need. When you start building up your team, there won't be a huge surplus collection of cards. But that number will change as you complete more objectives and grind the different game modes.

You can sell these players for coins. But doing that with every card might not be the optimum path. Instead, you can exchange them for training points. The lower-rated items hardly give a sufficient amount of points. That changes when you exchange cards with higher overall ratings. This is also a great way to utilize BND items that can't be sold on the market. 


While this method is the best and most sustainable way of getting training points, holding on to your cards for now is best. Madden NFL 25 is still in the opening week of full launch, and it's better to hold on to your higher-rated cards as they help to improve your offense and defense.


In Ultimate Team, EA Sports also provides a Training Shuffle Pack program. But I am not a gambling person, and it's best to hold on to your existing points. Once you have a better idea about the auction market, make sure to get higher-rated items for cheap.


Once you quicksell them, you can get many training points to develop your available cards. This flipping method benefits those who can devote a certain amount of time to snipe higher-rated items for cheap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TomorrowHead Studio has revealed its debut game at the Future Game Show today. Will: Follow the Light is a narrative adventure focused on the authenticity of its travel and puzzle systems. It’s coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.


I’d refer to it as a walking sim, but I think that would be a misnomer since the trailer focuses just as much on dog sledding and sailing. I mean, I think it fits the genre’s criteria not the name.




Anyway, Will: Follow the Light casts you as a man appropriately named Will who is traveling north to find his lost son. According to the press release, “It explores the relationship between father and son in an adventure taking players on an emotional rollercoaster through wild thunderstorms, the ringing silence of loneliness, and a tale about the importance of caring for loved ones.” Oh okay.


What I find most interesting is the “realistic controls” of the sailing yacht. The travel segments of the trailer do seem pretty detailed. Moreover, they also say there’s a lifelike navigation system. I have hopes that there is a lot of travel and navigation in Will: Follow the Light, because I feel that it tends to get downplayed in a world with omnipresent fast travel. In games, I mean. Fast travel in real life hasn’t been figured out yet, as far as I know.


The puzzles also seem detailed, as they’re said to be “rooted in real life.” It shows weights being added to an elevator’s counterweight which is kind of neat. It might beat adventure game logic, but maybe not. There might be a reason why few games use puzzles “rooted in real life.”


Will: Follow the Light is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Refined Iron Sand is going to be a bit of a rare resource as you get through Chapter 2 of Black Myth: Wukong. It’ll be needed to craft the next level of weapon gear after the Wind Bear Staff.


In any case, here’s what you need to know on how to get the resource so you can craft the next tier of staves.


How to get Refined Iron Sand in Black Myth: Wukong


To get Refined Iron Sand in Black Myth: Wukong, you have to progress into Chapter 3 of the story. After defeating the Yellow Wind Sage, you should get one piece of this.


Next, you’ll find more by exploring the side areas and opening chests. However, you’ll still need a few to craft the staff.


Keep going until you get to the Mirrormere area. This will be the second Shrine you find in the third chapter. When you arrive at Mirrormere, you can activate the Shrine and actually buy one unit of Refined Iron Sand. 


With only one left to get, you will have to defeat the Kang-Jin Loong boss just up ahead at the frozen lake. You’ll be thrown into a new area in this chapter upon defeating her. The final pieces of Refined Iron Sand you’ll need should be in chests in the Pagoda Realm.

Much like Silk and other materials that were once scarce, Refined Iron Sand will become a more common resource as you progress through Black Myth: Wukong. 


Make it a habit to periodically check the shop either from NPCs or Shrines to see if you can buy a few more units of crafting materials such as this. It’ll speed up the process of getting better gear as you further progress through the game.


Items from these shops are going to cost Will, but you can always farm that up in areas with dense enemy spawns.

Best experience farms in Black Myth: Wukong


So, what makes a good farm spot is a location near a rest point shrine surrounded by enemies that yield a decent amount of experience when killed, and are easy to kill efficiently. These aspects increase your experience gain per hour (if you're going that long), which means easy experience for earning Sparks.

Where characters in other Metroidvanias may already know how to slide, grab ropes, and climb, in this game, Maui takes on new forms that give him the ability to do each of these and more. You grow your arsenal of animal transformations over time until nothing can stand in the Demi-God's way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games has recently launched the Fortnite Web Shop, creating another way for players to see and buy Fortnite stuff from the Item Shop. 


This Web Shop works similarly to how the in-game Item Shop works in Fortnite. Players can also purchase items by applying Support-A-Creator codes, just like they can in the game on their console or PC.


 This is beneficial for players who like to keep track of what’s available in the shop, especially when there’s a specific item that they are waiting to arrive in the shop, without having to hop onto Fortnite.




The Fortnite Web Shop refreshes every day at 5:00 p.m. PT. Each time, it may introduce new items, and some might go out of rotation. At the time of writing, the shop has skins for Marvel’s Hulk, Hela, Deadpool, Wolverine, and Guardians of the Galaxy. There are also John Wick, Ninja, Lewis Hamilton, Raiden, and Loserfit outfits and bundles that you can pick up.


If you wish to apply a creator code to support your favorite content creators, you can click the star badge on the top-right of the Fortnite Web Shop and add the respective code before you make your purchase.


Epic Games' decision reflects their ongoing efforts to create independent avenues to engage with Fortnite. This also means that players now have the option to purchase in-game items without relying on stores from the likes of Apple or Google, forgoing the platform fee along the way.


Epic Games battled both Apple and Google to prove that both companies hold a monopoly over the app market in their respective stores. While Epic Games lost its case against Apple, they were victorious over Google, which was found guilty of holding a monopoly over the Android app market.

Fortunately, you don't need to achieve all three to unlock the cosmetic, so pick the one that seems easiest (or challenging if you're up for it).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Dreamlight Valley has numerous seafood recipes, from large platters to the famous bouillabaisse. Among the list is a dish known as seafood boil, which, although it has some hints from its appearance, doesn't have any obvious indicators of its exact ingredient list.


Seafood Boil recipe


In Disney Dreamlight Valley, Seafood Boil is a four-star recipe requiring the following ingredients:



Any seafood


Any spice


Potato


Corn



Screenshot by Destructoid


While the first two ingredients are flexible in what you can use, the potato and corn are mandatory to complete this meal. Once you have all four items, toss them into a cooking pot alongside a piece of coal to create your seafood dish.


How to get Seafood Boil ingredients


Although you have some freedom on what seafood and spices you can use, you'll still need to get a few mandatory ingredients for Seafood Boil. It's also important not to swap seafood for fish, as that'll mess up the dish you create. Here are the locations for all four items:



Any seafood: Includes oysters, scallops, and shrimp. Commonly found in Dazzle Beach.


Any spice: Includes basil, oregano, and garlic. Found in all biomes.


Potato: Purchase from Wild Tangle or Forgotten Lands Goofy Stalls


Corn: Purchase from Glittering Dunes or Dazzle Beach Goofy Stalls



Generally speaking, you're good to go if you have some spices and seafood from any source alongside potatoes and corn. You also don't have to use the same combination every time to maximize the energy or star coin value of your meal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finji, Hollowponds, and Richard Hogg have revealed Wilmot Works It Out, a sequel to 2019’s game for organization sickos, Wilmot’s Warehouse. The release date is still TBA, with only PC/Mac announced as platforms.


Strangely, Wilmot Works It Out seems to be more of a puzzle game. But not in the sense that Myst is a puzzle game or Tetris is another type of puzzle game. This is more the sense of a jigsaw puzzle being a puzzle game. It has the same push-pull mechanics of Wilmot’s Warehouse, but instead has you making pictures out of a scrambled pile of tiles. Sometimes, a pile contains titles from multiple puzzles.




Not really what I was expecting. On the other hand, it makes perfect sense to add something more specific to the organization side of things. I’m also not certain that it’s something I’m interested in, but there are a lot of charming details to it. It could definitely be a cozy experience for people who are somehow able to listen to their own thoughts without becoming distressed.


Beyond that, I’m not really sure what to say. Check out the trailer, and you’ll probably know if this is the sort of thing you’ll dig. The soundtrack is by returning composer Eli Rainsberry. It’s said to contain over 60 puzzles, and you can unlock various items to decorate your puzzle-solving room.


Wilmot Works it Out is coming to PC and Mac at an undetermined time in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During Disney Dreamlight Valley's Palace of Time and Jafar's Laboratory quests, you'll explore Jafar's castle to confront him and stop Eternity Isle's curse once and for all. However, to find the final key, you'll need to talk to a picky raven and cook some bird food using vegetables and fish.


How to make Bird Food during The Palace of Time


Unlike regular recipes in Disney Dreamlight Valley, bird food requires a bit of puzzle-solving. Below is a quick list of ingredients you need:



Ripe Tomato


Ripe Carrot


Rotten Fish


Rotten Clam



You'll discover a hint to this recipe by reading the journal next to the ingredient table. Although it doesn't explicitly tell you all four items, it'll reveal that the raven loves rotten seafood and fresh vegetables.


Screenshot by Destructoid


When you first open the laboratory's ingredient table, however, you won't find the rotten fish immediately. Instead, you'll see four ripe items, two of which you need for the recipe. Pick up the ripe carrot and tomato before interacting with the nearby hourglass.


Once you interact with the hourglass, all four items will turn rotten. Although you don't need all four items, the rotten clam and fish are key components to this dish. It may be gross to us, but the raven loves it.

Now that you have the bird food, bring it to the raven to advance one step closer to completing Jafar's Laboratory quest. The raven will give you a power coil, which you'll use to power up the nearby pillar and unlock the door. Behind this door is the key you need for the Palace of Time quest, so make sure to pick it up before leaving.

What are Focus Points in Black Myth: Wukong?


Focus Points are a unique, combat-orientated resource that allows you to use powerful staff attacks to overwhelm your foes. Your most potent abilities, outside of spells, in Black Myth: Wukong will come from expending Focus Points, so it is imperative to understand how they work.

I dare boldly to maintain that there is such a thing as Too Wide, a point beyond which the extra visual estate becomes a waste of electricity, unless you watch the screen in pairs. I can only assume people who use ultrawide monitors live in constant terror of flanking manoeuvres and demand the maximum amount of peripheral vision. Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.
If you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable "cinematic aspect ratios" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view. It's one of several PC-specific flourishes they've just blogged about. Have a look.

We know that the 'Switch 2' is real. We know an announcement is coming this fiscal year. We know "Switch successor" is the most accurate description of it. All of the other big details — what form it will take, how big it will be, whether it will finally give us that flipping Wind Waker port — are all up to speculation and analysis for the time being.
Take, perhaps, one of the biggest questions of them all: How much will 'Switch 2' cost? In the absence of an official announcement, we still have no idea, but that hasn't stopped certain analysts from throwing out predictions and it won't stop us from looking to the past to try and determine the future.

Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.
Tips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”

But I had a fun time with its mixture of Halo-esque trigger pulling and portalling around! So I was intrigued to give the alpha version of Splitgate 2 a go and see if it had a little more substance to it than its initial reveal, which gave off a, "it's Splitgate but with more money" feel. 
Well, I think it's… a bit serious? It certainly has more polish and some extra additions, yet I didn't come away from it thrilled by its more competitive, class-based FPS leanings. I think it just needs a bit more time, perhaps, for a portal to open and some silly rocket launchers and baseball bats and zombies to come tumbling out of it.

And in a "hah, take this Overwatch!" way, they've also announced that all of its heroes will be unlocked for everyone straight off the bat (man). Oh no wait, he's DC isn't he. To be fair, I've only watched one Avengers film, two Captain Americas, and Thor: Ragnarok (without seeing the other Thors). All of which I have zero recollection of. Anyway, yes, Marvel Rivals.

The upcoming Switch title Sid Meier's Civilization VII was confirmed to launch for Switch on February 11th 2025 during Gamescom's Opening Night Live showcase. It's also been revealed that the in-game narrator will be none other than English actor Gwendoline Christie.

She also played the underutilised Captain Phasma in Star Wars: The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, and more recently appeared in TV shows such as Wednesday and The Sandman.

If you have have experience of the London rental market, you are probably reading this and thinking: “He’s got a front door? Such extravagance. I live in a folded umbrella.” Touché, my friend.

Yes, yes, it is the unmistakable rumble of a large survival MMO pondering its release date. Dune: Awakening is having a think and has decided "early 2025" is a good non-specific time period to come out in early access. That could mean January or February. Or March, I guess. April?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arc Raiders was announced back in 2021 as a free-to-play co-op third-person shooter, and has been delayed several times since. That's partly because Embark Studios' other in-development game, The Finals, progressed faster than planned and stole its momentum. It's also because it was re-tooled at some point as a PvPvE extraction shooter.

Now it's back again, aiming for release next year, and it's been re-tooled a little more: it's no longer free-to-play.

It’s just actor Troy Baker telling me about all the great acting he’ll be doing. It is great, by the way. He’s doing a fantastic job. Maybe just, you know, a crumb of acknowledgement or elucidation over the whole ‘interactivity’ part?
Anyway, don’t mind me. I’m just an old fool who likes to press buttons. And, to be fair, it's not like Machinegames don't have a great track record. Anyway, here’s some good news: The game releases December 9th this year. Have a release date trailer.

So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.
It’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's the first gameplay trailer.
We were more than a bit surprised when Sid Meier's Civilization VII was confirmed to be coming to Switch at Summer Game Fest 2024. And at Gamescom, we found out when we can expect to play the game on all consoles — 11th February 2025.
Debuting alongside the release date was the first-look at the gameplay, nd it looks absolutely stunning. Of course, we don't have Switch footage yet — and we're sort of staggered that they'll be able to squeeze the game onto the console — but hopefully it'll look nice on the hybrid console. Well, we'll find out early next year.

Grinding Gear Games have been set on a November window for a while now, but this is the first time they’ve nailed down a date, and possibly clicked on it a bunch of times to show how serious they are. Do a game related verb I can’t accurately name because I never played past that beach at the beginning of the first game, and do it in the general direction of the trailer below. Watch it. Just watch it.

Out in 2025, Directive 8020 is the story of the good ship Cassiopeia, a human colony vessel that is infiltrated by Something Icky. The Something Icky is capable of mimicking humans. So that'd be a bit like Alien and a bit like The Thing, then. Sorry, human colonists!
Directive 8020 was teased at the end of the last Dark Pictures instalment, 2022's The Devil in Me. A trailer also leaked back in November 2022. Now, we have an official announcement video.

"To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the Dying Light 2 Stay Human Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC." That's nice! 
This seems like an odd one. I’m only tangentially familiar with the Dying Light games, but I was under the impression that the model here was releasing a single game, then updating and expanding it for years. Whether standalone adventure Dying Light: The Beast represents an attempt to course correct after Dying Light 2’s mixed reception, then, I’m not entirely sure. But if nothing else, it does share something in common with all the other adverts at Gamescom tonight: it is a game that exists, and will presumably be playable at some point.

It's safe to say that King of Meat has sprung out of nowhere. Developed by Guildford-based studio Glowmade and published by Amazon Games, it was one of the genuinely new announcements in Gamescom's Opening Night Live showcase, and you may be wondering what exactly it has in store.
We were in the same boat when we were invited by the publisher to a preview event earlier this month. But, after watching the trailer, hearing from the developer, and getting to go hands-on for roughly two hours, we're starting to build up a pretty good picture of what it's all about.

Do we love it back? Who knows. But it does exist, and it isn’t using a subtitle. That’s got to count for something, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our Black Myth: Wukong review hails the game as "a generous Soulsy adventure hybrid that works within its limitations and delivers a beautiful challenge to be unpicked with a magical toolbox". Reviewer Edders went so far as to find the world more engaging than that of Elden Ring - proper defying-the-gods level rhetoric. Players seem to agree. The game launched last night, and has already accrued a concurrent player peak of 1.44 million - Steam's fourth highest ever, exceeded only by Counter-Strike, Palworld and PUBG. By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.
All that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other "content creators" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of "trigger words" like "Covid-19", no talk of "politics" or "feminist propaganda", and no mention of "China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our unlucky planet in Wasteland Waste Disposal has suffered not just one apocalypse but all of them. Turns out the "megapocalypse" was an unhealthy combination of "every worst-case apocalyptic scenario imaginable". Luckily, in this upcoming sandbox adventure, you have a giant metal fortress that walks above the pools of toxic sludge on huge spidery legs and chomps up all the trash you bring it. If you are not intrigued by that, perhaps the little janitor with a sci-fi vacuum cleaner (or the feel-good music reminiscent of Adventure Time songs) will convince you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tactical Breach Wizards is a tactics game for people that don’t like tactics games. Magically, it’s also a tactics game for people who love them like nothing else. It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.

They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.
According to director Hiroshi Takai, it was "impossible" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no "existential risk" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill has a messy, up-is-down relationship with time and history, so let's go about this hands-on with the Silent Hill 2 Remake in a messy, up-is-down way. Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative "Unreal Engine 5" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.
It begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground.

There’s not quite enough information about “story generator” sim Marry a Deep One: Innsmouth Simulator for me to confidently say it’ll cut through my exhaustion with all things tentacular and horrifically be-gilled. But it is beguiling, isn’t it? There’s all sorts of little widgets and details shown off that remind me of everything from Sid Meier’s Pirates to classic adventure games, and maybe even a little Rimworld? It’s a heady soup, although one I’d recommend against quaffing, given where the water comes from.

In other words, it all toys with the game's "curse" status effect, a hex that causes you to be killed if you take even a single hit. You'll probably die a few times as a result of this update, which in some ways is a fitting finalé for this fast-paced jar smasher of a game. You can see the new features in the trailer below.

The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.

That's just my shopping list. What I meant to say was: new video games! Video games (PC games, specifically) are the only thing that can preoccupy the Maw, the only thing newsworthy enough to distract it from the tempting clifftop maisonettes of Torquay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.
Still, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it.

We had moderately high hopes for it before the early access release - I personally enjoy the fairytale setting, with its pop-up Pucks and magic umbrellas, but I also think I've raised enough hovels on procedurally generated maps for one lifetime. Still, I'd quite like it to come good, if only so I can justify op-eds about Lewis Carroll, and I'm somewhat encouraged by what I've heard of the game's forthcoming Realms Rebuilt update.

And either way, it's a spectacular journey that works for mostly everyone: those after challenging fights against Chinese mythological creatures, and those after the same thing, but with a little less challenge than your typical Soulslikes. What separates Black Myth from the crowd, though, is its slick presentation and a sense of generosity. You're to witness the most lavish, cinematic worlds and its creatures. And you're to enjoy battering everything with your staff as a highly athletic monkey with copious spells at his furry follicles and fingertips. It's been a while since I've played anything quite as impressive as this.

The strategy game’s 5.2 update is on the horizon, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the team teased in June. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC. They’re also focused right where Immortal Empires needs them the most: depth, rather than width. In the dawi’s case, quite literally.

Both the stakes and the poly count were low. Happy news then, that it is getting a snowy sequel.

Like 13th century peasants straining to convey huge, teetering loads of freshly quarried LMGs, our SSDs cry out for justice. Perhaps scenting imminent rebellion and a mass audience desertion to low-poly shooters with more civilised file sizes, Activision have relented. Future installations of the much-padded FPS will be "smaller and more customised", though in a last cruel stroke of villainy, they want you to download a large update to prepare the ground.

Last time I checked in, it was school trips to other dimensions. Now, it's Cosmic Storms. Due for release alongside the Stellaris 3.13 Vela update on September 10th, these are a paid "mechanical expansion" (priced at a rather chunky £11, $13 or €13, and available as part of the current season pass) that builds upon the game's existing Space Storms, "providing a deeper experience with strategically meaningful gameplay and beautiful upgraded visuals". Wash that down with new civics, precursor narratives, anomalies, archaeology sites, techs, edicts, a new Ascension perk, and new galactic community resolutions.

Some readers characterised this as a familiar species of cultural hypocrisy regarding video games - emphasising violence is A-OK, but for the love of god, don't mention sex. Good news, those people: Dread XP's latest horror signing The Lacerator has both. It casts you as hirsute 1980s porn star Max - surname not given in press release, but presumably something like Jackin' or Girth - who has been abducted by a large scary individual called the Lacerator.

But I'm also the ideal reviewer to tear it apart over the most minor hiccups and defects. I'm the Anton Ego of factory games. I don't like food, I love it. If I don't love it, I don't swallow.
Ah, you needn't worry. This is by far the most fun I've had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I've never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life. But 40 hours into my save file, I've often found myself yearning for a bit more creativity in the challenges, a few more curveballs sent in my direction.

The idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.

The peasant-quelling RPG antics of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 won't be releasing this year after all, say developers Warhorse  in a video message to fans. "We aimed for the end of the year, and almost made it," said PR man Tobi Stolz-Zwilling. "Almost is not good enough though, so unfortunately we slipped to 2025."  Never mind, it's easy to slip in the medieval era. There was mud everywhere.

And, as of September, they’re cracking down on links to other websites in store pages. Now, horror of horrors, they’re coming for your ascii gigachads and “nobody is going to read this review so I’ll just say I’m gay” bangers. The changes are part of their ‘New Helpfulness System’, outlined here.
The new system, which will be enabled by default but can be toggled off, aims to “help potential players make informed decisions about the games they are considering purchasing by understanding the attributes of the game that other players like or don't like.” Ah, so a sort of ‘review’, if you will.

Whether both will actually see the inside of a cell is unclear; one turned up to face the music, the other failed to appear. The reason for his absence is unknown and just the start of a long list of other unanswered questions.

It's 2D pixel art, with a limited colour palette as in EGA games, and you control it with a text parser, like King's Quest or one of them other Sierra adventures old men like Graham remember. It's important to mention this up front because it's very possible that, despite The Crimson Diamond's tale of betrayal, murder, and mineral rights in 1914 Canada, the text parser element will be a Rubicon you instantly can't be arsed to cross. A not unreasonable stance - though I think the text parser in The Crimson Diamond is fantastic. Such beef that I have with this adventure game is down to the specificity required to solve some of the puzzles.

The titular arena is a large room in which you, a large man, bash a large amount of enemies. You have to punch a gong between waves to trigger the next, and this struck me as a nice pre-emptive nudge that every problem you face in Kiborg can be solved by rapidly moving your fist towards offending objects, which turned out not to be too far off the mark.

According to Obsidian's studio head Feargus Urquhart, the project is rubbing along nicely. But it was not ever thus: during the opening years of the Covid pandemic, there was apparently "talk of 'do we stop Outer Worlds 2 and just throw the whole team on Avowed'."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve have made no secret of their plans to make SteamOS – the Linux-based operating system that powers the Steam Deck – available to other games-playing devices, including rival handhelds. After a recent beta update mentioned adding support for the Asus ROG Ally’s inputs, The Verge confirmed with Valve that SteamOS support for non-Steam Deck portables is still very much in the works. The Deck’s long-promised dual booting capability, on the other hand, sounds further down the to-do list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been looking grim for Super Earth recently. I mean, not really. Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.
“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns," reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.
Whether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.

Back when I was OXM's online editor, "free Xbox games" was one of our golden Google pillars, the other two being "Minecraft Xbox 360 update" and "Skyrim something something". Well, uncle Valve has just rudely torpedoed that ancient investigative initiative by adding a Trending Free tab to the Steam frontpage, encompassing prologues, demos, free-to-play games and that most treasured of jewels, a full free game with no monetisation elements, such as Grimhook.
Do not cry for us pitiful electronic scribblers, crowded on our melting internet icebergs. Play free games instead! Thanks to that new tab, I've just discovered a demo for neato wide-format tower defender Frontline Crisis. Hah, that'll keep the awareness of steady livelihood erosion at bay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aside from being a game where you run around a shopping mall murdering the living dead, the original Dead Rising from 2006 is a clownish satire of sleazy tabloid photojournalism. It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn "Prestige points" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: "Brutal" scenes of characters being slain; moments of "Horror", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical "Outtakes", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of "Drama", such as people reacting to discoveries; and "Erotic" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.
The Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't "a response to a changing cultural climate", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not "an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck’s competitors, whether they’re the old guard Ayaneo family, the luxe Asus ROG Ally X, or the shapeshifting Lenovo Legion Go, usually share the same attack line: they can play more of your games. The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.
Unless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.

Little did I know that the humble premise of a small 2D spacecraft shooting baddies on a wrap-around screen would reach the glittering heights of Nova Drift. Had you shown me this game back in 1995, I dare say I'd have shmupped myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the many, Gigery beauties of 2014's Alien: Isolation is that you save using an in-game, wall-mounted Emergency Phone - a maddeningly analog process of slotting a keycard into the machine and waiting for three beeps. Doing this requires you to stand upright in full view, with your back turned upon an entire space station's worth of shiny domed technology and guttural industrial noises. Delightful!
Amongst the players harrowed and compelled by this fixture is Fede Álvarez, director of the 2013 Evil Dead remake, 2016's Don't Breathe and, most recently Alien: Romulus - the seventh and avowedly "back to basics" Alien movie. Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature's dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien's Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly's work, he's filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.

Speculation abounds that these "leaks", coupled with Valve's obstinate silence about it, are a calculated publisher psyop.

It seems unlikely, but as other writers have pointed out, this is Valve, unaccountable elder god of PC gaming. I guess we should be thankful it isn't another Half-Life tease.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Shadows Of Doubt you can fall from the roof of a corporate office building during a routine investigation, shatter all the bones in your frail detective body, wake up in a clinic fully healed, and then sprint out the door without paying your sky-high hospital bills while the clinic's auto-turret shoots at you for doing a medical dine and dash. The early access game is on our best immersive sims list for a reason, you know, and now it has an autumn release date for the final version, along with a new trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Bethesda released a remastered edition of Doom and Doom II on Steam, with lots of extra episodes and improvements. One of these new features is a built-in browser for mods, and support for many existing mods that previously required a different version of the game. Basically, lots of good fan-made mods are now playable on the Steam version of ye olde Doom. That's neat! Ah, but there is some demon excrement on the health pack, so to speak. The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author. That's prompted one level designer to call it "a massive breach of trust and violation of norms the Doom community has done its best to hold to for those 30 years."

Four joke topics appear at the bottom of the screen. Ridiculous celebrity kids names. Action figures for news anchors. Diet water sales boom. You cautiously slide that last one over to the microphone. Throwbrien emits a string of chirps, like a flame-crested lyre bird with a wounded voicebox trying to mimic human language. “Have you folks heard about this one…”
There is an implied terror in this seemingly friendly opener. What if they have heard this one? What will Throwbrien do then?

RuTube is currently awash with pirated copies of Hollywood movies and, during the summer, RuTube used imagery from Barbie and Oppenheimer to advertise the fact. Last week, Russian telecoms operators gave RuTube another boost by massively throttling YouTube. On Friday, RuTube's apps were suddenly removed from Apple's App Store and Google Play.

The Hi-Fi Rush studio have been acquired - alongside the IP for future games in the rhythm action series - by South Korean company Krafton, who also own PUBG Studios and Striking Distance, among others. “This strategic move will include the rights to Tango Gameworks’ acclaimed IP, Hi-Fi Rush,” Krafton said in a statement today. I particularly enjoy the hand-rubbing, grinning use of the word ‘strategic’ here. Great news though.

But while writing this, I'm sipping an "Intenso" Arctic Coffee from Morrisons, which is giving the Lidl frontrunners some stiff competition at last, albeit at 145% the cost. Will one true victor emerge? Find out next week! For now, here's what we're all clicking on this weekend!

And when I pan to the lighthouse piercing the sunset beyond the security spikes it's not out of any feeling of wonder, or even curiosity about possible escape routes. Please understand: I do not see these people, these objects at all, just the boneless, faceless traces they leave upon my own servitude to the lens.

It was a gimmick that made flanking fun again, at least until you died to a distant rifle that was right next to you all along. Its sequel, Splitgate 2 is continuing that gimmick but is also sprucing up the free-to-play arena shooter with a few modern additions, like bum-sliding around corners and big deployable bubbles called "time domes" that slow down your enemies yet speed up your allies. All this and more comes from a gameplay trailer that went up yesterday.

A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game's absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn't work out who was killing what.
It looks like the gargantuan action game's PvP multiplayer will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.
