Electronic Arts and FIFA have officially parted ways, and now EA is teasing what it's been working on for EA Sports FC, its next step in virtual football. That is to say, a logo.
The EA Sports FC logo was unveiled today, with a lengthy blog post detailing just how it was made. The company teamed with Uncommon Creative Studio to create its new brand identity, with its new triangular logo becoming the symbol for all things EA Sports FC.
It's a lot of discussion about how and why the upside-down triangle was chosen, mostly as a reference to both formation design / set pieces and also to player control indicators.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PC show will go on, even if E3 won't
The summer of gaming showcases is starting to take shape, and that means another stream has locked in its air date. The 2023 version of the PC Gaming Show, hosted by PC Gamer, will air on June 11.
No exact time has been locked in just yet, though PC Gamer confirms the broadcast will follow the Xbox double-header that's also planned for June 11. Host Sean "Day[9]" Plott will return to head up the showcase. More details about what's set for the actual broadcast, including games that will be featured, will arrive in the coming months.
"When we launched the PC Gaming Show way back in 2015, it was a response to how underrepresented the platform was at E3," writes PC Gamer's global EIC Evan Lahti. "Our noble hobby was in the midst of a golden age, but it didn't have a seat at gaming's biggest table. Now that E3 has gone off to live in that big, never-ending gaming convention in the sky, we're carrying on under the wider umbrella of mid-year showcase events, along with our sister show, GamesRadar's Future Games Show."
Yes, by the way, the Future Games Show is also planned to happen sometime in June. Details are TBD right now, but GamesRadar and Future have confirmed that the show is "unaffected" by the recent cancellation of E3.
The summer stops for no one
It looks like, despite the big to-do being done, there will still be some events and news to share in June. These events join the aforementioned Xbox showcase, set to discuss more about Microsoft and specifically Starfield too. Ubisoft is also hosting its own Forward event in June.
Tag on the Summer Game Fest, as well as today's confirmation for Gamescom Opening Night Live, and there's still plenty of summer showcases to go around.

Sony has issued a new statement regarding the Competitions and Markets Authority, or CMA, and its recently narrowed scope of concerns over Microsoft's pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
The paper, submitted last month and recently publicized, sees Sony describing the CMA's "reversal" of its position on its consoles theory of harm as "surprising, unprecedented, and irrational."
This is in regard to the CMA's recent update, where its provisional findings determined that a strategy of making Activision games like Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox would be "significantly loss-making under any plausible scenario." On this basis and from its updated analysis, the CMA says that Microsoft will still have an incentive to continue making Call of Duty…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GZDamn that looks good
I’m glad our community is looking out, since this one nearly got past me. Retro-engine FPS Supplice has been released on Steam Early Access today.
Designed by modders and built on the GZDoom engine, Supplice is the latest FPS looking to take you back to the days when 3D wasn’t made of polygons and enemies queued up to be exploded.
https://youtu.be/dRtT28_HBPI
Currently, developer Mekworx is presenting Supplice’s first episode of five missions for Early Access. They’re attempting to release a new episode every 2-3 months until completion. Supplice has technically been in development for 14 years, but began its life as a total conversion of Doom. The team got ambitious and decided it was time to spin off into a full product.
I saw a few seconds of footage from the trailer and immediately recognized the exaggerated head bob from the Doom engine. That classic engine’s bones form the foundation of GZDoom, allowing for techniques that weren’t possible back in the day. Along with Supplice, another indie game called Selaco is utilizing the engine to create something both familiar and unique.
I love old raycasting engines and think it’s great that developers are utilizing them again. While they’re certainly more constraining than your typical polygonal 3D engine, they have a quality that is difficult to replicate. I’m hoping to see more like it going forward, as Ken Silverman’s Build Engine has also seen some love from games like Ion Fury.
Supplice is available on PC right now through Steam Early Access.

Hey everyone, are you ready to add another game to your pile of gifts from Tim Sweeney? I know I am, and I swear I’ll find the time to play everything in my expanding library of freebies. All I need to do is discover that pocket dimension where time ceases to exist and I am gold.
From now until April 14, Dying Light Enhanced Edition is available for free on the Epic Game Store. Originally released in 2015, Dying Light is occasionally considered Techland’s spiritual successor to Dead Island. Of course, given the impending release of Dead Island 2 as an Epic Games PC exclusive, the choice of Dying Light as a freebie is pretty funny. Perhaps they intend for you to see one co-op zombie game and remember there’s a new one coming in two weeks. After all, since Dying Light was originally released in 2015, fans of the genre have likely long since played it.
That said, let’s not bury the lede here; shapez is also free on the Epic Game Store. Though I joke a bit here, shapez is a legitimately well-loved minimalistic base building game. It typically costs $10, but even a price as low as that can’t beat free. I can’t wait to finally play this one once I figure out where to find eight additional hours per day that don’t come from sleep.
Like Dying Light Enhanced Edition, shapez will be available for free until April 14. As usual, once you claim these games, they are yours to play even after the deadline. MORDHAU and Second Extinction are next on the freebie list, so make a reminder for next Friday if those interest you too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That's no moon...
EA has revealed the minimum and recommended requirements for the upcoming Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Unsurprisingly, you’ll need some reasonable meat on your PC’s bones in order to… what the hey? What the gosh darn dickens!?
According to this, you’re going to need 144GB set aside for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Why?
To put this into perspective, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (the new one) wants 125GB of digital territory. The original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (the new one) wants 175GB of space, and that’s largely because it includes Call of Duty: Warzone. Ark: Survival Evolved, with all its goodies and expansions, takes up somewhere around 400GB. Hitman 3 (the new one) tells me it wants 72.35 giga-acres of hard drive. Doom Eternal is at 89GB. Finally, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order tells me 55.92GB.
It’s not the biggest, but it’s also bizarrely huge for a single-player-only game that isn’t fully open-world. It’s built in the Unreal 4 Engine, and it looks snazzy, but I’m not sure I want it to desecrate 144GB of my hard drive.

It wasn’t so long ago that I just left most of my games installed because they didn’t make a dent in my expansive hard drive. Now we live in a world where having a full terabyte of vast, open space means you can install a handful of games. I guess on the other hand, my internet speed is faster, so maybe it’s just a matter of changing my habits.

The cosy Victorian toy-guiding puzzler Tin Hearts is out on Switch pretty soon here, on 20th April. And publisher Wired Productions and developer Rogue sun have revealed that it's now a timed-exclusive to the hybrid console, meaning those looking to play the game on other platforms will have to wait an extra month.
Managing director at Rogue Sun Kostas Zarifis highlighted the Nintendo community and the Big N itself for the support and love they've shown for the game, saying that the team is "honoured" to be working close with Nintendo. The game won “Most Anticipated Nintendo Switch Game” at Gamescom 2022, which has spurred on support for the community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The darkness comes
Fulqrum Publishing has announced that a sequel to Byte Barrel’s 2022 retro-inspired shooter, Forgive Me Father, is on the way to PC. Forgive Me Father 2 is said to “build up on the satisfying action of the first game and double down on the striking pulp, comic book inspired visuals.”
A teaser has been dropped alongside the announcement, and as with most teasers, it doesn’t really show off anything in terms of actual gameplay. Just a pair of hands reloading a revolver.
https://youtu.be/fJPxUZthqn0
At least that small bit of gameplay has shown off what is definitely an FPS. The first game in the series was a Lovecraftian twist on the classic shooter formula. It tied in creepy eldritch weapons and a madness system that let you go nuts on enemies. The graphics also strikingly feature 2D hand-drawn images.
In our review of the game, Noelle Warner found the original to be rather dull and repetitive. Hopefully, for Forgive Me Father 2, Byte Barrel can address feedback and knock this one out of the park. It certainly has a visual style that makes it worth a look.
Forgive Me Father 2 is coming to PC at some point in the future. No release window was given.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The big reveals show returns once more
It's another year, and summer's almost upon us. That means it's time for more showcases, reveals, and streams, including Gamescom Opening Night Live.
Show host Geoff Keighley confirmed the date and location today on social media, as the show will be hosted live from Koelnmesse in Cologne, Germany on August 22. No word on the time yet.
https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1643971101280681985
As for what to expect, well, it'll be a whole host of video game news. Gamescom Opening Night Live is usually the last big show of the summer of gaming news, sitting right near the end of August and leading right into the Gamescom event.
What this means is a lot of reveals, trailers, and spotlights on upcoming games. For example, last year is where we saw Dead Island 2 get a release date (that would eventually get delayed), a leaked Sonic Frontiers date got confirmed, and Hideo Kojima announced his podcast.
After the streams of summer have gone
The summer is going to look quite different this year, though. E3 has officially bowed out of the conversation, with the ESA and PAX organizer ReedPop calling off their plans for in-person and digital. Though we've been without a proper in-person E3 for a few years now, this news feels a bit like a nail in the coffin.
Meanwhile, Keighley's Summer Game Fest is still cruising along. The SGF show will air live on June 8, with a live audience. Xbox and Ubisoft are also planning their own shows for the summer, too. Even without E3 in the mix, the summer seems set to roll on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look, I’m not saying Far Cry 3 is responsible for *gestures vaguely towards modern AAA games* but it’s definitely a prime suspect. If I was trying to connect a piece of red string from the middle of my evidence board (which would probably be a picture of the map screen from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla), I’m not sure I’d push a pin directly into Jason Brody’s face, but I’d definitely circle it in black Sharpie a few times. Basically, in the eleven years since its release, I’ve grown a bit suspicious of Far Cry 3’s lasting legacy. 


And yet, in those halcyon days of 2012, we named it our game of the year. Although it’d be easy to simply say that decision was made a bit before my time here, I should probably admit that when reviewing the game for the blog I used to run when I was at university, I awarded it an equally prestigious (stop laughing at the back) 10/10. That almost seems ludicrous, doesn’t it? Far Cry 3? Game of the year? Surely not.


After spending a few hours revisiting the sunny shores of Rook Island, I was shocked to discover a game that feels surprisingly pure. Mechanically, I hasten to add. The actual act of playing Far Cry 3 in 2023 is still good fun, it’s the bits around it that are a bit ropey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For April Fool's Day, Sega released a game where the company finally went and did the unthinkable: they killed Sonic. The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog is a real visual novel in which you investigate the death of Sega's beloved mascot, currently free on Steam. Here's the game's description via the publisher: 
It's Amy Rose's birthday, and she's hosting a murder mystery party on the Mirage Express! When Sonic the Hedgehog becomes the game's victim, everyone is off to get to the bottom of things. However, something feels a bit off - is this really an innocent game or is something more sinister afoot?
Surprisingly, the free game has proved very popular. As told by Sonic social media manager Katie Chrzanowski (via GameSpot), more one million people have played the game. Going a step further, it's apparently the 61st highest-reviewed game on Steam right now, and as GameSpot points out, the best-rated Sonic game on Steam (though that's not the highest margin to clear, all things considered). As of this writing, The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog has over 11,000 user reviews on Steam, netting it an "Overwhelmingly Positive" ranking. You can check the game out for yourself right here. 
Over 1,000,000 of you have grabbed The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog and it's currently the #61 highest rated game on Steam of ALL TIME.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now with a new font
Square Enix is bringing its Pixel Remaster series for the first six Final Fantasy games to console this month. The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series will hit PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch on April 19.
The Pixel Remaster series is a direct remastering of the early NES and SNES-era Final Fantasy games, from the very first up to the legendary Final Fantasy VI. They will be made available individually for $17.99 a pop, or you can get the full bundle of all six for $74.99.
Though both PlayStation and Switch are getting these Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters, there's no word on an Xbox release.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC6bH50jCik
A big update for these versions is a new pixel font, addressing one of the major complaints from the PC version. I'll need to see them in-game to really get a sense, but it's nice to know Square's at least trying to rectify the font situation. The pixel font, it's noted, is not supported in all languages.
Additionally, some quality-of-life features have been added. There is the modern UI and bestiary, but also some nice updates like the option to switch between the original and new music. There are also some settings to tune encounter rate, EXP and Gil gain, and more.
A new home for old classics
The Pixel Remaster series is notable, as it's the easiest way to get a hold of and play these classic RPGs. Even though the price tag feels a bit steep for me, I'm happy that there will finally be a way to play games like Final Fantasy IV on the Nintendo Switch. That just feels right, you know?
The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series hits PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch on April 19. Meanwhile, if you want some newer Final Fantasy, the next entry is slated to launch this June for PlayStation 5.

Releasing in cinemas yesterday, the Super Mario Bros. Movie has been generating non-stop hype and discussion online this week. We've shared our own thoughts on the film if you're interested in going to see it yourself, but before you do, you might want to check out this little beauty.
Yes, Mario's new silver screen spectacular has now been treated to its very own Monopoly set. Inspired by the film, of course, the game will have you collecting Super Mario World locations, earning coins, and even attempting to stay out of the way of a pesky Bowser token that moves around the board separately as you play. It's available to buy right now from Amazon and Target in the US (we'll update this page with links for UK buyers should the set also become available there):

The latest Japanese charts have come our way from Famitsu (via Gematsu) and this week once again sees Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe beating the competition to reclaim the top spot.
The pink puff ball's Switch remaster only managed to shift 21,014 copies in the week of 27th March to 2nd April, but that was still enough for it to land first place in a quiet week. Last week's champion, Resident Evil 4, saw a substantial decrease in sales with the PS5 version dropping from 89,662 copies sold down to only 18,510. This placed the game in second, with the PS4 version following one position behind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I probably should play Trepang1 first
Team17 has announced that Trepang Studios’ effects-filled supernatural FPS will be hitting PC on June 21, 2023. Trepang2 is billed as a love letter to “the fast-paced and over-the-top FPS games of the mid-2000s,” and by that, they mean 2005’s F.E.A.R.
Trepang2 puts you in the super-shoes of a super-soldier who is busted out of a Government black site. They’ve been given a super-hammer, and everybody else looks a lot like nails. You’ll be able to upgrade your superpowers, giving you access to slow motion, invisibility, and super-human speed.
https://youtu.be/WLcy-agdpaM
A trailer has dropped alongside the announcement that shows off some dim environments and bloody combat. Trepang2 seems particularly proud of its dismemberment systems, and why shouldn’t it be?
Trepang2 is shaping up to be a slick homage to F.E.A.R. My only concern is that a few superpowers aside, it does seem to be sticking rather close to the aesthetic of that game. Industrial environments and offices are all poorly lit: check. That said, I loved F.E.A.R. It came out around the time that I built my first gaming rig, so it was fun to have something that pushed it a little. I was in awe of the graphics and AI, and even today, it’s a solid shooter. Hopefully, Trepang2 can live up to that. I’ll probably be checking it out.
Trepang2 is coming to PC on June 21, 2023. You can try the demo right now.

Celeste Classic presented a condensed climb up the titular mountain, letting you dash across platforms, hang onto walls, and collect strawberries - in miniature form. As a fun homage, you can find the PICO-8 version inside Celeste proper. And now, as an even funner homage, you can play it on the Playdate. A loveable game on a loveable handheld.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a moment in BioShock Infinite's opening act that's always stuck with me. As you emerge onto the floating city of Columbia, the game takes you on a guided tour of the sights and sounds of this airbone civilization. As you saunter through the streets, you learn about its citizens and its creator, just sort of taking it all in. The sun is shining. You're surrounded by smiles. Before you know it, an airship rises above the clouds and perches next to a hugging couple, gently swaying in the summer breeze. Aboard the ship is a barbershop quartet, cheerfully harmonising the iconic Beach Boys tune God Only Knows. It's a memorable scene, and has become an integral part of the game's lasting iconography. 


But for Tyler, Nick, Derek and Greg, this section was more than just a fun tease for the secret behind Columbia's unusual success. Self-confessed music school kids, the quartet inspired them to create their own musical group styled after Infinite's singing hairdressers. In 2023, BioShop Infinite celebrated their ninth year at PAX East, where they performed a wonderful collection of harmonised tunes to an absolutely packed community room - and we were there to film it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm beggin' darling please, Layla
We’re just a few weeks away from the launch of Redfall for Bethesda Softworks, which means it’s about time for the developer to properly introduce the characters we’ll be hunting vampires with. There are four heroes in the base game—I would be shocked if we don’t get one or two more in an expansion pack—each with unique abilities that I can’t wait to see in action. First up for the introduction videos is Layla, the telekinetic hero who can conjur umbrellas, elevators, and her undead boyfriend Jason as she fights against the things that go bump in the night.
The video gives a little bit of information on Layla’s background, focusing on the night she and Jason came face to face with a couple of bloodsuckers. Using the telekinetic powers she gained during a laboratory accident, Layla's abilities make her a good candidate for anyone attempting to solo their way through Redfall. In combat, she can manifest protective umbrellas to shield her from attacks, a Lift to reach higher places, and a ghastly version of her old beau for when she's surrounded. A versatile fighter, Layla will likely be the first fighter I go with when I get around to paying the nightmare island town of Redfall a visit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdLeBCGh1PU
Developed by Arkane Austin, the same team that gave us Prey and Dishonored, Redfall will release on May 2, 2023, for Xbox Series X|S and PC, and it will be available at launch through Xbox Game Pass. Anyone who preorders the game or plays on Game Pass will receive the Vampire Hunting Pack, which includes a shotgun, a weapon skin, and the Blood Ravager Stake Weapon Attachment, which sounds dope as hell.

We have yet another Pokemon Scarlet & Violet distribution on the horizon, and this one is already technically included in the game: Palafin. As you may know, acquiring Palafin in Scarlet & Violet is done by evolving Finizen at level 38 while using the (online) Union Circle system. Some folks haven't done this yet (or are unable to), so perhaps this distribution will help!
Here's the full tweet from the Play Pokemon Twitter account:
"Tune in for the 2023 European International Championships live stream starting April 14th for some fantastic #PokemonVG & #PokemonTCG gifts! Learn how to add Palafin to your team roster and Miraidon ex to your digital Pokémon TCG collection."

The accompanying news article has a bit more info on how it'll actually be distributed, and a confirmation that it's based on competitive Pokemon player Gavin Michael's Palafin:
"Wait for the password to appear during the 2023 EUIC broadcast, then go to the Mystery Gift feature in your game and enter the password to receive Gavin Michaels' Palafin—you can even add it to your next competitive team! This password can only be used once per save data."

So that's it! Wait for the code to arrive and enter it. Seems easy enough! We'll update you when that time comes. Until then, you can find all the info you need on the Palafin itself below.
Promo Gavin Michaels Palafin info:
Poké Ball: Cherish Ball

Developed by Kenny Sun, who has previously worked on the "Tinder for aliens" game Tender: Creature Comforts, Mr Sun's Hatbox throws you into a world where you need to embark on dangerous, ridiculous missions to gather as many hats as you can. It's an intricate mission, one that you need to build your own base for and create an entire organisation to become the ultimate trilby tea leaf.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's weird that Road 96 has gotten a prequel, because it only came out about six months ag- what's that? A year and a half? Good lord. Still, it seems a slightly odd move, because Road 96 - a first person hitchhiking choose 'em up about the collective action of wayward teens bringing down a totalitarian government - doesn't really need a prequel. On top of that, Road 96: Mile 0 is a sequel to developer DigixArt's first game Lost In Harmony, a musical runner about skateboarder Kaito whose fiend Aya is dying of a terminal illness.
In Mile 0, Kaito and his family have moved to a small gated town called White Sands, in the 90s USA-adjacent dictatorship Petria, and made best friends with Zoe, who 96ers will remember as a recurring NPC from that game. Zoe is the daughter of an important minister and lives in the nice part of town; Kaito's parents are workers who are forced to live on the wrong side of the tracks. Through a combination of Road 96-style character-driven vignettes and Lost In Harmony-style rhythm action tracks, the two come to the conclusion they must leave White Sands. If you played Road 96 you kind of already know how Mile 0 has to end.

It's also been confirmed that Normal and Hard modes will include new checkpoints in the 'Tunnels' sections of the game, which should provide some respite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ask RPS returns today with a question that takes us right back to the beginning of how we all got here. Not in the scientific, evolutionary sense of all of human history, I should add, but rather how we, the RPS Treehouse, ended up writing about video games for a living.
The question comes courtesy of Bloodyhell, who asked: When did you know that you not only wanted to play games, but to write about what you played? And, does writing about games ever dampen your enthusiasm when you are dealing with deadlines and putting words on a page?
A sneaky double-part question, there, but both good questions nonetheless. So come and find out our collective origin stories, and whether any of us have cried tears of pain and regret over the years after turning our favourite hobby into an actual job.

It's a promise of all the myriad adventures to come. And despite some fundamental changes in genre and perspective, it's something that the team behind the upcoming Minecraft Legends has tried hard to preserve.
I recently was treated to the most in-depth look so far at Minecraft Legends, in an hour-long livestream which gave us all some much needed answers on what manner of beast Legends actually is. It's a curious blend of action adventure and RTS, one that shares Minecraft's focus on exploration, but guides the player down a stricter, simpler path of summoning friendly mobs and constructing defences to repel a Piglin invasion. This will likely be a solid introduction to the RTS genre for a lot of players, but I came away unsure about whether the game will have enough depth to keep its prospective playerbase's attention.

Bandai Namco has opened up a survey for Tales of Symphonia Remastered, asking fans and those who've played the game to provide them feedback on the release.
The beloved action RPG — which initially launched on GameCube in 2003 — made it to Switch back in February in a remaster based on the Japan-only PS2 port. Yet many reported multiple bugs, glitches, and issues with the remaster, with some calling it "worse than the original", comparing it unfavourably to the PS3 remaster.

Remedy’s time-bending Quantum Break - part superpowered shooter, part live-action TV show - has been delisted on Steam and The Microsoft Store. The game’s Steam page is still up, but it’s no longer available for purchase on PC or Xbox consoles. Publisher Microsoft had already confirmed the game would be “temporarily” removed from Game Pass (for console, it was never on the PC version) due to licensing issues, although there was no word on a removal from storefronts.

The code — which will be shared on stream — is for Palafin, the pure Water-type dolphin Pokémon (thanks, Serebii!) that's become pretty infamous for its Zero to Hero Ability. Swapping out the harmless dolphin, and then bringing it back in, reveals a muscular bi-pedal dolphin creature with huge stat increases. It's a menace, to say the least.

OatmealDome shared and translated the announcement from Nintendo's official Japanese Twitter account, and from 6th April 2023 to March 2025, those in Japan can contact Nintendo to get money back on their untransferred eShop credit, if they wish to do so. Obviously, if users have already amalgamated their balances from Wii U and 3DS to Switch, then the service is unavailable.

While we're sure many fans out there are already dreaming of adaptations like The Legend of Zelda and Metroid series, there is "probably nothing to announce in the near future" even though Nintendo Pictures is now officially a thing. This shouldn't be all that surprising to hear given how long it took Nintendo and Illumination to complete the Mario Movie. Here's Miyamoto's response in full:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The VP seems to have left following Stadia's downturn
Phil Harrison, the former head of Stadia at Google, has reportedly left the company.
A new report from Business Insider said that Harrison left Google around the time when it shut down the Stadia streaming service. Though no official statement's been made as of this writing, Harrison's LinkedIn does reflect the change, with his departure from Google marked at April 2023.
Harrison has been around the games industry for quite a while, working at both Sony and Microsoft over the years. He joined Google in 2018, taking the lead on the company's efforts to start up the cloud streaming service Stadia. Harrison even took the stage at GDC 2019 to unveil this vision for a streaming future.

Of course, we all remember how Stadia turned out. In 2021, Google shut down its internal development projects for Stadia, saying it would not be investing further in bringing exclusive content from its internal development team. At the time, Harrison cited the "exponentially" rising costs of creating "best-in-class games from the ground up."
Then, a year later, Google officially closed the curtain on Stadia. All hardware purchases made through the Google Store would be refunded, and in January of this year, the service officially shuttered. Harrison wrote in a blog post that the technology hadn't "gained the traction with users" that Google expected.
The clouds set
There's been no formal announcement, and no indication of what may be next for Harrison. As for Stadia, well, that's just about through.
Google recently told Axios in an interview that it's been selling a bundle of services to publishers, moving into the role of tech partner for live-service publishers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Stars is an RPG unabashedly inspired by the 16-bit era of Japanese RPGs. Even just looking at screenshots of the game recalls the best of the era, and that’s not an accident. Developer Sabotage Studio’s CEO and Sea of Stars’ creative director, Thierry Boulanger, is a huge fan of the genre and has been building towards making a game like this since he started building the fantasy world Sea of Stars and The Messenger takes place in during Elementary school.
Dozens of classic RPGs inspired Sea of Stars’ development, including Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, but we asked Boulanger to pick the most significant ones in the video below.

I’ve been writing up kusoge games on a near-weekly basis for two years now. I’m up to 65 articles, if my count is right. That’s a lot of bad. But you know what? Sometimes I enjoy it. I have some good memories of the bad games I’ve been sharing with you.
Kusoge is a portmanteau of the Japanese word “kuso,” meaning crap, and “gēmu,” for game. Crap game. However, the term "kusoge" has a certain degree of affection behind it, sort of like “Eurojank.” The game may be poorly made, it might be excruciating to play, but there’s something that makes it worthwhile. Maybe it’s broken in a hilarious way. Perhaps you can tell that the developer really tried their best in poor circumstances. Or maybe the design is such a trainwreck that you can’t look away. Whatever the reason, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Straw Hats are back
It looks like Luffy and the gang aren't quite done with their RPG escapades yet. Bandai Namco is working on a new story DLC for One Piece Odyssey called Reunion of Memories, and it's coming soon.
There's no indication of a date just yet, but today's teaser trailer lays out some of the narrative groundwork. Much like the story of One Piece Odyssey itself, Reunion of Memories looks to be diving back into the storied past of the manga series. Lim, the young woman from Waford who played a key role in Odyssey, looks to be the focal point again, as the team is contending with a Dark Lim doppelganger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LpM5Yc9-Io
In a message from the game's producer, Katsuaki Tsuzuki, it's said that one of the key points of this One Piece Odyssey DLC is the theme of "new hidden story with bonds." It will also focus heavily on battles, and the team recommends clearing the main story before tackling the DLC.
There will also be some new characters that weren't in the main game. The full roster isn't being confirmed yet, but Tsuzuki says you may be surprised to find other characters "where you least expect them." More details are on the way soon.
Additionally, since release, the team has been listening to feedback and player requests, some of which have already been implemented in patches since launch.
The quest never ends
One Piece is still one of those series that I'm aware of but have never really personally dug into. That said, Odyssey seems like it was an interesting exploration of the fiction, if nothing else. I certainly respect the effort to try and tell the tale in an RPG format.
For those hoping for deeper One Piece cuts in their Odyssey, I hope they get what they want when the Reunion of Memories DLC hits.

For a while, Nintendo kind of took a silent approach to the "Joy-Con drift" Switch hardware issues.

In other words, the UK and Europe are getting a little deal-sweetener as of this month.

Before I begin, let me discuss the article I planned to write about The Last of Us on PC.
I agreed to cover the PC port of this game because, somehow, in 2023, I do not know a single thing about The Last of Us. I've dodged all story spoilers, and I deliberately avoided the HBO series so I could play this game completely blind. My logic was this would be a refreshing take, especially with the impending decade anniversary of the original game’s release. I even workshopped some jokes about how I was too busy grinding Pokemon effort values at the time to play one of the most critically acclaimed video games ever made.
I mean, what else was I going to talk about? The performance?

As a quick history lesson for those who need it, the chainsaw controller was a novelty peripheral manufactured by NubyTech that launched alongside the original Resident Evil 4 in 2005. It retailed for $49.99 and, for all intents and purposes, was just a weirdly shaped GameCube controller. Despite some PR jargon explaining how the chainsaw controller will improve your Resident Evil 4 experience (it didn’t), this thing primarily existed for collectors to display as a vanity item.
If you'd like to learn more about this curiosity, I recommend you check out the excellent "Stop Skeletons From Fighting" video about the subject.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its launch last October, Overwatch 2 has added an additional post-launch hero in the form of Ramattra, as well as new maps, cosmetics, and more. Season 4, which starts next week, brings players the next post-launch hero in the form of Lifeweaver, a unique support character. In preparation for Lifeweaver's impending release, Blizzard released a ton of new details surrounding the nature-loving character.
Lifeweaver comes to the Overwatch team from Thailand and uses advanced biolight technology, which plays a major role in his abilities. As a result, his kit introduces some new mechanics. First up, his first primary ability, Healing Blossom, charges a luminescent flower, which he sends off to teammates. The longer he charges the flower, the more healing it grants to the recipient.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want it
I'm a pretty huge fan of Magolor in the Kirby mythos. He's formidable and cute! Just like Meta Knight, it's a fantastic combination of shonen-level anime appeal. Frankly, he needs his own game (but I'll have to settle for his own mode for now). However you feel about him, you can enjoy one of Kirby's greatest frenemies on a canvas bag as a My Nintendo US reward.
Here's the full description of the bag from Nintendo:
"This sturdy canvas pouch has a zipper closure, so it’s the perfect place to store treasured items. Featuring the powerful pink puff Kirby and the mysterious cosmic traveler Magolor."

So it's a bag.
It's 500 Platinum Points (which is on the median/low end for many rewards), so if you want it, get it! Although rewards generally stay up for a decent amount of time and occasionally come back in stock, nothing is guaranteed on My Nintendo: especially with supply chain woes continually rearing up.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

The New Game Plus update for God of War Ragnarok is live today, giving players a good reason to hop back in if they didn't get enough the first time around. It adds a pretty decent amount of content for a new run too, from new armor to enchantments and more.

This includes the Draupnir Spear, though it comes with a caveat. Sonic and Hex arrows will still require players to reach the point in the story where they become available.

Hello Games has both announced and dropped a new update for No Man’s Sky: update 4.2, Interceptor. Or maybe. The patch notes are live, but it's not on Steam yet.
This is the jillionth update on the path of redemption for No Man’s Sky, which famously launched in a horrible state. The Interceptor update brings with it a continuation to the game’s story while introducing corrupted planets. Hello Games also outlines a great deal of quality-of-life tweaks in its emoji-filled Tweet. There’s also a new class of ship! I’m going to show the Tweet here, but if you don’t like emojis, here’s a link to the patch notes.
https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1643599380531023874?s=20
I feel like it’s tiresome to keep bringing up that No Man’s Sky kind of sucked at launch. It’s so high profile, and 2016 was about a million years ago. It’s been a decent game for a lot longer than it was a disappointing one. However, I do wish more games got this treatment. What if they fixed Spore? What if Spore eventually became the game it was promised to be? That would have been pretty cool.
There’s also a new trailer for the Interceptor update, and I am so lapsed on this game that I have absolutely no context for what’s going on. But, with that said, I think I might reinstall it and see if I get sucked in this time.
https://youtu.be/REQmGvAtHu0
No Man’s Sky: Interceptor is available now for Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for an excuse to break out that Leviathan Axe for another adventure? As of today, there's a new update for God of War Ragnarök featuring a load of new content, all built around a robust New Game Plus mode.
New Game Plus opens up for anyone who has beaten the game, and all of your equipment and skills will come along for the ride. You also have access to all weapons, including the Draupnir Spear. However, it should be noted that areas requiring that spear to access will still remain closed until you reach the appropriate point in the story. For similar reasons, you also won’t start your new playthrough with Sonic or Hex arrows.
Several new armors show up. The most interesting is the Spartan Armor, which recalls Kratos’ look from the old days in the Greek Pantheon. While wearing it, you get no perk, no stats, and it’s locked at Power Level 1 – expect a challenge.
New Game Plus also features a new level cap, enchantments, and progression paths to improve your capabilities. Players can also tackle an expanded version of the Niflheim Arena, where you play as either Kratos or Atreus and bring along a variety of companions to help out.
Among several other additions and improvements, players can also take on a Black and White Render mode for a more cinematic playthrough.
It’s a notably large blast of new content that ensures that dedicated fans should have good reason to jump back in if they desire.
God of War Ragnarök released last November for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.

We managed to get a lot of these down into our review, but a movie of this size was always going to benefit from the ol' conversation treatment too, so that's exactly what we've done.
In the above video, Alex and Jim team up to discuss their thoughts on the movie, covering the story, animation, score and that all-important voice cast. While the chat steers clear of any major spoilers, the pair do discuss several plot points, so if you want to go in completely blind, we would say that this is best watched after you have seen the movie — that way, you can join in and see if you agree or disagree with our comments.

Italian-based studio Stormind Games came onto the scene in 2016 alongside the announcement of Remothered: Tormented Fathers, a decent survival horror game that eventually found its way onto the Switch. After its more critically panned sequel dropped two years later, the studio decided to pivot to another genre with a new project, featuring an original IP the company had more control over. This project is Batora: Lost Haven, an isometric action RPG set in an alien world. Batora launched late last year on other platforms and was met with middling reviews; now it’s come to Switch, and we understand why. Batora isn’t a bad game, but it isn’t an especially good one either.
Batora begins on a post-apocalyptic earth and places you in the role of Avril, a spunky teenager picking through the ruins of London with her best friend, Mila. Suddenly, Avril is whisked away to the alien planet of Gryja by two godlike icons of the sun and moon, who grant her their powers and name her as their champion. Avril is then charged with vanquishing the forces that destroyed Earth (and various other planets), absorbing a bunch of elemental energy from some planetary cores, and restoring balance to the universe. Or something like that.

Show me a game with a gun in it that looks like it could feasibly run on Windows 95, and all of the neurons in my brain will start to fizzle and spark. I just think they're neat, and their recent resurgance has been extremely nice for me, specifically. 


Unsuprisingly, then, I've been very excited to get my hands on Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun, a retro FPS by Auroch Digital set within the grim-dark universe of Warhammer 40k. A retro shooter where you play as a Space Marine is so obvious a pairing it's a wonder the concept has never been tackled before, to the point where the game's own marketing materials sort of pretend that it already was back in the 90s but everyone just forgot about it.

Based on that description, you’d expect some three-headed sea beast, incomprehensibly twisted and glowing with an otherworldly light, to be the game’s most supreme being. Nope. That title goes to the dog you rescue in one of the game's side missions, the developers have revealed.

Essentially an RPG/tower-defence hybrid. You might also remember that a sequel was announced before it somewhat fell off the map - you probably don’t remember since it happened a decade ago, to be fair. Regardless, Defender’s Quest 2: Mists Of Ruin is now ready to re-emerge into the public’s consciousness with a 2023 PC release. 


Developer Level Up Labs and publisher Armor Games have released a new trailer to mark the re-announcement:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An important Star Wars question is: what colour lightsaber would you have? The lightsaber is the mood ring of elegant weapons for a more civilised age. Jason de Heras, design director on Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, agrees with me on the purple blade (a colour introduced to the canon specifically because Samuel L. Jackson wanted it for his character in the prequels). "I was like, 'we gotta have a pink lightsaber blade'," says production director Kasumi Shishido. "So whenever I play I always stick with my pink saber."
Shishido tells me the dev team focused on improving on Jedi: Fallen Order for this sequel, and one of the bigger areas where they did that was customisation. "We knew we wanted to put more resources and effort into it," she says. "There's a lot more that you can do with Cal, with BD... and just within Cal, it's not just outfits you can customise, so I'm just really excited to see what players are going to do with it."

Crackshell has been showing off snippets of their upcoming Hammerwatch II for a few years now, but today it has been fully revealed. Modus Entertainment has announced that Hammerwatch II will be coming to PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch this summer.
2013’s Hammerwatch and its spinoff, 2018’s Heroes of Hammerwatch, are something of fixtures in the indie hack-and-slash space. They’re notable for their strong co-op elements. Hammerwatch II is boasting much of the same action, but including a day/night cycle and an “entirely new” mapmaker. The press release for this also touts “smarter enemy AI,” which sounds kind of weird for a Gauntlet-like.
https://youtu.be/levsLa-NLWI
The trailer dropped alongside the announcement shows off the good stuff: ghost wolves! Also, dragons and dungeons.
The release also says that a special edition of Hammerwatch II will be available at retail stores and digitally at launch. Titled Hammerwatch II: The Chronicles Edition, this will run you $40 American dollars and include “the original remastered Hammerwatch,” as well as character color palettes, “facial items,” and a voice pack. I have no idea if this is a new remaster of Hammerwatch and what that entails, or if it's just a re-release.
I never played Hammerwatch, but Steam thinks I really should since it features heavily on the store for me. It looks cool, but having one friend is exhausting for me. I can’t imagine what it would be like to have three friends.
Hammerwatch II will be dropping on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch sometime this summer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You'll also get an "update bonus"
Fire Emblem Engage is still trucking with updates and DLC (via the expansion pass system), and we're at the end of the line with this first (and potentially only) pass today, through the game's 2.0 update. Let's quickly break down the biggest aspects of Fire Emblem Engage 2.0.
The big thing is that Wave 4 of the expansion pass is now live. Titled Fell Xenologue, it includes new characters, maps, locations, and class types as a micro-expansion of sorts. This is on top of the prior three waves which really were micro-DLC, with smaller skirmishes and the ability to recruit spirits. 2.0 also adds more "update bonuses," which can be acquired upon entering the Somniel: the game's core hub.
The other tidbit (which is going to be either useless or a cool perk depending on how much you engage with Nintendo's mobile side) includes a "collaboration" with Fire Emblem Heroes, which basically involves bonus items. Bug fixes have also been deployed in a typically vague fashion.
There's nothing too exciting on offer here unless you're diving into Fell Xenologue. You can check out the full patch notes for Fire Emblem Engage 2.0 below.
Fire Emblem Engage 2.0 patch notes (full link)
Ver. 2.0.0 (Released April 4, 2023)
General Updates
Compatible with Wave 4 of the Expansion Pass.
Update Bonus has been added. You can receive items when entering the Somniel from Chapter 5 or later.
Collaboration content with the smartphone app “Fire Emblem Heroes” can now be downloaded for free from the Nintendo eShop.

You can receive items when entering the Somniel after downloading the data from the eShop.
Note that players who have already downloaded the bonuses from linking with “Fire Emblem Heroes” cannot download the content again.
Issues have been fixed to make for a more pleasant gaming experience.

Dig out your best crowd-fighting paraphernalia, as The Pokemon Company has announced that its staggeringly popular Pokemon Center London is returning to the British capital next week — From April 14-16, 2023, fans of the cuddly critters will have to opportunity to bag themselves exclusive merchandise, from clothing to plush toys, available only at the "pop-up" retailer.
The Pokemon Center London has appeared twice before within the city's walls, firstly during the fall of 2019, where poor planning and understated demand saw fans queuing for up to five hours daily to bag themselves shirts, hats, bags and, the centerpiece of the store, a plush doll of Pikachu dressed up as a Little City Gent. Following a postponement in 2020, (amidst the burgeoning COVID-19 pandemic), the pop-up store eventually returned in the summer of 2022, running alongside the Pokemon World Championships.

If you fancy making the trip to next week's opening, then you'll need to book yourself a timeslot over on the store's official website. This virtual queuing system hopes to eliminate the chaos of the 2019 event, though it should still be noted that merchandise will likely be sold on a first-come, first-served basis, with the more exclusive items selling out in double-quick time. You can just turn up on the store's opening days without warning, but you might find that you have to hang around for a little while before giving appropriate entry.
The Pokemon Center London is located at ExCeL London arena, and will be open from April 14 to April 16.

After numerous delays to an initial proposed launch date of December 2021 due to real-world events that Nintendo evidently felt made launching a light-hearted warfare game problematic, Wayforward's Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp is finally almost here. Featuring the classic Game Boy Advance campaigns from both Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising, there's enough turn-based tactical good times here to satiate even the hungriest of wannabe Sun Tzus, and the whole thing has had a right old spruce up in the graphics department.
We've been busy getting to grips with the first 13 missions from the Advance Wars campaign and it's been an absolute blast so far. There's been no great shakeup of the core gameplay here — these are genuinely timeless strategy classics we're talking about after all, a pair of almost flawless experiences and the sorts of games that don't really need to be messed with. However, some excellent new modes and a few modern bells and whistles have been introduced, making for an even slicker and more streamlined experience than the one you'll remember from back in ye olden days.

Tiny Thor will be using mini-Mjölnir to help him get through the Norse Realms of Midgard, Svartalfheim, and Niflheim, among many others. There are 30 in total, spanning the length and breadth of Norse myth. Mjölnir's magical abilities include ricocheting off of walls, speeding through the air, ground-pounding, and absorbing different elements to tackle some tough puzzles.

With a busy four days in Boston for PAX East, mine and Liam's brains were basically mush last week, so Rebecca - an absolute angel - graciously said she could host a special PAX East episode where she chats with Liam and me about the indies we saw on the show floor and try desperately to string together a coherent sentence. She also made bulletpoints of our entire chat so writing up the shownotes would be easier; we do not deserve her.
Saying that, our exhaustion doesn't stop us from kicking up a riot over the BAFTA Game Awards at the start of the episode. We then delve into our PAX East indie round up and, as always, we end with our current hyperfixations.

I was having an early sneak peak at Inkle's new game A Highland Song in an appointment booth with paper-thin walls and no ceiling. The speakers on my Steam Deck demo unit were really going "full pipe" that day, so I'd like to say a big awkward sorry to any of my neighbours in there who were trying to conduct actual serious business interviews. 
But also: A Highland Song is 100% a game that deserves to have its music cranked up to full, whether it's returning Heaven's Vault composer Laurence Chapman's soaring orchestral score, or Scottish bands Talisk and Fourth Moon's aforementioned folk music. The clue's in the name, after all, and after a spirited 30 minutes with it, I'm certain this will have Inkle fans singing from the hilltops.

Tours & Tournaments will introduce new events to the medieval grand strategy game including jousting events, grand weddings and the ability to send you ruler on a tour of their domain. All offer an opportunity to impress your subjects and rivals - or, I'd guess, to fall off your horse and die.

While that film has garnered a cult following in the decades since its theatrical release, it does little to truly pay homage to Nintendo's flagship franchise in the ways all the best film adaptations aspire. Fast forward 30 years, and Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo have finally delivered a cinematic adventure starring the iconic fraternal duo that is joyful, fun, exciting, and, perhaps most importantly, respectful of the source material.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Stadium, the classic 3D battler/minigame collection for the Nintendo 64, just got a Nintendo Switch Online release date. While the game's imminent arrival to the online service was announced at a Nintendo Direct in September 2022, today is the day we finally know when we can play it. Pokémon Stadium comes to Nintendo Switch Online Wednesday, April 12. As is the case with all N64 games, you'll need the expansion pack in order to play it. Check out the full trailer below.


While some fans may have hoped this port would include trading with Pokémon Home, they're unfortunately out of luck. The fine print in the trailer specifies that "Pokémon cannot be transferred to this game." That said, there is also a notable improvement: four-player online multiplayer will be available, so you can play Clefairy Says or Sushi-Go-Round with friends all over.
Nintendo Switch Online's expansion pack had a slow start, but its library has gradually snowballed into a much more significant package. In February, the service added a Game Boy Advance library, which included fan favorites like The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap and Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. A month later, Metroid Fusion joined the lineup. Meanwhile, the base tier of NSO got an update last month that added another small handful of titles. To see all the retro games currently available on the service, check out our complete list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Marek Markuszewski had finished working on The Witcher 3's Blood And Wine expansion, he wanted to go back to basics and make something by himself, Starward Industries' chief marketing officer Maciej Dobrowolski tells me at GDC. Something that would capture the same kind of cultural Polish heritage as The Witcher - originally adapted from Andrzej Sapkowski's six-strong series of novels - but that would take him on a new, more introspective kind of development journey. It took a while to find, but after a fateful encounter with an investor who'd just sailed across the Atlantic with only a copy of Polish sci-fi writer Stanislaw Lem's The Invincible for company, the signs were too good to ignore, Dobrowolski says. And after spending the best part of a year convincing Stanislaw Lem's son (and current rights holder) of the same thing, Markuszewski finally had his something - and a new partner to help him realise it.  
"People tell us, 'Don't fuck it up, this guy's important,'" Dobrowolski continues, and no wonder. During the course of our conversation, Lem is described as both a "national treasure" and "mandatory reading in high school" for Polish students, and his hallowed cultural status is something the team's "had to deal with" in bringing the book to life. Despite all this, though, Dobrowolski insists this "isn't a one-to-one adaptation" of Lem's interstellar rescue story gone wrong, and that fans of the book will still find some surprises on the surface of Regis III as they explore its strange canyons, caves and crash sites.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Normally, when a big game releases, I’ll test how it runs on PC, knock together a best settings guide, respond in the negative to an email that asks if it will run on a GTX 680, and we all move on with our lives. Not so with The Last of Us Part 1, which as you’ve probably seen, has launched in a technical state that’s bleaker than Joel’s face. The first few patches and hotfixes (more are planned) have made it somewhat less terrible on powerful desktops, but I’m sad to report that playing The Last of Us Part 1 on the Steam Deck is not currently worth your time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At last year's PAX East, we spent a lot of our time poking around the PAX Rising Showcase booth, which is a collection of indie games curated by PAX itself. Not only did we find a bunch of cool games to play, but we were also able to chat to the games' creators, as all Rising finalists are invited to attend in person to show their work to the public. 
This year, though, Rachel and I decided to go one step further. We interviewed the teams behind four of the eleven 2023 finalists, asking the developers behind Go-Go Town!, Paper Trail, Slay the Princess and Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action about their experience of bringing their games to PAX, what they learned along the way, and what it’s like to spend four days standing on your feet talking to thousands of attendees (spoilers: it’s really bloody tiring).

I don’t claim to understand whether this has something to do with “ray-tracing” or some manner of “screen space occlusion” or what have you – Digital Foundry, I am available for work – all I know is that there’s an option to crank up the gloss until you’re pretty much zooming around the galaxy in a big angry disco ball.

Rádi vám proto ukážou fotky, popovídají o zhlédnutých prezentacích a poreferují o berlínském hackerspace MotionLab. Ukážou vám také "Badge" - visačku, kterou dostali všichni návštěvníci akce a která obsahuje virtuální 4bitový procesor. Neuvěříte, kolik zábavy můžete zažít s instrukční sadou, která má délku instrukce slabých 12 bitů.

Ale nebojte - celá Virtuální Bastlírna rozhodně nebude jen o zážitcích z berlínského výletu. Jako pokaždé, budete jádrem diskuze Vy - účastníci! Pokud by ale nastalo ticho, Bastlíři z MacGyvera si nachystali dost novinek ze světa techniky. Jako obvykle se objevily nové procesory - ať už procesory fungující od 0.8 V z baterie nebo velmi levné ARMy od 40 centů (které ale nejsou výjimečně z Číny). Pak nový ST-LINK s velice šikovnou funkci pro embedded programátory. A Raspberry Pi Pico W bude mít konečně použitelný Bluetooth.

Samozřejmě jako vždy mají Bastlíři i plný pytel drobností a úsměvných zpráviček. Kupříkladu se dozvíte, jak se dá podívat neinvazivně do některých integrovaných obvodů, co je nového na Průša i3 MK4, jak prakticky uchovávat SMD součástky, jak se v Brně staví vesmírná loď nebo co je zač studentský vesmírný projekt SBUDNIC.

Ať už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat, chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl a nebo jste také byli na berlínské konferenci, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 5. dubna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

So here's a quick list of five more games I wanted to spotlight in written form while Liam's busy in the editing mines working on all the community videos we filmed (the first of which is out right now, chronicling the PAX Facebook group that takes a community photo every single year). It's very wholesome. We've got more community videos coming out this week, plus an article listing our absolute favourite games we played throughout the entire event, so keep your eyes peeled for those, too. For now, though, let's dive into some more indie highlights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a lot to be said for being consistent these days. After playing four hours of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor last week, I can tell you it is exactly what you probably already thought it would be: a competent, big-budget action-adventure sequel, well made by talented people, that isn't breaking the mould but expands upon the first game in the areas you liked best. If, like myself, you enjoyed Jedi: Fallen Order, this will probably be a solid follow-up for you. But if you were less well disposed towards that first game, you'd probably want to swap "consistent" for the word "predictable".

When Respawn Entertainment announced it was making a third-person action game in the Star Wars universe, many fans didn’t know how to react; the studio was critically acclaimed, but at the time, Respawn was purely known for shooters like Titanfall and Apex Legends. However, 2019’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order surpassed the expectations of many, delivering a terrific adventure full of exciting action and memorable moments. Now, with all the learnings of Fallen Order, Respawn is ready to top itself in hopes of creating another unforgettable Star Wars adventure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graham (RPS in peace) text me yesterday and, with little warning, launched into what were clearly pre-prepared paragraphs of complaints about games he'd tried playing in his free time at the weekend and not enjoyed. I shall draw a veil of discretion over the names of the actual games, but his chief complaint was that none of them had, actually, very robust design or tutorialising fit for purpose (i.e. teaching you how to play the game), especially for people who aren't able to give games their singular attention for hours at at time. I agree with him, although his attention is divided by, e.g., having a child in need of stimulation, and mine is divided by, e.g., being a child in need of stimulation.
It's probably turning my brain into cottage cheese, but I often do things at the same time as playing a game, like listening to music or a podcast. I understand that podcast games are sort of a genre now, but I've started doing it with regular games. Is this a me problem? Sure. Does it mean I want games to bring back that thing where NPC quest givers will just explain the quest again to you if you ask? 100% also yes.

Hello! I am the second imposter covering for our dear Ed, who is currently away on holiday in Japan (and I’m definitely not jealous at all). Let’s get into some good words, shall we?
Wired’s Megan Farokhmanesh interviewed Richard Hofmeier, the developer of Cart Life - a sobering game about three street vendors trying to make ends meet. Hofmeier tells the story of his decision to remove the game from Steam ten years ago and his reasons for bringing it back.
His time away from game spaces made him appreciate the spectrum of expertise his colleagues had in things he’d never done. It was humbling. “So many people have talent and passion that gets entirely overlooked,” he says. He loved working in games, but back when he released Cart Life he feared a career in the field could get too insular. “The most interesting art, to me, comes from outsiders,” he says. “I was a little bit scared of becoming an insider myself.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ARK 2 has been delayed until the end of 2024. The dinosaur survival sequel currently best known for having Vin Diesel in it, for some reason, was originally aiming for a 2023 release, but developers Studio Wildcard say they need more time.

To compensate, they're going to instead release Ark: Survival Ascended in August, a remaster of the original Ark: Survival Evolved that moves it over to Unreal Engine 5. That's the good news. The bad news is you can only buy it in a $50 bundle with the sequel (which won't be finished for at least a year), and that the original Survival Evolved servers will be switched off when Ascended launches.

        <updated>2023-04-01T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ScummVM project, a free and open-source software project that allows users to play classic point-and-click adventure games on modern systems, has announced a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence gaming.
Thanks to the innovative work of ScummVM developers, AI tools such as ChatGPT are now able to play point-and-click adventure games directly, without any human intervention.

"With this new capability, we hope to explore the potential for AI to learn, adapt, and evolve within the context of classic adventure games," said Eugene Sandulenko, lead developer of the ScummVM project. "Now AI can experience the joys of helping Putt-Putt join the parade or Adibou count things. We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans."
"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule."
Update: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:
Getting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.
Taking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream
Refusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first chapter of Videoverse took me right back to the early 00s last night. I can still remember sitting at the family PC in our living room, begging my parents for more internet time because I wanted chat to my friend on MSN Messenger. We had to buy hours of internet in those days, and between my young teenage self and my three brothers, we absolutely devoured those meagre weekly limits, always pleading for more, more, more as we became absolutely captivated by this new world of the online. 
Luckily, Emmett doesn't have to contend with such antiquated restraints in Videoverse, as his portal to the internet is built right into his enormous Nintendo DS-like home console, the Kinmoku Shark. As well as using it to play games reminiscent of old 16-bit classics, there's also a Nintendo Miiverse-esque social network on the Shark that Emmett uses to chat to his friends, post fan art of his favourite game, Feudal Fantasy, and feel part of something bigger. What hasn't changed since those early internet days, however (or indeed, the internet today) are the types of people he interacts with - there are trolls, of course, but there are also plenty of nice people here to support him, and the emergence of seemingly new user (and budding fan artist) Vivi quickly becomes the main subject of Videoverse's current free demo that's available as part of Steam's Storyteller Festival.

Tides of Foscari takes on a decidedly more whimsical tone and introduces eight new heroes. Three of them include the mage Eleanor, the fighter Maruto, and th thief/archer Keith. The DLC also introduces a new stage called Lake Foscari, 13 weapons, 7 musical tracks, and 21 achievements. 
The DLC launches April 13 for just $1.99. This news comes hot after Vampire Survivors’ big wins at the BAFTA awards, where it picked up trophies for Best Game and Best Design. You can learn more about Vampire Survivors by checking out our review here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the solemnity of Samwise Gamgee informing Mr Frodo that one more step will take him the furthest he's ever been from home, I recently realised that it'll soon be the longest we've gone without a new Life Is Strange game since the franchise debuted in 2015. I looked into it and sure enough, the current record-holder is the gap between the season one finale of Life Is Strange and the first episode of its prequel Before The Storm: 1 year, 10 months, and 12 days. That means that come mid-August of this year — specifically, the 14th, which marks the 683rd day since True Colors' Wavelengths DLC released — LIS fans will be leaving the Shire whether we like it or not.
I suspect that Life Is Strange: Steph's Story — the first prose novel tie-in to the franchise, released on March 21st — was commissioned with fans like me in mind. Fans who work out useless trivia like the above because they need something to occupy them when there's no new game on the horizon and they've played all the existing ones to death. Fans who know every character's canonical middle name and birthday. Fans who complain that it feels like they never have time to read any more, but nevertheless finished the novel and wrote a silly supporter post about it within ten days of publication. Of course I really liked Life Is Strange: Steph's Story. But will you, as a person whose relationship with this franchise is statistically guaranteed to be more normal than mine?

In this week's episode, The Electronic Wireless Show podcast talks all things mods - specifically, the ones that got real big and broke out from their respective source games. It's a chat that's been prompted by the developers behind Slay The Spire mod Downfall announcing their own brand-new game, Tales & Tactics.  
There's also a lot of undead fish chat, and Alice's plans for entertaining herself on an upcoming long-haul flight. And in James' hardware corner, the gang chat about Nvidia's comments on AI and crypto, as well as Ubisoft's AI writing software tool thinger.

Windy Meadow is set in the same fantasy world as Roadwarden and similarly presents a slice-of-life story that can branch out depending on your choices. This time, though, you’ll be following three protagonists in their interweaving day-to-day lives. 


Windy Meadow’s press release teases the stories of Vena, Fabel, and Iudicia: “Will talented huntress Vena depart the harmonious but harmless village and leave her family behind in pursuit of riches with a merchant guild? Can Fabel finally embrace his talents, ditching the figurative shackles of his difficult past as he chases his dream of becoming a famous bard? And will outsider and herbalist Iudicia take hold of her love life, choosing not to marry a man she doesn’t really love at the risk of leading a lonely future?”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PAX East is a great place to play the latest games, sure, but as anyone who's attended the event will tell you the games are just a small part of a wider medley of things to see and do. Last year we highlighted the show's thriving pin collecting scene, for instance, interviewing a bunch of Pinny Arcade enthusiasts about the hobby and discovering that physical badges are just a minor part of the appeal.


Encouraged by the lovely warm feeling making that video left in my belly, we set out to shine a light on other lesser-known parts of PAX East during our time at this year's show. This led us to discover the PAX East Facebook group, a community of over 8,000 members brought together through their shared love of video games, pop culture and PAX itself. The page is dominated by a striking banner image, a photograph that shows a large group of people crowded around the PAX logo that's a permanent fixture in the main hall of the Boston convention centre.


 Rachel and I found this photograph fascinating. Who were these people? Do they take this picture every single year? How did something like this start, and who was responsible for organising it in the first place?

On April 7, the invisible leader of the Cenation joins the game’s roster of celebrity athletes alongside Michael Jordan and Steph Curry. Given his well-documented freakish strength, Cena excels at hitting long drives and rocks a vaguely familiar red, white, and blue ensemble. Cena is set to compete at Wrestlemania 39 this weekend, challenging Austin Theory for the United States Championship. If he comes up short on Saturday, he can always bounce back and win the Masters instead. Or continue improving his K/D ratio in Fortnite. Cena is nothing if not versatile. 
PGA Tour 2K23 is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Xbox players can try the game for free on the weekend of April 6-9, while Steam players can play until April 10.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wildfrost is excellent at creating moments of triumph. Early on in my playthrough while I was still getting to grips with the game, I came face-to-face with a boss who got stronger when hit. Its card art had become bigger, juicier, more tauntingly malevolent, and easily could have taken out any of my team with a single hit. Thankfully, three of my team members were due to act one turn before it. The first chipped away a little of its health (its job was mostly healing) but the next doubled a stacked debuff that I had set up and turned the goliath into a giant bomb, and the effect of my two cards combined was just enough to trigger it. BOOM! My backline leader didn't even need to lift a single finger.
Playing with turn order and setting up synergies is a key part of how Wildfrost plays as a roguelike deck builder. Each individual card on the stage is part of a counter system, with both delaying and advancing them on the playing field being strategic choices. Some actions are free, like moving your cards around the stage or withdrawing them for healing, but playing cards out of your hand or shuffling your deck will pass the turn.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2023/03/30/netflixs-scott-pilgrim-anime-series-reunites-the-live-action-movie-cast"/>
        <updated>2023-03-30T14:52:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We learned last year that Scott Pilgrim is getting another encore in the form of a new Netflix anime series. If that wasn't exciting enough, we now know that the cast from the cult classic 2010 film is reprising their roles.
As reported by Deadline, the still-untitled Scott Pilgrim show will be computer animated by Japanese animation studio Science SARU (Devilman Crybaby, The Heike Story, Inu-Oh). Scott Pilgrim vs. The World director Edgar Wright returns as executive director, with Scott Pilgrim author Bryan Lee O’Malley and artist Bendavid Grabinski will serve as executive producers, writers, and showrunners. The plot of the graphic novels/movie centers on slacker musician Scott Pilgrim battling the seven evil exes of his new girlfriend, Ramona Flowers. 


The primary actors from the live-action film are higlighted in the trailer above, which include:
Michael Cera - Scott Pilgrim
Mary Elizabeth Winstead - Ramona Flowers
Kieran Culkin - Wallace Wells
Satya Bhabha - Matthew Patel
Chris Evans - Lucas Lee
Anna Kendrick - Stacey Pilgrim
Brie Larson - Envy Adams
Alison Pill - Kim Pine
Aubrey Plaza - Julie Powers
Brandon Routh - Todd Ingram
Jason Schwartzman - Gideon Graves
Johnny Simmons - Young Neil
Mark Webber - Stephen Stills
Mae Whitman - Roxie Richter
Ellen Wong - Knives Chau
Unfortunatley, the series currently still doesn’t have a release window other than “coming soon.” Scott Pilgrim has always had a strong relationship with video games; the graphic novels and film incorporate a bevy of gaming references. Of course, we’d be remiss, not to mention the much-beloved 2010 beat ‘em up Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which was remastered for modern consoles in 2021. 
Are you excited to see Scott Pilgrim return as an anime? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Sure, in reality, I’m slumped on my couch in a position that my body will give me payback for when I’m thirty, but in my fantasy, I’m a musical prodigy whose guitar licks are so epic it would make Slash cry. My joy for virtual jamming came as a direct result of playing hours and hours of Guitar Hero. Harmonix held my music taste in its death grip, and almost breaking my fingers on those flimsy plastic buttons trying to conquer Through The Fire And Flames is a precious memory of mine.
So yeah, I love a good guitar sesh, so when I saw that Hi-Fi Rush was about a wannabe rockstar that smacks evil megacorp robots with his guitar to a catchy rock OST, Tango Gameworks had my attention.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Live A Live became one of our favorite RPGs when it launched on Switch last year, and the celebrated remake is making the jump to PlayStation consoles and Steam on April 27. 
Additionally, there’s a free demo on PlayStation available today that lets you play three of the game’s eight stories. Live A Live was originally released in 1994 for the Super Famicom in Japan, but it hadn’t been localized for the West for decades. Directed by Takashi Tokita, one of the lead creative minds behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV, the game consists of eight very different short stories, each starring its own protagonist and featuring distinct gameplay mechanics and presentations. While the battle system is turn-based strategy, sometimes the game flips that on its head in unique ways.
Last year, Square Enix resurrected the title by giving it an Octopath Traveler-style HD-2D facelift, a rearranged soundtrack, and full voice-acting. You can pre-order the game on PlayStation and Steam to get a 20% discount. To learn more, you can read our review of Live A Live here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A short animated sequence kicks The Last Worker into gear, reeling off the game’s backstory with breezy efficiency. It’s an apt start for this first-person satire set in a fully-automated dystopia, in that it underlines a very human aptitude for artistic communication. It’s surprising, then, that as The Last Worker continues its story, it takes less graceful turns, electing for verbosity over economy. For a game that takes critical aim at the future of work, frankly, it’s all a bit laboured.
So what does happen in that opening animation? First, we see everyman hero Kurt among thousands of recruits arriving at the gigantic distribution centre of megacorp Jüngle (like Amazon, get it?), to spend their working lives plucking products off shelves to order. Before long, though, any drop in output sees the employees themselves plucked off and given the boot, to be replaced by robots. As the numbers dwindle, top-performer Kurt remains steadfast, and even finds love among the boxes with a fellow product picker. But when she gets pregnant and quits, he stays behind, living full-time in the warehouse. Years pass. Jüngle smothers the entire retail market, and Kurt becomes, well, the last worker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yasunori Mitsuda has worked on dozens of games since the mid-90s, but he is best known for his work on Chrono Trigger. The story of how he came to work on the game is surprisingly straightforward. "[Sea of Stars creative director Thierry Boulanger] was like, ‘We have a contact that is in touch with all these people. And he just kind of reached out, and [Mitsuda] liked what he saw. And so he's like, 'Yeah, I would, I would love to be a part of this’,” Sea of Stars lead composer Eric W. Brown says. “There’s no words to describe this. Like, it’s… we literally got the guy.” Mitsuda committed to creating about 10 tracks for the game, and the process has been smooth.

On paper, Crime Boss: Rockay City is bombastic, star-studded, and promises a city-spanning adventure about a criminal organization’s rise to the top. The actual game, however, is anything but. The gameplay is unbalanced, buggy, repetitive, and boring. The celebrity-filled cast is exciting at first glance, but crude and humorless writing weighs down the already-phoned-in performances of characters voiced by Michael Madsen, Michael Rooker, Vanilla Ice, and more. The single-player roguelite campaign lacks any of the genre’s typical hooks, and bu…]]></summary>

There was a big focus on co-op games and time trial demos in this year's cohort, with nearly every stand having some sort of whiteboard pinned up that was constantly being scrubbed out with new fastest lap times and corresponding visitor names. There was also lots of friendly hooting emanating from them as well, as mates and strangers attempted to co-ordinate their gaggles of limbs to steer various game characters in the right direction. 
It was excellent fun, and I sampled a bunch of games that used toasters, intricate pulley systems, papier-mache tree stumps, bike wheels and more in place of your typical controllers and mice and keyboard. There were also plenty more I didn't get to try out, mainly due to time, and you can see the full list over on GDC's website. For now, though, here are some personal highlights of what I saw, including the largest bowler hat I think I've ever seen in my life.

Not a fan of trapping said friends into small balls, only letting them out to fight gangs and other Godlike creatures? Well, Cassette Beasts might be the game for you. It's a Pokémon-like where you’ll still be beating up wildlife creatures in turn-based combat, but rather than capturing them, you record their likeness on the titular tapes and then transform into those same street cone-wearing crabs and metal-clad wolves. It looks like an energetic, nostalgic romp, and it’s coming to PC and Game Pass on April 26th.

The story sees Frey Holland follow a mysterious voice that leads to her being sent back in time 25 years before she first stepped foot in Athia. She arrives at the Purge of Rheddig, the battle that caused Athia’s collapse and pushed the Tantas to madness. Frey must now fight to save this era of Athia, and she has backup in the form of Tanta Cinta. Frey gains new magical powers, including tag-team-focused abilities that utilize Tanta Cinta’s talents. The DLC also features new environments for players to scale using Frey’s parkour skills. 
Forspoken: In Tanta We Trust is a paid expansion that launches on May 26. Those who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game can play it three days early, on May 23.

It's been more than eight years since Tekken 7 arrived in arcades across the globe. While the console version didn't hit for another two years, the gap since that seventh entry represents the largest distance between two mainline entries since the series began in 1994. Bandai Namco used that time to evolve the experience, adding several new characters by way of DLC en route to the announcement of a highly anticipated eighth entry.

More specifically, Atlas Fallen will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on August 10. This news comes after previewers recently went hands-on with the game as part of a press event and after the game was showcased at PAX East, which took place last week. As for why Deck 13 is delaying Atlas Fallen, the team says it needs more time with the game.

Deck 13 also revealed that this delay will allow the team to include a full German voiceover for Atlas Fallen.

A gameplay trailer shows off Jun’s expert use of Kazama-style martial arts to cleanse opponents of their evils. That translates to beating the snot out of them if that wasn’t obvious. We also see a brief reunion between Jun and her former lover, Kazuya, and it goes about as well as you would expect from a mother meeting the father and repeat attempted killer of their son. 


For those keeping count, here’s the list of confirmed fighters thus far:
Jack-8
Jin Kazama
Kazuya Mishima
King
Lars Alexandersson

The Legend of Zelda series producer, Eiji Aonuma, revealed this during today's Tears of the Kingdom gameplay showcase. He then jumped directly into the game, showing off more than 10 minutes of new gameplay. Aonuma begins this demonstration by showing how Link can get up to the Sky Islands floating above Hyrule. He uses the "Recall" power, which rewinds an object's movement, to reverse a fallen rock's descent. He's able to reach one of the floating sky islands using this new power. 
After fighting an enemy up here, we learn that weapon durability, a hotly debated feature of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, is back. But now, you can use Link's new "Fuse" ability to create brand-new weapons. Aonuma showed us ho…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[E3 2023 has taken another hit, as Ubisoft has confirmed it will not have a presence at the show. In a statement to Video Games Chronicle, the publisher reveals that it will instead hold its own live presentation on June 12 in Los Angeles. 
The publisher statement to VGC reads “While we initially intended to have an official E3 presence, we’ve made the subsequent decision to move in a different direction, and will be holding a Ubisoft Forward Live event on 12th June in Los Angeles. We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon.”
Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated in February that the company would commit to attending “if E3 happens”. If that's the case, this news certainly doesn’t bode well for the fate of what’s supposed to be E3’s big return. 
As for what Ubisoft could show at its event, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Crew Motorfest, and (maybe) Skull and Bones are slated to release this year. Other announced projects include the long-quiet Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia remakes, a multitude of new Assassin’s Creed games, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. A rumored follow-up to Immortals Fenyx Rising could also make an appearance.  
Ubisoft joins Nintendo on the list of major publishers that have declined to participate in this year’s show, following a previous report that Microsoft and Sony plan to follow suit. E3 is largely organized by ReedPop this year and will take place June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The event will open its doors to fans and press, with separate attendance days for each. It will be the first in-person event since 2019.

The game’s online modes will later become unplayable as developer Player First Games plans for a relaunch early next year. 
In a developer blog post, Player First Games CEO Tony Huynh explains that since MultiVersus launched in open beta (yes, open beta) last July, players have offered a ton of feedback. The studio feels that the only way to properly implement improvements based on these fan requests is to shut the game down temporarily. Huynh writes,

It was a special edition that came with a code for Wind Waker HD and a gamepad emblazoned with a golden Triforce. For my brother and I, 11 and 13 at the time, respectively, this was a massive deal; we’d spent the last year seeing Wii Us at friends’ houses, yearning for our own, and struggling to explain the difference between it and our current Wii to our parents.
But while it was valuable to us, the Wii U struggled to sell and has ultimately gone down as one of Nintendo’s most disappointing consoles. Today, the system’s eShop shuts down forever, permanently closing a chapter of Nintendo’s history.

Despite the fact that we've gotten multiple trailers over the past few months, Nintendo has yet to reveal any clip of gameplay longer than a few seconds, and every new glimpse seems to raise more questions than it answers. What are those strange vehicles? Does Link have a new paraglider? And why does the game cost $70? Whether or not tomorrow's showcase addresses those questions, we'll all find out when Tears of the Kingdom releases on May 12.
We'll be live streaming our reactions to the 10 minutes showcase on Game Informer's Twitch channel.]]></summary>

To know that a game heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger will feature music from the man behind its score is exciting. Still, it is worth being excited for the soundtrack that Mitsuda will not be directly involved with, as well.
The majority of Sea of Stars’ soundtrack is in the hands of the talented Eric W. Brown, who also composed the soundtrack for The Messenger. Brown’s musical history started with playing drums in metal bands. “I've been a drummer since I was a kid and I'm still a drummer now, but, you know, I got into music production via chiptune essentially,” Brown says.  Around 2006 he decided to focus on making music on his own in the chiptune genre, primarily on Game…]]></summary>

The news comes from Polygon's interview with Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global. According to Rosen, The Last Ronin video game will be a single-player action role-playing title in the vein of the Norse-themed God of War series. Like the story it adapts, the game will feature a mature tone. The game’s developer has not been named, and the project is years away from release. 
The Last Ronin was published in 2020 as a five-issue mini-series by IDW. It takes place in a dark futuristic New York, where three of the four turtles have been killed. The surviving turtle, whose identity is revealed at the end of the first issue (we won’t spoil it), dons a black mask and seeks revenge by fighting crime using both his and the weapons of his fallen brothers. 
It’s a cool (and very grim) story if you haven’t read it, and we’re excited to see it translated into a game. Rosen also mentions in the same interview that Paramount sees opportunities to create different types of TMNT games that target young and adult audiences. 
The Turtles are enjoying quite the renaissance lately thanks to the launch of the well-received beat ‘em up Shredder’s Revenge last year, the nostalgia trip of the Cowabunga Collection, a Shredder-themed Call of Duty pack, and even a new animated film coming to theaters this August.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daedalic Entertainment revealed The Lord of the Rings: Gollum way back in 2019, announcing that it would be released in 2021. In 2021, however, it was delayed to 2022. In May of last year, Daedalic revealed Gollum would release in September but then, in July, announced it had been delayed once more. Now, today, Daedalic has revealed that Gollum will finally be released this May. 
More specifically, Gollum will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on May 25. There will be a Switch version of the game, but Daedalic says it's planned for later this year. Alongside today's news, Daedalic has released a new story trailer. Check it out below: 


"The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is a story-driven action adventure," a press release reads. "Embark on a perilous journey as Gollum, chasing the only thing that is precious to you. Climb, leap, and sneak your way past dangers or into advantageous spots. Gollum is skillful and sly, and torn by a split personality. It is up to you to decide whether to yield to the darker side of Gollum or trust the kinder gentler hint of Sméagol." 
Check out some new screenshots from the game below: 

For more about The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, check out this trailer highlighting the game's supporting cast and then check out this trailer featuring some of the game's stealth-based gameplay. Watch this trailer showing off the game's parkour gameplay after that.

Its specialty is developing immersive sims, a niche it’s helped cultivate since 1999. On May 2, Arkane releases its next project, Redfall, an open-world first-person shooter.
I’ve been a fan of Arkane Studios’ rich single-player worlds for years. Naturally, I had questions about Redfall’s position in the developer’s portfolio. However, after interviewing Studio Head Harvey Smith and playing the game for 90 minutes, I have the answers I was looking for – and I’m excited to share it all in this week’s episode of The Game Informer Show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Sonic Origins celebrated Sonic the Hedgehog's birthday by gathering Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD in one place with new features and some added bonuses. Despite some shortcomings, the compilation remains the best official way to experience those classic games from Genesis and Sega CD three decades following their original releases. Today, Sega announced the bundle is about to get better through Sonic Origins Plus, a premium upgrade that arrives a year after the collection's initial launch.
Sonic Origins Plus brings forward all the features of Sonic Origins delivered last year – Classic Mode, Anniversary Mode, widescreen support, added story animations, a virtual museum, and more – while adding a bunch of new content. First up, Sonic Origins Plus adds all 12 Sonic Game Gear games to the museum.
The full list of Game Gear games getting added is listed below.
Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine
Sonic Blast
Sonic Chaos
Sonic Drift
Sonic Drift 2
Sonic Labyrinth
Sonic Spinball
Sonic the Hedgehog
Sonic the Hedgehog 2
Sonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble
Tails Adventure
Tails' Sky Patrol
On top of that, Amy joins the roster of playable characters in the Genesis and Sega CD titles (Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD). One of the strangest exclusions in the original Sonic Origins release is also rectified, as Knuckles will become playable in Sonic CD. Sadly, this first press release does not make any mention of restoring the replaced music in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.


Sonic Origins Plus arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 23. If you don't already own the initial release of Sonic Origins, the digital version of Sonic Origins Plus costs $40. The physical version, which includes a 20-page artbook and reversible coversheet with new art, also costs $40. If you already own Sonic Origins, you can upgrade to Plus for $10. For more on Sonic Origins, check out our review from the base compilation here.]]></summary>

The real-time tactical shooter pits a squad of marines against dozens of deadly xenomorphs, though we hadn't seen any gameplay footage until the release of a new video today.
A gameplay commentary video walks players through the basics, in which players command a team of marines to investigate a xenomorph outbreak on Moon Lethe. You’ll issue commands for teammates to attack or execute skills and can also slow time during firefights to select orders. However, your squadmates can perish permanently, but you can raise your survival odds by outfitting soldiers with various weapons and upgrades to ensure the best team composition.


Aliens: Dark Descent is being devleoped by Tindalos Interactive, makers of the Battlefleet Gothic: Armada series, and will be published by Focus Entertainment. It arrives on June 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

Night Dive Studios is currently led by Stephen Kick and Larry Kuperman and is both a development studio and a publisher. It has published more than 100 games, and will add its remake of System Shock to that list on May 30 (on PC). Atari says a key to the success of Night Dive Studios is its proprietary KEX engine that makes classic games playable on modern hardware. Considering Atari is a retro company, and one that just acquired 12 classic retro games, it's easy to see what Night Dive Studios can do for it.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/03/23/redfall-microsoft-canceled-ps5-version-after-bethesda-acquisition-arkane-director-says"/>
        <updated>2023-03-23T12:14:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arkane was developing a PlayStation 5 version of its upcoming first-person vampire shooter, Redfall, before Microsoft acquired Bethesda in 2020. However, following the acquisition, the PS5 version of the game was canceled by Microsoft, according to Arkane director Harvey Smith in an interview with IGN France (translated by IGN). 
Discussing this with IGN France, Smith said, "We got bought by Microsoft and that was a huge sea change. They said, 'No PlayStation 5. Now we're gonna do Game Pass, Xbox and PC.'"


Smith said Arkane didn't mind the decision, even if Redfall was originally meant to release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. 
"Support from Game Pass and having to worry about one less platform, one less complexity," Smith told IGN France. "And Game Pass has a ton of people that can play. It could be our biggest game ever because of the 30 million Game Pass [members] or whatever that number is." 
News of this canceled PS5 version of Redfall doesn't come as much of a surprise. When Redfall was revealed during a 2021 Xbox and Bethesda E3 showcase, it was revealed as an Xbox console exclusive. And considering it's par for the course for companies like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo to keep their first-party releases off of competitor consoles, it's also not surprising Microsoft opted to make Redfall an Xbox exclusive after it acquired Bethesda. 
A spokesperson for Microsoft responded to this story, providing the following statement: 
Redfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2. 
For more about the game, watch the latest Redfall story trailer that introduces some of the vampiric big bass and then watch this gameplay trailer that invites you out to a bloody night on the town.
