        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Genshin Impact  comes with several banners you can wish on to obtain rare characters and weapons. Each banner is a different type of slot machine, and understanding their probabilities is key to avoiding disappointment.


This article is part of a series on Genshin Impact’s convoluted gacha system. It’s important to understand exactly what you’re getting into when you engage with predatory gambling mechanics like these. By knowing your chances, you can get a realistic idea of what to expect from your pulls and make smarter decisions when spending your precious Primogems.

By this point, auto-catchers aren't new to the Pokémon GO community. These generally pocket-sized devices catch 'mon and spin PokéStops while your mind is on other things, leaving you to focus on the Battles, upgrades, and Raids whenever you return to the app.
Niantic has its own range of companion devices like the catchily-named Pokémon GO Plus+, but the third-party market is huge, with each developer working to add another gimmick to make its product the very best (like no one ever was).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the best things about Fields of Mistria is the fact that you’re never short of something to do, a new challenge, or something to find. One of the things you’re going to be collecting a lot of while exploring is Bugs, and none are more rare than the five Legendary Bugs. 


As with Legendary Fish, there is a specific Legendary Bug which spawns in each season. As well as this, there’s one Legendary Bug which can spawn during Spring, Summer, or Fall, although that doesn’t make it easier to find. 


Advice for catching Bugs in Fields of Mistria


Unlike with Fish, Bugs don’t tend to have specific locations where they spawn. They can show up pretty much anywhere in the overworld of Mistria and you need to keep your eye out for them during times when their spawning conditions are met.

In addition to event banners, Genshin Impact also has a permanent standard banner. This doesn’t rotate, but it occasionally receives additions to its prize pool. If you're new to Genshin Impact's gacha system, you might want to start by learning about the standard banner.

All event banners use pink/blue Intertwined Fates as their pull currency. One Intertwined Fate equals one pull on any of the event banners. You can also use Primogems to pull on event banners, either by converting them …]]></summary>

The Summer of Rewards began on August 2 and is running all the way until September 30, with rewards obtainable for 13 games.

To start off, it’s highly recommended to complete the Drunken Pig’s quest. At the end of it, you’ll be rewarded with the Wind Tamer Vessel. It can replace the Fireproof Mantle that was obtained from the previous chapter.

Playtonic Friends and SkyDevilPalm's retro-style racer Victory Heat Rally was originally set to launch simultaneously on PC, Switch and mobile this winter, but, in a new statement from the publisher, it looks like that is no longer the case. While the game will be coming to PC and mobile (via Crunchyroll Game Vault) on 3rd October, the Switch version will now follow "at a later date".
According to the statement, the Switch delay came about due to "some unforeseen difficulties with development", though the publisher promises that a Switch announcement is "not far behind", so keep those engines running.

Pilestedt left his former position as the CEO to take up a more hands-on approach to developing Helldivers 2 as the new CCO. While the game hasn't really made good on all of its promises from that point onwards, Pilestedt has remained one of the community's favorite Arrowhead developers due to his penchant for discussing upcoming content and explaining the reasoning for why Helldivers 2 is going in the direction it's been going.

Even if you do really like it, it's certainly a far cry from what Todd Howard (and, indeed, Bethesda on the whole) was pushing for in terms of the next big thing from the Skyrim studio.


However, the team is sticking with it, and the first major DLC for the game is coming soon. Shattered Space  (which launches September 30) will have a shorter, more focused narrative, while also leaning towards a horror vibe and, according to a recent post from Xbox Wire, it'll be akin to "classic Bethesda."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Bungie continues its problem-ridden development of the extraction shooter Marathon reboot, the classic Marathon trilogy is now completely released on Steam, now that Marathon Infinity is out and about. All thanks to the efforts of the Aleph One team, we now get to enjoy classic Marathon without any fuss.


Whereas Marathon and Marathon 2: Durandal at least pretended to be simple, straightforward run-and-gun shooters at face value, Marathon Infinity throws any pretense of common sense right out the window with its ridiculously broad, time-hopping main narrative. It's phenomenally weird, and now that Infinity is properly available on Steam, you, too, get to try to make sense of the game's hard-hitting final screen. It's an absolute hoot, I promise you that.

Trailered this week at Gamescom 2024, it's the fifth installment in the hitherto mobile-focussed Nikki series and it's seemingly going down a storm, with over 12 million pre-registrations so far (albeit, many of them motivated by the prospect of collectively unlocked in-game bonuses). It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns. Here's that trailer.

However! Turns out you’re trying to kill the queen. Yep, that’s, uh, that’s pretty punk.

So many Halo books


The world of Halo opens itself to a lot of expansion, looking at the prelude, the histories of both races, the flood, and the list goes on. Because of this, there are a lot of books expanding on the universe. It's understandably overwhelming, so start with his definitive list of Halo literature reading order and go from there.

Well, it sounds like MySims could be making a comeback. Spotted by ResetEra user --R (via GamingLeaksAndRumours subreddit), listings for a Switch version of the game have appeared on European retailers Virtex and World of Games along with a 19th November 2024 release date.

Nintendo is ramping up the marketing for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom ahead of its 26th September launch. The latest teaser serves as a whistle-stop tour of the Faron Wetlands region, giving us a closer look at the new location.
You might remember this region making an appearance in Nintendo's earlier 'Traversing Hyrule' trailer, where we learnt that the area was home to some hungry Deku Scrubs — though that was about all we saw. Today's look (shared to Twitter by @NintendoUK) doesn't contain any new information, per se, but it does give a closer look at the environment and some new footage of the beasties we can expect to find there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my formative video game moments is the final mission of Psygnosis cyberpunk flight sim G-Police. (It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - "metaphor" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.
The technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins all have one thing in common: they've got a Discovery mode, which replaces murdering with learning. You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh "Friar Tuck" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).
This is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.

Moreover, Walker Brain is also used to build Explosive Drones, which are temporary buffs that increase a frigate’s combat capabilities by 10 points for the next expedition.

You will need to complete the first breadcrumb quest to head to the new area in which the expansion takes place. Here is how to start The War Within campaign quest in WoW.

How to start The War Within quest in WoW


As long as you are a Level 70 character in World of Warcraft, simply logging in will cause the breadcrumb quest, properly titled The War Within to pop up.  If you open your Quest Log, you should see the quest at the top under your Campaign quests.


Some players who were logged in to World of Warcraft at the time that The War Within quest went active indicated that they didn't automatically receive the breadcrumb popup notification for the new expansion quest. If you don't automatically receive The War Within quest in WoW, try simply logging out, completely closing World of Warcraft, and then relaunching and logging back in.


Re-logging in seems to fix the bug that causes The War Within campaign quest to not automatically start.


How to complete The War Within quest and reach Isle of Dorn


For the first The War Within quest, you need to head to the sword that's embedded in Azeroth located in Sillithus. It's the same place you started your journey in the Battle for Azeroth expansion. Check your inventory for a scroll that will automatically teleport you to where the quest starts. Head under the sword and speak with Magni to continue The War Within quest and progress through the quest objectives.


After finishing this initial quest, you will head to Dalaran to complete the introduction to The War Within. Upon completing this introduction questline you will end up at The Isle of Dorn and continue your journey in WoW The War Within.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embarking on your Minecraft upgrade journey begins with the creation of an enchanting table setup, a pivotal step that opens the door to the best tools. While acquiring low to mid-range gear is straightforward, reaching the highest tier necessitates a specific building arrangement. We're here to explain how many bookshelves you need for the Level 30 enchantment in Minecraft.


How many bookshelves do you use for level 30 enchantments in Minecraft?


You can unlock Level 30 enhancements in Minecraft by placing 15 bookshelves within a one-block radius of the table. The build must also be on a two-block level, as any shelves placed on the third level will not count towards it. To give you an example, the setup on the left won't work (bookshelves are on the third block), but the one on the right checks out:


Image by Destructoid


The bookshelves basically have to be as close to the enchanting table as possible. Nevertheless, you can still place them one block away to give you room. If you need some ideas on how to build it, you can check out our guide on the best enchanting table setups.


Although the build helps set the stage for the enhancement, you'll still need to take a few more steps to get better materials. The maximum tier requires three lapis lazuli and a Level 30 experience rank. Go deep into the mines to acquire the lapis lazuli, which can also help you gain XP for your levels.


To earn more XP in Minecraft, look for Monster Spawners in the mines and defeat hordes of enemies. It'll take some time to reach the higher ranks, so keep mining and fighting to farm a ton of experience points.


Once you've tackled the requirements, place your desired tool in the enchanting table. You'll gain unique buffs like the highly durable Unbreaking III or the damaging Smite V. However, enchantments are completely randomized, so it all depends on the luck of the draw.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From day one of its early access release, Fields of Mistria has been praised for its performance on Steam Deck. Users reported from the moment the game was available to play that it ran seamlessly. 


Now, three weeks into the life of the game, Fields of Mistria has achieved Steam Deck verification, so if you’ve been holding back on taking Mistria and its residents on the move with you due to lack of official backing, you’ve no longer got any excuses. 




Thanks to this move, Fields of Mistria joins other cozy staples like Disney Dreamlight Valley, Stardew Valley, and Unpacking, which you can all take on the move with you. On the other hand, if you want to play without moving at all, the Steam Deck is also perfect for that, as long as you keep it next to your bed. 


Obtaining Steam Deck verification means that the game performs as well on the handheld as it does on any other PC at default settings. With Fields of Mistria being in the style that it is, you can expect it to run just as well on Steam Deck as it does on any PC, regardless of settings.


On a personal note, this does prove problematic for me, as I recently said the fateful words “if Fields of Mistria gets verified, I think I might need to get a Steam Deck”. Well, true to my word, it’s now on order, and I can’t wait to visit Mistria on the handheld.

The founder of Canari Games (LUNARK) recently released his latest work, and it's a punchy little sendup to The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening and other portable entries that delivers on its pint-sized promise.

Anyone who has ever played a portable Zelda game will find welcome familiarity in the opening scene of Castaway. When we first gain control of our plucky little hero, he finds himself coming to on a desolate beach. Unlike Link, though, he ended up there after his spaceship plummeted from the sky. Not only was his ship busted, but some rogue pterodactyls saw fit to nick his key items and — plea…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The deadly Backstab Kills have appeared in many objectives, including Weekly Challenges and weapon unlocks. But, since the elimination doesn't have a description, it can be confusing to understand. If you want to know what to do, we'll explain what Melee Backstab Kills are in Modern Warfare 3. 


MW3 Melee Backstab Kills, explained


Melee Backstab Kills are eliminations that must be performed behind an enemy Operator using a Melee-based weapon. Regular guns won't work with this tactic; therefore, you must use tools like Karambit, Gutter Knife, or Sledgehammer.


Performing the Melee Backstab Kills without the proper preparations will be challenging. To help you through this, use Tactical Equipment such as Stun and Smoke Grenades. Cast out this equipment in battle and try to sneak up behind the enemy while they're in a vulnerable state.


Screenshot by Destructoid


To be extra sly, utilize Covert Sneakers or Dead Silence to remove an Operator's footstep sounds. This will make it easier for you to sneak up on the enemy without being detected. You can also equip Ghost T/V Camo to get you off UAVs, Heartbeat Sensors, and enemy radar sources. Without these items, you'll be pretty easy to spot, as running can get the attention of enemy Operators.


Use small maps to earn the Melee Backstab Kills in Modern Warfare 3 quickly. I like going into Shipment for this since everyone tends to get caught in the chaos from its compact size. Then, when the opponent is preoccupied with someone else, you can sneak your way in for the elimination.


Completing this task earns you various rewards, depending on the season. For example, Season 5 Reloaded's Spear requires players to get three Melee Backstab or Special Zombie Kills. It also comes up a lot in Weekly Challenges, so keep it in mind for future references. And, if you're confused about any more Call of Duty terms, be sure to check out our guides on Clean and Gun-Butt Kills.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Throughout the years, particularly in 2023 and 2024, we've experienced some of the best (and worst) gaming has to offer, from role-playing games that set the standard for years to come to small indie titles that lay comfortably in our hearts and tug at the heartstrings. We're also continuing to see the rise of expansions for some of the most famous games out there, from World of Warcraft: The War Within to Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail. 


With all that said, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer number of game releases as the months go on, especially if you're partway through a playthrough and learn that more games are launching the same week. Whether you're looking to plan ahead or tell others about an upcoming release, we've got a complete list of every game releasing in 2024 and tho…]]></summary>

This is also revealing to me how little I know about how the Heroes of Might and Magic games play. I saw my cousin play one of the games way back in my youth, but that’s about it. I know more about its history than what it’s like to experience one of the games.


As such, I’m going to have to take the press material’s word on the fact that it’s supposed to be a return to form. How did the later games compare to the earlier ones? Olden Era bills itself as a prequel and is said to take place on a continent that wasn’t explored in the series. They say, “We’ve combined the core elements of classic Heroes…]]></summary>

One of the best parts of the Character Studio is the inbuilt Photo Mode, which allows you to to take almost photo-realistic shots of your created characters. The graphics are stunning and if you take some time, you can get some truly beautiful photos that wouldn’t look out of place in a photo album. 


There’s a lot of settings which can be tweaked and played with in order to make the most of Photo Mode in inZOI, and I’ve spent approximately 10 hours over the last couple of days getting to grips with everything that’s currently available as part of the demo.

The box includes 25 exciting new kingdom cards and introduces prophecies, omens and shadow cards, all of which shake up the core mechanics of the game in fun ways.


Fans can also purchase and play Rising Sun right now using Temple Gate Game’s digital version of the game, available on mobile devices and Steam.

During the Direct, we get a look at a variety of interactive experiences such as an Ultra Machine Pitching experience, a shooting gallery with the Zapper and Super Scope, and more. Arguably the most exciting of these interactive experiences is a room full of giant Nintendo controllers.

We've heard of some fun development stories over the years, but we think this might be one of the best ones yet — Nintendo created an internal social media-like platform to help streamline development on the absolutely massive The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. (Thanks, GamesRadar!).
Speaking at the Computer Entertainment Development Conference in Japan (via GameWatch, translated by Automaton) director Hidemaro Fujibayashi and engineer Kenichi Hirose spent a portion of their presentation of the production flow for Tears of the Kingdom. And during this section, the pair spoke about the "Rupee Bulletin Board", where Rupees were used in place of likes.

It’s not that developer Dee Dee Creations haven’t shown off the game in action. It’s just that I find myself rooting so hard for this not to just be a vapid bit of meme-ware that I’m getting more concerned as we rapidly approach its 29th August release.

The Japan-only Powerful Pro Baseball 2024-25 knocks it out of the park once again, staying at the top of the pile with an additional 32,372 copies sold. It's mostly familiar faces elsewhere, with the likes of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Nintendo Switch Sports padding out the top 10, but That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime ISEKAI Chronicles makes its debut at number four with a perfectly respectable 21,270 sales.

If a park sim based on Tim Burton’s 1996 B-Movie homage Mars Attacks wasn’t on my bingo card, it’s because I’ve recently binned it and replaced it with a bobble head that simply nods in amused acceptance at whatever videogames decide to do next. And conceptually, Jurassic World Evolution with captive humans instead of dinos isn’t not a potential winner, is it? Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that Mars Attracts, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game. But then I realised that I’d never thought to check before, which might go some way to explaining the lack of them. Do you reckon they did the pun then worked backwards from there? Respectable, honestly.

Even almost 14 years after it was first released, it still hasn’t really set in that Deus Ex creator Warren Spector’s first game after a six-year break was not only a Mickey Mouse platformer, but one exclusively made for the Nintendo Wii after years of being a PC-only developer. To make matters even wilder, it was a pseudo-edgy re-imagining of decades of Disney iconography with forgotten mascot Oswald the Lucky Rabbit as a central antagonist.
And yet Epic Mickey happened, and what’s perhaps even more unbelievable, given the complications of re-releasing licensed games, is that 14 years on we’d be getting a remade version of the game. But, following the remake of the certified banger Spongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom, Purple Lamp is taking the helm of an updated edition of Mickey Mouse’s Wii adventure.

I mean, it's only a real-time tactical stealth game set in a cursed 18th century Jesuit monastery, developed by the people behind gorgeously gross metroidvania Blasphemous. It's only got isometric art inspired by Goya and a sanity/trauma system redolent of Darkest Dungeon. Sounds like an automatic RPS write-up to me.

Still, it does retain some of the bodily gymnastics of its predecessor. Namely the use of tongues as bungee ropes.

Launching early 2025, the game focuses on the lives of 'five forsaken inmates', who must work together to escape the confines of a monastery that is said to be both a prison and a madhouse.

Whether plundering the earth in SteamWorld Dig 2 or mucking about with magic in SteamWorld Quest, these are solid and approachable adventures that enthusiastically embrace whatever theme the developers have decided upon. Cowboys? Sure. Wizards? Why not. It barely matters, as long as it results in some good puns. As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders.

It will relax you so much that you gently petrify. Future archaeologists will marvel at you, a smiling stone figure in the ruins of a bygone civilisation. "What exactly was going on back in 2024 to inspire such a critical intensity of chillax?" they will wonder. Then, they will spot the computer screen glowing beneath its layer of dust, and the cycle will begin anew.

The Shattered Space expansion, out on September 30th, probably won’t refurbish the RPG’s reputation as an overall miss – but it does ditch the proc-gen planet bloat for a single handcrafted hellhole, a true Bethesda speciality honed by years of Fallouts and Elder Scrollseses. And, if its - sadly hands-off - Gamescom showcase is any indication, it might just double down on Starfield’s own strengths as well.

Publisher Twin Sails Interactive popped up at last night's Future Games Show to reveal that the gorgeous Persona-inspired turn-based JRPG Bloomtown: A Different Story will be adventuring onto Switch on 24th September.
Developed by Lazy Bear Games and Different Sense Games, Bloomtown looks like a perfectly cosy affair on the surface. You get to explore a slice of 1960s Americana, make friends, do a light bit of farming — it's all very sweet. But there's a darker side to the idyllic Bloomtown (literally), with a world of demons and other nasties growing beneath the surface, snatching the town's children.

In development at Sniper Elite makers Rebellion, it’s a "survival-action game inspired by real-life events" – specifically the Windscale fire, which in 1957 coated much of northern England in radioactive fallout. Atomfall’s alternative history makes Britain’s worst nuclear disaster even more disastrous, plunging the realm into full-on post-apocalyptica and leaving your good amnesiac self to dodge death with nothing but a cricket bat and whatever you can scrounge out of sheds. I like it! Mostly.

I dare boldly to maintain that there is such a thing as Too Wide, a point beyond which the extra visual estate becomes a waste of electricity, unless you watch the screen in pairs. I can only assume people who use ultrawide monitors live in constant terror of flanking manoeuvres and demand the maximum amount of peripheral vision. Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.
If you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable "cinematic aspect ratios" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view. It's one of several PC-specific flourishes they've just blogged about. Have a look.

Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.
Tips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I genuinely don't like sucker-punching video games the second they're announced, but playing Glowmade's King Of Meat is three hours of my life I won't get back, and every second I spend writing about it extends that total, dragging me closer to a regretful demise. Here's the stuff I'm more positive about: buried at the core of this spurting interactive snarkfest there is a moderately OK third-person dungeon-crawler for groups of up to four.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now, I never played quite as much as our Brendy did of the original Splitgate. But I had a fun time with its mixture of Halo-esque trigger pulling and portalling around! So I was intrigued to give the alpha version of Splitgate 2 a go and see if it had a little more substance to it than its initial reveal, which gave off a, "it's Splitgate but with more money" feel. 
Well, I think it's… a bit serious? It certainly has more polish and some extra additions, yet I didn't come away from it thrilled by its more competitive, class-based FPS leanings. I think it just needs a bit more time, perhaps, for a portal to open and some silly rocket launchers and baseball bats and zombies to come tumbling out of it.

If you have have experience of the London rental market, you are probably reading this and thinking: “He’s got a front door? Such extravagance. I live in a folded umbrella.” Touché, my friend. I guess it’s just as well we have spaciously proportioned first-person puzzle adventures to console us in our time of compound elbow bruises, rising damp and preposterous financial debt. On which note, Looking For Fael seems fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arc Raiders was announced back in 2021 as a free-to-play co-op third-person shooter, and has been delayed several times since. That's partly because Embark Studios' other in-development game, The Finals, progressed faster than planned and stole its momentum. It's also because it was re-tooled at some point as a PvPvE extraction shooter.

Now it's back again, aiming for release next year, and it's been re-tooled a little more: it's no longer free-to-play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh, and new Indiana Jones And The Great Circle trailer! Great. I’ve been looking forward to a nice, juicy chunk of extended gameplay. You know, something to really convey the flow of the game, rather than the admittedly impressive but nonetheless very fragmented snippets we’ve gotten so far. Now to sit back and…oh, wait. Hang on. It’s just actor Troy Baker telling me about all the great acting he’ll be doing. It is great, by the way. He’s doing a fantastic job. Maybe just, you know, a crumb of acknowledgement or elucidation over the whole ‘interactivity’ part?
Anyway, don’t mind me. I’m just an old fool who likes to press buttons. And, to be fair, it's not like Machinegames don't have a great track record. Anyway, here’s some good news: The game releases December 9th this year. Have a release date trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Little Nightmares DNA runs strong in Tarsier Studios’ new game. So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.
It’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.

It's called Herdling and it's nothing to do with sailing across a decaying universe, but very much to do with alpine expeditions and friendly beasts. Very unexpected.

Out in 2025, Directive 8020 is the story of the good ship Cassiopeia, a human colony vessel that is infiltrated by Something Icky. The Something Icky is capable of mimicking humans. So that'd be a bit like Alien and a bit like The Thing, then. Sorry, human colonists!
Directive 8020 was teased at the end of the last Dark Pictures instalment, 2022's The Devil in Me. A trailer also leaked back in November 2022. Now, we have an official announcement video.

"To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the Dying Light 2 Stay Human Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC." That's nice! 
This seems like an odd one. I’m only tangentially familiar with the Dying Light games, but I was under the impression that the model here was releasing a single game, then updating and expanding it for years. Whether standalone adventure Dying Light: The Beast represents an attempt to course correct after Dying Light 2’s mixed reception, then, I’m not entirely sure. But if nothing else, it does share something in common with all the other adverts at Gamescom tonight: it is a game that exists, and will presumably be playable at some point.

For sharing today is a look at multiple Linux distributions up and running on the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X (Zen 5) desktop. Among the distributions in the mix are Intel's Clear Linux distribution that is optimally tuned for maximum x86_64 Linux performance and once again even on AMD hardware shows the significant benefits to a well-tuned Linux software stack.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our Black Myth: Wukong review hails the game as "a generous Soulsy adventure hybrid that works within its limitations and delivers a beautiful challenge to be unpicked with a magical toolbox". Reviewer Edders went so far as to find the world more engaging than that of Elden Ring - proper defying-the-gods level rhetoric. Players seem to agree. The game launched last night, and has already accrued a concurrent player peak of 1.44 million - Steam's fourth highest ever, exceeded only by Counter-Strike, Palworld and PUBG. By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.
All that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other "content creators" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of "trigger words" like "Covid-19", no talk of "politics" or "feminist propaganda", and no mention of "China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc".

Luckily, in this upcoming sandbox adventure, you have a giant metal fortress that walks above the pools of toxic sludge on huge spidery legs and chomps up all the trash you bring it. If you are not intrigued by that, perhaps the little janitor with a sci-fi vacuum cleaner (or the feel-good music reminiscent of Adventure Time songs) will convince you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tactical Breach Wizards is a tactics game for people that don’t like tactics games. Magically, it’s also a tactics game for people who love them like nothing else. It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.

They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.
According to director Hiroshi Takai, it was "impossible" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no "existential risk" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill has a messy, up-is-down relationship with time and history, so let's go about this hands-on with the Silent Hill 2 Remake in a messy, up-is-down way. Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative "Unreal Engine 5" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.
It begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the best roguelikes on PC is getting a farewell of sorts this week. Twitchy slashfest Dead Cells received its final major update, introducing new enemies, fresh weapons, and a few mutations. Unfortunately, all this new stuff is very cursed. In other words, it all toys with the game's "curse" status effect, a hex that causes you to be killed if you take even a single hit. You'll probably die a few times as a result of this update, which in some ways is a fitting finalé for this fast-paced jar smasher of a game. You can see the new features in the trailer below.

A seizure banner accuses the operation of criminal activity and warns of prison sentences. Nevertheless, the site's operators have already made a restart and are vowing to keep going until sports streams are affordable for everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, the Xitter account for H2M - a mod aiming to recreate the heyday of classic Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer inside Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered - announced that they had received a cease and desist from Activision Blizzard, and would shut down the project. The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.

As ever, we have a way of thwarting the Maw's advance, and it's... pasta sauce? Graham, why is there pasta sauce in the Trello? Have Ziff Davis subfranchised us to Dolmio? Oh, I'm sorry! That's just my shopping list. What I meant to say was: new video games! Video games (PC games, specifically) are the only thing that can preoccupy the Maw, the only thing newsworthy enough to distract it from the tempting clifftop maisonettes of Torquay. Let's see what the week has in store for us, eh.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.
Still, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In December 2022, music industry giants including BMG, UMG, and Capitol, filed a massive copyright infringement lawsuit against Altice, owners of internet service provider Optimum. The complaint followed the familiar 'repeat infringer' format, with damages for works in suit worth over a billion dollars and everything on the line. A joint filing this week reveals that the lawsuit has been dismissed with prejudice, never to see the light of day again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baroque wilderness-builder Nightingale has not been doing brilliantly since Ed Thorn described the launch early access version as "a numbers grind disguised as a gaslamp survival game". We had moderately high hopes for it before the early access release - I personally enjoy the fairytale setting, with its pop-up Pucks and magic umbrellas, but I also think I've raised enough hovels on procedurally generated maps for one lifetime. Still, I'd quite like it to come good, if only so I can justify op-eds about Lewis Carroll, and I'm somewhat encouraged by what I've heard of the game's forthcoming Realms Rebuilt update.

Wham! Bam! You reel back in consternation as I bounce into the path and clobber you with a sack containing no less than eight venerable RPGs, from Baldur's Gate to Warhammer 40,000: Rogue's Trader - well over a thousand hours worth of dungeons, dragons, dicerolls, dwarven shopkeepers and many other things I refuse to spend time alliterating, all of which will (currently) set you back just £32.07. 


Were you planning to spend this weekend playing some cute two-hour artgame sideshow, without any levelling at all? Shut up, you DOLT. You will play what the nice journalist tells you to play! Best lay in extra caffeine tablets, because it's going to take you till Monday just to get through the character creators alone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black Myth: Wukong is an action RPG that leans a bit into the Souls camp and a bit into the adventure camp. And either way, it's a spectacular journey that works for mostly everyone: those after challenging fights against Chinese mythological creatures, and those after the same thing, but with a little less challenge than your typical Soulslikes. What separates Black Myth from the crowd, though, is its slick presentation and a sense of generosity. You're to witness the most lavish, cinematic worlds and its creatures. And you're to enjoy battering everything with your staff as a highly athletic monkey with copious spells at his furry follicles and fingertips. It's been a while since I've played anything quite as impressive as this.

The strategy game’s 5.2 update is on the horizon, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the team teased in June. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC. They’re also focused right where Immortal Empires needs them the most: depth, rather than width. In the dawi’s case, quite literally.

Alongside the likes of the Descenders and Riders Republic, it offered a more laid-back game, open to furious time trialling but always remembering to let you stop and appreciate the view. Both the stakes and the poly count were low. Happy news then, that it is getting a snowy sequel. In Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders you'll be swapping your bike for a pair of skis, and you'll be able to barrel down the mountainside with friends in co-op.

Like 13th century peasants straining to convey huge, teetering loads of freshly quarried LMGs, our SSDs cry out for justice. Perhaps scenting imminent rebellion and a mass audience desertion to low-poly shooters with more civilised file sizes, Activision have relented. Future installations of the much-padded FPS will be "smaller and more customised", though in a last cruel stroke of villainy, they want you to download a large update to prepare the ground.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The management game progression chart is supposed to go: zoo, then theme park, then hospital, then school. Apparently no one told Springloaded Software, who are following up their 2021 tycoon 'em up Let's Build A Zoo with a game about building an MMO. 

Let's Build A Dungeon marries the business aspects of Game Dev Tycoon with a more hands-on approach to constructing your company's game, and there's a first trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Space 4X strategy game Stellaris launched in 2016, but Paradox can't stop adding to the universe. Last time I checked in, it was school trips to other dimensions. Now, it's Cosmic Storms. Due for release alongside the Stellaris 3.13 Vela update on September 10th, these are a paid "mechanical expansion" (priced at a rather chunky £11, $13 or €13, and available as part of the current season pass) that builds upon the game's existing Space Storms, "providing a deeper experience with strategically meaningful gameplay and beautiful upgraded visuals". Wash that down with new civics, precursor narratives, anomalies, archaeology sites, techs, edicts, a new Ascension perk, and new galactic community resolutions.

Some readers characterised this as a familiar species of cultural hypocrisy regarding video games - emphasising violence is A-OK, but for the love of god, don't mention sex. Good news, those people: Dread XP's latest horror signing The Lacerator has both. It casts you as hirsute 1980s porn star Max - surname not given in press release, but presumably something like Jackin' or Girth - who has been abducted by a large scary individual called the Lacerator.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over 2000 hours spent in various factory games makes me a bit of a purist, I suppose. In theory, I should then be the ideal reviewer to enjoy Shapez 2. But I'm also the ideal reviewer to tear it apart over the most minor hiccups and defects. I'm the Anton Ego of factory games. I don't like food, I love it. If I don't love it, I don't swallow.
Ah, you needn't worry. This is by far the most fun I've had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I've never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life. But 40 hours into my save file, I've often found myself yearning for a bit more creativity in the challenges, a few more curveballs sent in my direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s an oddly Halloweeny summer week for games, this one. Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s October 31st release date leaked earlier, Steam have put together a Summer Fright Night bundle featuring RPS fave Hauntii, and I’ve got a strange urge to gorge on Haribo and mini Double Deckers until blood comes out of my eyeballs. What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.
The idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.

The new system, which will be enabled by default but can be toggled off, aims to “help potential players make informed decisions about the games they are considering purchasing by understanding the attributes of the game that other players like or don't like.” Ah, so a sort of ‘review’, if you will.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Crimson Diamond is a proper old-school style puzzle adventure. It's 2D pixel art, with a limited colour palette as in EGA games, and you control it with a text parser, like King's Quest or one of them other Sierra adventures old men like Graham remember. It's important to mention this up front because it's very possible that, despite The Crimson Diamond's tale of betrayal, murder, and mineral rights in 1914 Canada, the text parser element will be a Rubicon you instantly can't be arsed to cross. A not unreasonable stance - though I think the text parser in The Crimson Diamond is fantastic. Such beef that I have with this adventure game is down to the specificity required to solve some of the puzzles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[KIBORG: Arena feels like a throwback in several ways that I quite enjoy. It’s a free prologue to the upcoming cyberpunk puncher KIBORG. The titular arena is a large room in which you, a large man, bash a large amount of enemies. You have to punch a gong between waves to trigger the next, and this struck me as a nice pre-emptive nudge that every problem you face in Kiborg can be solved by rapidly moving your fist towards offending objects, which turned out not to be too far off the mark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Satirical space RPG sequel The Outer Worlds 2 was announced back in 2021. Since then, we've heard nary a peep about it, with developers Obsidian focusing on Pillars Of Eternity successor Avowed and their ace survival game Grounded, which left early access in September 2022. According to Obsidian's studio head Feargus Urquhart, the project is rubbing along nicely. But it was not ever thus: during the opening years of the Covid pandemic, there was apparently "talk of 'do we stop Outer Worlds 2 and just throw the whole team on Avowed'."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve have made no secret of their plans to make SteamOS – the Linux-based operating system that powers the Steam Deck – available to other games-playing devices, including rival handhelds. After a recent beta update mentioned adding support for the Asus ROG Ally’s inputs, The Verge confirmed with Valve that SteamOS support for non-Steam Deck portables is still very much in the works. The Deck’s long-promised dual booting capability, on the other hand, sounds further down the to-do list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been looking grim for Super Earth recently. I mean, not really. Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.
“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns," reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.
Whether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finding and sharing Free Stuff is one of the time-honoured duties of the video game journalist or SEO-monger. Back when I was OXM's online editor, "free Xbox games" was one of our golden Google pillars, the other two being "Minecraft Xbox 360 update" and "Skyrim something something". Well, uncle Valve has just rudely torpedoed that ancient investigative initiative by adding a Trending Free tab to the Steam frontpage, encompassing prologues, demos, free-to-play games and that most treasured of jewels, a full free game with no monetisation elements, such as Grimhook.
Do not cry for us pitiful electronic scribblers, crowded on our melting internet icebergs. Play free games instead! Thanks to that new tab, I've just discovered a demo for neato wide-format tower defender Frontline Crisis. Hah, that'll keep the awareness of steady livelihood erosion at bay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aside from being a game where you run around a shopping mall murdering the living dead, the original Dead Rising from 2006 is a clownish satire of sleazy tabloid photojournalism. It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn "Prestige points" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: "Brutal" scenes of characters being slain; moments of "Horror", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical "Outtakes", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of "Drama", such as people reacting to discoveries; and "Erotic" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.
The Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't "a response to a changing cultural climate", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not "an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck’s competitors, whether they’re the old guard Ayaneo family, the luxe Asus ROG Ally X, or the shapeshifting Lenovo Legion Go, usually share the same attack line: they can play more of your games. The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.
Unless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.

Little did I know that the humble premise of a small 2D spacecraft shooting baddies on a wrap-around screen would reach the glittering heights of Nova Drift. Had you shown me this game back in 1995, I dare say I'd have shmupped myself.
