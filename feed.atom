        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And some of them are actually darn good.
The Switch has a lot of games, and we'd certainly argue that quite a lot of really good games are in the system's vast library, waiting to be discovered.

Nintendo's extensive financial results briefing has plenty of information in various areas, and right at the back is the company's renewed commitment to its 'ESG' Initiatives - Environment, Social and Governance.
It reiterates some information seen in the most recent corporate social responsibility report, but is perhaps worth another focus. In terms of environment initiatives, the company's goals are to produce 'environmentally conscious products' - this is focused on energy conservation (Switch, like its predecessors, has a low power draw), 'green procurement', efficient transportation and 'post-sales recycling'.

It seems Nintendo's decision to remaster and port its 2011 Wii release The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD to the Switch has well and truly paid off.
In the company's latest financial report, it's been revealed the Nintendo Switch version of the game has already sold 3.60 million units as of 30th September 2021.

Gold-foil covers. Uniquely numbered issues. High-gloss pages. This is Game Informer Gold: The same video game magazine you know and love printed on ridiculously high-quality paper. We've been working on making this high-end variant for over a year and are finally ready to reveal it.
Each edition of Game Informer Gold is limited with a small print run. Much like prized comic books, each copy is bagged and boarded. You may even get a hand-written note from me in the box it's shipped in.
We are auctioning off the first copy of Game Informer Gold during our 25-hour Extra Life Livestream on November 6. The auction begins at 4 p.m. CT and all money goes to Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.
Want to get your hands on a copy? We plan to reveal more details about Game Informer Gold's availability in the weeks and months ahead. Stay tuned to Game Informer's social channels for that information.
I know you hear this often, but you need to get your hands on Game Informer Gold to truly understand how big of an upgrade it is. From its increased thickness to the gold shine on the cover, this is as high-end as magazines get.
Click image thumbnails to view larger version
 
                                                                                                             

In the months ahead, we plan on creating limited Gold editions for each issue. We may also reprint back issues with the Gold treatment. Here's a cool twist: Some of these issues (new and old) could feature never-before-seen alternate artwork on the covers, perhaps from some of the world's most celebrated artists.
We're going to have some fun with Game Informer Gold, and we can't wait for you to get your hands on an issue!]]></summary>

Well, I say ‘on point’; there’s a fair amount of discussion of new Dune, too, which is what got us thinking about successful book to screen journeys. Sadly, the House Atreides bagpipe band were not available for a rousing rendition of the podcast theme.

Earlier this week, a zen game about unpacking, which is unsurprisingly called Unpacking, launched on Nintendo Switch. Since then, it's been getting a lot of attention, both for its players who don't know what GameCubes are, and for the stunning amount of detail within the isometric pixel art game.
The latest detail to go viral is one that doesn't usually get nearly enough recognition: the Foley work, done by BAFTA-award-winning composer and audio designer, Jeff van Dyck, who has credits on Total War, Hand of Fate, and a number of EA Sports games.

Specifically, he's coming to the PlayStation versions of the game – he’s an exclusive character, after all. But even non-PlayStation owners will be treated to a substantial update that adds a new Raid, power cap increase, and a perhaps friendlier method of unlocking cosmetics. 
November 30 is the big day that patch 2.2 hits the game. Spider-Man arrives in the Great Power Hero Event. The story centers on Peter Parker uncovering a mysterious threat and joining up with the Avengers to prevent AIM from procuring powerful technology. Although Spidey struggles with working as part of a team, he manages to form bonds with Ms. Marvel and Black Widow (despite insisting on maintaining his secret identity).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Want to know which are the best guns in Call Of Duty: Vanguard? Recent Call Of Duty games have among the most complex weapon meta of any FPS games, thanks both to the sheer number of weapons and the absurd number of attachments you can use to customise each gun. Call Of Duty: Vanguard continues this trend in a big way, with 27 primary and 9 secondary weapons that you can unlock, customise, and experiment with.
We fully expect Call Of Duty: Vanguard's weapon meta to evolve quickly with future updates and balance patches, but at the moment there is definitely a top tier of guns which have risen above the rest in effectiveness. Below we'll walk you through the very best guns in the game and how to get the most power out of each one.

Nintendo has been eager to emphasize that version 2.0 of Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the first and only 'major' update to the game. We had various small updates previously of course, adding new events, items and themes, but today's arrival was far more substantial. In addition to new characters, locations and features, it seems to have added a lot of items.
Datamining results shared on animalcrossingworld.com suggest the number of new items could be as high as 9000+. That's crazy, but the number is currently being reviewed and debated, as it also depends on whether you count clones and new colour variations of existing items. In terms of items that are fully brand new, it could be more in the region of 1000+.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adorable 2009 platformer A Boy And His Blob hops over to Switch today. 
First released for the Wii, the game is a remake of the NES cult classic A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia. Players control the titular boy, with the help of his shape-shifting blob companion, to solve 2D platforming puzzles. Feeding the Blob jellybeans turns it into 15 different objects ranging from a parachute, anvil, or cannon. The game’s best feature: you can hug the Blob anytime.

A Boy and His Blob has since become a cult favorite in its own right. We scored the original Wii release an 8 out of 10. In her review, former GI editor Meagan Marie wrote that “...there is something undeniably magnetic about the game. The lush environments, charming characters, and the infinite power of the hug button make it impossible to stay upset for too long.” Over the last decade, it’s been ported to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, and mobile devices. 
You can purchase A Boy and His Blob for $14.99 on the Switch eShop. The port is being handled by Ziggurat Interactive, which is also gearing up to release enhanced versions of the BloodRayne games on consoles.]]></summary>

Remember the Power Glove? It was a mostly awkward means of interacting with games back during the NES era, and was immortalised in the 1989 Hollywood flick The Wizard. It's since become something of a cult object in the world of gaming, inspiring adoration with older gamers (as well as a feature-length documentary), but this much-maligned peripheral is getting another chance of movie fame thanks to HBO's upcoming festive flick, 8-Bit Christmas.
Set in the late '80s, the film tells the quest of one boy to get a Nintendo Entertainment System, the hottest item with any self-respecting child. But alas! The NES is sold-out everywhere, so ten-year-old Jake Doyle sets out on a mission to secure one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take-Two Interactive has reportedly canceled a $53 million game that was being developed by Hangar 13. 
This news comes by way of Bloomberg, which reports that “people familiar with the decision” have learned that “further development of an unannounced title in its pipeline” has ended. Codenamed Volt, this game had reportedly gone through multiple iterations since first being conceived but ultimately, what led to its cancellation was the repeated “reboots, technological hiccups, and challenges caused by COVID-19,” Bloomberg reports. 
Volt’s development began in 2017, and it was set to be centered around various superheroes competing against each other. It would have featured an emphasis on online gameplay. 
“It was set to be a new intellectual property for Hangar 13, but 2K executives didn’t see it as a worthwhile investment because of the amount of time needed in development before it became a finished product,” Bloomberg’s report reads. 
There have been no layoffs as a result of this at the time of this writing, and Bloomberg reports that Hangar 13 employees will meet Thursday in Novata, California, where the studio is based, to discuss what happens next. 
Bloomberg writer Jason Schreier, who wrote this report, tweeted out additional details about the canceled project and those affected. He said Hangar 13 staff in California learned today via email that Volt was canceled, and he also noted that some non-US staff members learned of this news from his report. 
Schreier also said this canceled game was not Mafia 4, which some thought Hangar 13 was developing according to rumors. He said Mafia 4 rumors “were always false, aside from their early attempts in 2016-2017.”

It's dark, it's tough, and a narrator likes to remind you of those things frequently. But this time around, we're leaving the Ancestor's squalid hamlet behind, and swapping it out for a stress-fueled stagecoach. Heroes are no longer cannon-fodder to send out on doomed expeditions, but vital team members who have stories to share and relationships to forge. 


I recently talked with creative director Chris Bourassa and design director Tyler Sigman about why they decided to take the game in this new direction, the difficulties of switching to a relationship-based affliction system, and why they're excited to be working in early access again.

Now, Amazon Games are bringing its flashy, Diablo-like combat to the west in the form of a closed beta later today, and we've had an early sneak peek at it. Of course, what with Amazon's own MMO New World now settling into its third month, not to mention Final Fantasy 14's Endwalker expansion looming on the horizon, Lost Ark arrives at a busy time for fervent EXP grinders. The big question, then, is whether Lost Ark’s Diablo-y formula can do enough to compete with the already well-established MMO juggernauts. Judging by my few hours of hands-on time, I’m thinking it might, but only if you’re able to embrace its slow burn.

        <updated>2021-11-04T15:52:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo has always had some great collector’s editions with each new release – looking at you, Master Chief helmet that came with Halo 3 – and Walmart sort of surprise announced a new one for Halo Infinite overnight. As expected, it sold out immediately. 
As far as special editions of Halo Infinite goes, there’s the Halo Infinite Xbox Series X bundle, the special steelbook that comes with preorders in select locations, and that’s about it. Before today, we hadn’t yet seen a special Halo Infinite edition that comes with what’s usually expected i.e. a statue of some kind, maybe some patches or stickers, and an art book. 
It seems Walmart had the lock on that because overnight, it released the Halo Infinite Collector’s Edition for $169.99. It sold out near immediately. It features the game, of course, a steelbook case (the same one being sold by other retailers), a set of five patches, a Plasma Pistol replica bottle opener, an Energy Sword desk lamp, two lanyards, a mini art book, a desktop portfolio, and a special developer note. 
According to Walmart, this edition was limited to just 10,000 units and now, it’s sold out. It’s unclear if more Collector’s Editions will be released. It’s also important to note that oddly enough, neither Microsoft nor Xbox have mentioned this edition yet. 
Perhaps it’s an unofficial one made by Walmart, although that would be odd considering it comes with some very official-looking merchandise. Maybe Walmart jumped the gun and released it early. All we know is that we’re very sad we were sleeping while this went live.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FromSoftware showed off 15 minutes of Elden Ring gameplay this morning, and also revealed a pair of snazzy special editions at the presentation's conclusion. Those who want more swag for their buck can pre-order these bad boys now. 
First up is the Collector’s Edition, which includes the following goodies:
Elden Ring game
Malenia – Blade of Miquella statue (23 cm)
Exclusive steelbook
40-page hardback artbook
Digital soundtrack
The Premium Collector’s Edition includes everything in the Collector’s Edition but tosses in a 1:1 replica of Malenia’s helmet, which may or may not be big enough to wear. Check it out below. 
The Collector’s Edition will set you back $189.99. The Premium Edition briefly appeared for $229.99 on Bandai Namco's website but is a bit tough to track down right now. You'll have to pre-order from retailers fast to grab one before they're just a memory. You can try your luck at Best Buy, Target, and GameStop (disclaimer: GameStop is the parent company of Game Informer). 
Elden Ring releases February 25 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

Famitsu's Japanese chart figures are now in for the week ending 31st October, revealing that Mario Party Superstars has gone straight in at number one.
The game sold an estimated 163,256 physical copies in its opening week in Japan, managing to fend off several newcomers releasing this week. Among the other new titles was Super Robot Wars 30, which sold better on Switch than PS4, and Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water, which did the opposite.

The entire showcase heavily emphasizes player choice when navigating the world of Elden Ring. Unlike previous FromSoftware games which are more akin to wide-open, interconnected areas rather than a full-on open-world, Elden Ring’s world is completely open, allowing players to tackle objectives how they see fit.

GTAV became the most profitable entertainment product of all time three years ago in 2018, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz, and it seems like the game has no plans to give up that title anytime soon.

        <updated>2021-11-04T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A HEE-HOme run.
Shin Megami Tensei V has been a long time coming. The last mainline entry in the series was released over eight years ago for the 3DS, while the last home console entry was another ten years before that. Moreover, Shin Megami Tensei V was one of the first games ever revealed for the Switch, mere months after the console itself was first shown to the public. All those years of hype have thus generated some awfully high expectations. It was never in doubt that Atlus would give this release the attention it deserves, but the question has always been whether it would be good enough to get over the high bar set by its predecessors. Fortunately, any such concerns can be cast aside — Shin Megami Tensei V is the best entry in the series yet and stands as an impressive achievement for a beloved franchise.
Right from the off, it’s made abundantly clear that Shin Megami Tensei V is every bit as ‘heavy’ as its predecessors. Things start off seemingly normal as you follow your character through a typical day of school, but there’s an ominous tone to the announcement at the end of the day that advises students to travel home in pairs. People have been disappearing and there are rumors of violent attacks taking place around Tokyo, but nobody really seems to have a clear idea of what exactly is going on.

I’ve been playing Shin Megami Tensei V, already clocking close to 40 hours, but I haven’t reached the end to deliver my final verdict. Until then, I’ll say: Shin Megami Tensei sticks close to its roots – for better or worse. This means common series complaints, such as poor navigation and obtuse instructions, remain, but Atlus has also enhanced certain aspects, with more expansive areas, more skill customization, and stellar demon designs. If you’re an SMT fan, you should feel at home with the long, hard-fought journey that awaits…]]></summary>

Recently, Ubisoft stated that it wants to be one of the key players in the world of video game-related NFTs (non-fungible tokens), and now publishing rival Electronic Arts has noted that it too is looking at how to breaking into "play to earn" market.
During an earnings call this week, EA boss Andrew Wilson referred to NFTs and blockchain gaming as an "important part about the future of our industry", which echoes what Ubisoft CFO Frédérick Duguet said earlier this week. Duguet believes that the technology "will enable more play-to-earn that will enable more players to actually earn content, own content, and we think it's going to grow the industry quite a lot".

This news comes by way of Nintendo, which announced that Version 1.1.1 is out for Super Mario 3D All-Stars, which is the collection released last year that features Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario Galaxy. Before this new update, you could only play these three games using Joy-Con or the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.
Nintendo Switchソフト『スーパーマリオ ３Ｄコレクション』の更新データVer.1.1.1の配信を開始しました。更新することで『スーパーマリオ64』を「NINTENDO 64 コントローラー」（Nintendo Switch Online加入者限定商品）でプレイすることができます。 https://t.co/UmrwP6e8C6 pic.twitter.com/RHKN7g0tLo
November 4, 2021
That’s still the case for Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy, but thanks to Version 1.1.1., you can now play Super Mario 64 with Nintendo’s recently-released 64 controller. Joy-Con and the Pro controller work fine in Super Mario 64, but for those looking for a more classic and nostalgic feel, using the 64 controller while playing is sure to fit their fancy. 
While waiting for the 64 controllers to be in stock again, check out why one of Game Informer’s editors thinks Super Mario 3D All-Stars is a great collection of remasters that doesn’t quite go far enough and then read about how Nintendo stopped selling this collection after March 31, 2021. Check out our thoughts on the latest 3D Mario game released in Game Informer’s Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury review after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By now you’ve probably heard about how Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs shake up the previously stagnant Core line. Led by this, the Intel Core i9-12900K, Alder Lake sees the adoption of a hybrid architecture that combines high-power Performance cores (P-cores) with Efficiency cores (E-cores) that can free up headroom by taking on background tasks. The Core i9-12900K takes this opportunity to bulk up, combining eight P-cores and E-cores apiece for a total of 16 cores and 24 threads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Intel Core i5-12600K is, in some ways, the CPU that Intel should have made three or four years ago. Ever since AMD’s Ryzen chips appeared with an alluring balance of gaming speed, desktop multitasking performance, efficiency, and affordability, Intel seemed to sink into a comfort zone of simply raising clock speeds and maybe adding a few cores. 


This was often enough to earn some half-throated recommendations for gaming builds specifically, but this past year proved that something needed to change, with the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X claiming the best gaming CPU title and 11th Gen Rocket Lake Intel chips – like the 5600X’s rival Core i5-11600K – looking thoroughly skippable. For those who did decide to wait until the 12th Gen Alder Lake launch, consider yourselves vindicated, as the Core i5-12600K is a great all-rounder: both a Ryzen-beater in games and, thanks to a long-overdue architecture revamp, a drastically better general purpose processor.

Dig was announced way back in August of 2019 as a new take on the massively popular Shovel Knight character.

Previously due in March 2022, it's now pushed back into the second half of 2022. I say "previously"; the game was only announced two months ago. Sounds like someone had a serious rethink about the state of the project. But if it needs the time, it's good that it's getting the time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA Sports PGA Tour won’t be hitting the green next Spring as promised. EA has announced its upcoming return to golf will arrive at a later date. 
When exactly? That’s not entirely clear. EA Sports PGA Tour never had a concrete release date, but EA’s statement simply states its shifting the launch to a later time and that it will tell us more about it later. The full statement reads as follows:
Hey golf fans, we wanted to let you know that we are shifting the launch date of EA Sports PGA Tour. We’re excited to bring championship golf to you and will be providing more information on our launch plans in the coming months.

EA Sports PGA Tour represents the publisher’s comeback to golf after a years-long hiatus. The game already boasts exclusive rights to the Master’s Tournament and features the PGA Championship, U.S. Open Championship, and The Open Championship. The game will also highlight the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) and feature one of their respective tournaments, the Amundi Evian Championship.
In other recent delay news, Marvel's Midnight Suns was pushed to the back half of 2022, Platinum Games' arcade shooter Sol Cresta will now launch next year, and both Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV may not arrive until 2023 at the earliest. 
What do you think of EA Sports PGA Tour's delay? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

There’s no shortage of those kinds of announcements these days, but sometimes those announcements can feel like mistakes, particularly when a game is nowhere near ready. 
Sure, the hype is exciting, but there’s no real purpose to announcing a game years and years ahead of time other than marketing, of course. If a game enters what’s informally known as development hell, that announcement can sting a lot, both for the studio behind it and the fans excited about it. 
In Part 1 of this series, Game Informer detailed the development history of games like Pikmin 4, Dead Island 2, Skull & Bones, and more. Part 2 explored the development hell of five more ga…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix has released its annual report for its 2021 fiscal year, which reflected on the games released during the initial months of the COVID pandemic. Marvel's Avengers is revealed in the report to be considered "not proven successful," though lessons were learned from the project.
Taking on a Games as a Service (or GaaS) model, Marvel's Avengers was described as an "ambitious title" for Square Enix. The complications that come with planning for the long tail of a service-focused title with the shift to developers working from home compounded the challenges. "We were able to surmount these challenges and release the game, but it has unfortunately not proven as successful as we would have liked," says Square Enix President Yosuke Matsuda in the report.

The studio tweeted a statement by creative director Jake Solomon explaining the delay. Simply put, the game needs more time in the oven to come together, and four months from now won’t be enough. “These extra months will be used to add more story, cinematics, and overall polish and will be essential in helping us make our vision a reality,” reads Solomon’s statement. You can read the full announcement in the tweet below.

Marvel’s Midnight Suns blends turn-based and deck-building gameplay with a story based on the ‘90s Midnight Sons story and team. Players control The Hunter, an original hero created by Marvel and Firaxis, who leads a team consisting of Doctor Strange, Blade, Captain America, Wolverine, Magik, and others against the evil Lilith. We recently featured it on the cover of Game Informer, and you can read deep-dive articles breaking down every facet of the game’s features and development in our coverage hub.

That’s because Nintendo will be making 20% fewer Switch consoles than expected through March, according to a new report from Nikkei Asia. The 20% reduction translates to roughly 6 million fewer Switch consoles, as Nintendo originally planned to manufacture and ship 30 million Switch units by March. Nikkei Asia reports that the planned number has been reduced to 24 million.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Honor of Kings, the extremely popular mobile MOBA, is getting a live-service, open-world spinoff game called Honor of Kings: World. 
This news comes by way of Kotaku, which reports that World will be following in the vein of Genshin Impact. It will have live-service components, a global launch, and locales and a narrative based on or at least inspired by Chinese mythology.

The new trailer, which launched over the weekend, features a gorgeous and flashy open world significantly more open than that seen in Honor of Kings...which makes sense considering Honor of Kings: World is meant to be an open world title. As noted by Kotaku, World will likely end up being massive – its MOBA predecessor, Honor of Kings, is one of the biggest games in the world, surpassing over 100 million daily players in 2020. 
It doesn’t hurt that it has Chinese entertainment conglomerate Tencent’s backing, too. Tencent originally wanted to make a mobile version of League of Legends, but Riot Games passed on it and so Honor of Kings was made by TiMi Studio instead. 
Similar to Genshin Impact, World appears to be a third-person action-RPG set in a fantastical world filled with different towns and cities, NPCs, enemies, and more. A release date for World has not been announced, but a worldwide launch is planned for multiple platforms, presumably PlayStation, Xbox, mobile, and PC platforms. 
While waiting to learn more about Honor of Kings: World, check out our thoughts on Genshin Impact in Game Informer’s Genshin Impact review and then read about how it's celebrating its first anniversary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After spending years in Early Access, the beautiful survival game Among Trees is ready for prime time. Developer FJRD Interactive announced today that the game will officially launch on November 10 for PC.
Among Trees was first revealed during The Game Awards in 2018 and launched in Early Access in June 2020. Set in a scenic, living forest, your task is to gather materials and food to survive. You’ll chop down trees to build a cabin, which you can upgrade by adding new rooms to unlock cooking, crafting, sewing, and gardening. Speaking of that last mechanic, you can construct an entire greenhouse to grow food to consume raw or use as ingredients for recipes. You can also build a hydration system and even a brewery.

The gorgeous world includes forests and caves. As peaceful as it looks, it’s not without its dangers. Predators such as bears roam its landscape, which you’ll need to avoid to prevent a The Revenant situation. If that’s too much excitement for your blood, a peaceful Zen mode allows you to enjoy Among Trees’ laid-back vibe without killer animals breathing down your neck. On the friendlier side, you can adopt and train a fox companion to help you locate valuable resources. 
FJRD says it plans to continue bug fixing throughout the year. Other than that, don’t expect any new significant features or content. After spending five years working on Among Trees, the team is excited for it to go 1.0 and begin transitioning to other projects. 
Among Trees will be available on Steam and the Epic Games Store for $14.99.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In early October, Xbox and Adidas partnered up to create a cool sneaker commemorating the 20th anniversary of the console. The downside: the shoe wasn’t for sale and could only be won in a contest. Fortunately for gamers and sneakerheads, the two companies are at it again, creating another console-inspired sneaker that you can purchase the old-fashioned way. 
Dubbed the Xbox 360 Forum Mid, the shoe draws aesthetic inspiration from, you guessed it, the Xbox 360. Like the original version of the console, the sneaker sports a predominantly white look with silver and lime-green accents. Eagle-eyed fans will notice the strap resembles the 360’s disc tray. The heel has elements referencing the removable hard drive and memory unit slots. These easter eggs are largely subtle; the Xbox button on the sides of the shoe is the only dead giveaway you’re wearing a console on your feet. The sneaker also comes with four extra laces in red, yellow, green, and blue. I’m sure you can guess the significance of those colors.

Whilst on Knowhere during Chapter 6, you can look around and partake in a bit of shopping. Whilst looking between the various stalls, you will find a merchant who offers to sell you a disabler that will supposedly remove the Nova Corps tracker from your ship. This would mean you don’t need to pay the Nova Corps fine that you incurred earlier in Chapter 2. However, Knowhere is a seedy place, and it’s hard to be certain whether you might get conned.
This guide will explain whether you should buy the disabler on Knowhere in Guardians Of The Galaxy, so that you can avoid any scams.

Play the game and you'll quickly realise it does things games aren't supposed to do. Most notably, for me at least, Inscryption makes me feel like I'm actually playing a proper card game; that feeling of being present at a table, slapping cards down on its hard surface. I hadn't realised how crucial this was to my enjoyment of CCGs, until now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elden Ring’s February release date is coming fast, and tomorrow, FromSoftware will showcase 15 minutes of gameplay. 
Any FromSoftware fan knows the struggle that has been anticipating Elden Ring – it was announced over two years ago during E3 2019, and after that, things went quiet. Then, information began to leak, such as concept art and a mysterious trailer. Finally, earlier this Summer, we got an extended look at Elden Ring and a January 2022 release date. The last morsel of news after that came last month when FromSoftware announced that Elden Ring had been delayed to February 25 and that closed network tests would happen this month. 
Now, it seems FromSoftware is ready to show some more of Elden Ring’s mysterious world. Tomorrow, the studio will release a “15-minute glimpse” of gameplay at 7 a.m. PDT/10 a.m. EST. 
Join us for a 15-minute glimpse of #ELDENRING gameplay on November 4th at 3 PM CET/7 AM PDT
https://t.co/yNnvFmV3ky
https://t.co/jFFOwDSEfr
November 3, 2021
As for what to expect, it’s anybody’s guess at this point, but 15 minutes is a meaty chunk of gameplay. We’ll likely see some of the horseback traversal featured in the game, some of its unique combat, and if one thing is certain, a horrific boss fight that will have everyone shaking in their armored boots. 
Only time will tell. Elden Ring will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 25. 
For more about it, read about how Elden Ring features a map and fast travel, and then check out this story about how the Moonlight Greatsword might be in the game. Read Game Informer’s breakdown of everything we know about Elden Ring after that.

Sakurai only just revealed Ultimate’s final fighter, Sora from Kingdom Hearts, last month and after over three years of DLC development, it was presumed that Sakurai would take a well-earned rest. It seems he’s doing that, but it hasn’t stopped him from speculating on the future of the Smash Bros. series.
In an issue of Japanese magazine Famitsu, Sakurai said he’s not currently thinking about a sequel to Ultimate, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 
“I’m not thinking about a sequel,” Sakurai said to Famitsu. “But I can’t say that this is definitely the last Smash Bros.”

Admittedly, it makes for an intriguing premise in this tale of conquest and demonic shakedowns, but don't be fooled. While its core systems take inspiration from 3D platformers of the N64 era, Demon Turf isn’t another Banjo Kazooie successor like publisher Playtonic's Yooka-Laylee. You’ll find those familiar cliches, sure, but there’s something great about Fabraz’s latest effort that goes beyond its unique visuals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Platinum Games’ vertical shoot ‘em up, Sol Cresta, which is a resurrection of a series over 30 years old, has been delayed.
This news comes by way of Platinum Games’ “Sol Cresta: Hideki Kamiya’s Very Sorry Stream,” which aired today, as reported by Eurogamer. The stream featured new gameplay of Sol Cresta, but Platinum's chief game designer, Kamiya, also revealed that it would miss its December release date.

Kamiya said he does not have a new release date to reveal just yet, but he hopes to announce it early next year. 
Back when Sol Cresta was announced, it was revealed as a successor to Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta, vertical-scrolling arcade games originally developed by Nichibutsu. Sol Cresta will follow in the footsteps of previous Cresta games in that it will feature spaceships flying through galaxies, taking out enemies, and more in classic vertical-shooter arcade fashion. It will also allow players to dock with allies, just like the original games did nearly 40 years ago. 
At the time of Sol Cresta’s announcement back in August, Kamiya said “we want to make all kinds of games...not just action games.” Platinum Games is perhaps best known for what it does on the action side of gaming – Nier Automata, Astral Chain, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, to name a few – but it seems the studio is using Sol Cresta to prove it can do vertical shooters, too. 
As noted by Eurogamer, Kamiya’s stream featured gameplay of Sol Cresta’s new Caravan Mode, which is a five-minute score attack mode. Kamiya also debuted its opening cutscene, too. 
Sol Cresta was originally set to hit PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and PC on December 9, but is now delayed to an unannounced date sometime in the future.

At the time, no cable provider liked the idea enough to make it happen, but I think about the story a lot. I think about it on days like today, on which Twitch has just introduced a new "Animals, Aquariums, and Zoos" category to the livestreaming platform.

That’s November 4 if you don’t have a calendar nearby. In terms of specific platforms, Repentance is coming to PlayStation 5 and 4, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch. If you’re feeling left out on Xbox One, McMillen assured players the game will hit that console “not long after.” He also says to expect the physical retail versions down the line too.

The Binding of Isaac: Repentance launched on PC this past March. Though not a sequel, it’s a massive expansion to the original game (as well as its final update) that adds dozens of features and quality-of-life improvements. These include over 130 new items, over 5,000 new room designs, 100 additional enemies, and over 25 new bosses. You can also control two new playable characters and earn over 100 added achievements. Repentance even boasts a full alternate path with new chapters, final boss, and ending.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While playing a game may sometimes be a short experience for players, hundreds, if not thousands, of work hours created it, even more so for longer titles. Game development is complicated, and crossing the finish line to hit release is a feat unto itself. 
However, sadly, not every game makes it across that line. A few end up somewhere informally known as “development hell.” It’s here that games might reside for months, years, or in some rare cases, over a decade. In Part 1 of this development hell series, we detailed the development history and path to development hell for five games – Pikmin 4, Skull & Bones, Beyond Good and Evil 2, In the Valley of Gods, and Dead Island 2 – and below, in Part 2, we’ll examine five more.

Snorlax is known to slumber wherever it wants, usually blocking the paths up-and-coming trainers need to cross to continue their journey. Coaxing a Snorlax to wake up and get out of the way isn't easy and usually requires the melody of a special flute to do the heavy lifting. This situation looks quite a bit different than your usual sleepover, though. It may be dangerous, innocuous, or even nefarious, but that's up to you, dear reader! 
We'd love to hear what you think is happening in the image above involving the passed-out Snorlax on the train tracks with Yamper and Machamp surrounding the behemoth. Give us your best story in the comments!
You can work with the above picture to build your description of what in tarnation is happening. Below you can see three more angles at the scene, giving more context but begs even more questions like: 
Does Machamp think he can stop a speeding train with just a sign?

If you're interested in owning this figure, it's called the Delibird Holiday Express Snorlax Pass figure, one of many new holiday-themed items on the Pokémon Center online store. Two other figures complement the Snorlax Pass piece, but please don't use those as part of your narrative in the comments. It's far more fun to hear what creative ideas you come up with!

Before the launch of Marvel’s Avengers, Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics released a blog post in August of 2020 that stated: “content purchasable with real money in Marvel’s Avengers will be aesthetic-only additions.” Then, around the start of last month, paid XP boosts had been quietly introduced to the Avengers marketplace, and, as expected, players were not happy, as first reported by Video Games Chronicle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coping with death and the grief that follows it is challenging and one of the few experiences everyone confronts sooner or later. How to Say Goodbye, an enchanting puzzle game from one of the minds of Monument Valley 2, finds an adorable, perhaps more palatable avenue for accepting loss. 
Players explore a world filled with spirits as the ghost of a recently departed person. According to publisher Arte France, the goal is to escape the “liminal space between life and death in which they are trapped.” That means sliding the floor and surrounding decor to guide the ghost through tricky environments to an exit. The grid-based areas allow horizontal and vertical movement, but you’ll also have to contend with dark spirits hindering your paths. Since many of the spirits are still grappling with the reality of their demise, escaping symbolizes the acceptance of your death by allowing yourself to move on.

How to Say Goodbye Comes from Florian Veltman, formerly a designer on Monument Valley 2 and Assemble with Care, and Baptiste Portefaix, an award-winning sound designer and composer. The game’s art direction draws inspiration from illustrated children’s books such as The Moomins, The Little Prince, and Where The Wild Things Are. How to Say Goodbye arrives sometime in 2022 for PC and Mac.

The company’s latest AR title, Pikmin Bloom, just launched this week. Today, though, Niantic and Portkey Games have announced that Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, one of the many AR games that launched over the years, will shut down on January 31, 2022. Before that, though, Wizards Unite will be removed from the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and the Samsung Galaxy Store on December 6. In-app purchases will end on that day as well.

This news comes by way of a new Bloomberg report that details Microsoft’s overall metaverse plans, which will reportedly include PowerPoint and Excel in a 3D virtual space. This news comes just days after Facebook announced that it was creating its own metaverse, going as far as to change its actual name to Meta, as reported by The Verge.
Facebook’s metaverse course also includes gaming, namely in its Oculus Quest 2 brand, but Microsoft’s inclusion of Xbox could be much bigger as the latter is much larger than the virtual reality platform. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in an interview with Bloomberg that Xbox…]]></summary>

A standalone title, but one that slots into the original game’s main story. It feels like a DLC package that should have been released closer to the original, but I’m not going to drag developers Mimimi for tardiness - after all, this is a game where it takes me upwards of three hours to creep around a single map. Nothing about Shadow Tactics is rushed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riders Republic is a multiplayer open world sports game developed by Ubisoft Annecy, in which every single character talks like they’re your mum’s new boyfriend after they find a bong in your sock drawer. And, hey, like, we get it, y’know, we all like to “hang loose” on Tik Tok sometimes, but – at this point Gareth the 43-year-old divorcé grabs a chair, spins it 180 degrees and sits on it in one smooth motion – dope just isn’t on fleek, fam.
Insufferable cutscenes aside, this is a thrilling downhill racing simulator in which you, a new arrival to a vast landscape of snowy peaks, scorched desert badlands, towering forests and rain-lashed mud flats, must repeatedly hurl yourself down the side of a mountain faster or more stylishly than your opponents. The world is a compressed version of California with all of the San Franciscos taken out, leaving just a bizarre population of baggy jeans wearing Urban Dictionary acolytes, and a vast interconnected series of freely roamable tracks and wilderness littered with activities to complete and landmarks to discover.

Perhaps next time I move house, I should go into it with the energy of this relaxed puzzler.

With its young cast and retro, small town setting, this is a game that definitely falls into that familiar “gang of boys plus maybe someone’s girlfriend going on an occult adventure” vein of 80s nostalgia fests like The Goonies and It. But the question was, would it be an inspired homage to the Upside Down, or a cash grab with a voxel paint job designed to lure in 'the youth'? The answer, sadly, is neither.

They're often hidden in secret passages, just like collectibles, so you might struggle to find them if you're focusing on the main story.
This guide will cover where to get every outfit in Guardians Of The Galaxy, so that you can relax and enjoy the story whilst knowing that you won't miss any costumes. You won't find outfits in every chapter, so don't panic when you notice some are missing. Below, we've listed every chapter in which you can find outfits.

In this case, that person is Greg Miller, whom some (very few, probably) know from IGN and Kinda Funny. Most people would know him as the photographer of washed-up hero, Shirtless Spider-Man. 
Young Horses, the developers behind Bugsnax, excitedly tweeted out its new trailer for its upcoming Isle of Bigsnax DLC, shortly after the trailer aired during last week’s PlayStation State of Play showcase.

Be it the cost to create them, the staff needed to actually develop a game, or something else behind the scenes, a lot can happen to take it off course. While it’s sad for players, developers know best what their game needs, and time is almost always something developers could use more of. Sometimes, though, time can’t fix everything, and in those cases, games can find themselves stuck in what’s known informally as “development hell.” 
This is a term used to describe games seemingly stuck in development forever. No matter what those development teams do, more and more barriers get in the way, and all of a sudden, a game misses its release date by a couple of months, then a year, then multiple years, and in some unfortunate cases, we just don’t ever …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation Now subscribers have a new batch of games to play this month. Four games join the library tomorrow, November 2, and can be played via cloud streaming or installed directly to a console. 
Mafia: Definitive Edition headlines November’s round-up. This ground-up remake of the classic Mafia was released in September 2020 and coats the 2002 sandbox title with the Mafia III engine's paint. Don’t worry if you’re a purist; Mafia still retains its classic design, for better or worse. You can read our review of the game here. Mafia: Definitive Edition exits PS Now on February 28.
In its wake comes the goofy party game Totally Reliable Delivery Service, a role-playing classic in Final Fantasy IX, and 2017’s critically acclaimed platformer, Celeste. These three titles will be available on the service until further notice. 
The Last of Us Part II joined PS Now last month and, like Mafia, is only available for a limited time. Thankfully, you still have until January to play that one. Meanwhile, if you're more of a PlayStation Plus kind of person, here's the list of "free" games you can download beginning this month. 
Are you a PlayStation Now subscriber, and if so, what do you think of November’s additions? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Is it a grim sign of ravenous consumerism, or a welcome respite from the watching the year die slowly and painfully in its final months? As I untangled my strings of LED lights this morning, I realised that PC gaming is the most Christmassy of gamings. The colourful LEDs people cram into their PC's every orifice and pore aren't just any decoration, they're Christmas lights. That's their purpose. It always has been. Christmas is year-round for PC gamers. So here it is: merry Christmas.

The only thing I dislike is that I have no idea how to pronounce it, dramatically limiting my pun options.

Right, so, there’s this fridge in Marvel’s Guardians Of The Galaxy and no matter how many times I close it, it won’t stay shut. At first it was funny, but it’s since morphed from a sly chuckle to a howl of agony. My relationship with the game is like that thing Yoda from Star Wars says, “Fear leads to the Dark Side”.

It's important to note that it's still unclear how people will be able to play this game. There's almost no way this comes to PlayStation, so PC is the likely destination.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though I’ve been dead excited about Weird West since its announcement last summer, when the time finally came for me to play a preview build last week, I found myself unusually hesitant. Primarily, this was because I loved the game’s concept so much (“What if Dishonored and Desperadoes III had a rooting tooting baby, then let it watch way too many horror movies?”), that I didn’t really want to face the possibility that developers WolfEye Studios might have fallen short on it. But more than that, I was worried I’d have to… well, make an effort.


For whatever reason, my enthusiasm to start new games has been taking one of its periodic dips over the last month or so, leaving me in the comforting arms of old favourites I can play on autopilot. Time and time again, I’ll get right to the point of hitting play on something, before convincing myself - completely unreasonably - that it’ll probably be a load of hassle for moderate reward. And however promising a sprawling, top-down immersive sim set in a world of haunted stetsons sounded, I was certain it would involve a lot of fiddling about with inventories, reading long screeds of text, and going on sidequests.


I’m delighted to say, however, that I was completely wrong. Because while Weird West does involve all those things (and features even more emergent complexity than the hefty dose I’d anticipated, to boot) I have not had a smoother time getting into a game in a long while. The build I played only featured one of the game’s five character campaigns, admittedly. But unless the other four are all set in a Tesco car park or something, I can heartily recommend it to you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Battlefield 2042 has a new trailer ahead of its November 19th release, and this one is aimed directly at us PC folk. While the action itself is more of the near-future mega-bangs you’ve probably seen in previous teasers (or, indeed, the open beta), it’s all in service of demonstrating the PC-exclusive features: chiefly ray tracing, Nvidia DLSS and Nvidia Reflex support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've already finished House Of Ashes, you'll have seen a wee trailer revealing that the next part of The Dark Pictures Anthology will be the "season one finale", named The Devil In Me. Bandai Namco have since publicly announced the next game in Supermassive's interactive horror story series, explaining a bit more of what's going on with the animatronic corpse. Bad news for would-be survivors: it's set in a replica of the infamous 'Murder Castle', a hotel built with traps and torture chambers by American serial killer H. H. Holmes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The reason I enjoy Riot's FPS Valorant so much is because it has an excellent mixture of fun abilities and tactical gunplay, which is why I'm not sure what to make of its new character. Chamber is a French weapons designer who's set to arrive in the game's next Act on November 16th, and his abilities mostly involve spawning weapons. Not weapons you can buy normally in-game, but special weapons that he's made himself. Somehow, this feels like cheating.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hope you like animosity. Darkest Dungeon 2 will eat your eyes and call you selfish for wanting them back. The ferocity with which it treats its players shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone who clawed their way through the crypts of the first Darkest Dungeon, a turn-based homage to Lovecraft and slow-acting poison. It especially won’t surprise anyone who bled their way through the early access version of that game, either. A lot of the difficulty and madness in the sequel comes not from the dangerous creatures along its roguelike turnpike, but from the roughly shorn design of a road trip yet to be completed. This is a faithfully despondent, sometimes frustrating journey of attrition, decay and distrust. A journey you should maybe put off until the wobblesome wagon has all its wheels tightened.

While it's too early for the full schedule right now, organisers have revealed the current list of accepted games, and there are already some absolute belters. A race to beat every Dark Souls boss and Deathloop's first GDQ outing are amongst the highlights. But the one I'm most looking forward to is a blindfolded Sekiro run. I couldn't finish that game even using my eyes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the first things that may strike you about Mundaun, a very unsettling horror game that released earlier this year, is just how comfortable with weirdness it is. There are hay people hunting you in the night, monstrous masks inspired by traditional Swiss carnival costumes, and the decapitated head of the goat Allegria, bleating and chattering from your backpack. 


Many horror games either try to establish a sense of mundane familiarity in a recognisable, contemporary world before shattering that familiarity, or else rely on the dusty, done-to-death setting of haunted manors. In most cases, neither approach does much to surprise. Horror often relies on the grotesque, but Mundaun’s weirdness is different. It is an earthy kind of weirdness, a strangeness with roots so deep that it might be confused with familiarity. It’s a horror that smells not of blood, but of hay and dung, snow and soot.

Or perhaps I’ll be creeping around a haunted house in Phasmophobia, my smudge stick in-hand and a cavalcade of petrified friends whimpering down their mics. Maybe I’ll be running from Pyramid Head in Dead By Daylight with my pals in tow. A thought has been brewing in the cold recesses of my mind for a while now, and it is simply this: when did horror become a team game?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy Halloween weekend, gang! Oh, hang on, I meant to say: BOO! Alright, there we go. But the greatest horror this weekend isn't any ghost or ghoulie, it's UK clocks switching back to GMT this weekend. Sure, your phone and computer will automatically update, but your heating will be irksome until you again dig out the manual to remember how to change it. And a secondary blast of horror comes from the fact that not every country changes their clocks just yet, so if you deal with business across timezones... good luck, pal. But, what are you playing this weekend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since I witnessed a little red-and-blue plumber-man tumble into the gnashing jaws of a Piranha Plant, I knew vegetables weren’t to be trusted. I see my suspicion of all things green and floral as a natural, even instinctual thing. We ourselves aren’t vegetable, and differences so often motivate our deepest fears. The vegetal realm is entirely inaccessible to us, its behaviour strange and habitats dark. From the carnivorous Venus flytrap to the bleeding tooth fungus, from plants that smell like rotting corpses to one's that trap prey and dissolve them with digestive fluids, it’s an unknown, often dangerous world, and one that overlaps closely with our own. And it makes for a compelling game.

The adventure to save the galaxy doesn’t just involve shooting Chitauri and cracking jokes. Throughout Guardians Of The Galaxy, you engage in conversations with various characters, in which you can make decisions that will alter the course of the game. Most of these have small, fairly insignificant consequences. However, the conversation with the Worldmind in Chapter 9 could help you get some crucial help in a difficult fight later in the game.
This guide will show you the correct choices to make to convince the Worldmind that Raker can be defeated in Guardians Of The Galaxy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam user genre tags can be awful. Cyberpunk 2077 was, for example, tagged ‘masterpiece’ for months before the first gameplay trailer, while the much more reasonable and catchy ‘looks cool sure but too early to say anything definitive if we’re being adults about it’ tag was strangely absent. Happily, they are sometimes wonderful, like the tag alongside ‘comedy’ and ‘indie’ that categorises avian arsehole adventure Untitled Goose Game as having a ‘villain protagonist’. 


I’ve been thinking about villain protagonists a fair amount this week because GOG just graced our collective thinking tellies with 1996 Zelda-like Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, in all its richly overwrought, gothic, inimitably voice-acted splendour. I would estimate this news finds you, reader, in one of two categories: those who give not a fig, and those who give so many figs they are currently scrabbling the world’s few remaining fig-bearing trees, searching vainly for an adequate quantity of figs.

This planet-hopping adventure takes you on the cosmic ride of your life in an original Guardians Of The Galaxy story, involving plenty of punching, shooting, and generally jumping around with jet boots. Throughout the adventure, you'll come across many classic characters, such as Cosmo the spacedog, Adam Warlock, Mantis, Fin Fang Foom, and Lady Hellbender. However, since it isn't based directly on a certain comic storyline or movie, it can be hard to judge how long you'll actually spend playing Marvel's Guardians Of The Galaxy.
This guide will break down how many chapters there are in Guardians Of The Galaxy, and explain how long it will take to beat the game.

Fair to say some of his stuff hasn't aged brilliantly, but despite many rough edges he undeniably remains one of my all-time favourite authors. I am, after all, a self-confessed horror nerd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hesitated. Not to play The Riftbreaker, you understand. I'd played its demo last year, which was enough to sell me on playing the full game. But to cover it as a strategy game is another matter.
It does games in particular a disservice to get prescriptive with genre, but there's no question that Riftbreaker falls under 'action strategy', with an even greater emphasis on action than, say, Hostile Waters or Sacrifice. But then, it also has detailed base building, tower defence, and a tonne of resource management. I've given up trying to categorise it, and it will always be distinct from most strategy games, but I think its peers could still learn a few things from it.

That's a fantastic price for what was once among the fastest NVMe SSDs on the planet, with read speeds up to nearly 3500MB/s... before the advent of faster (and more expensive) PCIe 4.0 drives in the last couple of years. 
Still, in terms of value for money, this TLC drive with a DRAM cache is going to be hard to beat - especially as the only real competitors tend to come with QLC NAND or without a DRAM cache, both of which sacrifice performance to hit lower price points!

It's also bringing a the new Legend Ash, the CAR SMG and more, but most importantly: beach map! I had a chance to play a little of Respawn's battle royale in this new arena, and it is delightful. Named Stormpoint, it's the FPS's fourth map, and not only is it lovely to look at, but it's full of cool locations to explore and dangerous wildlife to dodge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daniel Mullins says he's not sure that "horror" is the most accurate way to describe his gruesome new card battler Inscryption. He immediately follows this up by telling me a friend of his had nightmares because of the menacing figure you play cards against, so yeah, maybe it's a bit horror-like. But I kind of understand his point. 


At the start, Inscryption is like a hostage situation, where you're forced to play a card-based roguelike against a sinister games master. Then, just as you start getting the hang of things, the game evolves into something way more complex. If you've played Mullins' other games you'll know his work can go to some weird, meta places. I won't say more above the cut, because I'd hate to spoil it. But for those of you who've already played, read on for more detail on how Mullins created an excellently unsettling world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I've heard tales of Far Cry 6 players receiving snarky emails from Ubisoft about how much time they've spent in-game. They're supposed to read as if Anton Castillo, the game's evil dictator, is mocking you for not investing enough of it toppling his regime.
And even if you've spent a lot of time clearing Castillo's map markers, he'll still send you emails anyway. They feature stats like time played, checkpoints cleared, that sort of thing. Many people don't seem to like this, which I totally understand. But a part of me wishes these rude marketing emails were more of a thing. Specifically, I'd like it if the bugs from Hollow Knight spun some my way.
