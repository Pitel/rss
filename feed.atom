        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you love World Trigger, then dive into Project Trigger with every feature in the game at your fingertips using their Trello. It’s a community wiki of every feature in the game from your races and side effects to gameplay mechanics. Here’s the official Project Trigger Trello and Discord.


Project Trigger Trello and Discord Guide


Image via Project Trigger!


Here are all the community hubs you’ll need for Project Trigger:



Official Project Trigger Trello Board


Project Trigger Discord Server


Project Trigger Community Page


Roblox Game Page



I highly recommend checking out the Trello board first as a beginner because it almost acts as a starter guide. It explains the important opening mechanics like how to get your started Trigger and then dives into the details of all features. You can find info on:



Basic mechanics and tips


All Trion colors


All Races and their stats


All side effects


All stats and details


All attachments


All quests and NPCs


All enemies sorted by rank


All gun hitboxes


All armor



The list goes on but it’s just an objective and wiki-like way to have a categorized overview of everything. That said, if you need more specific or subjective information from experienced Project Trigger players, then check out the Discord server. It’s where you can ask about community opinions on everything and get a better and more informed picture of the game.


It’s also where you can find the latest codes and tier lists. Also, it’s excellent for tracking announcements and updates. I often browse around sneak peeks and patch notes for the latest buffs, nerfs, and new content being added. The game is always growing so giveaways and special events are always mentioned in the Discord first as well.


And that’s how to access the official Project Trigger Trello and Discord. Stay tuned to Destructoid for more Project Trigger and Roblox guides.

The circular sub-machine gun certainly has a fun look, but beyond that, it's a force to be reckoned with. Guardians will want to hunt down the Barrow-Dyad for themselves, but they'll need to know how first.


While Destiny 2 players may be a bit spoiled after the ease of obtaining the Lodestar Exotic in this Episode, Barrow Dyad will take a bit more work. A multi-part Exotic Quest will take players across the system, into The Nether, and beyond to earn the chic new gun. However, before Guardians start worrying about how to get the new Exotic weapon, the first question should be how to gain access to its Exotic Quest.

The Derealize Exotic mission is here, arriving after only a week into Episode: Heresy. But the mission won't give up its secrets or rewards easily -- and opening its doors is a whole other matter.


Destiny 2 has fallen into some comfortable habits, but it's refreshing to see Episode: Heresy shake some of those up. Exotic missions typically launch toward the end of a Season or Episode, as seen with Encore in Episode: Echo and the Kell's Fall Exotic mission in Episode: Revenant. 


That's not the case with Drealize, as players won't have to wait to jump into the new outing. That said, Guardians must accomplish some steps and prerequisites before the Exotic mission becomes available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny 2 had its latest Dungeon race, but PlayStation players, in particular, got the short end of the stick. Unexpected PSN outages plagued the experience, leading to instances where some players couldn't attempt Contest mode at all. Bungie has addressed the situation, announcing that Contest mode will return another weekend.


The Sundered Doctrine Dungeon was released on Friday, February 7, kicking off Destiny 2's second-ever Dungeon race. Like a Raid race, the last two Dungeons have been released with a Contest mode, massively increasing difficulty and offering some sweet rewards to the brave Fireteams who overcome its challenge. However, PlayStation players didn't have as easy of an experience, with lengthy interruptions draining away precious time.

The upcoming sequel to the Mortal Kombat movie reboot from 2021 had been silent for too long. The studio knew it had to break the silence in the most hype way possible, and it sure did. We'd known Karl Urban would be playing Johnny Cage in the new movie for a while, but this is the first time we get a look at the character, and he looks just right. 




Anyone unaware of Johnny Cage's persona might get the impression they're looking at a regular Duke Nukem impersonator, but there are a lot of cool elements at play here. The character of Johhny Cage is a true badass, but he's also a movie star in the world of Mo…]]></summary>

Word that Marvel Rivals players would lose their hard-won competitive ranks came in a Dev Diary Post about the big mid-season patch set to drop on February 21, 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Jess Park Future Stars SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete the challenge to earn a promo item for your Ultimate Team squad.


Park is the latest addition to the promo, and everyone has an equal chance to play with the card as it's part of a SBC. To do so, you'll need to complete all the tasks before the SBC expires. Let's take a look at how you can complete the challenge, and if it's worth doing so at all. 


EA FC 25 Jess Park Future Stars SBC tasks


The Jess Park Future Stars SBC has only one task, and here are its requirements. 


Task - Jess Park Future Stars SBC



Min. 1 Players from: England


Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 85



EA FC 25 Jess Park Future Stars SBC solutions


Here's a solution you can use to complete the latest Future Stars SBC in EA FC 25. 



Any 87-rated TOTW item


Cancelo 86


Palmer 85


Simons 83


de Ligt 84


Cuthbert 83


White 84


Romagnoli 83


Grimaldo 86


Goretzka 83


Acerbi 84



The only decent part of the SBC is its completion cost, for the card is extremely underpowered. It doesn't have two playstyles+, and the stats are mediocre at best. Trickster+ as a single playstyle+ isn't effective in the current meta (unless it's the Mbappe POTM card we are talking about). She also has only 4* Weak Foot and 4* Skills, making her slightly limited in front of the goal.


Park has decent roles, and 90 Pace and 92 Dribbling is decent. However, you'll have to place her in a future evolution if you want to use her in a competitive fashion. The Morgan Rogers Future Stars SBC, in comparison, offers far more value in terms of the fodder used to complete it.

Minimum System Requirements for Avowed


If you're looking to just get in and be able and run Avowed on lower settings, you'll want to pay attention to these minimum system requirements. It looks like Avowed will be pretty well optimized, as the minimum requirements don't require anything taxing at all. In fact, the minimum recommended GPU is a GTX 1070 or equivalent which released almost a decade ago back in 2016. Here are the full minimum system requirements for Avowed:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite's Chapter 6, Season 1 storyline has you running around the map and hunting down demons. Using a Forecast Tower is among your weekly objectives, but you won't find any quest markers for them. Instead, you'll have to wait until a few storm circles pass.


Where to find Forecast Towers in Fortnite


Forecast Towers spawn around your Fortnite map just before the third storm circle is announced. They'll appear as satellite dish icons on your map, giving you their exact locations. You'll usually find two or three during each match.

However, these locations change per round. While the buildings will stay in the same spots, only certain ones will activate during your match. In other words, even if you camp a forecast tower, it may not necessarily turn on, forcing you to find a new one.


How to use Forecast Towers in Fortnite


Once you approach an active forecast tower, you'll find a large tower and a small building with a terminal inside. However, you won't be able to unlock the terminal without obtaining an access key. It's time to fight some enemies.


Screenshot by Destructoid


More specifically, you'll have to defeat enemies guarding the forecast tower. They'll either spawn right outside the tower or patrol nearby, as shown by a face map icon. They don't have much health, but they can still deal some solid damage if you fight them for a while.


Screenshot by Destructoid


The guards you encounter will depend on the current Fortnite season. While some seasons had Latverian henchmen, others, like Chapter 6: Season 1, have demon grunts and lieutenants. Upon defeating a guard, they'll drop a Forecast Tower Access Card, which you can use on the terminal to use the forecast tower and finish Fortnite's story and weekly quests.

But what about Switch 2? That's what series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto and director Yuya Tokuda were asked in a recent interview with Spanish outlet Gamereactor. While the pair obviously didn't spill the beans on any kind of Switch 2 confirmation, Tsujimoto did share some insight into the team's thoughts on the upcoming hardware: namely, they want more info too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Wilds features an absolutely dreadful spider monster - a spider that, going by preview encounters and trailers, strives for the point on the Venn diagram between Malenia in Elden Ring and the demon arachnid from Hunt: Showdown. The spider monster is called the Lala Barina. If I saw "Lala Barina" out of context I would assume I was reading about a successor to Suzuki's subcompact automobile the Holden Barina, whose brave and sturdy outline once graced the roads of Oceania. I would not picture a giant, greasy rose blossom with jet-black darting mandibles. I would not picture nests of scarlet silk and status effects literally out the wazoo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And it's stunning.
Nintendo and Lego have already dipped their toes into the Mario Kart series with some official sets, but if we're being honest, we're not overly keen on the output so far. It's just lacking some of that signature Nintendo ingenuity, y'know?
So, we were absolutely thrilled when we stumbled across this stunning Lego Mario Kart concept – built by user Bbeethoven99 – on Reddit that utilises a conveyor belt mechanism to simulate the feeling of movement. Essentially, the rainbow road track rotates around the conveyor belt, while the kart in the centre shifts left and right according to the steering wheel on the front.

But with Compulsion Games behind the wheel, the creators of the intriguing We Happy Few, I was more than willing to dive in.

Becoming Best Friends with a character happens when you reach maximum friendship with them. This could be at level 15, 20, or 25, depending on the character. Once you reach this point, they’ll stop giving you their basic resource return gifts and start giving Character Gift Boxes instead.

GAME staff have accused the UK retailer of "scalping" Pokémon cards after the company began hitching massive shipping costs to the online sale of 'Prismatic Evolutions' mini tins (thanks, Eurogamer).
These mini tins are no novelty for a TCG expansion. They contain two booster packs and a collectible coin and retail for £10.99, tidy. The problem is that GAME is adding a bulky £19.99 "Oversized delivery" fee on top of that, making the overall purchase a little less 'mini' than the name suggests.

Yes, that’s a reference to Louis Sachar’s Holes, because the book has been freshly brought to mind in light of A Game About Digging a Hole, which lets you live out your childhood inner demon's deepest desire, and absolutely destroy the back garden of a house while looking for treasure.

With the Lunar Remastered Collection just over two months away, RPG fans will be able to get their hands on two beloved turn-based adventures from the Sega Saturn and PlayStation era. Today, ahead of the game's release, publisher GungHo Online Entertainment has shared some details about the game regarding the North American release.
In a fleshed-out FAQ section on the official website, GungHo reconfirms that the game will be launching both physically and digitally, exclusively on Amazon in North America. Store pages are even up. However, you won't be able to pre-order the game ahead of its release, and instead, you'll have to buy it on release day.

Also, the urge to browse the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 mods, to see what players of the RPG were downloading most at the moment. I find there's usually a sweet spot before anything too substantial hits a game's Nexus Mods page where you can use the most popular mods as an interesting barometer to what sort of game people actually want to be playing. The theme here? Players seem to love the idea of a gritty realistic medieval game in theory, but actually secretly enjoy having the inconvenient edges sanded off.

Fantasy is about losing yourself in a world that doesn't play by the same dull rules as ours. By adding a layer of sound to the reading experience, a fantasy audiobook can turn the people and places we're reading about into breathing, moving pictures that play out in the mind like a film beamed onto a diamond screen.

One that's published by Nintendo but developed by Square Enix? And also features a handful of familiar faces from the Dragon Quest series?

Got wounded? Maybe have a nice rest at that campfire. Not too long, you slovenly wastrel! You're actually on the clock: the 'he' of the title refers to the menagerie of boss creatures that turn up after a set time.

Sony has seemingly finally made a move against some of the so-called 'eSlop' plaguing digital storefronts in recent years.
According to True Trophies (thanks Push Square), the company has removed a whole bunch of titles from the PSN store, mostly from developer RandomSpin Games. This comes after an extensive investigation from IGN, numerous complaints from developers, and our own coverage on the issue.

"Hey Steam community," goes the delightfully unadorned Steam page introduction to this simulation game. "I'm Ben, and I created this game in my spare time!". I love you, Ben. Not a "play your way" in sight. Nary a "the only limit is your imagination". Absent a venomous and detestable "easy to learn, hard to master". Just a bloke named Ben, and a hole named hole.

According to multiple reports, the next major Nintendo set could be a Mario Kart one valued at $169.99 and launching in July 2025. (thanks, Brick Fanatics). Multiple Lego leakers have apparently shared evidence of listings for this new set including the product code 72037.

Relic's new corporate partners are a holding company established by the UK investment firm Emona Capital LLP - an arrangement that apparently lets them operate like an independent studio, though I'm fuzzy on the moving parts.

With the countdown officially on (assuming it isn't pushed again, of course), Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino has taken to Twitter to share a fresh look at the game — and it's looking really rather swell.
Translated via Google, Hino prefaced the screenshot drop by stating that major information reveals for the game have been slightly delayed by issues with "compatible models and new hardware" (what could he possibly be referring to there, eh?), but the visuals and content have developed to make the upcoming title "one of the best RPGs out there". No pressure there, then.

Prepare yourself to take on the role of Thor, the god of thunder, as he battles his way through the three part game, facing enemies and challenging environmental puzzles, all to finally face down challenging end bosses, culminating in Loki himself.
The implementation in ScummVM is slightly different from the original, in that whilst it has a high score table like the original, you don't have to go through the steps of creating an account and being limited to only a single savegame. Also, unfortunately, the game uses a special music format that will need to be implemented from scratch by someone with experience. So for now, no music playback will occur, though in-game sound effects play back fine.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. The game itself is freeware, and can be downloaded from the Adept Software website. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.And please take some screenshots along the way.
Have you the skill to defeat Loki, or will you be defeated by the cunning enemies, or be stymied figuring out the puzzles. Play, and find out.

If you, like us, have been eagerly waiting for new information on Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate, then you're just going to have to be patient and wait a bit longer.
However, given that next to nothing has been shared regarding the game since its initial teaser trailer in 2021, it's understandable if you're feeling somewhat anxious about its development. Thankfully, in a new livestream (thanks, Automaton), creator Yuji Horii has stated that the development team is "working hard on Dragon Quest XII".

We didn't get early code, and our usual method of sidestepping this issue by rapidly entering the numbers and letters spelled out by our extensive collection of longhorn beetles bore no fruit. Rest assured: it's coming. Sin reviewed it for EuroVega though, awarding it two out of a possible five beetles. While she found it largely dull, she did mention that "its UI has enough potential to make some of my complaints feel patchable". Firaxis seem to agree, putting out a statement last Friday following feedback from the game's advanced access period.

If you'd have told us five years ago that Batman: Arkham Knight would make its way to the Nintendo Switch, we would have laughed in your face and waddled off back to the Iceberg Lounge.
Alas, alongside its predecessors, Arkham Knight arrived on Switch in December 2023, and though it wasn't particularly very good in terms of performance (in fact, we'd say it was incredibly poor), it was nevertheless a surprising addition to the Switch library of games.

Obviously I can't actually respond to that, so I'll just do the bad news first and if you chose differently you can always tip your monitor upside down, hang from the ceiling, or just work your way up the article from the bottom: tributary horror demake Bloodborne PSX is no more. As reported by The Verge (thanks PC Gamer), LW Media's Lilith Walther has received a copyright takedown notice from firm MarkScan on behalf of Sony Interactive, accusing Bloodborne PSX of 'digital piracy'. The game was previously available on Itch for three years without issue.
This follows a recent DMCA takedown of a YouTube video promoting Bloodborne PSX, as chronicled by noted good modsman Lance McDonald below. As McDonald mentions, MarkScan were also responsible for another recent strike against his own 60fps Bloodborne mod, which had been available without issue since 2021.

Some trivia from a person who's been in a relationship for decades: Valentine's Day comes less than a month after "Blue Monday", the most depressing day of the year according to a random travel company, and you know, I think we need more time to, as it were, switch between varieties of blueness. My picks for this week's new PC games likely won't help, assuming you aren't especially turned on by the thought of Harriet Tubman being queen of Carthage. Ah well.

The true scale of site blocking action in Europe, let alone the world, is effectively proprietary information to which the public has zero access.

As a result, three other games that have been long-running staples of the studio will no longer get any updates.

In Keep Driving, a turn-based RPG of swishing scenery and smooshed roadkill, you are on a road trip in the early 2000s that will see you gulping coffee and stuffing cheap snacks into your mouth, all in an effort to get to the other side of the country in time for the big concert. It is a hypnotically involving game of picking up hitchhikers and battling tailgaters, a pixel art drivealong with tactile, chunky buttons and perfectly suited sound effects, as much fuelled by nostalgia as it is by gasoline. At first, I thought it was too loose and open-ended to elicit any deep feelings. But then I had to sell my guitar for half a tank of petrol, just to visit my dying grandmother. Dude, this is a game that goes places.

Less blowing, actually. More taunting me from my screen maddeningly like a middle finger salute from a man with no hands. It was a baffling piece of licensed merch from Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM and Atelier, who I assume are three hyenas in a board room sniffing each other's crotches for eternity.
I couldn't tell you exactly where I first saw the bag - which has actually been on sale for a few months now - but I soon realised why it had likely entered the zeitgeist again: an extensive set of a documentary podcasts by YouTube creator The 41st Precinct, the latest of which interviews writers Dora Klindžić and Argo Tuulik for more time than I have ever spent on anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[True to the word of Capcom’s German social media marketing, Monster Hunter Wilds has a new, generally less extravagant set of PC system requirements ahead of its February 28th launch. There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.
In theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.

The studio revealed their plans in a video showing three prototypes they're currently working on. The working title for this one is "Humanity 2.0" and it'll see you carving up derelict ships to build your own vessel and sometimes defending that ship from pirates trying to take it over. It sounds like you'll still be the sweaty cybermaster of a bunch of glitchy drones, who now might suffer "fun personality quirks" when you install upgrades, "like not wanting to go down narrow corridors because it's now claustrophobic". 
Sad, busted-ass space robots just trying to get by? Yes, I'm interested.

To a normal person, adding a 2 to the end of your game's name is the sign of a sequel. But as the attendant decimal and zero suggest, it's not clear if that's exactly what he means. It could mean a revamp with new features, or some other new direction for the existing game. His later words do make it sound more like this is what EA have in mind. Or at least what they're prepared to tell folks in a financial report.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I’ve had enough of fighting the dogs in a respectable, straightforward manner, I pick them up with my mind and - with a casualness that has to be extremely insulting if you’re a dog - drop them directly off a cliff. This ends the fight immediately. Sometimes I resort to this low move out of frustration, when a dull fight has dragged on for too long. Sometimes I resort to it out of panic, because I’ve accidentally set fire to every hard surface within ten feet, or frozen myself to a wall. Often it’s just for the pleasure of it. 

In Eternal Strands, Yellow Brick Games’ debut title, you play the leader of a "weaver band", a crew of freelance magicians, in a world where something extremely bad happened to magic. Some years ago, the Enclave, a city state acting as the isolationist heart of the world’s magic, exploded in a kind of power surge - one part tsunami, one part blown fuse - and just as quickly sealed itself off from the world outside. Somehow managing to breach the wall, your band finds themselves the first people to set foot inside the ruined capital since the calamity and sets about uncovering the mystery of what exactly went wrong.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has earned Playable status on the Steam Deck, and it’s a shrewd assessment on Valve’s part: there are some shortcomings that keep the coveted Verified badge out of Deliverance 2’s reach, most notably its cramped UI, but I’ve been bumbling around the medieval RPG for hours now and it is indeed plenty functional in handheld mode. Despite its system requirements arguably suggesting otherwise, it can even manage some decent 40fps-plus performance without dumping all the quality settings to their lowest.

While Dell has got some overpriced $5000+ Alienware 51 desktops up for preorder, there other (considerably cheaper, but not necessarily affordable) options up for grabs right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vendrán Las Aves - "The Birds Will Come" - is a brief, quiet, hopeful game about burnout recovery. Summarised as a "slice of life tamagotchi" and available in Spanish and English, it's a gamejam production from Francisco Riolobos, Chuso Montero and Deconstructeam, the Valencia-based developers behind The Red String Club and The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood.
It's free to download from Itch.io, and takes the form of a snowglobe perspective of somebody's one-room apartment. The person in question has just left their job after a rough spell, and has impulsively bought a guitar. They are also, however, totally exhausted, with barely the willpower to do anything beyond getting out of bed, let alone make music. Your task is to help them through each day and rebuild their morale till they feel able to pluck a few chords.

Wreckfest 2 is the follow-up to smashing racer Wreckfest, which came out in 2018 but which I only discovered last year while listing our best racing games. My friends, it got on the list. Developers Bugbear say they have "overhauled its physics engine to deliver the most intense crashes, deeper component damage, and absolute vehicular mayhem." We can see a little bit of that in a new trailer below, which also gives us an exact early access release date.

In the course of my 51 hours as reviewer, I've encountered only a smattering of more significant technical issues. Firstly, some heavy slowdown while roaming Trosky Castle, the centerpiece of the opening Bohemian Paradise region, which I resolved by quitting and reloading. Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis. And thirdly a repeated crash bug which I feel warrants its own article given that, together with Deliverance 2's eccentric saving system, it cost me several hours of progress.

Ah well! If you’re going to play it, know that it’s also a decent performer on PC – despite the almost threatening tone of its recommended system requirements – and, as far as I can see, isn’t anywhere near as bug-prone as the infamously unstable original.

The crash, which grounded the plane by damaging its left wing, occurred after Akemann ignored temporary drone restrictions in order to survey the Palisades fires before losing control. Thanks, Eurogamer. For first noticing the case, I mean. I'm not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.
The drone was traced back to Akemann, who has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That's a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he's "hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane," write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.

Venris once told me he mods for around "eight to 12 hours a day", though, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that this cult-shepherding roguelite is now available in Steam early access. Edwin described it as "Darkest Dungeon, but you're running the dungeon". That's better than anything I could come up with, so let's stick with that.

"Frittte brings reassurance that the bag will serve your everyday needs on the toughest streets."
This nod to people whose main takeaway from Fight Club was how rad Brad Pitt's taste in shirts was is being sold by ZA/UM's collobrative merch store with company Atelier. They've previously put out things like a replica of Kim Kitsuragi's jacket. I'm not going to link them, as a pathetic act of rebellion.
As the man who couldn't afford an ambulance to get the gash on his head sewn up once said, let's try and keep an open mind about this. The bag's Dyneema fabric "is up to 15x stronger than steel on a weight-for-weight basis and provides the highest tear and tensile strength of any competing materials".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had trouble sleeping last night, due to a combination of press trip excitement, chugging too many complimentary coffees, and my hotel room being opposite a strange, insistently symmetrical building that reared over my dreams like Sauron’s penthouse. So to settle my nerves, I got up and played a game about being a horrible tree. Just the worst tree. A total shit of a tree.

A clip of loud wreckage, gunfire, and bazooka'd buildings has fallen dustily into our lap via a promotional video for Battlefield 6 (or whatever the developers plan to call the next of these large-scale first-person shooters). Mostly, it's a lot of producers talking a big game about "levelling up" the "core experience", which seems to remain blasting a building you don't like with a rocket-propelled grenade. We can tell from the final 10 seconds of the video, which show some of the game's actual running and/or gunning.

She greets him like a nobleman. I have Henry push back. He's a blacksmith's son. He might have some blue blood care of his biological father, but he grew up in the soot and clamour of the forge. The girl nervously insists, however: Henry must be from the upper crust, or he wouldn't have been welcomed and feasted by the lord of the estate. He wouldn't be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it's more than her job's worth to treat him otherwise. In a timid, not quite spiteful show of reverse class policing, she refuses to end the dialogue until she's dismissed in a manner befitting her station.

Resident Evil 4, Fallout 3, Gears Of War - all bleary examples of a grubby visual style. This peaked in Clive Barker's Jericho, a shooter so desaturated it felt like the colour settings on your monitor were banjaxed. I have heard this called "the piss filter" and generally lamented in industry circles. But it was always a puposeful choice, intended to add some grittiness to the world. And there's at least one developer who is reviving "smeared dirt" as an art direction. As Time Surrenders is a very brown stealth game that takes a lot of inspiration from Metal Gear Solid V.

Not us though, we're too busy playing games, or doing other things that are less interesting than playing games. Here's what we're all clicking on this weekend!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's no ideal time to promote a blocking system that by design restricts freedom and, for the vast majority of citizens, offers no tangible benefit. Yet, over the past 15 years or so, the major Hollywood studios have convinced authorities in dozens of countries that blocking pirate sites benefits everyone. If the FADPA bill passes, the MPA's export-only site-blocking system will be reimported to the U.S. at close to maximum strength, straight off the bat.

In the U.S., rightsholders are taking a hard line, pursuing legal action against AI companies that utilize copyrighted works without permission.  However, other countries are adopting more lenient approaches, allowing AI models to learn from the vast troves of data found in 'pirate' libraries. This 'copyright schism' could have far-reaching consequences.

Kindly Uncle EA has taken a break from his busy layoff schedule to rustle up a pair of Legacy collections that include a bunch of old expansions. It's the very first time the original Sims has graced a digital retail platform, I believe - it was first released in 2000, back when people used to access the internet using smoke signals and semaphore. Anyway, here's the reveal trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia DLSS 4 has launched under not-terribly-happy circumstances. It’s a mostly AI-powered technology at a time when mistrust in artificial intelligence, fuelled by underbaked applications and anti-creative policies, is at all-time high – not to mention how the new GeForce GPUs it’s released alongside, the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090, have immediately entered 2020-style stock shortage purgatory.
However, having tried it out in a few different games, I suspect time will prove kinder to DLSS 4 than the RTX 50 series launch has been. It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.
Here, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.

In case you missed it, the new 4X strategy jobbo is out 11th February. Developers Firaxis have now sketched out plans for updating it, which extend from the usual balancing and bug fixes to a variety of new map types, possible multiplayer features and Age settings.

It may have a splash of Dredge when it comes to inventory management too. Oh, also, a strange man might imply you are "disappointing someone". Nothing to worry about. And the ocean may or may not turn completely red. These decisions have not been finalised. Everything is okay. It is possible the fish are safe to eat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hidden away on NASA's Golden Record, an interstellar archive of music, image and sound, there is a recording of a poem by Charles Baudelaire, Élévation, which describes the astral ascent of the soul. Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out "the vast sorrows and all the vexations" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.

Yes, I'm well aware that "2.5D" and "Soulsvania" are nonsense words, woven by pestilent market forces. Samuel Johnson is turning in his grave, I expect. He has risen from his grave and equipped himself with an ironbound dictionary and is even now making his way through the layers of the English language, hellbent on slaughtering every 'vania yet coined.
But never mind Samuel. Oversized rodents and spiders aside, Mandragora is notable for being written by Brian Mitsoda, writer of the original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines and the former narrative lead for its sequel at Hardsuit Labs, which lives on in the hands of The Chinese Room. Primal have just announced a release date - 17th April. Here's a trailer.

It's a crunchy, dicey machine of vibrant world-building that sometimes forgets itself in wandering prose. A compelling universe to sail through, with more habitats and hovels than its predecessor, more stations and stellar gateways. It can't - for me - escape the dense gravity of the first game's compact storytelling and novel character building, no matter how often it funnels you from one space caper to the next. But it has a good time trying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bioware released a statement yesterday. It talked of "turning towards the future". It dreamed of "a more agile, focused studio". Nowhere in the post did the word "layoffs" appear. But this is what the post was actually about. The closest it got to addressing the facts of what happened to an unspecified number of workers is the phrase: "we don’t require support from the full studio." 
It's one of the most disingenuous announcements of job cuts in a recent and plentiful history of job cuts. A weirdly impressive feat from BioWare, considering the last two or three years have seen some spectacular verbal gymnastics from games companies when it comes to shitcanning people. Let's take a look at some of our "favourite" mealy-mouthed press releases in which people have their jobs poetically "sunsetted" rather than, say, dropkicked out the window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The layoff train has come for BioWare. A number of Dragon Age: The Veilguard staff are leaving the celebrated RPG company in the course of plans to become "a more agile, focused studio", as BioWare move ahead with the next Mass Effect game. Posting on Bluesky, senior systems designer Michelle Flamm, producer Jen Cheverie, editor Karin West-Weekes, lead writer Trick Weekes and narrative designer Ryan Cormier have all announced that they're looking for work.


All of which feels like it warrants a mention in general manager Gary McKay's recent blog about BioWare's future, but he comments only that they're "taking the opportunity to reimagine" how BioWare operate between projects, and "have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit." Which is a very slippery way to say that you're making a load of people redundant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mere hours before it’s January 30th release – wait, that’s today! – Sony have finally spilled the beans on system requirements for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, as well as the eye-blistering, GPU-rending special features that more powerful rigs can support. Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.
Granted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looks like they finally got the message. "An account for PlayStation Network will become optional for these titles on PC," said PlayStation in a short and quiet blog post that includes the upcoming PC release for Spider-Man 2, and The Last Of Us Part II. It's been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play Helldivers 2, and later Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after a rough review-bombing but the company didn't seem to fully take the hint. It looks like they've now conceded that, yes, the obligatory sign-up was an unpopular move.

"Look at my spaceship go," you say to yourself, "look how fast it crashes into that other, smaller ship." Building your own galactic snowpiercer from scratch in Space Engineers 2 will bring a smile to anyone who once revelled in clicking together Lego podracers and bashing them into one another on the living room carpet with a violence eight-year-olds should not yet have mental access to. That said, this is the precise extent of the things you can do in the game so far. Build 'n' crash. Every feature fits in this opening paragraph. There's good reason to trust the developers' ability to deliver the rest of this crafting and survival game. But right now, it's all core, no loop.

Atomic apocalypse? Ehhh. That's a roadside picnic compared to what S.T.A.L.K.S this alternately Lynchian and Tarkovskian battlefield. You'll wish you'd been dusted by nuclear fire when you're being torn open by some kind of demon puppet in a labyrinth of red curtains.


If you do get torn open by a demon puppet, the good news is that players have a range of artificial bodies to choose from. Among Phantom Line's headline features is the HUSK system, which lets you switch between members of your squad right in the middle of combat. Unless, presumably, the body in question is already occupied by one of your co-op partners. If all this sounds appealing, the even-gooder news is that there's now a demo available via the developer Discord.

You also can’t miss its regular performance hiccups, which most often manifest as little but frequent stutters that occur as you’re moseying around its poorly planet. 
Or can you? News comes via Nic himself that modder FrancisLouis, whose previous works include performance-enhancing rejigs of various games (and one that turns the Silent Hill 2 remake’s pipe weapon into a rigid, A-posing wife), has produced Fantasy Optimizer: an overhaul of how FF7 Rebirth handles shaders and streamed visuals. Both Nic and myself have tried it out on our respective rigs, and it works! Mostly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has any genus of graphics card been as dramatically storied as the GeForce XX80s? The RTX 3080 was a thing of beauty, only to be tarnished by the worst wheeler-dealing spree (and crypto mining misappropriation) in PC component history. Then the RTX 4080 rocked up with its laughable £1269 / $1199 price tag, a miscalculation so severe that the RTX 4080 Super looked good – despite hardly being any faster – simply for not repeating it. For the new RTX 5080’s sake, you almost want it to be boring.
It isn’t. But then, neither is it a blood-boiler like the RTX 4080, nor a largely aspirational show-off piece like the RTX 5090. By maintaining the 4080 Super’s course correction on price while tooling up on compelling DLSS 4 improvements, the RTX 5080 is an agreeable GPU from the off. Particularly, if you’ve got the 4K monitor to take full advantage of it.

Dazzling and exhausting. What was once a relatively (and to some extent unintentionally) lean procgen exploration sim has swelled into a game of mechs, fishing, fickle weather systems, intricate asteroid engagements, starbases, nautiloids and capes. It is far bigger than it reasonably needs to be, and it's only getting more and more, er, infinite.

Which is to say, somebody's finally made a video game version of Hex, the sentient glass hive from Terry Pratchett's Unseen University. In spooky automation-driven strategy sim Microtopia, you manage a swarm of what could either be ants who've been to the ripperdoc, or PC components who've grown legs and antennae. Your goal is to expand an insect colony that is also a motherboard, where glittering pheromone trails double as silicon circuits.
The developers Cordyceps Collective have just announced a release date - February 18th - and what's this, there's a demo as well? Catch the trailer below.

You may or may not find all that "soothing" - I won't judge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sims and The Sims 2 are getting digital PC versions with all their original expansion packs included, and should be released by the end of the week, say Kotaku. The report follows teases made by the official Sims account on X as part of a 25th anniversary celebrations roadmap, as well as a few other scattered hints in various bits of promo as collated by Redditor skyline7284. "According to a source familiar with the plans, both games will be released digitally on PC later this week," write Kotaku.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Outside The Blocks is a diorama building game so beautiful I was initially distrustful of it, as if it was some sort of dazzling carnivorous plant trying to lure me in to munch on my hands. I've had a play of the Steam demo now, and am happy to report that it's still very beautiful, and also that I still have hands: an incredible victory on all counts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The developers of free-to-play monster hunting game Dauntless have laid off "the majority of the studio" less than two months after the game's troubled launch on Steam. "Today is another difficult day at Phoenix Labs," said the company in a post on LinkedIn, which called the sweeping layoffs "part of unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations." It's the fourth time in two years that the studio has seen job cuts.

This is good news! People Can Fly have a pedigree for serving chunky gun chutney with a smile. They've also worked extensively on the series before, notably Judgement Day. E-Day itself is aiming to have a pronounced horror slant, with the 'Emergence Day' of the title referring to the insectoid Locust's first visit above ground.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In regular Darkest Dungeon 2, your mind, body and soul are fixed upon the points of a horrible mountain, looming over the inn at the end of every foetid wagon ride. It's sort of Journey for plague doctors, or possibly The Hobbit: Cosmodick Turpin Edition. I enjoy feeling the weight of those distant peaks upon my brain and eyeballs, but it's nice to fire up Kingdoms, the new free DD2 game mode that's launched just today, and have a choice of disasters to trundle toward.  


Over here is an inn being overrun by slathering beastmen. Over there is another, safer inn, but it's inconveniently perched behind a nest of tentacular cultists. In the middle there is you, with the customary DD party of half-dead, half-mad adventurers, equipped with an exciting smorgasbord of sharp edges, cursed artefacts, phobias and diseases. Let us proceed laughing and wailing to the launch trailer.

They're letting 185 people go across their European operations, and will be closing UK-based Ubisoft Leamington, whose recent projects include supporting development of Star Wars Outlaws and Skull And Bones. All this less than two months after jettisoning the hundreds of people who worked on free-to-play shooter XDefiant.

Space Engineers 2 launches into the starry depths of early access today, although it is currently limited to a single player creative mode. It's the sequel to the sci-fi shipbuilding game we quite enjoyed here at RPS. At this early alpha stage, the not-yet-a-survival-game invites players to create galleons of the galaxy, block by shiny metal block, and then drive those ships into one another at 300 metres per second.

It's a fertilized duck egg, boiled or steamed, in which you can still see the duck embryo as you munch. I'm too old to discover this acquired taste on a gap year, but I'm not too old to waltz down the horror aisle in Itch.io, throwing retro jumpscarers into my basket. Which is where first-person Filipino suspense game Hapunan can be found. You play a young street food vendor hawking the eggs on a quiet corner late at night. Naturally, something alarming is afoot.

First, there was Dynasty Warriors: Origins, which I enjoyed quite a bit. Then Ninja Gaiden 2 Black got a surprise release. Now, we're getting Team Ninja's Rise Of The Ronin this coming March - the 11th to be precise. I'd do a bit about stealth drops but I'm at the point where using game-thematic verbs makes me want to collapse on a bed of caltrops, throat first. Here's a trailer:

It's a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don't know the name of so I'm just going to call a spinny stick.
There are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can't really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I'm not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game. I am devilishly compelled by swing, like a Reefer Madness extra.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Měl jsem z toho převládající WTF pocit, který byl víceméně příjemný, protože něco takového se hned tak nevidí a bylo jasné, že tvůrci měli nějakou jasnou dramatickou vizi - i když jsem ji nepochopil. Mělo to mít nějakou jinou "message" než "když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš"? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Z "Párty Hárd" jsem byl nadšen, ale tohle jako kdyby natočil (a především napsal) někdo úplně jiný. Ano, vizuálně to vypadá o něco profesionálněji, ale jaksi se vytratila většina chytřejšího humoru a zůstaly jen "věci na jistotu" jako sprostá mluva, zvracení a fekálie. Ve filmu je mnoho víceminutových scén, při kterých se NIKDO v plném sále ani neuchechtl, a to je tohoto typu snímku na pováženou. (Ilča 40 %)]]></summary>
