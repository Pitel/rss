        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ready for some sensory overload? Bullet hell shoot 'em up Shinorubi has officially fired off a release date and is now lined up for consoles and PC on January 12, 2024.


Red Art Games previously had Shinorubi penciled in for "early 2023," but clearly time is running out to make that cut. When Shinorubi launches it will be available digitally on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam. Those looking to pick up a physical copy will be able to do so on day one for PS4 and PS5. As for the physical Switch release, manufacturing delays have pushed that one back to Q2 2024.


If you've properly steeled yourself for a full-on eyeball assault, you can see just how hellish these bullets are shaping up to be in the launch date trailer. 




The Deluxe Edition of Shinorubi, pictured below, is limited to just 300 copies per platform and available exclusively through Red Art's online store. Copies of the PS4 and PS5 versions are still available to pre-order, but the Switch Deluxe Edition is already sold out. There's also a Shinorubi Pink Edition for Switch, which packs the game in a steelbook case with a double-sided poster and soundtrack. That one is a little less scarce at 2,000 copies.

Shinorubi marks the first release from the development team at Last Boss 88, who are, as you might have guessed, huge fans of danmaku shmups. For anyone who wants a taste, the game has been in Early Access on Steam since January 2022.

You can redeem an Epic Games Store code from Amazon's website on that date. You will need to be a Prime Gaming subscriber to pick this up, alongside the other games headed to the service.

The December Prime Gaming lineup isn't that bad


Deathloop isn't the only game being given out for Prime Gaming subscribers in December. There will also be the following:


December 14



Akka Arrh 


Aground


SeaOrama: World of Shipping



December 21



Kombinera (through the Epic Games Store)



December 28



A Tiny Sticker Sale 


Asteroids: Recharged (through the Epic Games Store)



Every game other than Deathloop, Kombinera, and Asteroids: Recharged will be available through the Amazon Games app. Asteroids: Recharged, in particular, seems to be an intriguing modern twist on the classic Atari game with co-op functionality and visual upgrades.


Deathloop is worth checking out


Before the mediocrity that was Redfall, developer Arkane Studios created a unique FPS called Deathloop, which revolves around time. Like Groundhog Day, you're repeating the same day over and over, but as you explore the game's world, you'll find out more about the characters and the environments you inhabit. One plus is that you don't have to be hounded by Ned Ryerson every day.


You're also gathering intel on each of your targets while chased down by a (sometimes player-controlled)  rival. There's a lot going on in Deathloop, but it's an intriguing take on the tired genre. 


Deathloop won multiple Game of the Year awards in 2021 from outlets such as GameSpot and the Critic's Choice award from Golden Joystick. "Deathloop combines a classic Arkane stealthy-shooty foundation with a genuinely interesting and fun premise to aplomb," our review said.

Larian's RPG garnered a lot of fans, who became infatuated with the world, story, and especially its characters. Now, in Patch 5, BG3 solidifies a particular fan-favorite character as a part of the journey.


Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 5 launched this week with a ton of updates, including a brand-new epilogue. Taking place six months after the conclusion of the adventure, it lets your player character reunite with their friends and reminisce. And, in the process, remark on the lasting legacy of Bing Bong.


If you weren't following the Baldur's Gate 3 outpouring post-launch, or maybe even if you were, you might be unaware of Bing Bong. The character does not actually come from Baldur's Gate 3, originally, but from the …]]></summary>

Christmas definitely isn’t my favorite time of the year. I make the most of it, but not only am I a spiritually-devoid husk, I also once worked a job in retail over the holiday season. If you ever want a reason to give up on humanity, that’s how you do it.


So, I’m bitter about the holidays. Not only that, but I’m well-practiced at being bitter about the holidays. Maybe you are, too. If that's the case, I invite you to learn from my years of humbug-slinging and celebrate the way I do: by playing a bunch of marginally Christmas-related games that pay no respect to the holiday.

As I mentioned in my review-in-progress, there’s really no shortage of extra content for those who don’t want to leave the world of Persona 5. And if you want more Persona 5—more hijinks, gags, and general time spent with the Phantom Thieves—then Tactica can certainly accommodate that.


On top of that, it’s a solid tactics game that even has some interesting ideas. Persona 5 Tactica is lighthearted, fun, and even hits some solid notes near the end with its stance on fighting for your beliefs.

        <updated>2023-12-01T20:26:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gear up squad, we’re going to Arrakis. Activision has revealed skins for its operators revolving around the upcoming Dune: Part Two for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone Season One.




No date was attached to the announcement, but the models for the skins are shown. The characters Paul Atreides (Wonka’s Timothee Chalamet) and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Elvis’ Austin Butler) got revealed and they look… a little uncanny. They both look like they’ve had a bit too much spice, in Dune terms. It’s not known if the Oscar-nominated actors will reprise their roles, as other actors like Anthony Starr for The Boys’ Homelander or Nicki Minaj as, well, Nicki Minaj.


Dune and Dusted


You’d be right to be a little confused with the timing of the promotion and I don’t blame you. Originally, Dune: Part Two was scheduled to release on November 3. However, due to the Hollywood strikes, the sequel was pushed to March 15, 2024. The decision to delay the highly-anticipated adaptation came in late August, so it’d be too late to push them out of Season One. Still, it is weird to see the movie be promoted through, of all means, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.


Granted, Dune is no stranger to video games. For promotion for Denis Villeneuve’s epic, characters Paul Atreides and Chani (Euphoria’s Zendaya) appeared in Fortnite back in 2021. Outside of shooters, Dune sticks to strategy-style gameplay, which is befitting of the book's political landscape. Last year, Shiro Games launched Dune: Spice Wars, which made it’s way to Xbox Game Pass just recently. 


Furthermore, the series is venturing into MMO territory by the folks at Funcom with Dune: Awakening. It’s a strange but nice time for Dune fans. Hopefully, Activision will include sandworm riding in Modern Warfare 3 as a vehicle option. If you can put Nicki Minaj in the game, you can also put in sandworms.


Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is available now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S

An adaptation of Minecraft has been in the works for a while, dating back to 2014. Directors like Deadpool 3's Shawn Levy and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Rob McElhenney took turns in Creative Mode before quitting. The movie even had Steve Carell attached to star back in 2016, but he left at a later time.

Right back at the start of this year, we discovered that after inventing Waluigi, the team behind Mario Tennis, Camelot Software Planning, was planning another 'Wa' variant of Princess Peach. It was a shudder-inducing thought, we'll admit, and one that was rejected by Shigeru Miyamoto before even looking at the designs. But now, those very designs are seeing the light of day.
Fumihide Aoki, the father of Waluigi and character designer on the Mario Tennis GameCube follow-up, Mario Power Tennis, has today shared his initial sketches of "Walpeach", an evil inversion of the Mushroom monarch that was left on the cutting room floor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is one that a lot of horror fans have been looking forward to. While the game is scheduled to release sometime in the first quarter of next year, the developer GSC Game World brings us another teaser.


The dark trailer sees the return of a familiar face. Those who played the 2010 installment, STALKER: Call of Pripyat, will be pleased to see Strider will be making a return for the follow-up. The description underneath the YouTube video also has something pretty interesting and, dare I say, profound: "You cannot kill God, just as you cannot get rid of the sky above."




Hopefully, GSC Game World will be able to come to us with a more definite release date soon. For now, the new cinematic trailer should keep fans satiated for a bit.


It's been a trying time for GSC


We haven't had a STALKER game for a good while. Over thirteen years, to be precise. This latest entry was originally due for release in 2021, so a lot of people have been waiting a long time for it to drop.


Things only got worse for the studio. Being based in Ukraine, the team had to pause development on STALKER 2 during the Russian invasion, with the company relocating to Prague to complete the project. Sadly, one of GSC's developer, Volodymyr Yezhov, was killed in action last December.


As it stands, development on the new game in the survival horror FPS series continues to be in full swing. It's also the first one to ditch the developer's own X-Ray Engine and opt for Unreal Engine 5 instead. That seems to be a thing a lot of studios are doing lately.

After a big debut outing on GameCube and PS2 (the later featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry series), it got a direct sequel, a multi-console Smash-like spin-off, and side story exclusive to the Nintendo DS. 


For a while there, it felt like Joe would be around forever, and in some ways, he has. Like the cast of Capcom's similarly ill-fated Darkstalkers series, Joe got an anime adaptation, loads of merch, and multiple guest spots in crossover titles like Tatsunoko Vs. Capcom, Marvel Vs. Capcom 3, and the most recent iteration of Puzzle Fighter. 


But what's really puzzling is why Capcom let the series die after that. Unlike Okami, also developed by Capcom's former studio Clover, none of the Joe games have ev…]]></summary>

After a launch on PC earlier this year, developer Gamma Minus and publisher Daedalic Entertainment have today announced that the neon-noir crime thriller Rough Justice: '84 will be shooting its way onto Switch this month. 20th December, to be precise.
This is a game that's difficult to pin down. On the surface, this is all about detective management as you choose a team of investigators to crack cases across town, but there's more at play here. You'll be relying on the roll of dice, skill cards and practical puzzles to complete tasks in this '80s-drenched world, all of which will move you through a story of corruption, oppression and violence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First we had the Wonka-inspired Xbox Series, and now there's something that should appeal to the Brit in me. If you're from good ol' Blighty and you like the idea of your Xbox or PlayStation peripherals reminding you of this fact, Yorkshire Tea may have the answer.


With a message that we should all "press X to boil kettle," the famous tea brand has married hot beverages with gaming by selling PS5 and Xbox Series controllers slapped with the logo and that familiar imagery. These were designed by POPeART.




With the traditional countryside visuals and that bright orange background, any British person seeing these may feel a slight warmth in their heart at the mere sight of them.


I'm more a coffee person, myself


However, such warmth may not be forthcoming, as the controllers are priced at £150 each (about $190 US). Yorkshire Tea itself says the company isn't actually making money from the accessories. Another tweet says these are a "small run" and were originally going to be just a one-off idea. Then the thought struck to actually make them available to buy.


In any sense, it's possible that these tea-based controllers may not be around for a long time, but the company has said it'll be keeping an eye on what people are saying about them.


Given the price, it might be a wee bit off-putting to many of you. It's a nice idea, especially for those in your life who love tea and gaming. And now I can't stop thinking about that Yorkshire Tea ad that featured Sir Patrick Stewart.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Considered by many to be more than worth the monthly cost, Xbox Game Pass is the front-runner in gaming's fast lean towards subscription-based services. On top of Microsoft CEO Phil Spencer expressing interest in an Xbox mobile gaming store, the company's Chief Financial Officer is now keen on bringing Game Pass to... well, just about everything.


As reported by GameSpot, Tim Stuart said in a recent Wells Fargo TMT Summit (form required to access) that the goal is to one day bring the Xbox subscription service, as well as first-party titles, to "every screen." This would also include on competing systems from Sony and Nintendo.


Image via IGN.


Stuart is quoted as saying that it also means smart TVs and mobile devices, as well as "what we would have thought of as competitors in the past, like PlayStation and Nintendo." Quite what these competitors think of this idea remains to be seen at this stage, but the report goes on to say that Sony previously blocked attempts to get EA Play on its consoles.


You can't move for bloody Game Pass


It sounds like a lofty ambition, bringing an extremely lucrative Xbox feature to the PS5 or Switch. Obviously, the endgame is to expand Game Pass as much as possible, and with Microsoft now owning the Call of Duty franchise, it has control on how it distributes these games.


With that in-mind, both Sony and Nintendo may have a vested interest in making sure CoD continues to be a mainstay across all major platforms going forward. In that sense, Xbox Game Pass being made available on "every screen" could be something big tech firms might consider.


Then again, it could also just be another way Microsoft is continuing to gain a stranglehold on the prosperous video game industry. Time will tell on that front.

The new trailer shows scenes that will be familiar to anyone who watched the Japanese trailer back in September, but it's nice to hear familiar voices connected to this new footage. The trailer also gives us a chance to hear Daniel Dae Kim's Masataka Ebina and Danny Trejo's Dwight. Here's what Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has to say about the two characters.
Ebina is the de-facto leader for the Seiryu Clan, a yakuza syndicate whose current chairman is incarcerated. Dwight leads the Barracudas gang in Hawaii and supervises the world's largest counterfeit goods market, aided by his sharp sense of business and even sharper machete.

Yeah, you read that correctly. A supposed flagship title for the streaming service, the 2022 series based on Xbox's golden goose is now up on YouTube. There wasn't any official announcement as to why Halo is available. 


However, in the description of the episodes, Paramount might have let the release date for Season 2 slip: February 8. The date was removed, but eagle-eyed viewers like myself found it before it was scrubbed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Turns out CD Projekt has even more plans for Cyberpunk beyond its 2.0 update and Phantom Liberty earlier this year. During a stream detailing the update with developers Paweł Sasko and Monika Janowska, the team at CD Projekt revealed Cyberpunk will be getting a 2.1 update soon that will add a fully functional metro, radioport, replayable car races, boss fight improvements, accessibility features, and more. The update will be available December 5 (the same day Rockstar is launching the trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto), which will also mark the release of Cyberpunk 2077's Ultimate Edition.
The metro system, called NCART in the game, lets players move around the city and take in the views. The Radioport will let players listen to music outside of vehicles. The update will also allow players to to invite their in-game significant others to "quality time" together in V's apartment. The other previously mentioned updates are a little more self-explanatory, though CD Projekt did specifically mention that the boss updates were specifically applied to the late-game encounter with Adam Smasher. He is also now equipped with Sandevistan, which was seen in Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. New vehicles will be added like the Porsche 911 Cabriolet and others, motorcycle handling has been improved, and there are also technical updates like larger fonts and the option to turn off timers in the Breach Protocol minigame.
As stated, the 2.1 patch launches December 5 on all platforms. To read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review, follow the link. You can also read our Phantom Liberty review here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It won't come as a surprise to anyone considering the success Capcom has had with past Resident Evil remakes, but the company has plans for more. 


This was mentioned by Resident Evil 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Anpo at a PlayStation partner awards event in Japan, IGN reports. He doesn't go so far as to reveal which title is up next, but he does state it is something that will be announced in the future. 


According to Anpo, Capcom looks to audience responses to gauge how it should tackle remakes. For this reason, the company is very grateful for the opinions fans voice, as it helps it to "develop with the player’s opinion in mind." RE4 Remake producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi also chimes in on how the RE Engine has facilitated development. Things are looking to only improve with the engine, as Capcom has revealed that you can expect more from it, including greater ray tracing features and improved console performance.

Which Resident Evil game will get a remake next? 


Naturally, one would expect Resident Evil 5 to be the next game up. It's the third-bestselling title in the franchise, sitting behind only Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil 2. However, for players drawn in by the remakes, it may be a surprise to see just how action-focused the franchise can get. 


Fans have long hoped for a remake of 2000's Code: Veronica, though the game has received a remaster before. Resident Evil Zero is also an option and you can also pick up a remastered version of this 2002 game. 


It's a good idea to keep your eye on Capcom in 2024, as it has a few big titles planned. One of the first is Dragon's Dogma 2 which has received a March 22 release date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember Ballance? I entirely don’t. But Ziggurat is pulling it out of obscurity (maybe) and onto Steam and GOG on January 5.


Ziggurat recently reproduced another game, Boiling Point, just this past November. But while I had a lot of things to say about my experiences with that game, Ballance is completely new to me. It was released in 2004 by Cyparade and Atari to decent reviews. It apparently wasn’t completely forgotten since it got a sequel in 2019 (involving none of the original staff), and even has a Wikipedia page. 




Speaking of its Wikipedia page, it says, “The game is now considered abandonware, and neither the developers nor publishers are actively tracking its copyrights.” Not anymore! Purge your hard drives. It lives again!


Anyways, Ballance is similar to the 1984 arcade classic, Marble Madness. It’s something of a puzzle platform where you navigate a ball through hazardous mazes. I guess, to use a more recent example, it’s a lot like Super Monkey Ball. It looks pretty fun, to be honest. Nothing in the press materials says whether anything has been fixed or updated in the new release. All the footage and screenshots of it show a 4:3 resolution.


By my standards, as long as it looks fine and runs fine, it’s good enough for a re-release. However, I am unable to confirm that it looks fine and runs fine.


You can find out for yourself when Ballance gets re-release on PC via GOG and Steam on January 5, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's barely time to breathe between Steam events and sales lately. However, if you have a virtual reality headset and are hankering for some pre-Christmas gaming, you might want to check out the Steam VR Fest next week.


The latest video on the Steam YouTube channel breaks down what you can expect between December 4 and December 11. There's not a whole lot that needs to be explained, to be honest. It's a Steam event. It caters to VR games. You know the score.




As for what's involved, the teaser shows off clips from games like Among Us VR, Star Trek: Bridge Crew, Elite Dangerous, Golf It!, and Tetris Effect: Connected. How you play a virtual reality version of Tetris, I'm not sure. But these are the times we live in.


Steam work makes the dream work


While these Steam events have been pretty short, lasting about a week or a few days, many of us are still recovering from the last one. The Autumn Sale took place at the end of November, and we still have the big Winter event to come.


Can't complain, of course. I've got a laundry list of games on my wishlist that I wouldn't mind buying at a lower price. If waiting until a Steam sale is the way to do it, then so be it.


Plus, with virtual reality still finding its footing in the market, the VR Fest is a great way those who have a headset to test out their hardware. I would get a virtual reality kit myself, but I can't justify the cost. Although, with Taskmaster getting its own VR game, maybe it's time to make the leap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anticipation is high for the next Grand Theft Auto title, and Rockstar has just confirmed that we'll get to see our first official glimpse of it on December 5 at 9 AM ET. 


Rockstar hasn't said much at all regarding the upcoming game, and it hasn't been confirmed whether it will be titled Grand Theft Auto 6. Despite this, leaks and reports from reputable sources have given us an idea of what might be coming. 




According to Schreier's reports, the game will be set in Vice City, which is styled after Miami. This aligns with what we saw in the major leak in 2022 which resulted in a teen getting arrested. The Tweet revealing the trailer's debut time also seems to hint at this, as it features a background with palm trees and tropical colors. Reports and leaks also suggest that we may be getting at least two playable characters, with one being the first female protagonist in the franchise's history.

A historic moment for gaming


GTA 5 launched in 2013, leaving us with the longest wait ever for a new GTA title. The desire for a new title in the franchise is evident from the staggering amount of engagement Sam Houser's Tweet announcing the new trailer received. It has since been viewed over 183.3 million times and collected 1.6 million likes. 




Past GTA reveal trailers haven't failed to generate great hype. GTA 5's trailer currently sits at over 92 million views, and it holds the world record for the most viewed trailer for an action-adventure video game. I have fond memories of GTA 4's trailer crashing Rockstar's site, causing people to flood YouTube where they were promptly rickrolled. 


Now that Dan Houser has left Rockstar, and there are reports that the company has had a change in its workplace culture, there's no telling how the next GTA game will set itself apart from its iconic predecessors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After teasing that it would be releasing a trailer in early December about a month ago, Rockstar confirmed an exact date and time this morning. The trailer for the next be Grand Theft Auto will premiere Tuesday December 5 at 9 a.m. ET.

Rockstar shared the tweet above without any context, so it's worth noting that it is technically not confirming that this trailer will be for the next Grand Theft Auto. All it says is "Trailer 1" and a date. But, considering its early November tease explicitly read, "We are very excited to let you know that in early December, we will release the first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto," it's safe to assume that this is what the tweet is referencing.
The art of the tweet also offers the first official tease for the game's tropical setting. It has long been rumored that the next Grand Theft Auto would return to Vice City and a massive leak in September where 90 video related to the game also made that apparent.
If you're on a video game website reading about Grand Theft Auto, it's safe to assume that the excitement surrounding this game does not need to contextualized, but the previous Grand Theft Auto is one of the video game industry's biggest hits of all time. In 2018 it was crowned the most profitable entertainment product of all time.


While waiting to learn more about Rockstar's next game, read Game Informer's Grand Theft Auto V review and then read our thoughts on Red Dead Redemption II. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's gaming division is seeking continued growth, and to do that, it is eyeing the mobile gaming market. As Bloomberg reports, Xbox is talking with partners to create a mobile gaming store. 


In an interview in Sao Paulo during the CCXP comics and entertainment convention, Xbox's Phil Spencer highlights how mobile gaming is part of his team's strategy. Hence, they're "actively working on today not only alone, but talking to other partners who’d also like to see more choice for how they can monetize on the phone." 


This is not a new idea from Xbox. Spencer reveals that one of the motivations for the lengthy and pricey acquisition of Activision Blizzard King was the company's strong mobile gaming market presence through hits such as Candy Crush and Call of Duty Mobile.

Xbox's plan for global dominance 


As Xbox has made clear numerous times, it is not purely focused on hardware sales, and it also hopes to maximize the reach of its subscription services. To do this, Microsoft expanded Game Pass to 11 new Latin American countries, and this has led to an increase in customers. 


According to Spencer, Peru and Costa Rica account for almost half the new sign-ups. He also highlights how important Brazil's gaming market is, as it is the second-biggest market for PC Game Pass globally, and he argues that "in many ways Brazil leads a lot of the trends that we see globally." 


Microsoft certainly has a lot of weight to swing around but it won't be entering an empty market, as big players such as Apple and Alphabet Inc already exist in that sphere. No date is given for when the mobile store will launch, but Spencer is certain that it isn't many years away.

When we last heard word about the Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, series creator Yuji Horii said that the development was "progressing quite steadily". It was hardly the info dump that many of us were after, but hey, at least it was something (let's not forget that this project was initially announced by Square Enix way back in May 2021). Well, now Horii is back with another update, and this one feels a little more promising.
It seems that development on the much-anticipated HD-2D remake has indeed been progressing well, as the series creator announced that he recently stayed up late working through a playtest of the game.

Masahiro Sakurai has revealed that during the development of the Nintendo GameCube, he had suggested that a scroll wheel be implemented into the design of the controller.
In his latest YouTube video, Sakurai explains the reasoning behind the suggestion, stating that a scroll wheel might have several useful functions for players. The obvious is that it would allow users to move between menu options quickly and efficiently, but he also noted that it would allow for easy manipulation of an in-game camera, or for choosing between items and abilities.

Enki has big cute ears and a beaver's tail, and I wouldn't be surprised if he's related to one of those awful, many-limbed gods Flintlock's protagonist Nor Vanek is trying to slay. 


I'm sorry, it's my first time writing about Flintlock, and I realise the "OMG it has a cat!" ship has probably long since sailed. Only hang on, Ed thinks Enki is a squirrel, while Graham thinks it's a dog. Which of us is correct? Developer A44 Games describe Enki as "fox-like", further muddying the waters. There's only one thing for it: you'll have to watch the video and decide for yourself.

2023 has been quite the year to be a tactics fan with the likes of Fire Emblem Engage, Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp and Persona 5 Tactica all landing on Switch. One of the year's very best in this genre though (if you ask us, that is), is Wargroove 2, a gorgeous sequel that we described as a "must-play" in our 9/10 review. Well, it has just landed itself an update.
Released last night, this patch brings the game up to ver. 1.2.5 and introduces some tasty new features for those who are interested in some multiplayer battling. As its name suggests, the "Multiplayer Ranking Update" brings (you guessed it) multiplayer ranking to the game. This keeps things nice and fair on the online play front, with matchmaking now informed by a player's ranking to hopefully produce a level playing field.

Nintendo has now added the N64 classic Jet Force Gemini to the Switch Online + Expansion Pack service. The catch is, it appears to only be available in Japan right now. If there's an update, we'll let you know, but right now it's locked in for a "December" release here in the west.
Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter which was originally released in 1999. It stars Juno, Vela and Lupus who must put a stop to an insectoid threat. This game was also developed by the talented team at Rare. GoldenEye 007 happens to be the other N64 release in Japan this week.

It will be a worldwide launch on PC on both Steam and the Epic Games Store. Homeworld 3 will be the first title in the Homeworld series in over two decades.





“The Homeworld community has waited actual decades for this launch. We’re thrilled that their wait will finally be rewarded this March as players will be able to command the Mothership and continue their adventures. We’re grateful to BBI for their incredible work, and to the players for communicating with us and ultimately trusting us with Homeworld’s legacy. Hopefully they feel that we’ve done it proper justice.” 
- Steve Gibson, President of Gearbox Publishing

Three special editions


Also revealed were four separate editions that will be available. First is the Standard Edition which comes with the base game for $59.99, as well as the Deluxe Edition which includes the base game and the Year One Pass for $79.99.


Those interested in playing early can pick up the Fleet Command Edition which grants access to the game 72 hours early as well as the Deluxe Edition of the game and some digital goodies including a soundtrack, ship decals, engine trail color, and more. Finally, those interested in physical collector items can go for the Collector's Edition which includes everything from the Fleet Command Edition as well as a WW2-Inspired Spotted Deck, a Homeworld 3 Logo Keychain, a Lithograph, and a true-to-scale Homeworld 3 ship.


I usually can't justify the price on physical collector's editions, but I have to admit, that ship looks pretty nifty.

        <updated>2023-11-30T22:46:34.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grinding Gear Games revealed the details for the upcoming Path of Exile Affliction league. It looks like a pretty big league overall with a slew of new features, content, and updates. The Affliction League itself adds the new Virdian Wildwood, where players can work their way through a mysterious forest to hunt down the source of the Affliction.




The Viridian Wildwood


Players will encounter Sacred Wisps that beckon them into the overgrown passageways of the Viridian WIldwood. Over time the Wisps burn away the affliction that shrouds the forest, but the Wisps only have a limited amount of power. Once you return to Wraeclast, the Wisps you saved from the affliction will inhabit random monsters, increasing their power and rewards.


Overall this mechanic feels like a mix of Delve with Sentinel. You'll progress through the Wildwood in a Delve-like fashion, where it's sort of an infinitely generated map. Then, you will take the Wisps back with you to power up monsters for increased rewards, similar to how the Sentinels worked.


Wildwood Ascendancy Classes and return of Ultimatum mechanic


As you traverse the Wildwood you'll complete quests to unlock one of three new Wildwood Ascendancy classes. Your chosen ascendancy class is in addition to the regular ascendancy class, which is the first time this has happened in Path of Exile.


Also, the Ultimatum mechanic from the Ultimatum league is being added to the core game. The popular mechanic lets players undertake Vaal trials for the Trialmaster in exchange for rewards. If you defeat the trial, he gives you the option of doing double or nothing. It was honestly a very fun mechanic that I've missed, so I'm glad it's being added back in. Of course, the mechanic has been rebalanced as it was a pretty powerful way of obtaining rewards in its original form.


The Path of Exile Affliction league goes live on December 8 on PC and Mac, and on December 13 for PlayStation and Xbox.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grinding Gear Games revealed a new class that will be available in Path of Exile 2, the Mercenary. The Mercenary class features shooter-like gameplay with the ability to swap crossbows and ammo types on the fly. Alongside the class reveal, GGG also revealed that WASD movement has been added as an option to PoE2.




The Mercenary is a brand new class that is coming to Path of Exile 2, and does not exist in the current version of PoE. Based on the gameplay video, it looks like a pretty fun class similar to Demon Hunter from Diablo mixed with say a Gunslinger from a game like Lost Ark.


Fans had started to theorize that WASD movement was being added to the game after the previous Druid reveal video showed some gameplay that looked like WASD movement. Now that Grinding Gear Games has confirmed its existence, we know that you will be able to move in a different direction than you aim and attack which is huge for an ARPG. According to the GGG, players will be able to switch between click-to-move and WASD at any time.


I'm excited to see what other classes and feature reveals we get as we get closer to the PoE 2 release. Path of Exile 2 enters closed beta on June 7, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am late to walk the Path of Exile. Very late: the evergreen free-to-play dark fantasy action-RPG launched literal generations ago in 2013, the heyday of Bioshock Infinite and GTA 5. (It's still arguably the heyday of GTA 5. Bioshock Infinite, not so much.) It's my understanding that New Zealand-based developer Grinding Gears have released approximately one bazillion Path of Exile updates and expansions in the decade since, the latest of which, Affliction, is briefly detailed in a boxout down the page. 


I am not your guy for blow-by-blow descriptions of what Affliction adds to Path of Exile. My cautious summary would be: lots of terrifying trees, and lots of modifiers. I am, however, your guy for a newcomer's snapshot verdict on the sequel ahead of the closed Path of Exile 2 beta on 7th June 2024. In a twist so far-fetched they might just pull it off, the new game is designed both for returning players and newcomers, and I think a lot of that is epitomised by the just-announced Mercenary class, which reflects game director Jonathan Rogers's desire to create combat mechanics that are at once more involved and more inviting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie is almost ready to bring Lightfall's long-awaited Fireteam Finder feature to Destiny 2. But players can get in on the action a little early, as stress tests have begun rolling out starting today. 


Players logging into Season 23 on November 30 were in for a treat. An in-game message informed Guardians they could participate in the day's Fireteam Finder stress test, as Bungie previously noted in a November 22 Dev Insights post.


Today is the only day confirmed for stress testing, but it's the first chance players have to try Fireteam Finder out. Players can jump into Fireteam Finder's first stress test between 9 AM and 5 PM PST (12 PM to 8 PM EST) on November 30.


The experience is limited to Raid content, and, per the in-game notice, Bungie already anticipates the test could lead to some hiccups with game performance. That said, the pop-up also provided a method for players to report any issues they came across.


Will there be another stress test?

Right now, the only announced stress test is happening on November 30. That said, Bungie has already gone on to outline the path ahead. Following today's stress test, a Beta period will begin in December. 


Bungie hasn't specified exact dates in December just yet, but that news will likely come after this first test concludes. Bungie did note in the Fireteam Finder Dev Insights post that the Beta's start would depend on how the stress test goes. 


Following the new year, Bungie estimates that Fireteam Finder will be ready for a full release in late January. This is, of course, if everything goes according to plan. And Bungie has promised to keep players updated on any timeline changes, should they develop.

To reiterate, Furi Demake - The Chain is only comprised of the first boss battle against the eponymous 'The Chain', a jailer who acts as your first brick wall of many. The original game had 10 of said walls to smack your face into until their demise. Though, at least one kind of crumpled like a $5 camping chair.

Furi Demake is a bite-sized boss fight free on Steam


The Chain, however, did not crumple. Even though he was the "tutorial boss," it was a multi-stage fight against a monster who wanted you dead. He often …]]></summary>

One of them was Spine, an upcoming action game that asks the question: what if Sifu also had guns? The new gameplay trailer shows street artist heroine Redline punching, kicking and shooting her way through a cyberpunk-themed world of thugs and armoured guards, and her fancy footwork and the equally agile camera framing looks like it could be quite the combo when it eventually comes out in 2025. Alas, the trailer doesn't give away much else, but I spoke to developers Nekki ahead of tonight's showcase to find more about it, and how it's taking direct inspiration from Sifu and John Wick to become the next big cinematic beat 'em up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After suffering a delay to next year, we now know that the driving-focused roguelite survival game Pacific Drive is arriving on February 22.
The news comes courtesy of today's PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted. Pacific Drive is a first-person adventure that unfolds in a surreal version of the Pacific Northwest. Players drive a station wagon to explore a forest filled with supernatural threats related to a government agency’s experiments gone wrong. Check out a recent story trailer below.  


As a run-based game, the world shifts with every trip into the forest, and the only thing keeping you alive is your trusty vehicle, which you’ll repair, reinforce, and modify using materials found while exploring the unsettling landscapes. Your car will need to stay up to snuff in order to withstand dangers such as the Zone Storm, a recurring maelstrom that obliterates everything in its path, meaning players will have to outrun it to stay alive. 
Pacific Drive will be available on PlayStation 5 and PC. For more on the game, you can check out our extended preview of the game here.]]></summary>

You can't just shove any old Bokoblin-tracking canon in our faces and expect us to clap any more. Now, you have to go big. Something that really blows the lid off the potential of Ultrahand. Something like, we don't know, a fully-realised Godzilla movie created in-game...

"We're trying to make this thing as good as we possible can, and it needed a little more time in the oven," reads a statement from Necrosoft Games on Twitter. "But it'll be worth it! Please wishlist on steeeeeeam!"


The news arrives alongside a new trailer, shown at today's PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2023 showcase. The trailer features a good look at the mechanics of its turn-based tactics, as well as some glimpses of different characters that will be in your party.




School's out for demons


Demonschool is a pretty rad-looking tactics RPG, from the team behind games like Hyper Gunsport. It's been on our radar for some time, and made a strong impression when I got the chance to demo it at PAX East this year.


The story follows Faye, who's attending a university while also getting involved in a ton of occult and supernatural happenings. Between the turn-based battles, you can also wander around, pick up quests, and chat up other people.


It's really neat, and despite dashing my hopes for a last-second end-of-year surprise, I hope the extra time in the oven helps Demonschool shine. In an increasingly crowded 2024, this is still one of my more anticipated games. Definitely one for the indie and tactics crowds to keep an eye on.


Demonschool is currently planned for Q2 2024 on PC via Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer League of Geeks has revealed its Grand Strategy game Solium Infernum will be released on February 14. In Solium Infernum, players attempt to ascend the Dark Throne of Hell via strategy, intrigue, and betrayal. Solium Infernum is a reimaging of the cult-classic strategy game from 2009. We also got a look at exactly just how we'll be able to achieve that goal in a gameplay trailer.




A bit of betrayal


In Solium Inferum, players choose one of eight great Archfiends of Hell as they outwit and outmaneuver their opponents to claim the Infernal  Throne. Political and Military strategy will both be required as players bluff, backstab, and sow betrayal to climb the ranks of Hell.


Our very own Eric "The Tactician" Van Allen got a hands-on look at Solium Infernum last month and feels the multiplayer is where the real grand strategy elements will shine. 


Solium Infernum features 2-4 hour single-player matches as well as weeklong six-player multiplayer matches for those who only have a few minutes to play every day. The asynchrous multiplayer is popular among vast grand strategy titles like Solium Infernum, so I'm excited to see how well it works. A multiplayer playtest will kickoff early next year before release.


Solium Infernum launches on PC via Steam on February 14, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among Us is having a massive collaboration and players will get the chance to rock some brand new skins and other cosmetic items because of it. This collaboration includes seven popular indie games, including big names like Undertale and Castle Crashers.


Alongside those two, the other games involved in this crossover are Celeste, A Hat in Time, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Untitled Goose Game, and Alien Hominid Invasion. Innersloth, the developers of Among Us, announced this massive collaboration on November 28 and it is live now, until February 28, 2024.


There are a total of 25 hats, 18 skins, 12 nameplates, 9 visors, and 6 pets included in this crossover. With the in-game currency—beans—players can head over to the shop and purchase a Cosmicube. The Cosmicube allows players to have access to all cosmetics from each game for a mere price of 7,000 beans. Beans are earnable through gameplay, if you're finding yourself bean-less for this new cube.


Alongside this collaboration, Innersloth has also added in a number of different patches in order to improve Among Us. Since its release in 2018 and massive success it gained during the pandemic in 2020-2021, several updates have been released. The patch notes state that they’re falling behind because of all of the older versions of the game, so the team is removing older versions and encouraging players to update to newer versions for efficiency.


This collaboration will be the first update since The Fungle map was added to the game back in September of this year. The Fungle is the fifth map to be added to the game. It  features a fungus-infested jungle for crewmates and imposters to explore.

We're all having fun with Super Mario RPG on Switch, right? The return of this SNES classic has brought smiles to our faces with constant reminders of Nintendo at its weirdest, but, according to one Square developer who worked on the original title, it was almost a whole lot weirder.
In 1994, Jiro Mifune had just completed work on Live A Live (which also received a swanky Switch remaster last year) and was just about to get cracking on Chrono Trigger (which, unfortunately, did not) before he was brought onto Super Mario RPG. In the game's early development, Mifune sketched up several ideas for how the Nintendo mascot might transition into the world of an RPG and guess what, he's sharing those very sketches on Twitter!

There's some other very solid titles being added throughout December including Spirit of the North, Rise of the Tomb Raider, World War Z: Aftermath, Against the Storm, and Far Cry 6.


Here are all the titles coming to Xbox Game Pass in the first two weeks of December:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 keeps adding reasons to get lost in Night City. Now that everyone’s had time to settle in with 2.0 and Phantom Liberty, a new Update 2.1 is going to add some new gameplay elements to Cyberpunk 2077 next week. 


Today CD Projekt Red announced that the free Update 2.1 for Cyberpunk 2077 will drop on Dec. 5, to align with the release of the Ultimate Edition on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. 


Ahead of the release, CDPR is hosting a REDstreams event on Twitch at 10a.m. EST on Dec. 1. The stream will feature members of the Cyberpunk 2077 team, including quest director Paweł Sasko and producer Monika Janowska, talking about new features coming to the game. In its event listing on Steam, the company wrote, “We have a few nice surprises in this patch so don’t miss it!”


It’s hard to say exactly what features we can expect to see in the update. Cyberpunk 2077 just recently got a slew of new content and features. The 2.0 update overhauled the game’s skill trees, changed police interactions, and added vehicle combat, and Phantom Liberty added a new district and story line. 


CDPR has previously stated those were “the last big updates” for the game, so whatever is coming probably won’t be too earth-shattering. Then again, adding onto the game is a great way to build excitement for the Ultimate Edition and future Cyberpunk projects like the live-action series and the inevitable sequel. Maybe we’ll luck out and those surprises will be bigger than we think.


We'll learn more when Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.1 drops on December 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The surprise horror hit of the earlier parts of 2023, Sons of the Forest was released to critical acclaim. While the hype died down rather quickly, the game did sell two million copies in its first 24 hours. And now, Endnight's follow-up to The Forest will be coming out of early access soon.


In a post on Twitter/X, the developer said that Sons of the Forest will be getting its full version 1.0 release on February 22, 2024. This will mark one year since the game came out, so the timing is pretty gnarly.




An update on Steam says a patch will be rolling out soon (if it hasn't been done already), and the team will "continue to release hotfixes as needed." However, in the future, Endnight will be putting focus on the next stage of its survival horror sequel.


The studio is grateful for "everyone who joined" the early access


On top of that, the tweet goes on to say that Shawn Ashmore will be expanding his role as the voice of Timmy. Many of you will know him for his voiceover work on the likes of Quantum Break and The Dark Pictures: Man of Medan. Most recently, he played Tim Breaker in Alan Wake 2.


Quickly gaining popularity when it was released earlier this year, Sons of the Forest retained a high position on the Steam charts, even pushing some AAA titles to one side (Lethal Company, who?). 


With its cooperative gameplay, creepy atmosphere, and the real star of the show, Kelvin, SotF is one that many will be happy is getting its full release next year.

Developer Brainwash Gang and publisher Headup have announced the release date for the critically acclaimed 'Motorvania' title Laika: Aged Through Blood, which will land on Switch on January 11th, 2024.
Mixing the motocross-style gameplay you might find in a Trials game with classic Metroidvania mechanics and outrageous, bloody combat, Laika definitely looks like one of the more unique games we've come across in quite some time.

Things aren't looking great for Starfield - or at least, they're looking mixed, as in the Steam reviews, and verified but nameless devs are responding to negative reviews with comments that are basically like "no, our space game is fun and you're playing it wrong". We laugh about this (but also discuss the role of Steam reviews and devs replying to them). As well as that, the lads have been playing, well, the same sort of stuff this week, James brings us talk of mini PCs, and Nate makes us play Dracula or Russell Crowe. Extremely normal.

In the case of my multiplayer hands-on, that empire was the Ix'Idar, a race of burrowing insect critters with a unique resource - pheromones. Boldly disregarding the PR's gentle advice that I start with an easier-to-master race, I set out to swarm the galaxy and immediately found myself at the bottom of the victory or "Succession" point scoreboard, with one player picking off my planets by means of espionage, while others stomped my fleets of stargrubs flat in no-nonsense space combat. 


I did manage to briefly take possession of the titular Nexus, a throneworld which awards beaucoup Succession points to its owner, but it turns out fixating on the Nexus is a great way to set yourself up for a midgame dogpile - you pour resources into capturing it, sacrifice half your fleet to the first invader, then lose it all to the second. With my initially bountiful dominions rudely shrunk to a smattering of isolated planets, I took the coward's way out of the press event and said I had to be going because I had other work to attend to. I didn't at all! I just wanted to go and cry in the toilet. Alas for the Ix'Idar - not so much "lions led by donkeys" as an antfarm in the hands of a wilful toddler.

I spoke to the game’s lead designer, Sofiane Saheb, and art director, Edouard Caplain, to better understand how Don’t Nod spent over three years bringing Jusant to life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We found out last August that Sonic the Hedgehog 3 was set to hit theaters on December 20, 2024, but a new teaser gave us another glimpse at its newest star: Shadow the Hedgehog.
I say “another” because Shadow briefly appears during Sonic the Hedgehog 2’s mid-credits scene, setting him up as presumably the antagonist of the third film. While we still don’t know his exact role or who will voice him, today’s image, posted above, provides a good look at Shadow below the neck (does he have a neck?), namely his signature air shoes.

November 29, 2023
Production on Sonic the Hedgehog 3 had stalled due to the SAG-AFTRA strikes, and today’s update confirms work has resumed following the strike's suspension. Jeff Fowler remains in the director’s chair, and the returning cast includes Ben Schwartz (Sonic), Colleen O'Shaughnessey (Tails), Idris Elba (Knuckles), and James Marsden (Tom Wachowski).
Whatever the third film entails, it has one heck of an act to follow. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was a box office smash, becoming the highest-grossing video game film of all time in the U.S. until The Super Mario Bros. Movie took that crown earlier this year. A live-action TV spin-off starring Knuckles is also in the works and slated to release early next year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remakes tend to be more exciting than remasters because the improvements often go beyond mere bumps in resolution or framerate. At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window. This will be an evolving list t…]]></summary>

While Beyond Good & Evil 2 is still a no-show for the foreseeable, Ubisoft has confirmed that the original game will see a remaster next year for its 20th anniversary. And unlike BGE2, we know we’ll almost definitely be able to play it in the next 12 months, let alone the next decade, because some people are already playing it.

I rolled with the punches, fighting back against Musk's cult of personality with a bold new direction for the future of the 'chain in the second novel of my Non-Fungible Future series. Well. I had expected both books to be in your hands already (and on the bestseller list), but now my publishers are concerned by that report declaring "the vast majority of NFTs are worthless". Well then! As we say on the Infobahn: when Turing closes a crypto exchange, he opens an ICO. So in the wake of Cyber Monday, I now present to you a sneak peek at my third Non-Fungible Future novel, a mint read I call 'Worthless'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition is arriving early next year. The news was accidentally posted early to the Xbox store and was even briefly available to play (albeit in unfinished form) on Ubisoft Plus. 
According to its now-deleted Xbox Store page (which was shared by Wario64 on X), the 2003 adventure will now feature 4K graphics and 60 FPS with improvements to controls and audio. It will also feature auto-save and cross-save functionality. Here’s the full blurb:
The store page also included a big batch of screenshots of the remaster, which can view in the gallery below.

According to Ubisoft’s statement to IGN. , the store listing went up early due to a “technical error” 
"As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of Beyond Good & Evil, we're excited to share that the official launch is set for early 2024, and we look forward to sharing more with you in the new year," Ubisoft wrote in the statement. 
Beyond Good & Evil originally launched for PlayStation 2, Xbox, PC, and GameCube in 2003. It stars Jade, a reporter and fighter who joins a resistance movement to uncover a conspiracy on an alien planet. Gameplay involves taking on enemies in martial arts melee combat while using Jade's camera to take photos of clues and evidence while solving puzzles. The cult classic received its first big remaster in 2011 in the form of an HD upgrade, while its long-lost sequel, Beyond Good and Evil 2, has seemingly been in development limbo since its formal reveal at E3 2017. 
Beyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition is expected to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sněmovna dnes ve třetím čtení schválila zavedení eDokladů. Od ledna příštího roku tak již nic nebrání tomu, aby si každý mohl stáhnout svou občanku do mobilní aplikace. Úřady budou eDoklady přijímat postupně, zpočátku půjde o tzv. Ústřední orgány státní správy, postupně se pak během roku přidají úřady práce, pošty či například policie. Projekt nyní finalizuje Digitální a informační agentura (DIA).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom held a new showcase for Dragon’s Dogma 2, showing off more of the game’s fantastical action but giving fans the one thing they’ve wanted most: a release date. The hotly anticipated sequel is coming on March 22.
If that date looks familiar, that’s because it was accidentally leaked not once but twice. The first instance occurred earlier this month, thanks to a PEGI rating that revealed the March 22 date. The second leak occurred just hours before today’s presentation courtesy of the game’s Steam page. But if you missed both early reveals, today is probably a nice surprise. 
A new trailer shows off more of the game’s story while also offering up new gameplay footage. The trailer showcases the new Trickster Vocation alongside new enemies, such as the towering statue, mythical beasts, and, naturally, dragons. 


Dragon’s Dogma 2 is launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crossover skins are extremely commonplace for in-game stores in 2023, and Among Us is no different. Their latest collaborative effort introduces skins from a list of popular indie games; Undertale, Celeste, A Hat in Time, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Untitled Goose Game, Alien Hominid Invasion, and Castle Crashers. The cosmetics from all seven games will be included in a Cosmicube, which can be purchased with 7000 beans. The crossover includes 25 hats, 18 skins, 12 nameplates, 9 visors, and 6 pets. You can see a gallery of the featured skins below.

The update will also include a series of patches (which you can read right here) and will notably deprecate 2021 versions of the game, pushing players to use updated versions instead. "We’ve been supporting a lot of older versions of the game, and as it continues to grow and get new features, it gets harder to keep up," the patch notes read. "We have to remove older versions so we can focus on improving our system for everyone. Make sure you update your game and thanks for understanding!"
This is the first update to Among Us since they added The Fungle, a new map that takes place in a fungus-infested jungle. You can watch the launch trailer right here.

        <updated>2023-11-28T18:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, something odd happened in the streets of Gotham. With no prior announcement or fanfare, people booting up Batman: Arkham Knight were greeted with a skin from 2022's The Batman starring Robert Pattinson. But then, as quickly as it appeared, it was removed, all without comment from the developers. While we still don't know exactly why the skin was added accidentally, we know exactly why it was created: it's a timed-exclusive suit launching with the Batman: Arkham Trilogy on Switch.


The collection brings Rocksteady's beloved trio of Batman games to Nintendo's hybrid console, complete with all previously released DLC. The trilogy will also include the aforementioned suit from The Batman, but it won't be limited to the Switch forever – other platforms will get access to the suit "at a later date."
Game Informer, much like the rest of the gaming community, is a big fan of the trilogy, with all three games appearing on our list of best superhero games of all time. While it's been eight years since the last game, Rocksteady has been hard at work ever since working on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which is set to come out on February 2, 2024. If you want to stick to the classics, Batman: Arkham Trilogy launches this Friday, December 1.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only... compromise, calculation and license to misbehave. In Owlcat's forthcoming RPG Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, you play the free-wheeling head of an interstellar merchant's dynasty. Operating on the fringes of uncharted space, you're the owner of a Warrant of Trade that essentially lets you run your own miniature empire within the Imperium, deciding the fates of planets, amassing vast wealth and recruiting a motley crew of xenos, heretics and assorted weirdos. It's the kind of behaviour that'd get you vaporised if you were some run-of-the-mill Space Marine Chaplain, but out here on the frontier, you're allowed to act with impunity, providing you fulfil your overall mandate of adding to the God Emperor's glory and kicking the odd Eldar's head in.


Rogue Traders are arguably the only characters in Games Workshop's brutal and decrepit table-top setting that lend themselves to the role of CRPG protagonist, because they are the only characters in Warhammer 40K's Imperium who enjoy anything like the plot agency of a Commander Shepard. And with that, I think, comes an interesting transformation of the character alignment systems the game shares with other CRPGs such as Baldur's Gate 3.

The images showcase all the classic iconography you'd expect from the series, including vaults, ghouls, and power armor.
The Vanity Fair article goes on to give us the first concrete details of the show, thanks to an interview with co-creators Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan, who also created Westworld. The series will star Ella Purnell as Lucy, a "doe-eyed" woman who emerges from her vault with naivete and optimism but is forced to face the horrors of the wasteland. 
"Lucy is charming and plucky and strong," Nolan says. "And then you see she’s confronted with the reality of, hey, maybe the supposedly virtuous things you …]]></summary>

No, it's got nothing to do with teeth. According to Larian, the slowdowns are actually connected to the game's understanding of crime and morality: Patch 4 left it unable to "forget" player thefts and acts of vandalism that haven't been detected by NPCs, meaning that BG3 players who break the rules often and get away with it have been saddling their simulations with unfinished tasks. That's right, the game's latest technical crisis is in fact a crisis of conscience. Oh the  humanity!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since premiering in late October, Five Nights at Freddy’s has become a big box-office success. It’s already the highest-grossing horror film of 2023, and it has now become horror production company Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film of all time.
The film adaptation of the popular 2014 horror game hit theaters on October 27, grossing a strong $80 million in its opening weekend, the best for any horror film this year. That’s even more impressive given that it premiered on the streaming service Peacock the same day it was released in theaters (becoming the most-watched title on Peacock during its first five days). 
Five Nights At Freddy’s has continued to gain traction over the past few weeks and has now grossed over $295 million ($136 million domestically, $160 million overseas) during the month it's been in theaters. That ranks it at the top of Blumhouse’s highest-performing films, a record previously held by M.Night Shyamalan’s Split, while also climbing over top performers such as Halloween (2018), Get Out, and Glass. 
FNAF is the BIGGEST @blumhouse film of ALL-TIME. Just passed SPLIT. thanks to Emma Tammi, Scott Cawthon, cast & the New Orleans crew, the Henson team, & our partners @universalpics & @peacock. @jhutch1992, @matthewlillard, @Piperrubios, @elizethdlail
November 27, 2023


First announced in 2015 (roughly a year after the first game’s release), Five Nights At Freddy’s stars Josh Hutcherson (The Hunger Games series) with actors such as Elizabeth Lail and Matthew Lillard in supporting roles. The film is directed by Emma Tammi and produced by Blumhouse. The film joins the ranks of other highly successful video game adaptations to release in 2023, such as the other box office juggernaut The Super Mario Bros. Movie and HBO's critically-acclaimed The Last of Us.

With the series’ action built around the incredible manoeuvrability and momentum of the Omni-Directional Mobility gear, the genuine unnerving threat of the titans, and the relatively fragility of its human heroes, it’s just primed to be mined for video game inspiration.

Originally slated to launch on February 27, The Final Shape now launches on June 4. In a blog post, Bungie states that the expansion “needs more time to become exactly what we want it to be”.
“The Final Shape is the culmination of the first ten years of Destiny storytelling and, for Guardians everywhere, countless hours spent together,” Bungie writes in the post. “We want to honor that journey, so we’re taking the time we need to deliver an even bigger and bolder vision, one that we hope will be remembered and treasured for years to come.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chinese company ByteDance is best known for its ownership of TikTok, the international video platform, but it owns a number of other companies as well. One of those companies is Nuverse, a game publisher best known in the West for its work on Marvel Snap. Fans of the superhero card-battler had reason for concern this morning, as an article from Reuters reported that ByteDance had plans to leave the gaming space entirely, with intentions to "divest from titles already launched." This seemed to spell doom for Marvel Snap.
However, the official Marvel Snap X account issued a statement today that this would not be the case.
Dear SNAPPERS,
November 27, 2023
It's unclear exactly why the PC and mobile game will be exempt from any changes, but we're happy to hear that one of the best games from 2022 isn't going anywhere. However, the fates of the workers at Nuverse and the company's other games are unclear, as Reuters reports that "the decision is likely to impact hundreds of employees." The report states that ByteDance will announce this restructure sometime today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dredge was pretty weird to begin with. The indie hit somehow melded fishing with cosmic horror - seamlessly - to create an enthralling adventure where you can never be sure if what you're about to haul out of the depths will have a normal amount of eyes or tentacles. The new Pale Reach DLC gets even weirder, a masterpiece of show-don’t-tell horror that manages to evoke some of the more inspired Bloodborne monsters as well as some of icy, supernatural scares from The Terror. And it's all centred on a big whale. 


Spoilers ahead, friends, but in The Pale Reach, a massive icy landscape has suddenly appeared in the southern, well, reaches of Dredge's world, so naturally we’re off to see what that’s all about, ploughing along in our faithful fishing boat to the hostile new climate. Every path into the landmass is barricaded by imposing ice walls. It's a slog.


It’s also a great setup. We're made to instantly wonder what the hell hides in this treacherous ice field, and the answer is equally great: a massive corrupted narwhal with bulbous glowing eyes. The huge beast dwarfs your tiny ship, but mercifully it’s frozen solid in an even bigger chunk of ice, with only those very angry eyes poking out at us. Four angry eyes on one side of its head, to be very precise.

New to the Tribes series? It once went by the unofficial title of "the world's fastest shooter". On the one hand, I'm not sure that claim holds as true in the era of Titanfall 2 or DOOM Eternal or Hyper Demon or heck, even latter-day Fortnite with its rocket-powered rams. On the other hand, and to pick up the tune from Matt Cox's (RPS in peace) 2019 retrospective - WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Here's a compilation of footage from a recent playtest.

In an X post, the team behind The Medium and Layers of Fear asks for fans’ patience in regard to new information on the game while stating that development is going according to schedule. Konami announced the Silent Hill 2 remake last October with a lengthy trailer showcasing the 2001 classic’s updated presentation.

Silent Hil 2 remake was one of many new Silent Hill projects announced last October. The first one to arrive was Silent Hill Ascension, an interactive streaming series that premiered on Halloween. Other projects in the pipeline include Silent Hill f, a new mainline entry set in 1960s Japan, and Silent Hill Townfall, a mysterious title published by Annapurna Interactive and developed by No Code, the creators of Observation. A new live-action film called Return to Silent Hill is also in production by original Silent Hill director Christophe Gans.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fewer games than I'd like have captured that feeling of everything getting really out of hand. Not just getting harder, but putting you in a situation that's truly deteriorating all around you.
Last Train Home has an intriguing premise: taking the Czechoslovak Legion home from the Eastern front via an armoured train directly through the chaos of the Russian Civil War. Its unusual mixture of survival sim, RPG, tactical skirmishes, and narrative history holds together, I think, precisely because your efforts to make it all work provide such a contrast to what an incredible mess the world around you is becoming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In another lifetime, SteamWorld Dig could have easily ended up as SteamWorld Build. When Image & Form first released their 2D digging platformer back in the depths of 2013, its moreish loop of carving out rocky chasms, finding gems and treasure, then upgrading your pickaxe and burgeoning township back on the surface was instantly captivating, and its 2017 sequel continues to be one of my favourite platformers of all time. Now, a decade later, SteamWorld Build has reimagined Dig's core ideas as a handsome citybuilder, placing equal focus on managing your rustbucket town up top, while plundering its depths via an abandoned mineshaft to find treasure, resources and (most importantly) rocket parts, so you can escape your crumbling planet and find a new homestead up in the stars.
Despite the threat of annihilation hanging over the horizon, however, SteamWorld Build is one of the most relaxed and easy-going building games I've ever played. This is a game that's more concerned with keeping your economy running like a well-oiled, uhh, machine than turning a profit, for example, and it merely dips its toe in the genre's wider, ongoing obsession with building up defences to fend off oncoming hordes of malicious town hall-eating nasties. If the scales do get thrown out of equilibrium, the worst that will happen is you get lots of angry little red robot faces appearing above your houses. You won't go bankrupt, you won't get turfed out for being incompetent, and you definitely won't see any kind of game over screen if the aforementioned nasties end up running amok in your mining levels. The stakes, then, are quite low, which is probably a good indication of whether you'll get on with SteamWorld Build, and how much you'll get out of it.

The most endearing aspect of the SteamWorld series is how each of its games relates to one another despite their disparate genres. From tower defense to turn-based RPG, each title offers a unique spin on a specific gameplay experience while adhering to a shared mythos, resulting in a fun collection of games that coalesce thematically. SteamWorld Build, Thunderful's city-builder/RTS hybrid, serves as the latest iteration of this formula. Sporting streamlined genre mechanics, intuitiv…]]></summary>

It is a dreadful god of gossip and reportage, a hideous, paradiscursive entity of boundless appetite, whose Number is Infinity+1 and whose Sign is the Serrated Spiral. It's one of many abyssal denizens of a dungeon dimension outside of Time, where nothing changes and there is accordingly an apocalyptic hunger for News. My ancestors, the Brigante Celts who once ruled the misty valleys of Yorkshire, called it keno-augā-brājat, or “the cave that will never be filled”. But nowadays, we call it the Maw.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gaming laptops are a tougher proposition at a time when the Steam Deck offers portable PC gaming at a fraction of the cost. Yet while Valve's handheld is great for playing indie games and older AAA titles, there are some circumstances where it's simply not fit for purpose. It isn't really suited for twitchy multiplayer shooters, while glossy ray traced experiences are beyond its capabilities. So if you're after that kind of gaming on the go, a laptop remains ideal, and you can get a great portable gaming device for less than a grand this Black Friday weekend.

In a famous scripted sequence during which a long, green tentacle busts through a window and drags away a scientist, the scientist and the tentacle would be mis-aligned, making it look like the scientist floated out of the window of his own volition.

Not anymore. After over twenty years, Valve programmer Ben Burbank has fixed the bug - and explained how he did it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon doesn't specifically list this as a Black Friday deal. But it's certainly a bargain that you can take advantage of this Black Friday weekend. AMD's Ryzen 5 5600X processor is available for just either side of half-price, depending on which side of the pond you live on. Regardless, that's a big chunk off one of the best gaming CPUs around.


When Katharine reviewed the 5600X back in 2020, she called it "a stonkingly fast gaming CPU". It's a six-core, twelve thread processor, with each of its Vermeer processors providing speedy single-core performance, making it an ideal CPU for playing both modern multithreaded games, and older single-thread titles. There are of course plenty of faster CPUs around these days, but you'll pay significantly more for those, and it's only prudent to do so if you're looking to get the highest framerates at 1080p. If you're gaming at 4k, then it's your GPU that'll be doing most of the heavy lifting, and your funds are better spent there.


It's also worth noting that the 5600X is highly power efficient, with a TDP of just 65 watts. This makes it both more economical and more environmentally friendly that a lot of CPUs, an important consideration if your energy bills are making you wince.

But you also won't get without far it, and we are slowly heading toward the point where more RAM is preferable. This year brought a scare when Star Wars: Jedi Survivor seemingly needed a minimum 32GB of RAM. Luckily that turned out to be an error in the system requirements, but as the size and detail of video game worlds exerts greater demand on load times, RAM will become more important. And if you want to get ahead of the game(s), you can get 32GB of rock solid ram for less than £50 this Black Friday weekend.

In fact, it's pretty standard for an event all about buying cheap kit. But they are very similar monitors, which makes deciding between them more interesting. I'm referring to the ViewSonic Omni VX2428J and VX2728J.

For goodness sake, just eat it. If a meal's worth remembering, then your brain will cling to the memories of those flavours for all they're worth. Anyway, external SSDs have other applications too. The right external drive can be a great place to store games, whether that's big games that you're not playing at the moment, or just as your standard install for smaller, lighter games. If that sounds useful to you, then you can currently get a discount on the best External SSD for gaming this Black Friday.

By slicing off the rarely used numpad keys, a TKL board gives you a little extra room to wiggle your mouse, or actually put a cup of coffee to one side rather than jamming it somewhere between your keyboard and your monitor. The only problem with TKL boards is they tend to be slightly more expensive than their bulkier counterparts, meaning you often end up paying extra money for less keyboard overall. But if you are in the market for a slimmer typing solution, then right now you can get £100 off one of the best TKL keyboards this Black Friday.

Since its official reveal in June 2021, Palworld has raised eyebrows with its vibrant, expansive world teeming with dozens of monsters ripe for catching but in greater fidelity than Pokémon’s recent entries. In addition to capturing them and harnessing their abilities in battle, you can also wield realistic firearms and other weapons to blast them apart or, more hilariously, arm your cuddly critters with some serious heat.
“Pokémon with guns” has become the shorthand description of Palworld, but the experience packs in survival mechanics, base-building, a central narrative, and other bells and whistles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Videogames are full of loops. Often, the loop isn't just a loop in space but a loop of labour, a loop in time. It's a repeated task with a touch of variation from cycle to cycle, typically associated with a character progression system of some kind. The classic one is the town-dungeon loop in an action-RPG such as Diablo 4. You sally forth into the depths with sword and shield, slaughter a bunch of blameless goblins, then orbit triumphantly back to the village square with its 24/7 forge and bustling adventurer's guild. Then off you go, once again, with a Sword +1 and a shield now bearing a Goblin Magnet. There are straightforward equivalents in multiplayer, especially in the wake of Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare - sign in, play a few matches, harvest some XP, unlock a new laser sight, equip it, play a few more matches with +5% to your aim.

Miles Morales is a comic book character created to represent people of color.
Leading up to the 2008 election, which resulted in the United States’ first African American president, Barack Obama, Marvel wanted to "take a good look" at one of their icons to reimagine as African American. A few years later, when an internet campaign pushed Community actor Donald Glover to play Spider-Man, the icon was chosen, and writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli created Miles. Every iteration of the character continues this legacy of representation, and Insomniac Games’ Spider-Man 2 is no different.

Little Goody Two Shoes is a life simulator adventure dating game hybrid full of secrets and mutually exclusive options that encourage replays. Going into it blind definitely heightened the sense of enjoyable confusion, and the joy of gradually going from "is... is this gay?" to "oh this is super gay" and "is this a game about hiding secret gay relationships from the backwards villagers" to "oh this is totally about being secretly gay and also automatically covering for a witch because these people can eat it".

Our predictions are in fact not as outlandish as you might think, although there are gorillas, obviously.


Alongside this we talk about the games we're playing right now (largely Darktide, it turns out), and dish up some recommendations. We also spent like a third of our recording time playing a deranged Age Of Empires 2-themed RPG using an abbreviated D20 system of Nate's devising, but don't worry, I edited it down quite a lot. Apologies for my poor mic quality!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is admittedly unfair of me, but any time a video game reveals itself as free-to-play, my interest immediately dissipates. Free-to-play games are not universally bad; plenty of brilliant design ideas, engaging stories, and fun mechanics can be found in games with no upfront admission fee. But once a game’s goal shifts from singular experience to long-term engagement, any excitement I may have folds in on itself and disappears like Pac-Man.
It all stems from my desire for experiences, not obligations.
In free-to-play and comparable models, success is marked by player engagement. The more rounds a player queues into and the longer they play, the more likely they are to engage with the monetized elements. And the best way to encourage that engagement is to incentivize players to return. Dai…]]></summary>

No time like the present, then, to net yourself a top-quality storage extender for your Steam Deck or Steam Deck OLED.


It is of course possible to swap out the Deck’s internal SSD for something bigger, and if it were a desktop PC, normally that would be the way to go. But replacing components in a tightly-designed, hyper-compacted machine like Valve’s handheld is a far trickier business, and just doesn’t have the same appeal when a fast microSD like the Pro Plus is right there. Now, you can get plenty of extra space, an incomparably easier "installation," and performance that still comes remarkably close to NVMe SSD level, all for up to £38 off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What a charmed life the WD Black SN850X leads, if you don’t count how its existence is spent almost entirely locked inside a hot, dark box. Not only is it the overall best SSD for gaming, but it’s also arguably the single brightest highlight of this year’s Black Friday storage sales, with the spacious 1TB model down to £65 in the UK. Its US deal price of $80 also represents a sizeable $50 saving.

But it can be especially challenging if the giftee in question is a younger child who wants to play games, but is perhaps too young or inexperienced with the hobby to know what they might enjoy.

One of the most notable features is how RGG rethought its classic brawler combat. Protagonist Kazuma Kiryu now has two fighting stances, Yakuza and Agent, the latter of which comes with a host of new secret-agent tools, such as an exploding cigarette, a Spider-Man-like cable he can use to whip enemies around, and so on. 
We recently had a chat with RGG series chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto – who we spoke with last year about the future of the studio – to learn how Gaiden's new combat together, maintaining the series' identity despite how much has changed over the years, and why RGG doesn't look to…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cheap graphics cards are practically mythical these days, which is great news for gaming obsessed unicorns and centaurs, less so for us mere mortals trapped in boring old reality. But there is one last torchbearer of the budget GPU, and weirdly enough that's Intel. If you happen to live in the US, then you can get your hands on the best cheap 1080p  graphics card for a smidge more than $200 for Black Friday.


Now I know the idea of Intel making graphics cards sounds almost as preposterous as horses with horns, but they've been at it for a while. Granted, they've not been especially good at it for most of that time. The original launch of the Arc series was pretty disappointing. But Intel have worked to imrprove the performance of their GPUs, and now the Arc A750 is an excellent 1080p offering.


It's also a perfectly acceptable card for those looking to make their first-steps into the world of Ray-tracing. As James notes in his review "if you’re specifically looking to try ray tracing on the cheap, know that the Arc A750 turns the tables on the RX 6650 XT with these kinds of settings. Where the A750 produced 47fps in Hitman, the RX 6650 XT could only manage 29fps, an even steeper drop from its respective rasterised performance."

Kyle also touches on Assassin's Creed VR before the duo moves on to the main course: ranking fictional video game birds on criteria like how tasty do they look and how bad would we feel about eating them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ah, Thanksgiving. It's a time of year for gratitude, togetherness, repeatedly attempting to explain my job to older relatives, and most importantly, a time when a lot of people come together to eat one really big bird. But here's the thing. Why do we always eat the same kind of bird? I mean, turkey is fine and all, but why not branch out a bit? Why not chicken, or quail, or pheasant?
And that got me thinking – why limit my daydreaming to real-life birds when there's so much delicious-looking poultry in video games? Sure, not every video game bird would be tasty, but it's worth assessing in case I ever get Jumanji-ed into a game one day.
Here's my rating of video game birds based on how good they'd be for Thanksgiving dinner.

There’s a small handful of 13th-gen chips at good prices, but nothing on par with the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X or Ryzen 7800X3D that Will highlighted earlier this week.


I have, however, spotted a surprise £20 discount on the Intel Core i7-14700K, which just happens to be the only CPU in the new 14th-gen lineup that actually is worth buying. And so, just as it carried the Raptor Lake Refresh launch, so too must it redeem Intel’s Black Friday showing.

In my multiplayer review, I say that it preys on nostalgia, because it does! The game's multiplayer schtick is all about bringing back classic maps to act as a smokescreen for a lack of direction. At least, that's what I think.
I find all this nostalgia stuff interesting, mainly because it's coincided with three other events in my own personal timeline (Chapter 29 Season 11, you could say): A League Of Legends pro-player called Faker, the resurgence of a badminton star, and Fortnite's own OG event. The thing that separates them all from COD? A plan.

It might have more entries in it than any other series out there and it won’t be slowing down anytime soon. On top of that, thanks to its anthology-like nature, if one Final Fantasy game doesn’t click for you, there’s a good chance another one will. As a result, ranking the Final Fantasy series can be highly contentious. Everyone has a lot of love for the first entry they played, and then there are heavy hitters like Final Fantasy X and VII, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The goal of the iptv-org repo on GitHub is to offer an index of IPTV streams already freely available on the web. While the volume ebbs and flows, that generally means a library of 8,000 TV channels or more, available to users in seconds, and totally free. The project has weathered several storms over the years and thanks to Spanish football league, LaLiga, another one is brewing right now.

In Spider-Man’s case, that’s only true some of the time. But the web-slinger has had so many video games (and series of games) that he’s racked up an alarming number of “Spider-Man 2” games, so with the latest iteration currently printing money for PlayStation, it’s time to finally reflect on and rank all of them. What’s the best second Spider-Man game? The answer may mildly surprise you.

Alongside animation studio Illumination, it had teamed up with Red Wing Shoes to make Mario’s shoes from the movie, not as a line of shoes for sale, but rather a hyper-realistic version of the boots – odd proportions and all – to be displayed at the official Nintendo Store in New York City.

The interest in Mario’s shoes began with the movie’s first teaser poster, where the fidelity of Mario’s footwear blew fans away. People wanted to know more about them, which led Nintendo and Illumination to contact Red Wing Shoes, a Minnesota company specializing in work boots, about making some. “We got the call, and naturally, we’re like, ‘Well, Mario is the world’…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online's highest tier, the expansion pack, have access to an ever-growing catalog of modern and classic games, including a small library of N64 games. In December, that expansion pack is expanding a little more, as Jet Force Gemini is coming to the service.
First released in 1999, Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter developed by Rare, the studio originally known for the Banjo-Kazooie games, but most recently known for Sea of Thieves. It's set on a sci-fi alien world, where players blast through hordes of insect-like creatures.
The most recent way players could experience the game on modern consoles was through Rare Replay, a compilation of classic Rare games released on the Xbox One in 2015.  For a refresher on the game, check out this 60-second rundown Rare put out a few years back.


The Switch Online currently includes 26 other N64 games, including the recently added Excitebike 64. It also includes Game Boy Advance games, Sega Genesis games, and DLC content for popular Switch titles, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing. For the full list, check out our rundown here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the first ways Fortnite was able to prove its mainstream success was by introducing popular real-world people into the game. Whether it's Travis Scott, Lebron James, or Patrick Mahomes, it's become a sort of Hollywood Star of Fame to be featured in Epic Games' hit shooter. Today. Marshall Mathers joins the club – Eminem is coming to Fortnite. 
The Grammy winner will be added to the game's item shop on November 29. The image above shows the three versions of the rapper that will be available for purchase. From left to right, they're called Rap Boy, Slim Shady, and Marshall Never More. This release comes a few days ahead of Fortnite's Big Bang event, which is set to happen on December 2 at 2 PM Eastern. Alongside whatever world-altering event phenomena Epic plans to introduce, Eminem will be performing a live concert. Attendees will receive the Big Bang loading screen, featured at the head of this article.
Fortnite has been in gaming news a lot recently, thanks to the rollout of Fortnite OG, a record-setting new season that throws players back in time to the earliest maps in the game. It's also come under fire for new rules about which skins are allowed in certain creator-made worlds: you can see their response to this controversy here.

Alongside the streaming explosion and a system unchanged for a decade, one that critics describe as "dysfunctional", the levy now faces renewed scrutiny.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After four seasons of brand new content, Epic Games injected a healthy dose of nostalgia into Fornite Chapter 4's fifth season, officially called Season OG, by bringing back the Chapter 1 map for players to experience once more. Season OG has included weekly updates to add items from Chapter 1's various seasons, too, making it a fun romp through what Fortnite was like years ago. However, Season OG ends on December 2, which is also when Fortnite's next live event, The Big Bang, goes live. 
The Big Bang begins on Saturday, December 2, at 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, and Epic says, "This event marks a new beginning for Fortnite."

Before the event begins, Epic says players will see The Big Bang in the Battle Royale tile in the Discover section of Fortnite 30 minutes prior to its start; that way, you can jump in before the event starts to link up with friends and get your cosmetics in order. And speaking of friends, The Big Bang will support parties of up to four players. 
The Big Bang will be available anywhere you play the most current build of Fortnite, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. If you won't be near a dedicated gaming device during the event, you can check it out using Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Amazon Luna services to play Fortnite via cloud streaming on your computer or mobile device. 
"To prepare for The Big Bang, Fortnite experiences made by Epic will be disable starting 12 p.m. ET on December 2," Epic writes in a blog post. "Creator-made experiences will remain enabled until downtime for Fortnite v28.00 starts at 11:30 p.m. ET."
While waiting for The Big Bang event, read up on everything you need to know about Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG, and then read about how Epic says it's aware it missed the mark with a recent cosmetic restriction update for Fortnite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt Red released Phantom Liberty, the first and last expansion for its 2020 RPG, Cyberpunk 2077, in September. We loved it – find out why in Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review here – and if you enjoyed the base game, it's not an expansion to miss. Currently, it's only available for purchase as an add-on to Cyberpunk 2077, but if you haven't yet picked it up, it might be worth waiting just a couple more weeks. That's because CDPR has revealed Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion in one single package.
Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 5, and will be released in both a digital format and physical. Check out the box art below: 
Big news… Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition arrives on December 5th in digital AND physical form for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC!

November 21, 2023
All that CDPR has shared about this new edition is the tweet above so it remains to be seen if the Ultimate Edition includes any new goodies or enhancements. Given Phantom Liberty and the Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 update improved the game in big ways, reworking and revamping several of its mechanics in the process, it's unlikely the Ultimate Edition will include any changes in that vein. Only time will tell, though. 
For more, read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review and then read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review. After that, read about the things to remember and know before starting Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, and then check out this feature about how the team behind the expansion created its spy-thriller soundtrack. Read about this live-action Cyberpunk 2077 project that's now in the works, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yakuza: Like A Dragon was a very silly game in spite of its dramatic narrative, but its follow-up, Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, looks to give it a run for its money. Between letting Ichiban ride a dolphin and its Animal Crossing-style city-building mode, fans of the franchise’s goofball nature should be in for a treat, and a new batch of screenshots highlight this.
The images provide looks at Ichiban, Kiryu Joryu, and their returning friends, such as Nanba, Adachi, and Saeko, kicking butt in a variety of classes and looking absurd doing so. Other familiar faces will be playable party members for the first time, such as Seonhee, who is shown brutalizing opponents with a whip in the images. It's clear that Hawaii will never be the same once these guys are done with it. 


Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 26. You can learn more about the game and see it in action in this pair of trailers. Be sure to also read our review of its direct predecessor, Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, here.]]></summary>

The Talos Principle II often left me staring at my screen in awe. Sometimes, from sheer intimidation in the face of a seemingly formidable puzzle. Other times,  from my incredulous pride after unraveling said problem. But most of all, the experience regularly gave me pause as I pondered a philosophical idea or argument that challenged my viewpoints on the nature of existence and humanity’s place in the cosmos. These moments spurred me to solve the game’s 100+ puzzles in search of answers, and I’m largely satisfied with what I discovered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth arrives in February, which isn’t too far on the horizon, so Square Enix is getting players prepared with a cinematic refresher of its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake. The company pairs that with a batch of fresh screenshots and art, including the first glimpse of the Highwind airship. 
The video sees Red XIII narrate the broad strokes of the 2020 adventure. While it doesn’t touch on the finer details and background of the characters, it provides a decent summary that's perhaps better served as a reminder for fans who played Remake rather than someone coming into Rebirth completely fresh. Unfortunately, the recap doesn’t touch on the events of the Intermission expansion that introduces Yuffie, who joins the party in Rebirth, so unfamiliar players will have to do their own homework on that. 


Square has released some new images, including a piece of art depicting Aerith in front of the Highwind. The screenshots show off the town of Kalm, the summon Kujata, the abandoned Mythril Mine, and a few side characters. Oh, and Chadley is there too. 

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on February 29 for PlayStation 5. You can watch us play two demos of the game in this video and read our hands-on impressions here. You can also get the answers to some of Rebirth's burning questions in this interview with Square Enix.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 11/20/23:
Last week, developer Epic Games updated Fortnite to include a new rating restriction that applies to certain skins. Depending on a Fortnite skin, it might only be useable on a creative island with a T rating, meaning the Resident Evil Claire Redfield skin, which features a pistol in a holster on her thigh, can't be used on islands rated less than Teen. Players were upset with this change as it made skins they paid real money for (often $10 to $20 per skin) unusable in all the ways they might have previously been usable. 
Epic said only 7 percent of Fortnite skins are only usable on Teen-rated islands, at the time, but it's clear enough skins are affected to have the community unhappy with this update.
Over the weekend, Epic released a statement through the official Fortni…]]></summary>

Back in the '90s, Nintendo played faster and looser with its library of characters. Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward.

Arguably the most interesting secret boss of the original game was Culex. He is not a Final Fantasy character, but he looks and feels like one and features Final Fantasy music and sound effects.
Culex appears in Super Mario RPG remake as he did in the original game, which is to say he is a pixelated, 2D creature. He also features the original throwback soundtrack and sound effects. You access him the same way, too – by buying fireworks and trading them with the little girl nearby in Moletown for a shiny stone. You then use that shiny stone in Monstro Town on the locked door.
However, upon defeat, Culex teases another encounter in the future, which is where thin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck OLED releases today, providing a new avenue for game players (especially those with big Steam libraries) to take their gaming experience on the go. The new OLED models (one at 512 GB and another at 1TB storage) effectively replace the original release as the new Steam Deck flagship hardware. The older 64 GB and 512 GB LCD models are being phased out, while the 256 GB LCD will remain available at a reduced price.
Steam Deck OLED is not a fundamentally new platform. In many ways that matter, our review of the original still stands, and snagging one of the older LCD screen models is now an even more substantial value at the lower price. However, several of the concerns that surfaced in that review have been remedied by the new model – enough that a new evaluation is warranted.

In Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. 
Nancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.
In Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.
And if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.
The games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!
Kingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. 
Escape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.
Both games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.
To play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!
