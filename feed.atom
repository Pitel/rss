        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You'll carry over most of your stuff
Yes, there is a Xenoblade Chronicles 3 New Game+ mode.
Since a lot of people like a heads-up about how the end of the game works, you can read all about it here. Note that there are no spoilers at all, but the guide will talk about continuation options at the end of the game (hence the question at the very bottom). So come back later if you only want to know near the end.
Can you continue exploring your original Xenoblade Chronicles 3 file after your save?
Yes. After you finish the game, you'll have the opportunity to make a clear save file. Loading it up will bring you back to the area you were at before you finished the game. Clear save files will be denoted by a gold medallion in the top left corner of the file.
Just in case, you may want to save that clear file in a slot you aren't using (it doesn't really matter, but it might matter to you).
Xenoblade Chronicles 3 New Game+ carries over most of your progression
You can also opt to just play a completely new file and start the game over again. A new option will appear on the main menu right next to "New Game," for "New Game+."
Here is exactly what carries over, in the words of the game's own tutorial for NG+:
You'll retain your character growth.
All the tutorials you've read thus far will not come up again (but you can access them via the in-game menu).
All of your inventory outside of key items stay (but you will keep shards and nopon coins).
Unique monster kills will be reset (graves will revive, but if you clear them again you can see your original kill record).
Here is what doesn't carry over (and will need to be unlocked):
Chain [super] attacks
Interlinking [Ouroboros]
Key items

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We need a Bedman scent
If you ever wanted to give off the lascivious odor of the pack of fucking maniacs that make up the Guilty Gear Strive roster, then fragrance company Fairytail Parfum has you covered, from head to toe, in fact.
The cologne and perfume company has released a new line of eau de parfum products based upon the sexy, sexy stars of the Arc System Works fighter. The range launches with four specific characters: the regal and handsome Ky Kiske, the mysterious world-eater Ramlethal Valentine, super-cute Halloweenie Jack-O Valentine, and hard-edged merc Sol Badguy, who looks like he hasn't seen a shower in a year.

While the men's fragrances are seeing a relaunch, (now in larger 50ml bottles) the two ladies are seeing their respective debuts in the world of fragrance. These are not even Fairytail Parfum's first dalliance with the world of Guilty Gear, as the company has previously released perfumes based on Dizzy and Elphelt Valentine — two beloved characters who are yet to make their roster appearance in Guilty Gear Strive (which may be why they have been replaced by Ram and Jack-O in this range).
These are the new fragrance builds, as reported by the fine folk of Siliconera.
Ramlethal: Red thyme, jasmine, and peony at the top; powder, white freesia, and lily of the valley in the middle; white musk, suede, and spice at the bottom.
Jack-O: Fragrant olive, yuzu, and jasmine at the top; iris, apricot, and magnolia in the middle; musk and cedarwood at the bottom.
You can check out the full range of fragrances over on the official Fairytail Parfum website. Given the company's Japanese origins, GG fans will likely have to go the import route if they wish to pick up the new perfumes. Each bottle retails for ¥3,520, or roughly $27 USD, not including shipping.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reservation windows are moving on up
Valve has a new update on Steam Deck production, and it's some good news. The company announced today that it's fulfilling demand sooner than estimated, and so it's bumping up reservation spots for those in the queue.
The supply chain shortfalls that initially affected Steam Deck production have been gradually clearing up, and Valve says it is continuing to ramp up its output. According to Valve, the company is able to produce Decks faster than ever before.
Everyone who is currently in the reservation queue will get their Steam Deck email this year. And many customers who were previously in the Q4 or later window have been bumped up to Q3. That window ranges from July to September. Everyone else will fall in the Q4, or October to December, range.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWgZhMtlWo
Right now, any new observations will be put in the Q4 bucket. If those fill up, reservations will continue to spill over into the following quarter. Those who have a Deck locked in can check their reservation window on the site.
Much more on Deck
With more of the Steam Decks rolling off the line, this is good news for those still waiting on their portable PC. The company had previously said it was looking to up its production and distribution, and it looks like those efforts bore out well.
The official Steam Deck dock is a bit of a different story, as the official hardware was indefinitely delayed a few months ago. For those getting their Steam Decks in, third-party seems like it will be the way to go for a while. I wound up grabbing a powered hub online, and it's been working pretty well while I wait for the real deal to be available.
Also, for those getting a Steam Deck in, be sure to be careful with any hardware mods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the age of years-long development cycles, it seems miraculous that Wolfenstein 3D, a game that spawned the modern-day FPS as we know it, was developed by six people in just six months. The story of Wolfenstein 3D’s development makes for a fascinating time capsule of those early days of game development - a milestone in gaming history that underlines just how much the industry has grown over the decades since.
But that’s getting ahead of ourselves a bit. The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.

Some of my fondest Nintendo Switch memories were formed with multiplayer (and especially co-op) games, and if you're looking for a group activity, the Nintendo Multiplayer Sale is worth a run-through. There are about 50 discounted games on the eShop, as well as some DLC, and the deals will stick around through August 7.
You can see the full list of featured games over here, and I've got recommendations. That said, this is a digital Nintendo sale — the games are often great, but rarely cheap.
10 games to consider
Borderlands: The Handsome Collection ($15.99) runs fine on Nintendo Switch.
Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics ($27.99) is a good bang for your buck if you enjoy board and card games — and the AI puts up a fight in solo play.

Head to every canteen you can
This is something you should start making a habit of early on. When you visit a canteen anywhere (mostly in colonies, which are like small outposts/towns so to speak), buy the one meal available. It'll "unlock" it for use at regular campsites as your team cook (Manana) can now wield the recipe. Canteens can be identified on the map with a handshake symbol (which is also shared by campsites): but it'll say the words "canteen" on the screen.

But I did see two upcoming games with similar names: Bicycle Mechanic Simulator and Bike Mechanic Simulator 2023.

To backtrack for those who missed it the first time around, a player by the name of "sadfutago" was conspicuously seeking help in advancing through a church they found in Nier: Automata. The thing is, this particular part of the Copied City had never been seen before, and no one was able to replicate it.
As a potential new discovery in a well-loved series like Nier, it obviously caused a stir. Cue several days of fevered speculation, memes, and new users flooding into the Nier modding Discord.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 classes are highly customizable, as you can mix and match abilities from other classes into one synergized player-crafted build. That said, you need to unlock the ability to use a class with everyone in your party. Here's how to make sense of the system.
[No major story spoilers will be discussed in this article.]

So this is actually important to understand. Typically, party members join up as part of the main storyline, or through optional quests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our brief first look at NBA 2K23's on-court action shows off the fluidity of play and attention to detail that unfolds even after the whistle is blown. For years, this series has been lauded as a graphical powerhouse, and this teaser sizzles in this way.
We'll have to see how the footage shown breaks down as far as new gameplay features, but it would appear perimeter play is getting some of the spotlight this year. The realism in the superstars is also on display, both on the court and in how they celebrate and interact with fans.
NBA 2K23 will have three different looks on retail stands with NBA Legend Michael Jordan on one cover, Phoenix's Devin Booker on another, and the WNBA's Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi on the third. Michael Jordan's return unfolds through 15 different Jordan Challenge scenarios that recreate key moments from his career.
More details should be coming soon, as 2K Sports aims to ship NBA 2K23 on September 9 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During last year’s Game Awards, Falcon Age developers Outerloop announced Thirsty Suitors, a stylish story-driven RPG about battling your exes and disappointing your parents. Since then, the team have been keeping game details under wraps, but now thanks to the Annapurna Interactive showcase, Outerloop have released a free Steam demo, meaning now we can all have a go at beating the pulp out of our exes - a dream come true. 
You play as Jala, a young woman who just got booted out of her shared apartment after having a fight with her, now, ex-partner. With nowhere else to go, she’s decided to take the bus back to her hometown of Timber Hills to move back in with her parents (hopefully, temporarily). While she's killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life. Is she really a lost cause in love?

A Xenoblade Chronicles 3 canteen is useful for multiple reasons. It serves as a rest stop, which you can use to do all sorts of rest-stoppy things like add bonus XP and talk things over with your party for a chance at extra XP and more questlines. But the real thing that sets canteens apart from camps is the ability to learn new recipes for party member Manana. So make sure you make a point to hit every canteen you can!
Here's a very early game (like first-few-hours-early) example!

Canteens are typically found in colonies
Colonies are by and large the "cities/towns" of Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Here you'll find opportunities to gather up new quests, as well as some hidden caches (barrels full of useful items and equipment), and...canteens.

Honestly, my thoughts remain largely unchanged – which is a good thing! It's a fun free-to-play fighter that iterates on the Smash formula but can't quite emulate its predecessor's polish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a set of Unreal assets that Alice of Bees once described as "angry playmobil". I've wanted to quote that for years but had yet to play a game using them that grabbed me enough to warrant an article. Let us be thankful, then, for ADACA, an angry playmobil FPS.
It's actually two games, and I'm not sure which to call the main event. I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who's inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you're swarmed by creepy mutants. It was good enough to tempt me this week, despite a few minor niggles, but its other half, Zone Patrol, is a Stalker-esque sandbox where it really shines.

It has been a full year since the in-house focus group "A Better Ubisoft" penned an open letter to Ubisoft bosses over the reported toxicity, abuse, and harassment that is taking place within the studio's walls. And, according to comments made yesterday, not one of the group's original requests has been met.
A Better Ubisoft was formed out of both current and former Ubisoft employees, who decided to take matters into their own hands following the publishing of a Bloomberg report into a culture of sexual harassment, bullying, and other toxic behaviors at the Assassin's Creed developer. The fallout from the report lead to several resignations and repurposed positions within the studio, as well as an apology video from CEO Yves Guillemot, notorio…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["A new chapter is about to begin amidst a tangled web of factions." This line accompanies the latest teaser trailer for Genshin Impact, the incredible free-to-play RPG from miHoYo. The trailer dives into the game's fourth region, Sumeru, which is home to people who can't dream and worship the God of Wisdom.
Suermu looks lush in foliage, with mushroom creatures scurrying about the trunks of sizable trees. It also contains a desert area and looks to be just as sizable as the game's other areas.
The trailer also introduces a host of companion characters that players will meet as quests are completed. The first new character is Tighnari, a forest watcher who we see holding a magical firefly. In Port Ormos, players will run into Alhaitham from the Haravatat in the Akademiya. Further into the game, players meet Dehya of the Desertfolk, who is also a mercenary for the Emerites. There are also Nilou, a character who is pursuing art and dance, Nahida, a mysterious being, and Cyno, the General Mahamatra.
All of this content is a part of Genshin Impact's 03 update, which doesn't have a release date yet, but appears to be close, given how much miHoYo has revealed. Genshin Impact is currently available on PlayStation consoles and PC, and works just as well on Android, and iOS.
Are you still invested in Genshin Impact? If so, what do you hope to see from the new update?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has dated them for September 9
It's not often you get amiibo news anymore, but Nintendo did just that, and gave us a date for the Steve and Alex Minecraft amiibo figures: September 9. Note that this is the same day Splatoon 3 is out!
As a reminder, the duo is actually coming out as a result of their appearance in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as fighters, and will function as normal as characters that can be trained as CPUs with the figures themselves. While the jury is still out on US orders, they've been available to pre-order for nearly a year now on some Japanese marketplaces as a two-pack, including Amazon Japan (where I secured a pre-order in October). The date for some of those markets still lists "December 31, 2022" as a placeholder release, which we expect to shift soon given this news. While amiibo do not strictly follow a "global release date" system, it's typically close enough barring regional delays.
Production on amiibo has slowed down in recent years, and 2022 has only hosted the Min Min figure thus far. Soon it'll have Steve and Alex, as well as three Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak figures. As for what's left, we don't know for sure what the future holds on random and third-party tie-ins, but we do have the rest of the Smash Ultimate DLC cast to go: Sephiroth, Pyra/Mythra, Kazuya, and Sora.
As always, we have a full up-to-date list of amiibo that's been updated since 2015.

Turns out, that's because a group of fans have secretly been making their own mod tools, and plan to release them soon. In the meantime, I've enjoyed pranksters memeing on the mystery by creating secret churches in other games, including Half-Life 2 and Super Mario 64.

Sony has released its financial results for the fiscal year ending June 31, 2022 (Q1 2022), and while the PlayStation 5 platform continues to gather slight momentum on a global scale, overall the brand is seeing a general decline in customer expenditure, particularly in the realm of software and subscriptions.
The mighty PS5 has now hit an impressive 21.7 million global shipments since its launch in the fall of 2020, with around 2.4 million consoles shipped in Q1. While this number is certainly nothing to be sniffed at, it reflects an increasingly granular sales growth when compared to that of the company's previous PlayStation hardware launches. Still, the numbers are moving in the right direction, if a little more slowly than Sony had perhaps hoped.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Switch is coming later this year
I'm always looking for the next title to scratch my cozy game addiction, and it looks like the management sim Bear and Breakfast is the newest release to make that list. While I first heard about the game during the Summer Game Fest stream this year with the gameplay trailer, it was initially announced back in 2020. Players take on the role of a bear named Hank who builds and runs his own bed and breakfast in the woods, and will encounter all kinds of human and animal friends along the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USaiP4ACTB4
The developers at Gumycat said that they "grew up on management sims," and that games like Theme Hospital were a huge inspiration for them. In addition to the "usual management stuff," they also wanted to create a game that tells a story.
The premise is that humans are coming back for some unknown reason, and they need a place to stay, so Hank and his friends decide to fix up old buildings around town for them. Players will advance through Bear and Breakfast's story by completing quests that entail the aforementioned management stuff like gathering materials, crafting, building, decorating, and so on. There's even a kind of puzzle element to booking guests, making sure they have food they like, as well as some kind of creepy subplot going on, too.
The game's art style reminds me of Saturday morning cartoons in an adorably nostalgic way, and the game's comedic writing is already being praised in the Steam reviews. With an ever-growing list of games to play these days, Bear and Breakfast has managed (see what I did there?) to find a place at the very top of it. In the past, I've found some management games to lack the depth to have staying power, but this title promises a rich, worthwhile experience that I can't wait to play.
Bear and Breakfast is out now on Steam and a Nintendo Switch version is slated for release in "2022."

Co-op first-person horde game Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is taking a little extra time for development. Developer Fatshark announced today that the PC version has been pushed to November 30, while Xbox Series X|S will arrive later.
Previously set to arrive in September, the multiplayer PvE game is now splitting out its console and PC launches. In a statement, Fatshark says the Xbox version will arrive "shortly after" PC, with a specific date to be announced.
Fatshark also says that delaying a game is a difficult decision. But it's also one the team hopes shows its commitment to making Darktide come together.
"While we have been humbled by the great feedback on the game so far, we also need more time to improve stability, performance, and to mature key systems," the studio says. "Each is critical to making sure we have the best possible experience for you, the players."
https://twitter.com/Darktide40K/status/1552685635219210240
Squad-based test fire
If you're still eager to get in, there will be a chance before November 30. The team will be hosting a series of technical tests ahead of launch, in order to kick the tires on Warhammer 40K: Darktide.
The playtest sign-up page is live on Fatshark's site here, and appears to have sign-ups open for both Xbox and PC. Seems like a decent way to get in early if you can't wait to fight the Chaos horde.
Fatshark has built a pretty solid reputation with its work on the Vermintide series, creating some stellar co-op PvE games over the years. Safe to say, Darktide has some lofty heights to reach. So a little extra time for the studio to buckle down and work on fine-tuning things to be just right sounds good for the whole squad.
Warhammer 40K: Darktide hits PC on November 30, with Xbox Series X|S arriving sometime later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Calico, Saint's Row 2, and Monaco round out the list
Microsoft announced the four Xbox Games with Gold selections for August 2022, and you know what? It's better than it has been lately. (A caveat-filled summary, to be sure.) During the month, Xbox Live Gold and Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can nab Calico, ScourgeBringer, Saint's Row 2, and Monaco: What's Yours is Mine at no extra cost.
Do you recognize these games? For once, I knew them all.
Calico is a community life sim game centered on a cat cafe, which is a cute premise. On the flip side, we've got ScourgeBringer, a frantic action roguelite game that I'd recommend playing if you aren't too burnt out on the genre — it's fun for a bit. Due to its balanced tone, Saint's Row 2 is the fan-favorite entry depending on who you ask, and Monaco is a still-pretty-unique co-op heist game that's getting a sequel all these years later.
[caption id="attachment_337024" align="alignnone" width="1920"] Subscribers are getting four Xbox Games with Gold titles in August.[/caption]
When to claim the games in August
Calico (August 1–31)
ScourgeBringer (August 16–September 15)
Saint's Row 2 (August 1–15)
Monaco: What's Yours is Mine (August 16–31)
Earlier this month, Microsoft said it would stop including Xbox 360 games in its usual Games with Gold rollouts — the company has "reached the limit" in terms of 360 games to give out, presumably due to partner interest. Starting in October 2022, Games with Gold will focus on "Xbox One titles and exclusive savings each month."
It's nice to avoid repeats, but I hope this is more of a positive shakeup and less of a value reduction. In some ways, it's surprising that Games with Gold is still around in a post-Game-Pass world. If you're in the habit, keep hoarding these games while you still can.
And if you revisit Saint's Row 2, spray a building for me, would ya?

In preparation, a Florida federal court has set some rules for what can and what can't be brought up before the jury. Among other things, the ISP is allowed to argue that terminating accounts of persistent pirates is disproportional. However, the ISP can't freely argue that Internet access is a human right.

October will be a big month for Resident Evil fans, as it should be. While the main attraction is the Winters' Expansion and Resident Evil Village Gold Edition on October 28, Capcom has more plans in store. Namely, a free accessibility update for Resident Evil Village.
Announced on Twitter, Capcom will add several accessibility features to the game:
Subtitle size, color, and background toggles
Speaker name display in story mode
Closed captions
Permanent reticle
It's a fairly light suite of options, particularly as some game developers have stepped up their efforts to reach the widest possible audience. That said, every little bit adds up, and it's never too late. The permanent reticle might help if you suffer from motion sickness.
I've heard complaints about a lack of FOV adjustments in Resident Evil Village, and that would've been a good inclusion here while Capcom is putting more time and energy into development. As it stands, there's an FOV mod for the PC version. Once again, not ideal.
[caption id="attachment_337050" align="alignnone" width="1920"] The accessibility update is free, but third-person mode will cost you.[/caption]
The Resident Evil Village accessibility update will be released "alongside" the paid expansion and all-encompassing Gold Edition, which are due on October 28.
The Winters' Expansion comes with third-person mode, a new "Shadows of Rose" storyline, and extra characters and stages in The Mercenaries Additional Orders — Chris Redfield, Karl Heisenberg, and yes, Lady D. Altogether, the bundle will cost $20.
I look forward to going HAM in October with a full third-person run, a Rose playthrough, and more arcadey horde slaying. I just hope the Mercenaries scoring isn't a pain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whatever's coming from Cardboard Computer, it'll be worth the wait
Kentucky Route Zero is probably in my top five favorite games of all time. The game's whole feel, its subject matter, the process that went into making it — I'm fascinated by the whole thing, which is why I'm so thrilled to get absolutely any news from the development team behind it, otherwise known as Cardboard Computer. While it hasn't been all that long since the release of Kentucky Route Zero's final act back in 2020, the team has been hard at work on their new project, as they showed during the Annapurna Interactive Showcase.
While we have almost no information about what type of game it will be, where it will be set, any story points, etc., we did get a brief look at Cardboard Computer's new workflow, and what little we saw already has me giddy to learn more. Developers Jake Elliot, Tamas Kemenczy, and Ben Babbitt showed off their new animation software, which utilized some kind of face-mapping tech rigged up to a character model.
https://youtu.be/UeQYiKQoH_g?t=1312
They stated that this is the first project where they will be focusing more on performance, and while Kentucky Route Zero was a fairly slow, static game, this new project will be more "lively" with fully-animated characters. The story will also be more upbeat this time, they said after reminding themselves that while Kentucky Route Zero had comedic moments, it was ultimately a tragedy. Apparently they started working on the new game right away after Kentucky Route Zero wrapped up, and they've had this idea kicking around for as long as their debut title.
I'm thrilled to even get an update, and will be awaiting any more with bated breath. Although the details are sparse right now, Cardboard Computer is one of those developers that I have faith will deliver something amazing every time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a free upgrade for those who already own it
2017 was a stellar year for video games. So many excellent titles launched that you might have even let some slip you by. And if What Remains of Edith Finch is one of you, there's some good news: this emotional story is out now on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.
Revealed as part of today's Annapurna Interactive summer showcase, What Remains of Edith Finch got a next-gen update today, bringing Giant Sparrow's adventure game to the new console hardware. It arrives with 4K and 60 FPS support. And what's more, owners of the game on Xbox One or PlayStation 4 can upgrade to the newer generation versions for free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKpcpwM5onA
Otherwise, the game is available on the Xbox store and PlayStation Store. (It is also on Game Pass, at the time of this writing.)
What's left of those who came before
If you need a pitch on Edith Finch, it's a narrative adventure game where you play as the titular heroine Edith. The Finches are a superstitious family, governed in part by one constant rule: every member of the family has their own room. And the house the Finches live in just keeps growing, up and up.
As you enter new areas and learn more about the Finches who came before, trying to discover why Edith is the last Finch alive, you also learn about your family members. Each area is a new vignette, often with its own mechanic and narrative device, exploring what happened to them and why. And also, maybe a little bit about their life.
It is a sublimely beautiful game about life, legacy, family, death, mourning, and a really, really big house. As we covered five years ago and still today, What Remains of Edith Finch is very worth your time. And those rooms will likely look even better with all that hardware bolstering them.

Hollow Ponds and Richard Hogg, the creators behind Wilmot's Warehouse, Loot Rascals, and I Am Dead, are back with a relaxing co-op game about the "joy of flight" called Flock. The upcoming PC, PlayStation, and Xbox game made its debut during this afternoon's Annapurna Interactive Showcase, and it was my highlight of the stream. It's so pure!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WANeJSsV3Js
Unsurprisingly, the art direction is fabulous, as I've come to expect from Hollow Ponds.
I'm also into the laid-back vibes I'm seeing so far — the idea is to accumulate a hoard of cute critters as a flying shepherd, and you'll be joined by other players, adding to the coziness. The Steam page mentions online co-op; I'm hoping for couch co-op, too.
According to the developers, you can "charm" creatures into joining your flock, and with hover-sheep in the mix, you can use wool to make "hats, cardigans, and even socks."
[caption id="attachment_337096" align="alignnone" width="1920"] Soaring with other shepherds in co-op.[/caption]
Flock is coming to PC (via Steam), PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass.
Another cool game that Richard Hogg worked on, Hohokum, has found its way onto Steam. After seeing Flock for the first time, my mind immediately went back to that PS3/Vita-era game about exploring fantastic worlds. Some found it a bit dull, but I loved it.
Even if they haven't caught on with a massive audience, I really appreciate this team's games. This one, in particular, seems like it has the right ingredients to resonate.

We saw some glimpses and updates from some really great titles, both new and old, during the Annapurna Interactive Showcase today, and they closed out the show with a look at a new title from Giant Ape Games called The Lost Wild.
The trailer opens showing off a lush landscape teeming with dinosaurs, and a protagonist running through a dark forest with a compass. As the protagonist finds what appear to be old research facilities, it's only a matter of time before some T-rexes show up, and we get a glimpse at tense encounters with the giant predators. It looks like the core of the game is going to be exploration and stealth, and I'm sure there's even more to this adventure than we got to see today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA1AkZn2PrE
The whole thing is definitely giving off the tense, grounded feel of the first Jurassic Park film, and I can tell just from this short trailer alone that this game is going to scare the crap out of me in the best way. The game was announced previously, but this is the first time we're seeing Annpurna's name attached to the project.
We don't have any word on a release window yet, but The Lost Wild is available right now to wishlist on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive concluded its showcase today by debuting The Lost Wild, Great Ape Games dinosaur-laden survival game.
The Lost Wild was first announced last October with a pre-alpha trailer and is described as a first-person survival horror game. Players control an investigative reporter guided by a mysterious voice over the radio to explore abandoned Japanese facilities nestled within an island forest teeming with prehistoric wildlife. These dinos are highly intelligent and realistically behave like animals, featuring what Great Ape describes as self-preservation and reactive systemic AI behaviors. 


Players can use stealth to avoid detection while exploring, create distractions, or repel dinos using items like flares and makeshift, non-lethal weaponry. You’ll spend much of the game scrounging for materials as you traverse ruins for clues about the island’s history and how you ended up in this dire situation. 
According to the game’s FAQ, The Lost Wild won’t be arriving until late 2024 or early 2025. It has been confirmed for PC via Steam but will also come to unspecified consoles.]]></summary>

A teaser trailer premiered during today’s Annapurna Showcase showed a few seconds of close-up footage of an animated child snoring in his sleep. What does it mean? Your guess is as good as ours, but we fully expect it to be weird given Takahashi’s history.


Takahashi’s last big title was the colorful Wattam, released in 2019 and published by Annapurna. This new title looks to continue the relationship between the two partners.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive revealed an eye-brow-raising new shooter called Bounty Star: The Morose Tale of Graveyard Clem. The title blends mech gameplay and farming with a wild west aesthetic, and it’s coming next year. 


Players control Clementine McKinny, a bounty hunter and former soldier looking to atone for her past by keeping the peace in the Red Expanse, a post-apocalyptic version of the American Southwest. She uses her trust mech suit to keep the bad guys at bay, which players can customize with various offensive and defensive components. These include various guns, a laser sword, missile launchers, riot shields, boosters, and more. 
When you're not blasting apart enemies, you'll take care of your homestead. This rundown garage can be upgraded with new supply and water lines, and you can grow food, raise animals, and manufacture ammo for your mech.
Bounty Star will arrive on PlayStation and Xbox platforms (launching day one on Game Pass), Switch, and PC and launches in 2023.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-07-28T19:15:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thirsty Suitors kicked off the Annapurna Showcase with a new gameplay explainer breaking down its uniquely presented battle system and a surprising exploration segment. 
The game, which premiered during last year's Game Awards, centers on Jala, a young woman who must reconcile with her exes and friends while dealing with ( or, more specifically, disappointing ) her demanding parents before her sister's wedding. The game revolves around a turn-based battle system where Jala faces a former lover, which reimagines their attempts to find common ground as an RPG battle.


The trailer showed off moves such as Thirsty Taunts to manipulate an ex's emotions. Your old flames can manifest their inflated egos into alternate realities, where they reign supreme as the exaggerated versions of their self-perceptions. Thankfully, you knock them down a peg by enlisting the help of family members as if they were Final Fantasy summons, such as a giant version of Jala's mother dishing out significant damage. Battles conclude not with a knockout but with Jala and her adversary working out their issues.
Thirst Suitors features a variety of gameplay mechanics outside of battles, namely skateboarding. Certain segments allow Jala to skate and grind rails, build combos, and execute stunts to build up a score. It's a surprising addition that harkens to Tony Hawk or Jet Set Radio, and the game also features other unique gameplay shifts. 
A Steam demo goes live later today if you're still on the fence about Thirsty Suitors. The game has only been confirmed for PC so far and has no release window.]]></summary>

A dev diary during today's Annapurna Showcase doesn't reveal much about the game, including its title. We get shots of the team members animating a dog's face, with the designers saying the next game will feature fully-animated characters. It also explains the project has a faster tempo and sports funnier writing than KRZ but will ultimately be a tragedy.

In a little over a month's time, NIS America will release its newest retro compendium. In preparation for Prinny Presents NIS Classics Vol. 3, the publisher released a spotlight video focusing on one of the two games featured in the release, Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure.
Considered a forerunner of the Disgaea dynasty, Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure was originally released for PlayStation in 1998, before eventually making its way west via a Nintendo DS port in 2008. A tactical RPG with a leisurely pace and non-intensive difficulty, Rhapsody won over fans as one of gaming's first true "musicals," telling its delightful and thoroughly wholesome tale through fully voiced song and dance sequences.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now we just need a Steam port of GoldenEye 007
Yesterday, the Steam platform released its newest client update, which adds a compatibility function for the Nintendo Switch Online range of classic controllers. The new-school/old-school gamepads can now be used for a plethora of Steam games, bringing further options to the massive library of PC titles.
The Nintendo Switch NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis controllers will function with essentially all Steam releases, though one will obviously have to adapt to certain titles, given the required number of buttons or the button layout required for each game. Button customization will, obviously, be your friend here, but while it will be neat to play Streets of Rage 4 with an authentic Sega Mega Drive controller... God of War? Perhaps not so much.
It should also be noted that these controllers are not always the easiest to come by. While the NES and SNES controllers are now far more available than they were at launch, the Nintendo 64 controller remains something of a tough cookie to track down. No doubt a restock will be forthcoming, but Nintendo has always been a little on the lax side when it comes to readily available hardware.
Other controllers added in the new update include the HORI Fighting Stick Mini 4, the Qanbi Obsidian, and Dragon Arcade sticks. For full details on the new update, visit the official Steam forums right here.

Sony has partnered with Backbone to create an official PlayStation mobile controller for iPhone users, and if you're a fan of the PS5's DualSense, you might dig the aesthetic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SATA SSDs are getting increasingly affordable, with even capacious 2TB models going down in price rapidly as NVMe drives approach parity with the slower SATA drives. This makes it a good time to pick up a SATA drive for desktops or laptops that can't accommodate another M.2 drive, especially for media or game storage where the speed difference between SATA and NVMe is minimal. 
Today, Teamgroup's imaginatively-named T-Force Vulcan Z drive is down to $128 for a 2TB model, the lowest price we can find for this size at present. 
Note that to get this price, you do need to be an Amazon Prime member - normal folk you like and me will see a price of $160 instead, alongside a reminder to 'join Prime to save $32 on this item'. You should be able to join Prime under a free trial, order the item and then cancel your Prime status to avoid a charge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dell's G15 is one of the most affordable gaming laptops on the market, thanks to modest specs and Dell's willingness for aggressive discounts, but today we're seeing an RTX 3050 model go for an astoundingly low £441. 
To get this price, select the Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS operating system and use VOUCHERCODES8 at checkout. Linux is a completely free operating system, unlike Windows, so you can knock £50 off the purchase price just by ticking this box - and of course, you're free to install Windows 10 or 11 afterwards. Keys for Windows 7/8/10 work on Windows 11 too, so you probably already have a key lying around - or you can pick up a new one for less than £50 online. The whole process, from using the Windows 11 Media Creation Tool to prepare a USB install drive to reaching the desktop, only takes around 20 to 30 minutes - well worth it!

        <updated>2022-07-28T17:00:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Make sorting all those games a little easier
A new beta is rolling out for the PlayStation 5 today, adding some much-requested features. 1440p video output, gamelists, and other updates are entering the PS5 beta for select participants today.
One big new feature is the ability to support 1440p HDMI video output, letting those who own 1440p monitors or TVs use the setting. If the game supports 1440p native output it will allow for it. Or, if at a higher resolution like 4K, the system can use supersampling.
The option is under the Screen and Video section here:

PS5 beta gamelists
Gamelists are also headed into the beta, and this is likely a feature that every PlayStation 5 owner will want to see roll out soon. These are essentially like the PS4's folders, allowing players to sort their collection.
Up to 15 gamelists and 100 games per gamelist are allowed. These lists can include disc, digital, and streaming, and the same game can be added to multiple gamelists. Finding what's still in your backlog should be a bit easier once this rolls out to everyone.

More PS5 beta features rolling out
A few other updates are on the way too, including comparisons for 3D audio and stereo. In-progress activities will pop up at the top of the game hub, making it easier to hop back in.
On the social side, beta users can request party members to start sharing their screen. Basically, a "let me watch you play" button. And if you're in a party and someone starts up a joinable a game, a notification will pop up. Probably useful for all those Guilty Gear fight nights or Overwatch stacks.
Beta users will also be able to send voice messages and stickers to each other, within their groups.

The beta is rolling out to invited participants today, and Sony's goal is to roll these features out later in the year. Hopefully it's sooner rather than later, because my PS5 home is getting a little cluttered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As long as you have iOS 14 or Android 2.2+
Nintendo has added the ability to share Nintendo Switch Online friend codes on mobile devices as of this week, with a few provisos: mostly OS related.
Here are the iOS patch notes with the details:
Share Switch Online friend codes on mobile update, version 2.2.0
・ You can now send friend requests using your friend code. (Accepting a friend request requires a Nintendo Switch console.)
・ You are now able to copy your friend code as a URL and/or save it as a QR code, which others can then use to send you friend requests.
・ Other minor changes have also been implemented.
・ System requirements have been updated to iOS 14.0 or higher.
As you can see, the implications are pretty great overall. If you're randomly meeting someone for the first time, sharing a friend code is as simple as getting out your mobile device and making the exchange that way: even in the form of making a QR code for someone else to use on the spot.
Remember of course that there has to be provisos because it's the friend code system. To accept it, you need to use the Switch console itself when you actually get home. Also, you need specific versions of your chosen OS (iOS 14 for Apple, Android 2.2+) to actually use this feature.
Still, progress!

The winners in this week's edition of The Electronic Wireless Show, however, are numerous. Taking that nice engineer chap from Metro Exodus as the absolute pinnacle of 'best nice bloke-ness', Nate and Matthew have framed this week's episode as the four people they'd most like to invite to an afternoon pub trip.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These cats don't need no stinkin' meow button
Developer Cyberconnect2 has released the first teaser trailer for its upcoming strategy sequel Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2. The anthropomorphic/steampunk RPG will bring its epic, turn-based action to PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms at some point in 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OolRShEoq9I
The sequel to 2021's highly rated Fuga: Melodies of Steel and the fifth release in Cyberconnect2's Little Tail Bronx franchise, Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2 will see our band of survivors continue their voyage aboard the rickety but technologically adept battle tank — Taranis. Set against the thinly veiled backdrop of an alternate World War II, Fuga: Melodies of Steel blended turn-based action with high melodrama and a storyline of loss, sacrifice, and redemption. Themes that are expected to carry into the new sequel.

While the developer has not offered too much in the way of information regarding the sequel's mechanics, Fuga 2 promises to boast a boosted and improved battle system, stronger strategy elements, and a brand new, choice-based storyline that will leave players with a roused spirit, a broken heart, and an empowered soul. My words, not theirs. I should probably note that. While understandably niche, the first release was a real hit with the fan community, who will no doubt receive today's sequel reveal with much joy. Fire up the Soul Cannon... Who is the ammunition this time around..?
Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2 will launch in 2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. The original game is available to purchase right meow on all aforementioned platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been excited to play Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer dino shooter, ever since it used the phrase “unstoppable raptor horde” in one of its trailers. It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.


Admittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sims 4 High School Years is launching today, but its release looks set to be overshadowed by a couple of major bugs introduced by its supporting update, Patch 132. The patch came out on Tuesday and, if you've played The Sims 4 since then, you'll have automatically downloaded it unless you've been playing offline. While the patch's release coincides with the High School Years expansion and supports a number of its features, it also added several new elements to the ever-evolving base game. These include long-time fan requests like sexual orientation customisation, body hair options, and the return of a wants and fears system in the style of The Sims 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can also pick up Recompile
A StarCraft: Remastered free download is front and center for this newest Prime Gaming update: set to arrive at the start of August.
As Prime Gaming continues to shuffle in new games alongside of other publisher-driven services, Amazon Prime subscibers have new games to claim. Several are relatively unknown, a few are higher-profile indies (comparatively), and the one Amazon chose to put front and center is StarCraft: Remastered. Not paying for a Blizzard game sounds pretty great right now to a lot of people, I bet.
If you need a refresher, here is what StarCraft: Remastered does differently:
Full graphical upgrade of the original StarCraft and the StarCraft: Brood War expansion
Widescreen UHD support for up to 4K resolution
New matchmaking and leaderboards
Player profiles that track individual statistics
Cloud saving for campaign progress, hotkeys, and replays
Higher fidelity music and sound
Switch between Remastered and the original StarCraft
Beyond StarCraft: Remastered, you can find the full free lineup below.

They let you strike out on your own, figure things out for yourself, and create something valuable with your own two paws.
Bear And Breakfast doesn't hold your hand. It wraps you up in a gigantic bear hug, and refuses to let you out of its smothering embrace until long after your enthusiasm has evaporated.

It’s Tuesday morning. I’m late. I’ve missed the embargo deadline for Rollerdrome. Across the games press, website authors have already published previews and stories about their time playing Roll7’s blood-packed sports title. 
But I can’t stop playing Rollerdrome. 
Instead of writing, I once again queue the Barbican Arena competition, the last leg in my six-level demo. The level begins in a long, claustrophobic tunnel lit in red light. I have everything I need – rollerskates and a shotgun – to put on the show of a lifetime. Ahead of me are echoes of a crowd clapping in unison, an ominous metronome inv…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In these trying times, the only thing keeping me going is knowing I will play a new Bayonetta game in just a few short months. But hey, let's not forget the classics, either. 
Today on Game Informer Live, we're revisiting the original Bayonetta, which most intelligent and attractive people will say is one of the best games of all time. 
But that's not all! A couple of weeks ago, we started building a Real Grade Wing Gundam Gunpla kit. You can check out the first and second archives right here. I recommend getting caught up because today is the day we're finally finishing our build. Come Hell or high water; we are piecing this robot together. 
We're going live on our Twitch page at 3:30 PM Central Time (4:30 PM Eastern Time/1:30 PM Pacific). Hope to see you there!]]></summary>

Or a bald man cackling as he kicks you down a hole. And, of course, the tricky boss fights with deformed dragons and Fell Omens from the West Country.
Since I've been playing Monster Hunter Rise, which is largely a succession of ever escalating boss fights with big lizards, I've begun comparing these scuffles with Elden Ring's boss battles. And I reckon much of their differences come down to the simple health bar, or lack of it.

The details discuss how a revamped and improved studio culture has influenced the game's design, including its playable protagonists, writing, and tone. 
GTA 6, which Rockstar confirmed was in active development in February, will reportedly star two playable bank robbers in a Bonnie and Clyde-inspired tale, and the female protagonist, a first for the series, will be Latina. The game is set in a modern-day, fictionalized Miami and its surrounding areas, which signals a return to Vice City. Despite being set in a single city, the game is said to already have more interior locations than any GTA game. Still, the studio plans to regularly update GTA 6 over time to add more …]]></summary>

The three games will be available on August 2, which means July's titles – Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, The Dark Pictures Anthology: Man of Medan, and Arcadegeddon – are leaving. You have until August 1 to download last month's free games. In any case, here's what you can expect from this month's three titles:
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 Cross-Gen Deluxe Bundle | PS4, PS5
In his review, Brian Shea awarded Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 an 8.75 out of 10.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I sat down to talk to Wadjet Eye founder Dave Gilbert last week, he was in the middle of trying to sum up The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow, a new point and click adventure from Cloak And Dagger Games that his studio will be publishing later this year. "Usually, by the time a game comes out, I've compressed it to one sexy sound bite. I haven't done that with Hob's Barrow yet," he says. "Basically, Victorian gothic horror story. That's the best way to describe it."
Originally announced as Incantamentum (Gilbert jokes that one of the reasons behind the name change is because he could never pronounce "Incantamentum" correctly), Wadjet Eye got involved after Gilbert played the Steam demo last year and emailed the developer. "I said, 'Hey, I played the demo. I really liked it. Please tell me you're going to be adding voice acting to this because it's screaming for it'," Gilbert tells me. "And he said, 'Well, we will if we can find a publisher who'll do it for us.'" So now Wadjet Eye are publishing, and Gilbert is overseeing the voice recording.

Sources from Aspyr told Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier that the game had been intended for a 2022 release, but that 2025 was more "realistic".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake, teased initially with a brief trailer back in 2021, is reportedly on indefinite development hold. That’s the news as reported by Bloomberg earlier today, which cited unnamed sources close to its development, relaying that the project has been paused.
The problems reportedly stem from major staff departures at developer, Aspyr Media. Specifically, both the art director and the design director were unexpectedly let go from the company. A recent vertical slice demo of the game was well received by license holders. However, later messaging to the rest of the development team suggested that the project wasn’t where studio leadership wanted it to be.
Developers at Aspyr are reportedly now stating that 2025 would be a realistic time frame to expect the project to release. 
Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic holds a special place in video game history. The original 2003 game was a significant milestone in successful and original video game storytelling in the Star Wars franchise and featured a memorable twist regarding a main character’s identity. The game also helped popularize some of the choice-driven and moral decision-making that became so popular in later games like Mass Effect.
The remake is highly anticipated by longtime fans, but its future now appears murky.

The twist is that there's no money fuelling your construction. Instead, your city flourishes or not based on your ability to fulfil each building's resource requirements, which quickly turns progress into more of a puzzle than a management game.

It's out on Steam now, and you can find a trailer of its pretty voxel world below.

Whether you're up to no good in Red Dead Redemption 2 or stealing from the rich to (sort of) give to the poor in the original Desperados, these temples of cash have long been the scenes of messy shootouts, upturned tables, and big, golden pay-outs. At least when your heist strategy's going according to plan, that is. In an exclusive demo for one of the later levels in Hard West 2, the upcoming sequel to the 2015 turn-based tactics original, Ice Code Games' chief technology officer Mateusz Pilski is starting to feel the heat a bit. The bank is well guarded, with at least half a dozen gunslingers staking out the doors at the front, and untold numbers waiting in hidden nooks and crannies further back. He takes a moment to consider his approach, but he begins his assault with confidence.  
"In any XCOM-like, when you see that many enemies and that much firepower, in that good a position, you think, okay, I'm fucked up," he tells me. "In just a second, I will show you how you can use Bravado to totally overturn the situation."

This model debuted at £330, got more expensive over time as the worst of the GPU supply shortage hit, and was impossible to find below RRP even after its next-generation successor, the RTX 3060 launched two years later. 
Now the RTX 2060 has finally dipped in price, making it an ideal time to pick up what is still a powerful and feature-complete graphics card for 1080p or even 1440p gaming. You can pick up a compact EVGA RTX 2060 SC model for just £212 on Amazon right now, a 52% drop from its peak price and a fair deal for the level of performance on offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D is Team Red's fastest gaming processor in many titles, yet it costs far less than the slightly older 5950X and only a bit more than the 5900X. Reason being? You get fewer cores than those processors, and slower clock speeds, but dramatically increased cache - a trade-off that often provides a massive performance improvement for gaming. 
The 5800X3D was extremely hard to find at launch, with AMD's limited inventory being claimed as soon as the first reviews rolled in, but now we're starting to see better availability - and today, the first proper discounts. You can pick up the 5800X3D for £384 from CCL, thanks to a £15 off discount code: AFF15.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skull and Bones was first revealed in 2017. As a major fan of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, I was thrilled to see Ubisoft dive back into piracy, this time with a new IP. At that point, Skull and Bones was a 5v5 multiplayer arena battler where you played solely as the ship. It wasn't exactly the Black Flag follow-up many, including myself, had anticipated, but with Ubisoft Singapore, the studio behind the Assassin's Creed franchise's excellent naval combat, at the helm, I wanted to see more. 
After another look at it in 2018, Skull and Bones went dark, and Ubisoft remained mostly silent on the title for years. Then, this month, the publisher announced that it would be re-revealing Skull and Bones on July 7. That return brought with it a brand new look at gameplay and new details about ho…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WWE’s SummerSlam event takes place this Saturday, and Epic is getting in the mood by announcing that 16-time world champion John Cena will five-knuckle shuffle his way into Fortnite.
Cena arrives on July 28 and comes outfitted in his full-on entrance gear as well as his shirtless in-ring gear. You can pick up a set that includes a “you can’t see me” emote, WWE Championship Title Back Bling, and Five Digit Slapper pickaxe. Personally, I’m chuckling at the idea of the PG-friendly Cena adjusting attitudes with guns instead of bodyslams. 
While Cena isn’t the first wrestler to appear in Fornite – Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has him beat there – it’s cool to see regardless, and, as a wrestling fan, I hope this trend continues. Fortnite already acts as the ultimate “forbidden door” for various media properties, so let's throw more sports entertainment into the mix by adding stars from WWE, AEW, Impact, New Japan, and other promotions. That would certainly entice me to dive back into action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony released a PlayStation Blog post fleshing out some of the new features for its upcoming PlayStation VR2 headset. 
PS VR2 now sports a see-through view. By hitting a button or using the Card in the Control Center, you can disable game footage and see your surroundings without removing the headset. This is thanks to the device’s embedded front cameras, making it less of a hassle when you need to check on something in the real world. Sony also notes that this mode is for viewing only; you can’t use it to record. You can, however, broadcast yourself while playing PS VR2 games by connecting a PS5 HD camera to the consoles. 
The play area, as in the virtual boundaries allotted for VR play, can now be customized. You can use the headset cameras and Sense controllers to scan the room and dynamically map out the play space to your liking. These settings are then saved until you move to a different play area. 
Lastly, PS VR2 sports two viewing modes: VR and Cinematic. VR mode displays VR content in a 360 degree view in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) and 90Hz/120Hz frame rate. Cinematic Mode lets players view non-VR media and the PS5 interface in 1920×1080 HDR video format with 24/60Hz and 120Hz frame rate.
PlayStation VR2 still doesn’t have a release window, but Sony promises to share more information “soon.” That includes its launch line-up, which is said to consist of at least 20 games. Titles being developed for the headset include Horizon: Call of the Mountain, ports of Resident Evil Village and No Man’s Sky, and The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners Ch. 2.
What do you think of these features for PlayStation VR2? Share your thoughts in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nier: Automata is my favorite game of all time, renowned and criticized for its unconventional narrative design and eccentric characters. Years after seeing the action JRPG’s numerous endings and earning the platinum trophy, I never expected to miss out on so many well-kept mysteries. However, an Automata player recently discovered a secret room leaving hardcore dataminers baffled and excited. 
Someone randomly posted a video on the Nier Automata subreddit showing they found a secret room in the Copied City. So far no one else has worked out how they managed to make this secret door appear. Literally 1 person on earth has accessed this room and we are uttered mind blown pic.twitter.com/g7W4JxiNDg
July 25, 2022
Randomly uploaded to Reddit by user sadfutago (thanks, Eurogamer!), the video in the tweet above shows them sprinting past droids in the Copied City and interacting with an inconspicuous section of the back wall. After sliding down a ladder and whooshing through distorted corridors, sadfutago enters a "holy" site. I'll let you see what that is for yourself.  There are unimportant items along the way, and there's not much to do other than look around. Still, the community is shocked that something of this nature remained hidden for so long. 
Famed dataminer Lance McDonald – you might remember them as the player who unearthed Automata's best-kept secret – spoke for everyone when they said, "So far no one else has worked out how [sadfutago] managed to make this secret door appear. Literally 1 person on earth has accessed this room and we are utterly mind blown." McDonald also said that it's impossible to mod the game this way, refuting the claims of swaths of naysayers. 
Is this an area Platinum Games intended, or is it a ruse designed and implemented by players? What do you think? Let us know in the comments below!

Rollerdrome fuses these two oscillating trends in the story of a rollerskating hotshot with a vendetta against human heads.

Monolith Soft has struggled to recreate and magnify the novelties of the first Xenoblade Chronicles adventure since its 2012 release. The third chapter in the science-fantasy JRPG series suffers the same frustrating fate as XC X and XC 2. Despite its first-rate combat and character progression features, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is a bloated trek across vast but lifeless environments further diminished by an unaffecting narrative with one of the worst ensemble casts in the franchise.
XC 3 employs a real-time battle system where “Arts,” advanced skills mapped to the controller’s face buttons, give fi…]]></summary>

To get the reduced price, you'll need to use code HOT10 at the checkout to knock 10% off the price. 
Higher-end Ryzen processors have also seen discounts in recent weeks. We spotted deals on the Ryzen 7 5800X and Ryzen 9 5900X using the same Ebay HOT10 code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has been delayed. The upcoming adaptation was scheduled to launch on September 1 (with a Switch port coming sometime later). However, developer Daedalic Entertainment is taking a few more months to polish up Gollum's solo adventure. 
Fans have been critical of Gollum's perceived lack of quality, especially after a recent gameplay trailer where the game looked rough around the edges. Daedalic seems to have taken those concerns to heart. The studio didn't reveal a new release date, only saying it's delaying the game "by a few months." 
Here is the complete delay statement: 
 

First of all, we would like to thank all of you for your patience and support so far. Over the last few years, our team has been working hard to bring you a remarkable story in a breathtaking world, fill with magic and wonder.

We are dedicated to meeting our community's expectations and uncovering the untold story of Gollum in a way that honors the vision of J.R.R. Tolkien.

That being said, in order to deliver the best possible experience, we have decided to push the release of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum by a few months. We will update you with an exact timing in the near future.

We are grateful for our passionate community and we cannot wait to share this unique adventure with you soon!

Daedalic Entertainment

The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was announced in 2019 and chronicles Gollum's life after he loses the One Ring during the early chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring. The game emphasizes platforming and stealth as players climb and sneak across environments. Players can attack enemies depending on if they side with the character's Gollum or Smeagol personalities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox Insider testers noticed a faster boot-up time for their consoles, revealing Microsoft’s recent initiatives to get players into their games quicker. According to The Verge, the cold boot-up time is now estimated to be around 5 seconds. The trick to the faster time lies in a shorter animation. 
Can confirm - worked with @harrisonhoffman and @jakerose27 to create a shorter boot up animation (~4s) from the original boot up animation (~9s), helping to reduce the overall startup time.
July 23, 2022
The director of Integrated Marketing at Xbox stated (see above) worked alongside the principal product manager for connected TV apps, Harrison Hoffman, and senior product manager lead Jake Rosenberg to “create a shorter boot up animation (~4s) from the original boot up animation (~9s), helping to reduce the overall startup time.” However, there is a catch. You’ll have to set your Series X/S to Energy Saver mode to benefit from the faster boot-up. This means the console will completely power off when you decide to put the controller down and do something else. Nevertheless, this benefits the environment and helps drop the monetary load of electricity bills. 
Ultimately, the boot-up is down from 20 seconds to 15 seconds. That might seem negligible at first glance, but perhaps we’ll reach a period when wait times are nonexistent.

A message shared by the publisher's Twitter account yesterday states that the presentation begins at 12 p.m. Pacific/3 p.m. Eastern. Other than that, it offers no hints as to what games will appear. Annapurna's last showcase took place just over a year ago, where it highlighted a variety of new titles and game updates, such as Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye, The Artful Escape, and more.

Annapurna has been riding a nice wave of momentum lately due to the well-received launches of Stray, the cat-focused post-apocalyptic adventure game developed by BlueTwelve, and Neon White, the anime-inspired platforming action game developed by Ben Esposito and Angel Matrix. The publisher has several noteworthy titles in its portfolio that could get a spotlight on Thursday, some of which haven't been heard from in a good while. There's a good chance we'll see more games such as Cocoon, Open Roads, Thirsty Suitors, Storyteller, and Skin Deep. And those are just the games that we know about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A flying wyvern known as the Lucent Nargacuga will soon nest within a ruined society in Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. This creature arrives on August 1 within a free title update for players on Switch and PC.
Capcom released a minute-long trailer that shows a battle against the Lucent Nargacuga within the Forlorn Arena, backed by beautiful moonlight. The wyvern can cloak to evade its attackers and spin within the blink of an eye to knock them back.
In our review for Sunbreak, John Carson said the game needs more threats. "The lack of new monsters plagues the early hours, but there’s plenty to love if you keep at it," he wrote. "The added flexibility of the Switch Skill Swap system is a freeing and fun expansion to combat for hardcore hunters and the new creatures in the Master Rank quests – when you get to them – breathe life into the experience. For someone already invested in Monster Hunter, there’s plenty to love in Sunbreak."
This title update brings at least one new beast to hunt. Here's hoping players stumble upon more as the world opens up and the new content is unearthed.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-07-25T13:10:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funko, the collectibles manufacturer behind the wildly popular Pop line of toys, is partnering with 10:10 games to create a "AAA action platformer" for console and PC. The game is slated to release in 2023 and is spearheaded by video game developer veterans  Jon Burton and Arthur Parsons, who worked together on several Lego games at Traveller's Tales and are now at 10:10 Games.
“Creating iconic products that emotionally connect fans to their favorite fandoms is critical to each product portfolio decision,” said Andrew Perlmutter, CEO of Funko. “By partnering with 10:10 Games and utilizing the best creators in the business, we will have the talent to deliver games that reflect Funko’s unique look and feel across its lines and varied products.”
This quote implies Funko's stylistic characters with large heads and black eyes could be used for the game. Given the developers' track record of making games that feature hundreds of playable characters, it's not unreasonable to think this title may unite many popular brands that have gotten the Funko treatment. For now, all we have is a teaser trailer, which you can view above.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been experiencing Marvel fatigue for, oh, around seven years now. To compensate, I decided to watch Marvel's Midnight Suns latest trailer while pretending it wasn't about Marvel superheroes, but just a Firaxis-made tactics game with character classes who have wildly divergent skillsets. The video focuses on the spider-powered class - and heck, it does look pretty cool.

A few weeks ago, around 16 cinemas were screening pirate copies of the latest movies; last week it was 127. Not even the chairman of the Association of Cinema Owners can muster much optimism. "I can't even blame cinemas now dabbling in torrent screenings," he says. It's not a desire to make money, but a fight for survival.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is the highly anticipated sequel to Fallen Order that brings back Cal Kestis likely in a Jedi Knight role. The game doesn't have a release date yet and was only shown once in a trailer, but will soon get its first action figure. Hasbro just revealed a six-inch Black Series action figure for the KX Security Droid, which will make its debut in the sequel game.

The Security Droids were a big threat in Fallen Order and look even more imposing now with a weapon that appears to be fuel-based. The tank on the droid's back has to be a weak spot. This figure falls into Hasbro's long-running Gaming Greats line and will be sold exclusively at GameStop and can be preordered starting July 28 at 1 p.m. ET.
Hasbro also announced a Cal Kestis Vintage Collection figure is on the w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray has been out in the wild for a couple of days now, which means players have had plenty of time to answer one burning question: what did you name the cat?
The game’s furry protagonist lacks an official name. As you explore the post-apocalyptic world, have you given it one yourself? If so, what name have you settled on? 
Admittedly, I’m still figuring that out myself. I still have a good ways to go in Stray, and I’ve batted around a few options as I hopped across rooftops and meowed at robots. Some are more elaborate, like "Chester A. Tabby II" (the successor to my Palico’s name in Monster Hunter: World); others are more simple, like “Creamsicle," which has been growing on me. I’m hoping your responses inspire me to concoct the purr-fect moniker. I'm sorry. 
So let’s hear it: what do you call the cat in Stray? There are no wrong answers. Well, unless you named it “Dog.” Then we’ll have to snitch on you to the Cat Police. The Cats-apo? I'm going to stop now. Share your responses below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The MultiVersus roster expands today with the news that LeBron James, Rick Sanchez, and Morty Smith are stepping into the ring. 


King James joins the roster on July 26, the launch of the open beta, as the version of himself that appeared in Space Jam: A New Legacy. That means he’s rocking his Toon Squad jersey and unleashing all manner of over-the-top basketball moves. You can check him out in action in the gameplay trailer above. 
Mad scientist Rick Sanchez joins the roster when Season 1 begins on August 1. He’ll be rocking his portal gun and can summon Meeseeks, among other zany abilities. Morty joins him during the season, but his arrival date has not yet been confirmed. The young sidekick focuses on using projectiles such as grenade weapons, and he can whip himself at targets. 
The MultiVersus open beta begins July 26 and will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. Though if you played the closed alpha, you’re already playing the game right now. 
What do you think of LeBron, Rick, and Morty joining the roster? Who else would you like to see join in? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. 
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and, making his Replay debut, GI web designer/programmer Jon Woodey on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat. Just as a reminder, subscribing to Game Informer on Twitch rewards access to the official Game Informer Discord channel where you can interact with our lovely community as well as the editors. See you in chat!]]></summary>

I also like one where you get to be a bit creative and build according to your whims as much as to necessity. The Final Earth 2 is an ant farm kind of game that places very few limits on what you can build where, and lets you cheaply restructure as needed even if you mess it up.
The idea is you build vertically, with each building taking up a block, and your people freely travelling through all of them to get to work or home or the pub. Everyone else who plays it seems to build enormous, elaborate, impressively well organised structures that are even kind of beautiful. I build a random pile of crap. I am absolutely rubbish at it.

        <updated>2022-07-22T15:19:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil Village Gold Edition arrives in October and introduces the Winters’ story expansion. This content update includes an expanded version of the game’s Mercenaries mode, introducing Chris Redfield, Karl Heisenberg, and Lady Dimitrescu as playable characters. A new trailer shows off each of their abilities and how players can tear through hordes of monstrosities as this powerful trio. 


The update, called The Mercenaries Additional Orders, adds two new stages, Bloody Village and Bloody River, and lets players mow down adversaries such as the weapon-strapped Chris Redfield. When his arsenal of guns isn’t enough, the former BSAA agent packs a powerful punch that can have foes reeling, and activating his Onslaught gauge grants him an absurd speed boost, letting him move and reload in the blink of an eye. When all else fails, Chris can call in support strikes by pinpointing targets with his locator. 
If you want to get your Magneto on, Heisenberg can use his electromagnetic powers to toss buzzsaws and other objects, channel lightning, and smash foes with his massive hammer. He can also call in his Soldat Jets to lend a hand. 
The towering Lady D handles threats by slicing them to bits with her intimidating claws, which builds up a Thrill meter. Spending this meter allows her to use special moves such as summoning her psychotic daughters. Hilariously, the trailer even shows Dimitrescu tossing her bedroom dresser at a mob, a goofy callback to when she destroyed the same piece of furniture during the main campaign. 
If you already own Resident Evil Village, you can purchase the Winter’s Expansion standalone to access the new Mercenaries content. Resident Evil Village Gold Edition is an all-in-one package that includes the base game and the expansion. Both will launch on October 28.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new indie horror game released today has challenged players to beat it within Steam's two-hour window to claim a refund. Creatively styled Refund Me If You Can, the game puts you in the unenviable shoes of Sarah as she tries to evade monsters in her nightmare and escape a darkened maze. If you did take up the challenge like RPS vid-bud Liam did then you’d have two hours to beat the game, and two weeks from purchase to claim your refund. It didn't go well for Liam, as you can see in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s kind of remarkable how little we really know about Nvidia’s next gaming graphics cards, the RTX 40 series. AMD are openly working on next-gen, RDNA 3-based Radeon GPUs, and Intel are gearing up for the full launch of their Arc Alchemist cards before the end of summer – yet there’s not been so much as a single presentation slide on Nvidia’s wares. Not the kind of hype-building you’d expect, given how many of the current generation’s best graphics cards have GeForce badges.


Arriving to fill that info void are, inevitably, leaks. If you don’t regularly hang out in PC hardware circles, know that there’s a veritable cottage industry of in-the-know insiders: anonymous but widely known tipsters like Greymon55 and kopite7kimi, who’ve shared enough accurate details on previous GPU and CPU launches that at least some of their sources are solid. Recently, unannounced Nvidia cards like the RTX 4070, RTX 4080 and especially the RTX 4090 have become this industry’s hottest commodities, meaning leakers are also the primary source of GeForce details for the gaming tech world at large.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Choosing a character portrait is one of the key decisions to spend hours mulling over in any decent CRPG. That’s why it’s awesome to see someone using the power of publicly accessible AI to generate fantasy mugshots for classic examples of the genre such as Baldur’s Gate. Indie app dev and documentary editor Alex Hay has created some great examples, which he’s shared on Twitter with Baldur’s Gate: Enhanced Edition devs Beamdog and their CEO Trent Oster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Montreal's character spotlights have given us detailed looks at Nightwing and Robin, and now we get a good look at Batgirl's combat prowess in Gotham Knights. In the trailer above, we see her acrobatic maneuvers make short work of a gang. The footage also shows what appears to be a boss fight and a couple of alternate skins that players can unlock for Barbara Gordon.
Slated to release on October 25 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, Gotham Knights tells the story of a Batman-less superhero world and shows how his wards rise to take his place. The playable characters are Robin, Nightwing, Red Hood, and Batgirl. You can play whoever you want, and it won't disrupt the game's cooperative play. Warner Bros. allows two Batgirls to run together, should players wish to attain an Elseworlds vibe.
The skins shown in the video will likely need to be unlocked by finding blueprints and acquiring the proper crafting materials to build them.
Following the success of Rocksteady's Arkham series and Warner Bros. Montreal's contribution, Gotham Knights has enormous shoes to fill. Here's hoping it's every bit as good as the titles mentioned. We need another great Arkham-like game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a lengthy behind-the-scenes video, Naughty Dog's development team walks through the changes players can expect from The Last of Us Part I, a high-end PlayStation 5 remake that should look just as good as its sequel. While the story beats will be mostly the same, Naughty Dog has reworked most of the gameplay and visuals.
Along with increased realism in the character models, players can expect seamless transitions between sequences, enhanced enemy and buddy A.I., more breakable objects in combat, accessibility features galore, and even a few new ways to play the game.
If you want to see how far you make it before dying, you can play a new permadeath mode. Naughty Dog has also added a speed run mode to see how quickly players get through the story.
Your time revisiting this amazing game is rewarded with new unlockables, like outfits for Ellie and Joel and a model viewer. The Last of Us Part 1 is slated to release on PlayStation 5 and PC on September 2.
Are you excited to revisit this classic? If so, will you play The Last of Us Part II right after you finish it?]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-07-21T20:56:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has reportedly canceled several in-development titles, including the previously announced Ghost Recon Frontline and Splinter Cell VR.
The publisher announced the cancellations in an investor call, part of the same earnings report that revealed the delay of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Ghost Recon Frontline was a battle royale take on the franchise unveiled last October. It boasted 100+ player matches and was positioned as Ubisoft's next big live-service title. Outside of a planned closed beta that never came to pass, Frontline never had a release window, and the game was heavily criticized by fans who wanted a more traditional Ghost Recon experience. You can watch the reveal trailer below. 


Splinter Cell VR was revealed in September 2020, and it was to be a brand-new Splinter Cell title made from the ground up for virtual reality. The game hadn’t made much of a peep since then. Assassin’s Creed VR, which was revealed alongside it, still seems to be happening, though. 
Ubisoft CFO Frederick Duguet told investors that canceling these titles and the two announced projects was a cost-cutting measure to emphasize “even more focus on our biggest development opportunities."

Unfortunately, the report, which you can view here, doesn’t narrow down Avatar’s release window more than that. According to The Verge, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot explained in the earnings call that the company plans to make the Avatar franchise a larger gaming brand and that, in regards to Frontiers of Pandora, “It is important for us that we come with something that is perfect.”
Ubisoft had been quiet on Frontiers of Pandora since its big reveal during E3 2021, but it was assumed the game would launch sometime this holiday to coincide with the December 16 theatrical premiere of Avatar: The Way of Water. The first-person action game is built in the Snowdrop Engine, and players control a Na’vi in a new area of Pandora called the Western Frontier. Frontiers of Pandora is being developed by Massive Entertainment, the team behind The Divison. You can watch the E3 reveal trailer below.]]></summary>

There are stretches of nothingness, and your numb mind tries to pass the time until you reach the destination. Sometimes the open road instills a sense of freedom; other times, you feel trapped.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The future of Destiny 2 will be revealed in a livestream showcase set to air on August 23.
Bungie tweeted a cryptic video, posted below, and sent an equally vague press release that simply says to expect “exciting details about what’s next for Destiny 2.” The most likely announcement is an update on the Lightfall expansion, which is technically still scheduled to arrive this year despite The Witch Queen launching only a few months ago (due to a delay). Perhaps Bungie will narrow down that release window, but beyond Lightfall, your guess is as good as ours. 
Witness what's next.

You’ll have to watch Bungie’s Twitch channel that day to find out, though the developer has not revealed a start time or disclosed how long it will be. What do you expect or hope to see at the Destiny 2 Showcase? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

As some of you might know, I'm that badminton guy. That guy who always mentions he's away at a tournament sweating and eating bananas. That guy who believes Gears Of War and badminton have more in common than you might think, and reckon Gears is the closest thing we'll get to a proper badminton game.
Badminton aside, running is another pastime that's become dearer to me over the last few years. And that's a universally understood form of exercise, right? Especially when compared to the likes of badminton. So, why are there no proper games about running? I'd like one.

        <updated>2022-07-21T15:18:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball: The Breakers offers a unique spin on the franchise by letting a team of players work together to evade a player-controlled villain in asymmetrical fashion. A new trailer puts on a spotlight on one of those baddies, Lord Frieza, while also confirming an October launch date. 
For those unaware, The Breakers tasks a team of non-superhuman civilians (including Bulma and Oolong) with escaping the clutches of a powerful mastermind who has imprisoned them in a pocket dimension of sorts. This overseer, known as the Raider, ups the ante by pitting these ordinary captives against powerful antagonists such as Cell, Majin Buu, and, of course, Frieza. The townsfolk can work together or separately to escape to a time machine by using various tools and can apparently harness and utilize the abilities of heroes such as Goku. 
The new trailer highlights Frieza, showing how players can rain destruction as the emperor of the universe. This player can assume all of Frieza’s traditional transformations (his Golden form is unconfirmed) and unleash attacks such as his planet-destroying Death Ball. He even “Krillins” a victim by pulling them into the air and blowing them up. 


Dragon Ball: The Breakers continues to look as wild as it does humorous, which certainly falls in line with the franchise. It’s launching on October 14 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Curious fans will get to try the game beforehand, thanks to a series of closed network tests taking place on the weekend of August 6-7. You can register for that here.]]></summary>

I say all this because Saints Row - not to be confused with Saints Row yet also to be confused with Saints Row - whisked me back to the early 2000s, when I was but a naïve teenager whose life largely pivoted around their Xbox 360. A time when Saints Row and Saints Row 2 were lighthearted Grand Theft Auto alternatives, then Saints Row: The Third came along and cranked up the silliness, and then Saints Row 4 grabbed the lever and cranked it so hard it snapped. So, yes, this year's Saints Row reboot is technically Saints Row 5, except it’s more of a careful reboot. Where does it really sit on the timeline? At both ends, I reckon.

Boisterous business discussions and the clanking of silverware ring out from the crowded patio of a corner restaurant in the heart of Champaign, Illinois, a small college town two hours south of Chicago. Lording over these hungry patrons is the stoic face of Deep Silver Volition. The studio’s logo hangs a few stories above the lunch spot on the side of a brownstone building. Many eating here today are likely Volition employees, and they have reason to celebrate with a feast, as their studio’s next game, Saints Row, is nearing completion.
