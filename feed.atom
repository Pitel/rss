It’s got dystopias covered, too, with Squid Game’s second season coming later this year. But the streamer also has plenty to offer in the way of the fantasy genre, including a current Oscar hopeful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We last got a look at the latest project from Onion Games, Stray Children, back in September during the Japanese Nintendo Direct. At the time it was set for winter 2024 in Japan, but those plans have changed and the RPG has now been moved to a general 2024 release window (via Gematsu). 


The official Onion Games Twitter account shared the news about the delay. They said the entire staff is working on Stray Children every day, and they would appreciate it if everyone could give them a little more time.




With the future of Stray Children in mind, the official website is also hosting a survey. It includes questions and answers in both English and Japanese, and asks everything from basic demographics to Switch game format preference, language options, merchandise, additional platforms, and crowdfunding. They also want to know your favorite RPG and which Onion Games you've played before, so if you're a fan who's looking forward to Stray Children you might want to take a moment to fire off some responses.


Onion Games has a handful of very interesting games to its name, including Million Onion Hotel, Moon: Remix RPG Adventure, and Black Bird. Stray Children is a new RPG from the studio that has some of the Moon staff on board, so there's a lot of promise there already. Here's the previous trailer for those who missed it:




Hopefully we'll find out a more concrete release date soon, but if it means a stronger showing, we don't mind the wait at all.

With Harmonix's Fortnite Festival now on the music gaming scene, a new contender is headed toward the stage in the wireless Riffmaster from PDP.


PDP announced its Riffmaster guitar controller today. It looks to be a generational leap for video game guitars (that's a weird sentence to write). No release date has been announced, but it's intended for both Rock Band and Fornite Festival through instrument support that's coming sometime this year.




The Riffmaster is wireless and will have two versions, each compatible with either the Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S or PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. Just like the Jaguar, it com…]]></summary>

Today, 31st January, is National Backwards Day in North America (no, we didn't know it was a thing either). It's a day for doing things with a 180° twist, a quick Google told us, whether that's wearing a shirt the wrong way round like the kids do — maybe? — or moonwalking over to the kettle instead of looking where you are going.
All of the day's festive cheer has got us thinking about playing games in a different direction. We’re not talking about those skilled individuals out there who can literally play a game backwards (we see you and your Z-Targeting leaps, Ocarina of Time speedrunners), but rather those who start the narrative at the end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It appears that developer Tokyo RPG Factory will be merging into Square Enix. According to Gematsu, as part of an absorption-type merger, Square Enix will inherit all assets and liabilities of Tokyo RPG Factory and the subsidiary will be dissolved and cease to exist. The company was established back in June 2015 as a Square Enix subsidiary to develop I am Setsuna and would go on to also develop Lost Sphear and Oninaki.




JRPG Developer since 2015


Tokyo RPG Factory released all three of its titles in a roughly three-year span between 2016-2019. That means it's been almost five years since we've heard or seen anything from Tokyo RPG Factory, which is a big difference compared to its nearly annual releases.


All three releases were highly anticipated for their classic JRPG style, but never quite hit the level of success the company surely was hoping for. I am Setuna currently has a 7.4/10 on Metacritic while Lost Sphear and Oninaki are both just under 7/10 at 6.8 and 6.9 respectively. Destructoid's Chris "The Legend" Carter gave Oninaki a 6.5/10 back in 2019 stating "Maybe Tokyo RPG Factory should look at changing their formula and scaling down to tighter 10 hour adventures."


Unfortunately, it looks like we might not get to see that possibility.

While that reveal included details about the survival aspects of the game, including multiplayer, crafting, and farming, viewers honed in on the idea of it being Pokémon but with guns. You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it's smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. 
Following various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely's Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…]]></summary>

Yes, as flagged by Games Radar, Nintendo of America has filed an opposition to the attempt to trademark the term 'PokeZoo'. This 'new' IP was set to be a trading card game which boasts, according to its website description, "groundbreaking mechanics that break the 4th Wall". Mhmm.

In some ways, playing alone was a great way to test one's might in duels without relying on teammate assistance. However, the experimental LTM was a double-edged sword, revealing that some ability kits were simply stronger than others in 1v1s. For instance, Lifeline's "D.O.C.

Folks looking for the latter, Xbox is adding a little more variety to your collection. A new line of Xbox Vapor controllers is rolling out. The best part is that you can choose the one that Microsoft has already cooked up. Or, you can concoct one for yourself in the Xbox Design Lab. 




Xbox started the vapor look with the Stormcloud Vapor Wireless Controller that debuted in August. It must have been pretty popular, as we're getting an entire line of custom controller options based on the vapor look. 


The Xbox team did create a new iteration of the Vapor series that will retail separately from the Xbox Design Lab choices. Dubbed the Dream Vapor Special Edition controller, it sports a cool-looking pink and purple tone that, of course, features all the swirlies. The controller is listed for $69.99 on the Xbox Store and will be released on February 6.


Xbox Series X|S Dream Vapor controller


As for your options in the Xbox Design Lab, Microsoft revealed that there will be six top-case options to choose from. Styles include Electric Vapor, Noctural Vapor, Fire Vapor, and Cyber Vapor. As well as the OG Stormcloud Vapor and new Dream Vapor styles that you can customize more to your liking. 


Like most Series X|S official controllers, the Vapor series comes with up to 40 hours of battery life, Bluetooth and Xbox Wireless connectivity, a hybrid D-Pad, textured bumper, trigger, and side cap grips, as well as diamond-patterned grips for a comfortable feel on the back. 


Choosing a Vapor series look within the Xbox Design Lab adds a $9.99 upcharge to your custom Xbox Series X|S controller. You can begin workshopping ideas as of today.

Paradox Interactive, which owns the Vampire: The Masquerade IP, has been trying to make Bloodlines 2 happen for years and years. Development seemed promising for a bit, but in 2021, Paradox removed original developer Hardsuit Labs from the project. We learned last year that Everybody's Gone To The Rapture studio The Chinese Room took over development (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz), and now, we've got our first look at their versi…]]></summary>

This is the most we've seen of Bloodlines 2 since Paradox took the RPG from original developers Hardsuit Labs and handed it to The Chinese Room, the studio behind Dear Esther and Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs. The trailer shows 14 minutes of our vamp creeping about a warehouse with a pretty Dishonored-y combination of stealth and magical violence, showing very much why the sequel is now described as an "action RPG" rather than just "RPG".

Blackburn announced on Twitter that he's passing the reigns onto a new leader next month. And while this change might seem abrupt to some, Blackburn notes that development on The Final Shape expansion is nearly done and is now entering a playtest and bug fix phase to prep for release.


Previously working as a Design Lead for Raids and then for the whole game, Blackburn had a hand in some of the most beloved Destiny 2 content. Most notably, he was a Design Lead when players got the stellar Forsaken expansion and its Last Wish Raid. Blackburn briefly left Bungie in 2019 to pursu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you’ve been living under a rock, the monster-catching survival game Palworld is the hottest thing since sliced bread. As such, it’s only natural that players would want to take it anywhere they go; it’s currently only available on PC and Xbox Series X/S (via early access). However, mobile versions have recently been spotted, but you’ll want to think twice before downloading them.
An app posing as Palworld has appeared on Apple’s App Store and Google Play. In an X post, however, Palworld developer Pocketpair states that there is no official mobile version of Palworld. The app store version lists its developer as Oleksandra Kryvcun, which is the primary tip-off that something is amiss. Though not available, the app is available for pre-order and lists a February 11 launch date. 
[Warning]
January 31, 2024
Pocketpair warns that downloading this app may lead to your personal data being stolen. It states that it has reported these apps to Apple/Google. We couldn't find the fake Palworld on Google Play, so it may already be gone. Hopefully, the App Store fake is dealt with soon to protect eager players from installing something potentially nasty. 
Palworld has become the hottest (and most controversial) game of the year, and it remains to be seen if and when it will be brought to other platforms. Until then, you can catch up on all the excitement and discourse by reading our in-depth overview of what Palworld entails and our studio profile on developer Pocketpair from last year. You can also watch us play Palworld from the beginning in this episode of Game Informer Live.]]></summary>

While the Super Mario series can get quite weird with its lore, world design, and general concepts, nothing comes close to the sheer absurdity of the WarioWare franchise. How many games out there let you pick someone's nose, perform dental work, and have a back-scratching competition with Mario? While on paper these activities may sound like the last things you'd want to spend your coveted game time on, they're executed masterfully and delightful to play.
For decades, we've been puzzled as to how the folks over at Intelligent Systems and Nintendo come up with the microgames that make up the WarioWare series. Where do these ideas come from? How many are left on the drawing board? Where does one even begin to develop so many different micro projects? To get some answers, we recently had the chance to chat with Goro Abe, who was not only the Chief Director on the latest game WarioWare: Move It!, but has been with the series almost exclusively as a programmer, designer, and director since the very beginning.

Alas, I have no review to lay at your feet, because the game booted once as soon as I got it, then didn't work for about five days, and for the rest of this week has booted at a ratio of about 1:8 of successful boot to attempts to boot. It has also crashed twice during cutscenes. It's a shame, because I've quite enjoyed the bits that I have played (which amount to about half of the campaign, in single player). As a cross section of the three of us who have the game, one hasn't been able to boot it at all, and it works apparently perfectly for the other - and we tested both the retail build and the review build.

The original title resembles 16-bit turn-based RPGs like the Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest games of old, leaving daydreams of grander scale and exploits a hopeful wish rather than an inevitable reality. With Granblue Fantasy: Relink, developer CyGames has an opportunity to explore a fantasy world of open skies and magic while…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My review of Alan Wake 2 makes it obvious I'm a huge fan, not just of the game but Remedy's work overall. 


With that said, I'm not blind to some of the flaws of the company, including the often missing features at launch such as chapter selection. It's not compulsory by any means, but when you consider the lack of photo mode as well, you begin to wish things were a little more filled out. 


Slowly but surely, the Finnish developer has been working on the game, even after the dramatic Final Draft which gave many the narrative closure they were searching for. This time around, the latest update has added a chapter select feature. As the name suggests, this'll let you replay any of the past chapters you've completed already which, for many, means multiple replays of Chapter 4.

The much-rumoured Switch successor that Nintendo fans and investors alike are eager to see officially revealed will struggle to match the current console's overall hardware sales, according to analysts quoted in a new Bloomberg report (thanks, GoNintendo)
Anticipation for the system has sent shares of the company to a record high in recent weeks, although industry analysts for Goldman Sachs, CLSA Securities, and Macquarie Group have suggested that Nintendo will have its work cut out to exceed the level of interest and unit sales that the current console has enjoyed since 2017. Switch has sold over 132 million units as of November 2023.

For better and worse, it turns out – while this Super-fied GPU knocks hundreds off the RTX 4080’s starting price, any excitement for a potential new 4K champion is quickly muted by it barely moving the dial on straight FPS output.

Update : According to the latest issue of Famitsu, Riviera: The Promised Land will be launching on Switch on 28th February 2024 in Japan (via Gematsu & Ryokutya2089). A Western release is still yet to be confirmed.
It seems that the upcoming port of the GBA and WonderSwan Color cult classic has dropped 'Remaster' from the title, and is now just going by its original name. The Switch remaster will be based on the PSP version of the game, but with "the Good Parts of the WonderSwan and Game Boy Advance versions" along with a whole host of improvements.

Developer Rocksteady Studios' new live-service multiplayer shooter, Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, went live for Deluxe Edition players on January 30. For those playing in regions like New Zealand, the game went live on January 29 here in the states (but it was January 30 for that region). Those first players were met with an unfortunate "story completion" bug that caused Rocksteady to take the game offline to fix. That fix took hours, leaving those who paid for the Deluxe Edition, which is $30 more than the standard edition, unable to play the game at all as Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice Leauge is an always-online game. 
To make up for that issue, Rocksteady has gifted Deluxe Edition players 2000 LuthorCoins, which is roughly $20 of in-game currency that can be…]]></summary>

Or at least, that was the idea.
Like many an online-required live service game before, Suicide Squad's premium access release has been marred by technical bugs and glitches, the most severe of which saw players logging in to discover the main storyline already completed. I guess Rocksteady were serious about not wanting people to treat it like a "life commitment".

It taps into the same checklist clearing compulsion that saw me spend over 100 hours in both Odyssey's Ancient Greek archipelago and the Viking open world of Valhalla - only instead of chasing map icons that take you down weird sidequest rabbit holes that riff on Fenton the (sheep)dog, or gobbling up story events just so you can make googly eyes at every warm-blooded human in a ten mile radius, Palworld hooks you in with its enormous catalogue of base building tasks. Not catching the 100+ Pal monsters roaming around its mysterious islands, but crafting the perfect sweatshop to put them to work in. It's one of those, "I'll just add this furnace so I can craft some ingots that will let me make a cooking pot to level up my base, but wait, now I need some ore to make those ingots, and oh god, I've just spent seven hours doing not very much at all, have I?"

For too long had PC folks had to 'make do' with the quite nasty mobile ports of these games, and the Pixel Remasters looked set to finally rectify that with proper versions replete with their original artwork. But one thing was missing. Well, several things were missing it turns out, but chief among them were, of course, its damn fonts - a point of contention that's plagued many a Square Enix PC port in recent years, and one that fans quickly set about trying to fix with mods. Extra salt was then added to the wound when Square Enix said that last year's Switch and PS4 versions of the Pixel Remaster series would have two different font options straight out of the box - and it's only now that the PC versions have finally caught up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I'm over at someone's place with a bunch of people and they say, "Let's play Overcooked!" I will always visibly recoil. The game is bad for my blood pressure and for the solidity of my friendships. So, I am terrified by the prospect of Speed Crew, an Overcooked-like set in racing pit stops as opposed to kitchens. I gave it a whirl and it has promise! Even if I now need a big lie down. I am not cut out for jobs involving manual labour, nor games where I play as someone who needs to perform manual labour.

Among the wildlife you'll murder are giant spiders, which might be a dealbreaker for some people, so it's just as well Nightingale comes with an arachnophobia mode which transforms those spiders into... large, winged balloons with teeth. It also replaces decorative, non-interactive, smaller spiders and scorpions found in the game's environments with ant models. If you have a phobia for ants or menacing balloons, you're out of luck, I guess.

Nintendo is widely known for its wholesome, family-friendly content, but it often likes to push certain boundaries when it comes to its WarioWare franchise, injecting a bit of crude (but still rather tame) humour into its marketing material to reflect Wario's more 'off-colour' personality.
To demonstrate this, Nintendo has launched a new WarioWare website dedicated to the franchise, and it's chock full of the kind of wacky humour you'd come to expect at this point. Designed to represent the WarioWare, Inc. company, it showcases information on the main man himself, his employees, and the franchise's history. If that's not enough, there's also a dedicated fart button.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yep, you heard that right. Godzilla has been unleashed on the world of Minecraft. Mojang and Microsoft released the Godzilla-themed DLC by Japanese studio Team-KYO on the Minecraft Marketplace today. According to the Minecraft blog, players will start in movie theater screening rooms before picking one of four adventures from the iconic Godzilla films.




Godzilla!


Look, I know Minecraft gets a ton of DLC. And honestly, I'm usually not too interested in it. But come on, it's Godzilla! Obviously, the King of Monsters himself is featured in the DLC, but based on the trailer, other monsters will be making an appearance including Gigan, King Kong, and King Ghidorah. Maybe we'll even see Mechagodzilla, right?


It looks like each of the four adventures in the DLC has its own gameplay modes. The blog told us about two. In the first, players have to flee from Godzilla in an escape mission. In the second, players are tasked with speed building to create walls and obstructions in an attempt to contain Godzilla and save the city. All four adventures can be played in multiplayer and have unique rewards for completing and exploring them.


The Minecraft Godzilla DLC is available now on the Minecraft Marketplace for 1510 Minecoins. The closest amount to that you can purchase is 1720 Minecoins for $9.99.

To understand GDKP, we first need to discuss DKP. Grab some popcorn as I try to make this long story short.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision and the Call of Duty team dropped a sneak peek of an upcoming collaboration for COD:MW3 and Warzone Season 2. In a recreation of the signature The Walking Dead opening title scene, the teaser shows scenes from around COD's Verdansk map while playing The Walking Dead theme music. The collab will drop alongside Season 2 on February 7 and feature Rick and Michonne, assumingly as new Operators.




Quite the lineup


The Call of Duty Operator lineup is getting pretty insane, right? Rick and Michonne are joining the ranks of Homelander, Kevin Durant, TimTheTatman, Snoop Dogg, Lara Croft, Spawn, 21 Savage, Skeletor, and even Lilith from Diablo 4. Oh, there's more, that just seemed like some of the crazier ones. When I first heard about these additions I thought it was insane. I mean let's be real it's still weird getting teamkilled by Nicki Minaj and then watching her go on to shoot pink tracer rounds on Terminal.


However, Rick and Michonne will probably fit in a bit more, at least in Call of Duty: MW3's new Warzone-like Zombie mode. Rick better have a "CAAAAAARRRLLLL!" voice line or I am going to be disappointed.


Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 and Call of Duty: Warzone both enter Season 2 on February 7 on all platforms.

While a North American copy of China Warrior would run me $40 or so (with case and manual), I got the Japanese version, The Kung Fu, alongside Genpei Tōma Den and Susanoo Densetsu for roughly the same price because nobody wants The Kung Fu. Okay, that’s not actually true, it probably has more to do with the fact that it was one of the first titles released for the PC-Engine and, therefore, most likely had a massive print run, so supply greatly outweighs demand.


The North American price mostly relates to the fact that the Turbografx 16, the North Ame…]]></summary>

Not so, it turns out, because Blizzard have just announced they've added them today, and with working multiplayer for both.

The DLC has been developed by Japanese studio Team-KYO and Impress and introduces four new gameplay modes that highlight the history of Godzilla and its films.

Sunsoft shared a new trailer via the IGN YouTube channel, highlighting more of the follow-up's fantastic looking stop-motion felt style. It's got a bit of a Kirby's Epic Yarn vibe to it, and the animation really sells the diorama aesthetic. 




Ufouria: The Saga was originally released for Famicom in 1991 as the first entry in Sunsoft's Hebereke series. A European release followed in 1992, but folks in North America didn't get a chance to try it out until it hit the Wii Virtual Console in 2010. If that port and its re-…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard revealed the next limited-time event coming to Diablo 4 as Lunar Awakening. A mysterious phenomenon is taking over the shrines throughout Sanctuary, empowering them. By activating these shrines players will earn 50% bonus XP, have their movement speed increased by 30%, and will earn Ancestor's Favor reputation. The event goes live on February 6 at 1 p.m. EST and will run for two weeks until February 20 at 1 p.m. EST. Unlike some events that have been exclusive to seasonal servers, this event will be active on the Eternal Realms as well.




Moon, wake up!


With the Lunar Awakening event, players can visit a new hub in the northern section of Ked Bardu. There players will find a new NPC, Ying- Yue, and the Lunar Night Market. As players find and activate Lunar Shrines throughout Sanctuary—including in dungeons—they will gain the experience and movement speed buff while also earning Ancestor's Favor reputation for slaying enemies while under the effects of the Lunar Shrines.


With the new reputation, players will ascend through ten reputation levels and obtain event-exclusive Lunar-themed rewards. There are six unique rewards in total, and look to be all different types of cosmetics including a Mount, Mount Armor, weapon skins, armor, and more.


Also part of the event, Nightmare Dungeon Sigils can have the Ancestor's Favor affix during the event. This affix guarantees that only Lunar Shrines will spawn in the dungeon, and also gives 10% bonus Glyph XP for completing the dungeon.


The event sounds rather simplistic in nature, which sort of seems to be the trend so far with Diablo 4 Season 3. Of course, I'm always up for bonus XP and the ability to earn some cool free cosmetics.


The Diablo 4 Lunar Awakening Event goes live on February 6 across all platforms.

So, I have bad news. The Duke Nukem table appears to have been removed. I’ll get to that. However, in its place, there is the spin-off table (Devil’s Island) and two brand new tables based on Missile Command and Centipede. Not a bad deal.


Balls of Steel was developed by Wildfire Studios (with help from Apogee/3D Realms/The Pinball Wizard) and published by GT Interactive in 1997. If we track the lineage, GT Interactive was acquired by Infogrames in 1999, which later became the modern-day Atari. That would be why it’s Atari releasing a remaster of it. That is, assuming everyone has the rights ownership figured out.

In case something sounds off about this announcement to you, it's because these features were already built into the console versions of these games. Why it took nearly a year to make it to PC is pretty mystifying.

The fonts, in particular, were hated by many who picked up the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster games back when they were released on PC in 2021. And it makes sense. Pixel art is a stylistic choice, but if you pile something that is not in line with the style on top of it, it’s not going to look right. Sometimes, that’s w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie briefly teased some upcoming Destiny 2 armor inspired by the legendary sci-fi RPG Mass Effect. According to the tweet, players can join the Normandy Crew with armor inspired by Commander Shepard, Garrus Vakarian, Liara T'Soni, and others from the Systems Alliance. The armor is set to drop in Destiny 2 on February 13.




Definitely a Win


Let's be honest, Destiny 2 fans haven't had much to be happy about lately. Not that an armor cosmetic alone is suddenly going to flip the frustrations the dedicated fanbase currently has with the game. But regardless of the impact, a Mass Effect crossover is a win in my book. I haven't played Destiny 2 in years but you bet I wanna grab that sweet Garrus armor in preparation for my return in Destiny 2: The Final Shape.


Bungie also revealed that in celebration of the collaboration with Bioware, an Enhanced Defense Ghost Shell, Alliance Scout Frigate Ship, and Alliance Drop Ship Sparrow will all be available for free as well. It seems like these are all just cosmetic skins for the various items in Destiny 2. I hope the ship and sparrow are cool.


The Mass Effect-inspired armor pack, called the Alliance Requisition Bundle, is set to arrivate on all platforms on February 13.

Weapons and playable characters alike undergo acute surges and declines based on several factors, with the most prevalent being player behavior. Years ago, Pathfinder reigned supreme across casual and competitive matches; his grapple hook-centric mobility and inconsistent hitbox made him an unrivaled duelist until his ability cooldowns and physique were tweaked. Similarly, the Prowler SMG once rivaled its light ammo counterparts before the Selectfire Receiver – a legendary hop-up that converted the weapon's burstfire to automatic – was removed from the loot pool. These changes, in addition to many others, morphed the meta in significant ways, but one particular update trumped the rest: Revenant's rework.

Triumph Studios and Paradox Interactive revealed today that Age of Wonders 4: Primal Fury will get the primal beast-themed pack on February 27 across all platforms. The content pack adds a handful of new features and content to the popular 4X title with a focus on a new Primal Culture system.




Channel your Primal Culture


The new Primal Culture system allows players to channel an animal spirit that influences and shapes their empire both physically and spiritually. The Tome of Fey Mists and the Tome of Stormborne are two new Tomes of Magic added to the content pack, and include spells to conceal troops in shrouded magical fog and gain advantages over seas and shorelines.


In total, there are seven primal animals that the people of your empire can worship. New quests allow you to follow specific primal anima to earn unique rewards. Your people can even take on new physical forms in tune with the animals, including Lupine and Goatkin.


Also releasing alongside the Primal Fury content pack is the free Wolf Update. While Primal Fury is a paid content pack, the free Wolf Update will add new features and improvements for all players. In the Wolf Update, Necromancy has received a rework, new randomly generated items have been added, and War Bounties allow you to better direct your allies in conflicts.


Age of Wonders 4: Primal Fury releases on February 27 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S for $9.99. Players who purchased the Premium Edition or Expansion Pass will get access to the Primal Fury content pack at no additional cost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitwise Reprise has announced that their 2023 NES title, Jane Austen’s 8-bit Adventure is available now for purchase on a physical NES cartridge.


Not really the subject matter I expect on an NES game, but it would look great next to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Jane Austen’s 8-bit Adventure is a platformer that stars the 19th-century novelist and author of Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen. According to the summary, she finds herself in an 8-bit video game and must “Restore Miss Austen's books to the 8-bit library!”




While the art doesn’t look great in the trailer, the game itself shows shades of Castlevania. Jane Austen battles stuffy British-types using a quill and battles characters from her novels.


If you’re not convinced, Jane Austen’s 8-bit Adventure is already available on PC and is, understandably, quite a bit cheaper than shelling out for the cartridge.


I’ve said this before, but homebrew has come a long way in the past few years. I found a lot of physical releases a decade ago to be of rather questionable quality, but that’s largely because they were just hobbyist projects, and learning to program for a 6502 processor is more of a dedicated enthusiast’s undertaking. Even if you did manage to create something worth publishing, it wasn’t easy finding someone willing to produce NES cartridges. NESmaker has made developing for the ancient platform a lot more accessible, but from the looks of things, Jane Austen’s 8-bit Adventure was created the old-fashioned way.


Jane Austen’s 8-bit Adventure is available for PC and NES.

As mentioned in the X post above, the Alliance Requisition Bundle includes armor sets based on Garrus, Liara, and the protagonist, Commander Shepard. In addition to the bundle, which players will presumably have to purchase, three items will be available for free – the Enhanced Defense Ghost Shell, Alliance Scout Frigate Ship, and Alliance Drop Ship Sparrow.
Destiny 2 is currently gearing up for its next expansion, The Final Shape, which is set to launch later this year on June 4. It's supposed to usher in the conclusion of Destiny's story so far, so now's a good time to get caught up if you aren't already. Here's what we thought of their most recent expansions, The Witch Queen and Lightfall.  If you start in two weeks, you can do it while roleplaying as Garrus!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently the Xbox page for Visions of Mana made news, as it cited the upcoming Square Enix RPG would be included as part of Xbox Game Pass at launch. Today we learned it was just a big mistake.


Game Pass owners thought they had a gem inbound for the subscription platform. X users, like Idle Sloth below, celebrated the Xbox reveal of the big Day One get.




Eurogamer reached out to Microsft to get clarification on the listing. A Microsoft spokesperson responded to the outlet to confirm that the mention of Game Pass was indeed a mistake. 


"We're aware that Xbox.com included language that indicated Visions of Mana was coming to Xbox Game Pass and can confirm this was an error," the spokesperson told Eurogamer. Microsoft concluded its statement by confirming: "We do not have plans to bring Visions of Mana to Game Pass at this time."


When Microsoft rolled out its Xbox Developer's Direct on January 23, Visions of Mana was a surprise inclusion within the showcase. The game looked great, and Series X|S owners were rightfully excited to finally get some love from Square Enix on their platform. 


With the promotional partnership between Xbox and Square Enix during the Developer's Direct, fans who spotted the Game Pass mention on the Vision of Mana page would have little reason to doubt the game's inclusion. Now, it looks like Xbox Series X|S owners will have to purchase the awesome-looking action-RPG when it releases alongside PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC versions later this summer.

        <updated>2024-01-30T17:17:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lucid Dreams Studio has announced that their “dark metroidvania,” Biomorph is slated to release on March 4. Alongside the announcement is a new animated trailer that, out of context, tells very little.


That’s okay, because more informative trailers have already been released. I opened one in Steam, and after watching a bit of it, I switched back to writing this, and the video kept playing in the background. I can tell there are a lot of gooey effects in there because, past the halfway point of the trailer, it begins to sound like someone is eating a can of tuna using only their tongue set to epic music.




Pointless musing aside, Biomorph looks like a pretty slick game in the gated exploration style. The big draw is that the gooey protagonist can take the form of some of the enemies in the game, which strikes me as a good substitute for keys and a great mechanic to base puzzle-solving on.


But beyond the usual hop-and-collect gameplay, you also get to customize a village. You’re tasked with rebuilding the town of Brightmoor and befriending its inhabitants. By the looks of things, you can pick from a variety of styles for the buildings. Looks light, unobtrusive, and satisfying.


“Metroidvania” isn’t my favorite genre, but it’s one that I’m no stranger to. Of the many that seem to be circling toward release, Biomorph looks like the most appealing to me. Something about the visuals exudes a love for the world the developers are building, dark as it is.


Biomorph will be released on March 4 for PC. An extended demo will be available for Steam Next Fest.

The upcoming "Kafkaesque" immersive sim gives you the simple goal of escaping a town within a few days, a task which is somewhat complicated by the fact that a Leviathan-sized Russian cop towers over the city, watching you. In a new dev blog, developers TallBoys explain more of how you might court the giant's approval (the term "fully fleshed dating-sim mechanic" features) or avoid it by sneaking about while he sleeps. You might even—gasp!—do crimes. This also drew my attention to a ten-minute gameplay video they released last month and oh, yes, please.

        <updated>2024-01-30T17:05:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We know that MSI is attempting to take on the likes of the Steam Deck with its own device called The Claw. There were also leaks suggesting how much the handheld would cost, and now prices have been confirmed by the tech company.


As noted by Videocardz, MSI has listed three variants of its upcoming mobile gaming PC on its website. As you can see, they're not exactly the cheapest. You'll be having to fork over $699.99 for the lower end model, while the two more expensive ones will cost $749.99 and $799.99, respectively.




If you opt for the first, you'll get a Claw device that's powered by the Intel Core Ultra-5 processor. The midrange model will have the Ultra-7, as will the priciest one, but that will have 1TB of storage instead of 512GB.


A potential USP


Also, MSI's device will be utilizing the Intel Arc graphics chip technology, something which the Steam Deck, ASUS ROG Ally, and Lenovo Legion Go don't have (these all use AMD). Whether this will be a unique selling point for The Claw is anyone's guess at this stage.


As far as specs go, it's going to give the Deck a run for its money, offering up slightly more advanced hardware, including a better screen and supposed stronger battery life. However, with that extra juice comes the price tag to match.


The other thing to say about The Claw is it uses Windows 11. That's not inherently a bad thing, but the good thing about the Deck is that it's gaming ready, linking users up to their Steam account from the first boot-up. That could be a win in Valve's favor, but MSI and other competitors could also get the edge by offering more powerful handhelds.

        <updated>2024-01-30T17:03:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Certainly, there are instances where the Destiny 2 community struggles to agree on certain things, but things just fall into place sometimes. Take, for example, Bungie's latest The Witcher-themed mini-event, which has been completed in quite a short amount of time, actually.


As part of its previous This Week in Destiny blog post, Bungie announced that it'd hold a special community event that officially kicked off at 12 AM PST, on January 25. From that point onwards, players would need to kill 7,777,777 enemies before a unique (and free) Witcher-themed goodie unlocked: the Adventurous Spirit emblem. A mere emblem might not be quite as exciting of a tidbit as the big Destiny and Witcher crossover was, at the start of the Season, but it's a neat bonus all the same, and Guardians can now claim the emblem.


That's right - the Destiny 2 community has successfully sliced through almost 8 million foes in just over five days' worth of time. Whether that's impressive or disturbing to imagine, we'll leave it to you to decide.




Claim Destiny 2: Adventurous Spirit today, whether you participated or not


All cheekiness aside, Destiny 2's Adventurous Spirit is a neat little emblem, and you can unlock it for use in-game whether you participated in the event or not. To do so, you can either use Bungie's own embedded link, or go to Destiny 2's official website and open up the Emblem Redeem widget that way. The activation code is 9FY-KDD-PRT.




And hey, if you - like yours truly - never did end up contributing anything to the event, you can still grab the emblem regardless. From the looks of it, plenty of us haven't really gotten around to participating, so it's a good thing that nobody's left out of the equation this time around. Heck, a snazzy new emblem might be just the thing that draws you in to complete a few of Riven's Wishes over the next couple of weeks.

Last year we learnt that the infamous Zelda CD-i games are getting a "spiritual successor' in the shape of Arzette: The Jewel of Faramore. It was an announcement that we didn't have on our 2023 bingo cards, we'll admit, but it's real and it's coming our way digitally on 14th February (how romantic).
Developed by Seedy Eye Software and published by Limited Run Games, Arzette will see you setting out on an adventure to save the kingdom of Faramore from the evil demon king Daimur.

They're codenaming it Hornet. The announcement trailer is sort of Lethal Company meets STALKER with a bodycam found footage perspective. It's quite the cocktail of tropes, though I'll take this over another "Soulslike roguelite deckbuilder" or similar.

Back in the Xbox 360 era, my friends and I held the X button one time and miraculously found a game in Gears Of War, having waited for ages. We grew superstitious. Later in our Call Of Duty sessions we'd hit matchmaking with reverse psychological techniques, saying stuff like "I bet we WON'T find a match", to in fact, find a match. Well, thanks to an official COD blog post, my heady beliefs have been hit with the equivalent of a precision air strike. Matchmaking cannot be gamed. It is all-seeing and all, sadly, science.

Type-Moon and Aniplex have announced Fate/stay night REMASTERED, a remaster of the very first Fate game, and it's coming to Switch in 2024 (via Gematsu). This will be the first time ever that Fate/stay night has been officially localised in English released in the West.
Fate/stay night is a visual novel that first launched on PC on 30th January 2004 — which means today is the franchise's 20th anniversary, making this a fitting announcement. The remaster will apparently be based on the 2012 PS Vita version of the game, Fate/stay night Realta Nua, which in turn was ported from an earlier PS2 version.

Just yesterday, Embracer Group canceled a Deus Ex game in development at Eidos-Montréal and laid off 97 people at the studio. Now, a group of former Volition Games veteran developers have formed a new studio called Shapeshifter Games, as first reported by TechRaptor.

CGI trailers that refrain from showing any actual gameplay have often been a source of discourse in the video game community. On the one hand, they can be pretty effective in building hype - particularly if it's for a highly anticipated release - but on the other, they often fail at demonstrating what the game will actually entail regarding its gameplay.
In his latest YouTube video, legendary creator Masahiro Sakurai takes a stand against trailers that don't show any actual gameplay, stating "In some cases, trailers like the ones seen on a game's Steam page won't show any gameplay footage at all - please don't do that!".

You can tell as soon as its snazzy intro cutscene kicks in that Mario vs. Donkey Kong, a remake of 2004's Game Boy Advance puzzle-platform classic, doesn't intend to reinvent any wheels whatsoever. It fully and faithfully recreates the 20-year-old original's opening movie (albeit with a nice lick of paint) and then moves swiftly on to serve up modernised versions of all the levels you'll have played if you've been through this one before — every one of them almost identical to how you'll remember.
Yep, we've been spending plenty of time getting acquainted with Mario's latest (re)adventure over the past week or so and, four worlds in, it's pretty much as expected for the plump plumber thus far. This is an exacting retread in how it serves up levels that stick to the layouts, enemy positioning, and traversal options of its source material. Nothing much has changed here in terms of the core mechanics, puzzles, and so on that make up the bulk of the game, which is a good thing when your source material is so delightfully addictive.

Even though Mario is now known as the most iconic face in gaming, in his first appearance, 1981's Donkey Kong, he couldn't even get his name in the title. That was corrected in 2004 with the release of Mario vs. Donkey Kong, a side-scrolling puzzle game designed to carry on the legacy of the classic arcade cabinet. Twenty years later, that outing has been reimagined for the Nintendo Switch, and Mario's rivalry with Donkey Kong – as well as the gameplay – holds up surprisingly well.
After the local toy store runs out of Mario toys, Donkey Kong goes on a rampage at the toy factory, leaving with a sack full of toys and Mario in hot pursuit. As Mario, you'll go through a series of levels w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It seems we're spoiled for choice at the moment when it comes to Early Access survival games inspired by other franchises. Palworld has been making more money than God, but Keen Games' recently released Enshrouded has been doing pretty well, too.


A recent Twitter/X post from the developer is proud to announce that its title has "reached over one million players." This is after just four days. While that may pale in comparison to Palworld's six million sold in a similar timeframe, it's still a massive accomplishment.




In fact, Enshrouded is currently at the number three spot on Steam's Top Sellers list, just behind "Pokémon-with guns" – with Steam Deck still at number one, because of course it is. Whether either of these can be toppled by the newcomer remains to be seen at this stage.


What is Enshrouded?


If you haven't played it yet, Enshrouded is a survival and crafting game that's taking cues from the likes of Valheim. It's "set within a sprawling voxel-based continent" and tasks you with a journey "across the mountains and deserts of an open world."


It's currently only out on Steam at the moment, but Keen Games is "keen" (ha!) to release it on the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, hopefully later this year.


It definitely feels like this genre is getting quite full at the moment. There's just something about games that encapsulate survival released in alpha or beta states that's appealing to a lot of people. Last year it was Sons of the Forest, and now we've got Palworld and Enshrouded. 


However, given that the latter has a current player peak of 160,405, according to SteamDB, it's probably not likely to take on the might of the former.

Not only had we cleared out the 42nd floor of the cursed extra-dimensional horror house that was our school’s midnight alter-ego, I’d also just aced my midterms. I spent the afternoon helping my french foreign exchange friend sew a kimono for his estranged uncle, then killed some time before bed by consoling the small child I’d been hanging out with lately about her parent’s divorce.


So goes an average day in one of the very, very many days stuffed into Persona 3 Reload’s year long taste of demon-slaying high school life. A charming fantasy? Perhaps! There's plenty here for fans who don’t mind an old-school approach to grinding while exploring heartfelt, albeit cheesy, friendships. Those who don't get on with anime tropes, though, might find it exhaustingly written and repetitive.

Persona 3 is perhaps the most important entry in the Shin Megami Tensei spin-off franchise. By establishing several series mainstays, including the popular Social Links system, Persona 3 laid the foundation upon which the next two mainline entries would be built. Unfortunately, by today’s standards, that 18-year-old title is unapproachable in many ways. Persona 3 Reload remedies that, bringing forward the outstanding cast, story, and turn-based battles in a faithful remake with the modern amenities of Persona 5 Roya…]]></summary>

It’s largely just a GUI that makes it easier to visualize your game’s content while also allowing you to plug in various code snippets that handle the functions in a game. It makes things almost too easy, which means one day, I can maybe get down to creating my spiritual successor to Hoshi wo Miru Hito.


Greater access to the platform also means that we’ll be seeing more games on the hardware, which brings us to The Adventures of Panzer: Legacy Collection.

It's a PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD, so it offers slightly faster speeds on the latter two devices than on the Steam Deck, but it's compatible with all three major options. It originally retailed at £230 for the 2TB model, but now it's at a much more reasonable price: £155.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frontier Developments has announced on Twitter that Planet Zoo is coming to consoles. What consoles? I don’t know. When? I don’t know that, either.


It’s happening, though! Frontier Developments dropped a teaser that shows a controller sitting on a breakroom coffee table (I think) while something unrelated goes on in the background. That’s it. You now know everything that I know.




That is unless you haven’t played Planet Zoo. Initially released in 2019 as a companion (spin-off?) of 2016’s Planet Coaster, it’s a management sim about building and running your own zoo. The Planet games are all about filling the gap left by games like Roller Coaster Tycoon and Zoo Tycoon. However, I feel they have their own distinct flavor.


What I mean by that is that Planet Zoo feels like it’s more about customization and building your dream zoo than it is about challenging you to keep it profitable and successful. Don’t get me wrong, there’s still some of that. You do need to keep your zoo profitable and successful, but it just feels so easy. Or maybe it’s just easy for me because I grew up on a hearty diet of tycoon games. I can’t tell anymore.


However, to me, it felt more like it gave you a tonne of tools and assets to allow you to customize your habitats at a very granular level. This would have really appealed to young Zoey, but old Zoey doesn’t have the same free time or attention span. I do have to wonder how the UI and all those tools will translate to a controller, but we’ll have to wait and see.


For now, you can grab Planet Zoo on PC. Having spent a few paragraphs talking about it, I think I'm going to reinstall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HoYoverse has released another round of its usual character teases for Genshin Impact, and if previous patterns hold up, it's a peak into Version 4.5. However, there's only one new character showcased this time, and it’s someone you might already be familiar with: Chiori of Chioriya Boutique.


Chiori’s element, weapon, and Constellation


Chiori’s drip marketing clearly shows her elemental Vision and weapons, locking her in as a Geo Sword user from Inazuma. Her art features a pair of wakizashi or small katana, showcasing a unique dual-wielding style. This isn’t entirely without precedent, since Alhaitham’s animations feature an additional sword on top of the one he normally equips. The remainder of Chiori's kit is yet to be revealed.


We've encountered Chiori before as an NPC during 4.3's Roses and Muskets event. She served as the costume designer for The Two Musketeers during the Fontinalia Film Festival. Now, Chiori is formally introduced as "The Thundering Seamstress" and Boss of Chioriya Boutique. We already knew that she was the boss of this small clothing store in the Court of Fontaine, and we got a taste of her direct, no-nonsense attitude during the event quests. It appears we'll soon witness her in combat as well.

Chiori’s Constellation is Cisoria, Latin for “scissors.” It's quite fitting for her as a fashion designer and seamstress. It might also serve as a subtle reference to her sharp wit and incisive personality.


When is Chiori coming to Genshin Impact?


Since Chiori’s introduction happened on the eve of Version 4.4, we can expect to see her sometime in Version 4.5 of Genshin Impact. If the six-week update schedule holds, Version 4.5 should start on March 13.

Alongside this cancelation, Eidos-Montréal, which is the studio behind 2021's Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy and both Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, has revealed it is laying off 97 employees. 
Bloomberg reports that Eidos-Montréal had been working on this new unannounced Deus Ex game for two years, and it was set to enter production later this year, according to sources familiar with the studio. It seems the studio's canceled game and subsequent layoffs are another casualty of Embracer, which has been purging studios after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion in the Scarlet & Violet series is Paldean Fates, which brings new Shinies into the mix, plus various type-shifted Tera Pokémon and new special-illustration cards. Unfortunately, you can't buy these booster packs individually; instead, you must purchase special collections like the Elite Trainer Box or the Tech Sticker Collection. 
Despite this unconventional release method, Paldean Fates adds an absolutely massive number of cards to the Pokémon Trading Card Game. Those trying to collect them all have more than 240 cards to look for, including more than 135 etched-foil cards and several Trainer cards.
The Pokémon Company sent along a few of the collections and products that contain Paldean Fates booster packs so we could crack them open to see what we could pull. While I'm usually most excited about the Pokémon themselves, one of my favorite pulls this time was a Trainer card: the Nemona full-art Ultra Rare. But that's not to say I didn't pull my fair share of great cards starring some of my favorite Pokémon. I'm always a sucker for a cool Charizard card, and I love the Shiny Toedscruel ex that I found in one of the packs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between Tekken 8, Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, and the impending release of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, 2024 is off to an explosive start, but the rest of the year is still up in the air. Luckily for PlayStation fans, Sony is pulling the curtain back on some games coming soon to its platforms this Wednesday, January 31, at 2 P.M. Pacific/5 P.M. Eastern. Check out the X announcement below.
Get ready for a new State of Play! https://t.co/KDyuY2Uvfq

Tune in on YouTube, Twitch, or TikTok this Wednesday at 2pm PT / 10pm GMT for 40 minutes covering 15+ games, including extended looks at Stellar Blade and Rise of the Ronin, plus more from talented game developers from… pic.twitter.com/MQg76iv8Tt
January 29, 2024
The showcase will specifically show off extended looks at Stellar Blade and Rise of the Rōnin. The former title, previously known as Project Eve, is a stylish action-adventure game that's been teased since 2019. The last we heard, it was delayed into this year, so we're due for a proper look. The latter game is the next project from Team Ninja, the developers behind the Nioh series. It's the studio's most ambitious project to date – check out our December preview here.
As for the other 13+ games, we don't have much of an idea. We know it won't include Naughty Dog's recently canceled Last of Us multiplayer spin-off, and we've gone a while without big reveals for a lot of Sony's first-party studios, so hopefully, it can shed some light on the rest of the company's 2024.
What are you hoping to see at Wednesday's State of Play? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I bought Baldur's Gate 3 shortly after its release as a need than a want, when I was a year-and-half into my gender transition and hormone replacement therapy. Gender transition is not just an arduous journey of self-discovery, but also a profound and constant engagement with one’s own reality. I was desperate for some escapism, and Larian Studios’ much-anticipated new entry into the Baldur’s Gate fantasy RPG franchise offered the perfect rabbit hole to fall down.
As a child, my gaming habits were relatively stereotypical for a closeted girl: select female characters wherever possible, especially in RPGs. But the immersion almost always wears off. The trans inclusion in games like Dungeon Siege, Sacred 2: Fallen Angel, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and others is effectively non-existent, and the result for transgender and transsexual players is a feeling that, even in fantasy worlds, we are invisible at best. Nocturne, a trans supporting character in Baldur's Gate III played by Abigail Thorn, has changed that experience for me. In an interview, Thorn shared some of her thoughts and experiences regarding Nocturne and trans representation in games.

Alas, the prospect of such a project has had fresh water poured over it this weekend, with Kitase explaining that, given it's already taken them ten years to make Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (with a third entry to complete the trilogy yet to come), a Final Fantasy 6 remake would likely take twice as long as that to actually make. And you know what? I'm good, actually. The Final Fantasy 6 Pixel Remaster is good enough for me in this lifetime.

Given how everything new and exciting ultimately becomes normal and mundane, this is perhaps an unfair expectation of technology that is now a decade old. Nonetheless, if you want me to sit with a shoebox pressed uncomfortably against my eyes for two hours like an ocular gom jabbar, then what's inside the shoebox better be pretty darned transformative.
Which is to say that LEGO Bricktales provided one of those moments. I was sat in my living room, with all its clutter visible through the Quest 3's coloured passthrough, and hovering above my table was a great big LEGO diorama of a jungle. All of it was rendered perfectly to scale, as if I could pick up the minifigs between my thumb and forefinger. Yet all of it was moving of its own accord, as if I'd somehow stumbled into a child's dream.

This entry in the series is from far from the first Prince of Persia game, but it represented a reboot of sorts and has become the game most identified with the franchise. It also is undeniably important to what would eventually become Assassin's Creed.
Join superfan Kyle Hilliard and Prince of Persia newcomer Wesley LeBlanc for a look at the 2003 classic. This isn't the first time we've revisited Ubisoft's classic platformer. You can watch our original Replay episode on Sands of Time from 2015 here.

Well, now's your chance to get to grips with its nifty combat system, which is broken into turns with each turn's actions unfolding in real time.

Honestly, did no one remember that February's Next Fest starts in, you know, February, in a week a bit's time this year? I'm all for getting a few things early to make the deluge of demos a bit more manageable to cover, but this year has just been a teensy bit insane. Now there's too many things to look at in advance, but hey, I'm making steady progress, and you've probably seen the fruits of a couple of these this week already. Next on the list is Dystopika, a toy-like sandbox citybuilder that's sort of in the same vein as the lovely Summerhouse I played earlier this week, but also lives at the exact opposite end of the mood and vibes scale.

You have to supervise them constantly, not relax and watch them grow organically while eating a sandwich and only occasionally intervening like a neglectful goddess.
Writer's Rush is sort of, sort of an idle game, I'd argue. It's a low pressure, low stakes, super light sim that takes the barest hint of the clicker and crosses it with sort of-sort of-sort of score attack, and somehow works without quite feeling like either. Because, I think, of its charmingly, intentionally daft representation of what being a novelist is like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One game I heard and saw a lot last year but absolutely did not play was Pizza Tower, a fast and fiendish platformer inspired by the Wario Land games. A lot of people seem delighted to rocket around in the colourful adventures of pizzeria proprietor Peppino Spaghetti. People who are younger than me. People whose hands aren't gnarled claws. People who don't have one foot in the grave. It'll happen to you too. In the meantime, I hope you've enjoyed it, and suspect you might be keen to see more of the new playable character coming free in a future update.

Not only have Sony announced a release date for the PC version of Horizon Forbidden West's Complete Edition - mark your calendars for March 21st, folks - but they've also released a new trailer showing off all the various PC features. Chief among them for me is proper support for PS5 Dualsense controllers, which means you should be able to benefit from all the same haptic feedback ripples and adaptive trigger pulls of Aloy's bow as folks did on PS5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard Entertainment's survival game, which it informally announced in 2022, was reportedly canceled over engine issues during its six years of development, according to a new Bloomberg report. This report follows yesterday's news that Microsoft is laying off 1,900 employees across its Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax divisions. Alongside this news, Blizzard president Mike Ybarra also announced he was departing from the company, and we learned the aforementioned survival game had been canceled. 
However, Blizzard didn't really touch on why the game it had just announced exactly two years prior was canceled. Bloomberg's new report details development struggles around the game's engine, which was prototyped using Epic Games' Unreal Engine before "Blizzard executives decided to switch…]]></summary>

I was innocently carving myself a nice stone foundation last night when the Devil jogged my elbow and I dug a massive, raggedy trench straight through it. I've spent an hour now trying to fill in the trench and flatten it out, to no avail. There's always a jaggedy bit right in the middle, and I'm getting displaced trypophobia from the awareness that my efforts have seeded the terrain beneath with random cavities.
What's worse, there is no mention of enhancing the floor-levelling functionality in this Keen Games forum post on Enshrouded's various launch issues, which they are even now racing to fix. Instead, it's all talk of frame rates, multiplayer stability and dedicated servers not appearing. Somebody rush me a cement mixer, stat, or I'm moving back to Valheim.

Most previous LADs, be they Kiryu’s Adventures in Punching or the more turn-based reboot have all been technically gentle affairs, and Infinite Wealth is ultimately another one. At the same time, it shares with Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name a newfound interest in PC-specific tricks. That means a full selection of DLSS, FSR and XeSS upscalers, plus DLSS 3 frame generation. Real yakuza might use a gamepad, but it seems real fuzz-haired RPG fantasists use graphics cards.
Let’s take a closer look, then, at how RGG’s latest crime caper performs on PC. We’ll also work out its best settings, to keep it running smoother than a legally distinct Segway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adventure mode was one of my favourite things about Dwarf Fortress, mainly because it made the infamously complex management game more approachable by letting you play it like a more traditional roguelike. I'm excited, therefore, that Adventure mode is coming soon to the Steam version of the game, and excited even more so that it's aiming to make it even more accessible.

A new update on development which outlines exactly how the new premium version of Adventure mode differs from the original, including its plan for tutorials to guide new players.

Not much more was known about the game except that the studio were actively ramping up recruitment, seemingly after having been working on the project since 2017.

This survival game has now been cancelled alongside today's news of sweeping layoffs across Blizzard and other divisions of new owner Microsoft.

Cut to several hours later and I've had to forcibly shut the game down and wrench myself away from it just to write this post, because listen, you need to go and play Balatro's demo right now, because hot damn this is the good stuff if you're into roguelike deckbuilders. I also say this as someone who's never played or understood a game of poker in her life, because let's face it, regular poker is quite boring. Balatro, on the other hand, is poker that's turbo-charged with magic Joker cards, tarot card multipliers, and blind conditions that make a successful hand increasingly tricky to pull off. And it's coming out in full real soon, too.

Outriders developers People Can Fly, meanwhile, have laid off 30 developers who were working on an unannounced Square Enix game.

Despite what various delays had me believing, Skull and Bones is actually shaping up to be, at the very least, a fun and competent experience.

Game Informer has reached out to Black Forest Games and will update this story if it learns more. 


Kotaku writes that its source says creative directors and most, "if not all," of the managers at Black Forest Games will keep their jobs following the layoffs. At approximately 110 employees as of last year, 50 job cuts would equate to a roughly 50 percent reduction in staff at the studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given that Microsoft have spent considerable time and effort becoming the biggest cock-of-the-walk possible, it does, I suppose, make sense that their layoffs are correspondingly massive. In an internal memo obtained by The Verge, Phil Spencer is very sad to reveal to the staff that, in order to grow, the combined powers of Microsoft's 22k-strong Gaming Division have to be denuded to the tune of 1,900 human beings. That amounts to about 8% of the division.

Super Algebrawl. This tactical mathematical RPG is the latest from Punkcake Délicieux, the small team behind the roguelikelike 'chess with a gun' Shotgun King. Super Algebrawl started life as a experiment by one of the devs to help teach his daughter maths, though frankly I think it'll teach her maths is cruel. This game and I have very different relationships with numbers.

Well, clearly the trio of developers at Phoenix Blasters did, as their upcoming platformer Telmari puts them front and centre as its main form of traversal. Your titular tiny heroine can't jump very far on her own, you see, so to save her beloved sunflowers from the spiky thorns of an ominous-looking tree, she'll need to fire them around the environment to help hoist her over obstacles to get to the, err, root of the problem. I've been playing its Steam demo this morning, and while it's a little rough around the edges, there's definitely something here for those trained in the Super Meat Boy school of pixel perfect platforming.

The Verge obtained the full internal memo sent to staff by Microsoft's game content and studios president, Matt Booty.

Hivemind, which also worked on Netflix's The Witcher, was developing the series with Sony Pictures Television, but co-founder Dinesh Shamdasani revealed on Twitter that the project is dead when asked about it, as reported by PC Gamer. 
"Dead," Shamdasani writes on Twitter in response to someone asking what happened with the series' production. "We took around a fantastic pilot script by Ben Lustig and Jake Thornton along with a multi-season plan they built with our showrunners, but got rejected across the board. The size and scale needed to do it right proved too much for anyone to want to risk. Amazon came closest."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friends, it is finally time for me to discourse unto you about my great love of balls. The roots of my enthusiasm go back to pinball machines - both the fancier, arcade variety that transmogrify into e.g. screaming robot skulls when you achieve a high-enough multiplier, and the crappy, play-at-home variety that are basically a canted wooden sheet with some numbers drawn on it. But it wasn't till I embraced the holy medium of videogames that I realised the full potential of balldom. 


Initiated, of course, by Sonic the Hedgehog, I descended into a frothing ballpit of ball variations, encompassing everything from the squashy rolling UFOs of Exo One through Katamari Damacy to the overcrowded chutes of Marble World and the spectacle of Overwatch's Hammond clearing out a capture point by means of sheer, delicious torque. I am always up for a game in which you either control or become a ball, and Go Mecha Ball looks like one of the better ones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People Can Fly, the developer behind 2021's surprise shooter hit Outriders, has laid off more than 30 employees. This news comes by way of Kotaku, which reports that its source with knowledge of the situation said the job cuts affected only staff working on an unannounced game at the studio, codenamed Project Gemini, that is to be published by Square Enix. 
Kotaku reached out to People Can Fly after its source sent screenshots confirming that layoffs happened at the studio, and development director Adam Alker confirmed the news. Alker cited budget limitations and a shrinking scope for Project Gemini as for why it was laying off "over 30 people." The publication notes that another 20 outside of the 30 laid off were removed from the project and moved to other projects at People Can Fly.

His post reminded me of Pope's other hit, Return Of The Obra Dinn. The closest we've come to a "Dinn-like" is probably 2022's outstanding The Case Of The Golden Idol, though as I said in my review, its fill-in-the-blanks murder tableaus felt just about distinct enough to be their own separate thing. 
Happily, the "Golden Idol-like" appears to be having a bit of a moment of its own right now, as Playstack, the publishers of Golden Idol, have just announced the delightful-looking Little Problems, a detective game that turns its word-shuffling problem-solving to the altogether more relatable conundrums of everyday life. And I couldn't be more here for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this evening, The Pokémon Company issued a press release seemingly addressing the recent conversation surrounding the new Steam Early Access release Palworld and its suspiciously familiar-looking collectible creatures. 
“We have received many inquiries regarding another company’s game released in January 2024,” the company states. “We have not granted any permission for the use of Pokémon intellectual property or assets in that game. We intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pokémon.”
While The Pokémon Company doesn’t explicitly name Palworld or its developer, Pocketpair, in its statement, we presume it’s investigating the record-setting Steam title based on the specified release window and recent controversies surrounding the game’s alleged infringement of Pokémon IP. 
“We will continue to cherish and nurture each and every Pokémon and its world, and work to bring the world together through Pokémon in the future,” the company states in closing.

By the time I saw the credits on Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, I felt like I had been through the emotional ringer. I was mentally exhausted. I think that's by design. Infinite Wealth is developer Ryu Ga Gotoku's (RGG) most ambitious project by a long shot – an epic tale told across multiple characters and continents, featuring the conclusion of some nearly 20-year-old plot threads that leave at least one character, quite literally and relatably, asleep in the streets.

        <updated>2024-01-24T18:08:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nier Reincarnation, the story-driven mobile RPG set in the popular Nier universe, will have its services ended this April. While the game will continue to receive support until then, its final story campaign will serve as its last big hurrah. 
Reincarnation first launched on July 28, 2021 for iOS and Android and takes place within an unspecified point in the Nier timeline. Like the previous titles, Reincarnation is an RPG set within a mysterious prison world called The Cage, with players controlling different protagonists divided across multiple story arcs. The game has also hosted several crossover events with games such as the remake of Nier Replicant, Final Fantasy XIV, and Persona 5.
The shutdown news came the same day as the launch of the latest chapter of its final story arc, The People And The World, dubbed Act II: The Return. Check out the trailer below.


In a shutdown notice, Square Enix states, 
Until service concludes, Square Enix will offer 10 free summons per day, weekly gem gifts, and other perks. Sales of items on the Premium Shop have ceased. You can read the full rollout of final updates and events in Square Enix's blog post. 
Former editor Jason Guisao was impressed with Nier Reincarnation, hailing it in an opinion piece as one of the strongest mobile titles available, writing that "Lengthy narratives and skill-based gameplay loops have come in console/PC-ports like Genshin Impact and PUBG Mobile. Nier Reincarnation, however, employs a happy medium. Heartfelt plotlines with striking visuals, Keiichi Okabe’s mesmerizing score, unintrusive microtransactions, and simple, but rewarding, combat controls establish Reincarnation as one of the best console-like games on mobile devices."]]></summary>

That's $100 below the original launch price of the chip and the exact same price as the slightly slower but otherwise identical Ryzen 5 7600. (It's even cheaper than Intel's $204 Core i5 13400F, a chip that the 7600X beats convincingly in most games.) 
In the UK, it's the 7600 that's the better deal, at £189 versus the 7600X at £209, but both are fine value options too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roots Of Yggdrasil - an inkwashed, roguelikey, card-playing, turn-based citybuilder, inspired by Norse myth - shot to the top of my wishlist after I read Katharine's preview last week. And look, here it is in Early Access. Roots isn't one of your traditional, SimCity-derived town sims in which you steadily colonise a single map (at least, until you lose patience with your glittering urban creation and press the Godzilla or Hurricane button). As per the roguelike element, it's a game about being on the run. 


In Roots, you take charge of a band of warriors fleeing an expanding purple smog, the Ginnungagap, in a flying longship. To escape its coils, you must land on floating islands, play cards to raise settlements, and harvest energy for your vessel from the titular roots of the World Tree. Succumb to the advancing mists, and you'll time-rewind back to your Holt to unlock new mechanics and upgrades. There are also various big-league mythological celebrities to meet and recruit, and a variety of randomised encounters and events to shake up each run. Here's the launch trailer.

Educate me, wrestling fans.
Valheim isn't waving a folding chair or a small flight of stairs, mind you. It's holding a development diary for the forthcoming Ashlands update, due sometime in the first half of 2024. The update introduces the titular Ashlands biome, a blend of graveyard and volcano level notable for the presence of burning skellingtons, some of whom emerge from glowering stone totems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I realised several hours into my Enshrouded playthrough that I have an unspoken internal checklist for what makes a great open-world survival crafting game. Great building, a sense of scale, a beautiful atmosphere, and the ability to die in extremely stupid ways. In Minecraft, it's digging straight down into lava. In Valheim, it's getting crushed by the very tree you'd just chopped down. And after dying for the third time by trying to climb a slightly-too-steep hill, slipping down and building enough momentum to send me careening off the cliff to my death, I realised that Enshrouded, too, ticks all the boxes for maybe one day being listed among the titans of the genre.
One paragraph in, and I've already compared Enshrouded to Valheim. You'll see that quite a bit throughout this review, and for good reason. Enshrouded has come the closest for me to recapturing that feeling of when the world collectively discovered Valheim for the first time. But that's both an accolade and a reservation. Because it's not quite there... yet.

I get the same kind of blank canvas choice paralysis I do in games like Minecraft, or anything where there's no real clear objective for what I'm meant to be building. I sit there with a big toybox of lovely things to stick together, but always end up deflated and disappointed with my own lack of imagination. But Summerhouse, the sandbox citybuilder (or townbuilder, more like) from solo developer Friedemann is just teeny-tiny enough to give me a sense of creative satisfaction. I've been playing its gorgeous little demo this week in between Palworld sessions, and yes, more of this please, this is utterly delightful. Happily, we don't have to wait too long for the final game now either, as it's coming to Steam on March 8th.

        <updated>2024-01-24T13:45:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo revealed during a Direct last September Splatoon 3's Side Order DLC would be coming to the game sometime in the spring of this year. Now, just a few months later, Nintendo has revealed exactly when: February 22, 2024. That's when Wave 2 of the Splatoon 3 expansion pass, which features Side Order as the star of the show, goes live, and it's when players can explore the Spire of Order, a brand new location. 
Nintendo announced this news with a short teaser trailer today that shows Agent 8 sleeping on a train. The teaser then transitions to the Spire of Order where a mysterious voice is calling out to Agent 8. 
Check it out for yourself below in the Splatoon 3 Side Order DLC release date trailer: 


For the uninitiated, Agent 8 is the protagonist from Splatoon 2's Octo Expansion. In Side Order, Agent 8 will meet a new character named Acht, who claims to go "way back" with Marina, one of the hosts of Splatoon 2. Marina's co-host, Pearl, seems to make an appearance of sorts in Side Order as a robot that accompanies Agent 8 on their journey. 
With the Spire of Order devoid of color, Acht gives Agent 8 color chips to modify their abilities, like boosting run speed and increasing damage. It's likely Agent 8's colored ink will be used to bring color back to the spire, too, but we'll have to wait until February 22 to find out. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Splatoon 3 review, and then check out what else is in the Splatoon 3 expansion pass. 
Are you going to check out Side Order next month? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

The monster-catching survival sim continues to set concurrent play records on Steam, and Pocketpair are presently focussed on fixing bugs. Beyond that, though, the sky appears to be the limit, as you might expect of a game that shifted a million copies in eight hours. In particular, Pocketpair seem markedly more confident about the odds of adding PvP to the game, having downplayed the idea in interviews before release.

Lil' Guardsman is a Papers, Pleaselike though - and a seemingly delightful one. You play as 12-year-old Lil, who is a substitute guard at the castle gate for a fantasy kigndom, and you must decide who to admit and who to deny entry. It's out now.

The "biggest impact" will be felt outside of core development, though the reductions will affect at least one major internal team - the developers of Legends Of Runeterra. Riot are also binning off the Riot Forge publishing label, under which third-party developers create smaller-scale games based on Riot's own intellectual properties.

But for the studio's next projects, it seems the mystery will begin before the games are even announced – today, two Steam listings were posted on Half Mermaid's developer page, but most of their information is redacted.
The games, currently called "Project C" and "Project D," have very few concrete details listed. White text blocks give the page a redacted look, so only a few words in each sentence are legible, and the images and videos in their galleries are surreal and vague. Obscure details are still details, however, so here's a breakdown of what we know about each game so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers with keen memories may remember that I recently self-described as being in my scented candle girlie era. I'm currently burning one called Starry Night, which is a nice fresh scent but it's nowhere near as strong as I would like. I can never find fresh scents that are as long-lingering as the fruity or woody ones. Anyway, I have been discussing my new interest (and interrupting work meetings with pretend candle unboxing videos where I tell them to like and subscribe and check out my collab with WickManiac) with the rest of the Treehouse, which prompted us to talk about the idea of gamer candles. They exist! They're just candles of lies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new update for the PC Game Pass and Xbox versions of Palworld has fixed some of its many, many known issues today, but those hoping for some fixes to its online multiplayer options will sadly have to wait a little longer. Currently, those playing on Game Pass still don't have the ability to join or create dedicated servers for up to 32-player multiplayer like their mates on Steam can. Instead, they remain limited to just 2-4-player co-op via the use of friend codes, meaning that Game Pass players aren't having quite the same experience as their Steam counterparts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blake Hester is hard at work on Game Informer’s full review of the exceptionally long Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, but while he is gathering his final thoughts, I wanted to share my impressions so far.
Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth can be deathly serious when it wants to be. A character with a negative first encounter with the game’s protagonist, Ichiban, soon reveals he is in over his head with the local Yakuza and spent time in jail, leading to heartbreaking difficulties with his significant other. Ichiban is sympathetic and builds him up with his unique and often excessive brand of optimism. The moment is well-written and genuinely moving. Those moments (at least in the first 11 hours) are rare and hit hard as a result.

Check them out for yourself in the new Princess Peach: Showtime gameplay trailer below:

The bar for the fighting game genre has been uppercut to astronomical heights in recent years. Exceptional one-on-one combat remains the primary bullet point, but other series have complimented their packages with robust suites of destinations, from cinematic story campaigns to comprehensive training dojos. Although Tekken 8’s fighting remains a treat thanks to some neat tweaks to its strong formula, the rest of the package, while respectable, falls short of some of its contemporaries.

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for Orion Burger, the classic game by Sanctuary Woods. The engine also adds a few niceties that the original didn't have, such as mouse wheel handling, and using the spacebar to skip walk animations - something the original didn't do properly.
Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game's logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation. And please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, luck be with you. And remember, with the aliens cheating on the tests they set up for you, this will be no easy task.
