Some of the game's oldest fans may well remember that DE's sci-fi adventure ambitions started earlier still, with the original concept behind Dark Sector: a game that embodied many of Warframe's core design principles at first, only to eventually be retrofitted into a bog standard (albeit charming) cover-based third-person shooter. Well, Dark Sector has always had more than a few parallels with Warframe proper, and those parallels may be explored in a new context with Warframe: 1999.
Notably, Digital Extremes recently revealed one of Warframe's two upcoming expansions, those being Whispers in the Walls and Warframe: 1999. 1999 is due to launch someti…]]></summary>

While no exact date was announced, cross-progression is coming to Warframe sometime in 2023. The game previously allowed cross-play between consoles and PC players, but saves were bound to each system.

Cross-progression was an often requested feature, and devs confirmed previously that it was in the works. Cross-progression has fortunately become the norm, though that wasn’t always the case.

The mashing together of tinted alloys and astral flame, the blend of over-the-shoulder shooting and swordplay, the environments that occasionally look like GPU boxart on steroids – it’s impressive, but a lot to digest. 
The Canadian developer’s new project Soulframe has the same sense of swagger, with menus consisting of beautiful, quasi-medieval illustrations decorated with scrolls and dancing figures. But it’s a quieter thrill, a stately and absorbing world of hazy forests and sun-pierced catacombs, which calls to mind both Dragon’s Dogma and the overlooked tiny MMO Book of Travels. After catching a hands-off presentation in advance of this year’s Tennocon, I am pretty keen to play.

This message comes to you from that primeval epoch known as "Last Wednesday", when Digital Extremes treated RPS to a preview screening of the Warframe update announcements planned for this year's Tennocon - a special Tennocon indeed, coinciding as it does with the game's 10th anniversary and the studio's 30th. Alas, "Last Wednesday" was a regular Dark Age, and we dusty ancients were granted only a partial glimpse of the promised new areas, weapons, cosmetics and story content, Digital Extremes having reserved some of the key reveals for a happier period, "Today" - which, according to our most trusted seers, will be an era of understanding and transparency. Fickle are the winds of history! Still, even with the limited insight of our time, we grasped at some sense of the offering's magnitude. Read on, if you dare.

Some criticism also fell upon its four classes, who lacked the 'career' subclasses of its developer's previous game, Vermintide 2.

Darktide's classes will therefore get an overhaul October 4th, when an update will introduce skill trees for each class.

Back when Sea of Stars — Sabotage's follow-up to its hit genre-bending platformer The Messenger — was unveiled to the world in 2020, there was a sparkle in many an RPG fans' eyes. The game's stunning SNES-style aesthetic, the combo-centric turn-based combat, and the beautiful music, brought forth cries of Chrono Trigger, Super Mario RPG, and many other classics from the mid-'90s.
Over three years later, and after a handful of delays, Sabotage's highly anticipated RPG is almost ready to launch. The journey of the Solstice Warriors lies ahead for many Switch owners, but the question of whether this will transport 16-bit RPG enthusiasts back to a time when they truly fell in love with the genre remains.

In an interview with Eurogamer, Phil Spencer addressed the perceived issues with Series S and why owners understand the changes.
"I don't see a world where we drop S," Spencer said, "In terms of parity, I don't think you've heard from us or Larian, that this was about parity. I think that's more that the community is talking about it. There are features that ship on X today that do not ship on S, even from our own games, like ray-tracing that works on X, it's not on S in certain games. So, for an S customer, they spent roughly half what the X customer bought, they understand that it's not going to run the same way."

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they've been chewing over. Today, Mahin laments the loss of a treasured deck, and recounts his quest to build it anew. For real, this time...

There was once a time I was doing moderately alright at the Pokémon TCG Online game, taking down EX and GX cards with a tactic that nullified those types, which were mainstays in many decks. Now, all that’s left is a broken deck. A family of Pokémon torn apart for the sake of capitalism where the motto isn’t 'gotta catch 'em all' but 'gotta keep buying the new ones'. This is an ode to my long lost Pokémon Deck from Pokémon TCG Online, caught in the crossfire of the new migration system to Pokémon TCG Live.

That, however, ignores the rare but very real case of sequels that don't necessarily suck but that will baffle fans with their nigh-inexplicable new design choices. We shouldn't forget this class of sequel, it does at least a great job of providing fun to anyone learning about just how absolutely bizarre these games can get.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic the Hedgehog first appeared in 1990’s Rad Mobile for arcade a few months before the first Sonic the Hedgehog game. He appears as an ornament dangling from the ceiling of the car.
I wanted to get that bit of trivia out of the way because it’s often all anybody knows about Rad Mobile. That is, if they even remember the name. I say that because I could never really remember it. Not until I became interested in pre-3D racing games.
This is mostly because Rad Mobile was only once ported to console and never in North America. That is, until it was chosen as one of the games for the Sega Astro City Mini. That’s still a pretty niche platform in this part of the world, so I’m still waiting for it to finally get the spotlight over here.

The newest installment in the Homeworld series will feature a new roguelike-inspired multiplayer mode called War Games. Unveiled at GamesCom, the new mode creates a strategic co-op experience mixed with elements of roguelike gameplay.
War Games can be played solo or cooperatively with up to two others, meaning three players in total. Plays will select a starting fleet and command it through a series of three randomized combat challenges, hence the roguelike mechanics. Those who successfully manage their fleets through the objectives obtain Artifacts that can augment their ships.

This brings the BG3 version number to 4.1.1.3669438, so make sure you're on the proper version when you play next! It's important to do so because Patch 1 addresses over 1,000 bugs as well as introduces some balance changes and fixes some flow issues while playing.
According to Larian Studios, this patch tackles some visual bugs while adding some more post-launch polish. Enemies should no longer spot you when they shouldn't be able to, and random items should no longer defy gravity and float. Perhaps most importantly, romancing Shadowheart has been fixed meaning those who could not reach the conclusion of romancing her should now be able to. Thank Shar, am I right?

If you remember Newgrounds, and you frequented that website, then you'll probably remember Alien Hominid. The Flash game eventually made its way to consoles — including GameCube — in 2004, but The Behemoth has confirmed that the original game will get getting an HD remaster.
Co-launching with Alien Hominid Invasion — the reimagining that was revealed way back in 2020 — Alien Hominid HD it has the same hand-drawn graphics you remember from the early 2000s. In a blog post on the developer's website, it confirmed that fans had been "asking for ages" as the original console releases are much harder to get hold of nowadays. The game is currently available to buy on the Xbox 360 store.

After the end of the second episode, we find Drummer and her crew piloting the Artemis toward the coordinates found on a data card in the first episode. Episode 3 begins with the Artemis approaching the location of those coordinates: an old derelict space station.
Interestingly, this is one of the earliest created space stations. It was built shortly after the creation of the Epstein Drive, which allowed interplanetary travel in the solar system. This station existed before the term "Belters," and before the formation of the OPA. This station was home to some of the first humans to leave Earth and settle in space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rayman fans are over the moon after the announcement that the limbless hero will be featured in the next Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope DLC. However, there might be more to look forward to. The game's director, Davide Soliani, teased a return to glory for the French platforming mascot Wednesday. He also confirmed there will be a secret message if you finish the DLC with a 100% completion rate. The prospects of the first Rayman game since 2013 might come to fruition.
According to fan community leader ItzalDrake from Rayman Together, Sparks of Hope director Davide Soliani sent a message to the character's fanbase just before the launch of the Phantom Show DLC:
"I hope that all the community and all Rayman players support us as much as possible because I'm on a mission: my mission is to be able to bring Rayman back to the glory he deserves."

https://twitter.com/RaymanTogether/status/1694386555723342118
When was the last Rayman game released?
The limbless hero has been absent for a long time, which is strange as he was an important mascot for Ubisoft during the beginning of the studio's history. The last true game in the series was Rayman Legends, released back in 2013: a decade ago this month. If you want to go all the way back, the last 3D platforming adventure Rayman 3 came out in 2003. A fourth entry or even a follow-up to the 2D platforming subseries would be a dream for many fans of the series.
Soliani did not outright confirm a new game in the series, but as previously mentioned, he has teased a secret hidden message for those who 100% complete the DLC. "I hope for your support and I hope you like it!" he concluded in his message to the fans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spice is life, and it's about to flow in full as Dune: Spice Wars prepares to leave Early Access. Developer Shiro Games and publisher Funcom announced plans to bring Version 1.0 to Steam in September 2023. There's also a release trailer to go along with the news. The new preview shows off more of the real-time warfare and the various means of political sabotage at your disposal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZJPQ2dRt-8
Dune: Spice Wars originally launched in Early Access on April 26, 2022. The 4X real-time strategy game tasks players with battling for control over Arrakis. Multiple factions—including House Atreides and House Harkonnen—are available along with key characters from Frank Herbert's novel.

Tremors
In addition to controlling spice resources and pulling off acts of subterfuge to expand, you'll need to watch out for sandworms. Ignoring wormsign is a great way to lose your spice harvesters and troops. The number of games featuring any form of giant worm management or warning system in place is shockingly low. We'll take what we can get and consider it a bonus if a quality RTS happens to be attached. 
The folks behind Dune: Spice Wars previously worked on Northgard, a strategy survival game based on Norse mythology. Northgard launched in 2018 and received its latest major update in April 2023. Like Northgard, players seem mostly positive on Spice Wars so far. Hopefully this sandworm will boast a similarly long post-launch tail. 
If you're looking for more on how this one came together, the devs have been fairly active in showing off concept art and other details.

Join us today and each Friday on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. 
After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. 
Part 1 - Surpr-iced!

The debacle began at the start of the week when said leaker posted low-quality videos of himself playing Starfield. Most of the original uploads are no longer available. YouTube's takedowns cite copyright claims by ZeniMax Media, Bethesda's parent company, and removed within hours of going live early on August 22.
However, this didn't seem to dissuade the original uploader. Additional videos later followed featuring himself with several copies of Starfield for sale ahead of the official release date. The original uploads are gone, but othe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 will feature a familiar face in actor Shawn Ashmore. While movie/comic fans likely know him best from his portrayal of Bobby Drake/Iceman in the X-Men film series, Remedy fans were previously acquainted with Ashmore as protagonist Jack Joyce in 2016's Quantum Break. 
Ashmore will play a character named Tim Breaker. Who is Breaker? He’s a sheriff, but that’s all we know for now. However, the fact that he shares a name and occupation with Bright Falls sheriff Sarah Breaker from the first Alan Wake seems more than coincidental. In a video message posted to Twitter by Alan Wake 2 creative director Sam Lake, Ashmore expressed his excitement to work with Remedy again and to play the sequel as an Alan Wake fan himself. 
The brilliant actor and our good friend, the legendary @ShawnRAshmore plays Tim Breaker in ALAN WAKE 2. We have wanted to work together again ever since Quantum Break. Now it’s happening!! So good to have you in this, Shawn! 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️🕺🕺🕺 @alanwake @remedygames pic.twitter.com/LQ9lnjA0gx
August 25, 2023
“I’m very excited to be part of the game with my friends at Remedy Entertainment," says Ashmore in the video. "Our last adventure was Quantum Break, and me personally, I’ve been waiting to play Alan Wake 2 ever since I finished the first game I don’t know how many years ago. I’m sure there’s a lot of people out there that are as excited as I am. So please stay tuned. We’ll release more details about my character, Tim Breaker, and I hope you enjoy playing it. I know I will."
Alan Wake 2 is set to release on October 27, having recently been pushed back from its previous October 17 date. The game stars dual protagonists Alan Wake and FBI agent Saga Anderson, with the former fighting to escape The Dark Place while the latter investigates a murder mystery in the Pacific Northwest. You can watch the latest trailer from Gamescom 2023 here and read our impressions of a Summer Game Fest demo featuring Saga here.]]></summary>

The downside of such a bounty is there are even more gems getting overlooked than usual, because nobody has the time even when we're aware of them. Like, for example, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk.

It absolutely is the Jet Set Radio tribute it looks like, and it's a delight even if, like me, you never really liked the originals. Inspired by, rather than tracing over the rail grinding, spraypainting, all-dancing classic. It plays a little smoother, it clocks in shorter, and runs a little faster, but it's undeniably dancing to the same beat.

According to Factorio found kovarex, Factorio: Space Age will continue the player's journey after launching rockets into space at the end of the base game. Players will discover new worlds with their own unique challenges and exploit their resources. In doing so, new technological advances will be found. Furthermore, players will be able to manage their own fleet of interplanetary space platforms.
It's been three years since Factorio officially released, and over seven years since its Early Access release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consistent with the spirit of the game, Baldur’s Gate 3’s first “major” patch notes are too large to even fit into Steam’s usual text character limit. Developer Larian instead published a portion of the patch details on a Steam blog and the rest on their forums, which were briefly  down - probably either due to an online traffic jam or just, again, the patch’s sheer size. Regardless, we have well over three thousand words worth of details on today’s patch, which addresses around one thousand bugs and graces us with “Short King Summer” before it’s too late. But beware: there are some spoilers in the patch notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Where would we be without Steam? It's easily the most popular way to download and play PC games in the current climate. The developer Valve also treats us to numerous events and sales throughout the year, and the next one is just around the corner.
If you like strategy games, then get ready for Steam Strategy Fest. As the name implies, this will be a celebration of all things tactical. A recent promo video gives a brief hint at what's to come.
https://youtu.be/xYp3ugqPxiA
The event will kick off Monday, August 28 at 10AM Pacific and will go on until September 4, so that's a week in which to get your strategy on (that's a saying, right?)
What's to be expected?
As always, Steam isn't saying absolutely everything about Strategy Fest. Suffice it to say, you can find demos and discounted games on sale throughout the week. As for what's going to be on offer, it's hard to say, but the short video above outlines a few titles that are likely to be included, such as Dune: Spice Wars and The Riftbreaker. Essentially, if this is a genre you're into, you're bound to find something you like.
Considering that we recently had the Visual Novel Fest, and before that the Stealth Fest, Valve does a good job of making sure we all stay tuned into its gaming platform. We can't help ourselves. There's usually something for everyone at these sales events. They make our Steam libraries look nice and bulky, even if they have the opposite effect on our collective wallets and digital bank accounts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The paranormal horror game Phasmophobia originally launched on September 18, 2020, on PC where it enjoyed popularity among streamers. Kinetic Games has PS5 and Xbox Series X/S ports in the works, but you'll have to wait a little longer than expected before you can get your hands on them. The studio has announced that the game has been delayed, pushing its Early Access console launch from August to October, in the week leading up to Halloween.
https://twitter.com/KineticGame/status/1694849069045194958?t=tRaDEz-xKbFYrOeZT2OxnQ&s=19
As the studio explains on Twitter, the delay is the result of a "fire incident" in its office building, along with "unpredicted development issues." With the extra time gained by the delay, the studio hopes to perfect and fine-tune the ports.
[caption id="attachment_399024" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Kinetic Games.[/caption]
Phasmophobia lands just in time for Halloween
The delay isn't too long, and in the meantime, PC players can enjoy the recently released Ascension update which brings several changes, including a new leveling system with "new rates of progression, new unlocks, and a prestige system," along with several minor bug fixes.
PS5 owners will be happy to know that a PS VR2 version is also in the works, and crossplay will allow friends to play together regardless of what platform they're on. The game has already demonstrated that it is capable of providing a terrifying VR experience thanks to its VR support on PC.
Phasmophobia's minor delay pushes it into an appropriately spooky time, which could end up being a positive for it. However, Phasmophobia will have to contend with several other headliners scheduled for October, including horror titles like Alan Wake 2 and Alone in the Dark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced that the next game joining the Nintendo Switch Online (Expansion Pack) line-up. Excitebike 64 will be arriving on August 30.
Excitebike 64 is generally remembered as being a better-than-expected motocross game. It was a rather strange title where, if you looked past the rather generic visuals and excess of dirt, you’d be rewarded with a lot of strangeness. This includes a soccer mini-game that the internet likes to call the original version of Rocket League and an endless desert.
It also got an unexpectedly awesome trailer:
https://youtu.be/mVHhNyEQeio?feature=shared
I rented Excitebike 64 back in the day and loved it. When I reunited with it years later, I couldn’t find that same spark. I pick it up every now and then, trying to remember why I loved it so much, and still can’t do it. There’s too much dirt. Too much bike. Not enough excite. Still, remember when Nintendo had its own line of sports games that didn’t involve Mario? I prefer Mario sports games over real ones, but I also love variety.
This is the fourth of five games Nintendo promised us for 2023. Many have been pointing out that somehow Mario Party 3 is currently the one left out. Considering the first two Mario Party games were released in 2022, it’s kind of strange that they aren’t in more of a hurry to complete the trilogy.
It would also be nice if they added more non-Nintendo titles. The Star Wars games, maybe? The Goemon games? Hybrid Heaven? It doesn’t really matter to me, personally, since I have an extensive N64 collection. However, there’s more to experience on the console than just Nintendo’s contributions.
Excitebike 64 will be arriving on the Nintendo Switch Online N64 app on August 30.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among all this Starfield talk, it's easy to forget that The Elder Scrolls 6 is even a thing (maybe). It's been five years since we were treated to a brief tease of the next installment in Bethesda's flagship series, and the face of the studio seems to regret being too hasty with things.
In a recent interview with GQ, Mr. Skyrim himself, Todd Howard, says he me have been a bit too quick to announce TES6, adding, "I probably would've announced it more casually."
https://youtu.be/OkFdqqyI8y4
Of course, the interviewer asks whether Howard can divulge any further details about The Elder Scrolls 6. Naturally, the director isn't saying anything, though he does say that the upcoming RPG does have a codename. He also says that he and the team want the next TES game to "fill that role of the ultimate fantasy-world simulator."
So when is it co-
When's it coming out, I hear you ask? Again, nobody can really say. As a sidenote, Howard does make a comment about how he wants to keep making games, with no plans to retire any time soon. He even likens his career path to Nintendo's own Shigeru Miyamoto, who's now in his early 70s.
It's at this point that the GQ interviewer offers their own speculation, saying that The Elder Scrolls 6 may not be out until Todd Howard reaches 60. Given that his Wikipedia page has him down as being either 52 or 53, this means TES6 might still be a good seven or eight years off.
Obviously, that's just speculation. Although recent rumors suggest the long-awaited follow-up to Skyrim might be at least five years away. In any case, Bethesda definitely seemed to have done itself a disservice by announcing it so soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco have announced a substantial 2.0 patch and the first DLC pack for their rollercoaster management game Park Beyond, both of which are dropping on September 29th. Prefabs and ride sharing are the big new additions coming with the free 2.0 patch, alongside the option to discover other player’s creations across platforms. Countdown to fiding the first penis-shaped coaster starts now.
The game already encouraged designing borderline cruel rides that pushed health and safety regulations, but the upcoming DLC Beyond eXtreme takes things one step further with contraptions that shake punters around like a fizzy drink, among new maps, rides and scenery items. On a side note, I’ve thought the game’s previous trailers were quietly creepy and the latest is no different. Maybe it’s the playground jingle in the background, or maybe I’m just sensitive to enthusiastic announcer voices. Take a look.

That has to be taken into account when we think about the development of the game, and it could be why, after 20-minutes spent exploring a bit of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl's irradiated world, I'm unsure what to make of it.
Maybe I played a very early build, but while the world itself looks every bit the eerie post apocalyptic survival wasteland you hope, NPC interactions aren't in as great shape. Chats with friendlies are unclear, and in firefights the enemy AI is shonky - to the extent that I think it'll be more useful as a preview to just tell you exactly what happened to me as I played.

We've seen some pretty weird and wonderful builds in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but this one is most certainly one of the wildest out there.
Much like Breath of the Wild, the latest Zelda entry features dragons, all of which gently glide around the land of Hyrule, occasionally shooting down into a chasm leading to the Depths. They're undoubtedly among the most impressive creatures discoverable in the game, but one player apparently wanted to go one step further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GSC Game World's S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has had quite an eventful development timeline. Fans were initially excited when the game was announced, though it quickly drew criticism when developers announced that NFTs would be included. The Ukrainian studio backtracked on this, though it then had to contend with the Russian invasion of Ukraine which resulted in the game's delay.
As revealed in a fact sheet from the studio at Gamescom 2023, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has been delayed yet again, pushing its release date to Q1 2024. This may be disappointing news but with a new trailer out, you can rest assured that GSC Game World is still working hard on the upcoming game.
[caption id="attachment_398998" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via GSC Game World.[/caption]
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2's development has been anything but predictable
It was inevitable that the Ukranian studio would be affected by the ongoing conflict, as it was based in Kyiv. When the invasion began, development was paused as the studio relocated to Prague and employees fled the conflict zone. Some decided to stay and fight alongside the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The studio has also found itself subject to cyberattacks originating in Russia, and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2's site was banned from the country after it ceased operations there. Despite the setbacks, the studio has continued to condemn the Russian invasion while embracing its Ukranian roots.

On a more positive note, preorders for the game are finally available, which represents some progress. It has also received positive reception at Gamescom 2023 where a playable demo was available, indicating that the long wait might be worth it.

While its one-hit-kill combat was fast, flashy and infinitely more appealing than some of the other neon lambs being led to the cyberpunk slaughter in the back end of 2020, its precise platforming and marksman-grade enemies made it a hard game to love while you were actually playing it. But having sat down for 45 minutes with Ghostrunner 2 at this year's Gamescom, I'm pleased to report that this is a sequel done right, building on everything you know and (probably) love about the first game, while also ushering in new, optional concessions to help make its still wonderfully gory swordplay much more approachable for old two-left-thumbs-McGee over here. Then there's the motorbike, which… phwoar. Let me tell you about the motorbike.

That vampire is named Kado Thorne and he’s made the battle island his home in Fortnite Chapter 4: Season 4. He’s draining the wealth and treasures around it to fund some new real estate (see: points of interest) around the island: Sanguine Suites, Relentless Retreat, and Eclipsed Estate. 

Epic Games says these three locations are strongly defended bases with cameras, laser grids, and guards. And inside, you’ll find Thorne has filled them with …]]></summary>

I think a game industry where every title is tripping over each other in an attempt to be the most meaningful experience you have had would be pretty miserable. Developers should have fun with the creative process. It should be fulfilling to them. Otherwise, we’d just be getting our entertainment from workers on an assembly line. That’s not how art works.
This might be obvious, but I say that because Orbo’s Odyssey did not combust my crotch. I played it because I like the cut of the developer’s jib. Feverdream Johnny is probably best known for their work on Nowhere, MI. They’ve partnered with Ben Drury for this sort of spin-off or sequel to Peeb Adventures.

        <updated>2023-08-24T19:23:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian founder and CEO Swen Vincke has shared an update on its massive RPG Baldur's Gate 3 coming to Xbox. While Baldur's Gate 3 is now looking set to debut on Xbox Series consoles this year, it won't have split-screen co-op for the Series S version.
Vincke announced that, after meeting with Xbox head Phil Spencer, the team found a "solution" to bring Baldur's Gate 3 to Xbox players.
"All improvements will be there, with split-screen coop on Series X," said Vincke. "Series S will not feature split-screen coop, but will also include cross-save progression between Steam and Xbox Series."
Split vision
While no split-screen co-op will disappoint Series S owners, Vincke stated back in June that split-screen would be one of the potential hangups for the Xbox version. He mentioned compromises might need to be made for an Xbox version, and it looks like lack of split-screen on Series S is going to be among them. Microsoft typically requires feature parity between Xbox Series games, but for now this is one bullet point that will stay on Series X. 
In an interview with IGN earlier this week, Spencer had commented on the Baldur's Gate 3 situation. "The decision to do split-screen or not is a creative decision, a dev decision," Spencer said. "So if we think about Forza, it has nothing to do with any kind of hardware thing on S and X, just where they wanted to focus their time." Vincke had previously confirmed to IGN that Xbox had committed some help to Larian in getting BG3 up to scratch on its consoles.
Next up for Baldur's Gate 3 is the PlayStation 5 version. Larian will bring the game to Sony's console on September 6, following an earlier delay.

After a number of fumbles stemming from Lightfall's release onwards, it looked like the studio just couldn't catch a break with Destiny 2. Now, thankfully, things appear to have settled down, and players seem pretty happy with Season 22's key novelties.
The excitement comes from the destinythegame subreddit, where players posted dozens of trending threads doting over some of Season 22's best offerings. The Savathun's Spire activity has already been singled out as a particularly notable highlight, endeared for its high enemy density, interesting mechanics, and solid threat escalation from beginning to end.

In some cases this can mean better performance but particularly should yield a nice improvement to the power efficiency of Ryzen Zen 2 and newer platforms, especially laptops and other portable Linux systems like the Steam Deck and ROG Ally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an interview with GQ, Starfield Director and Executive Producer Todd Howard confirmed the open-world RPG does, in fact, have a New Game Plus mode.
Unfortunately, no actual details on the mode were provided. However, simple confirmation of the NG+ existing in Starfield is pretty exciting as it would be the first Bethesda Game Studios title to feature the mode. The NewGame Plus mod added NG+ support for Fallout 4, but otherwise, it has just been a highly requested feature.
According to the interview with GQ, your skill traits and backstory perks when creating a character will add a unique and exciting twist on New Game Plus and incentivize continued and repeat play.

Even more content for Starfield with New Game Plus
Gamescom has given us an idea of how long we can expect to spend in Starfield. Bethesda's Head of Publishing, Pete Hines, even mentioned we could potentially spend hundreds of hours in a Starfield playthrough.
I'm very curious about exactly how New Game Plus will work. In an open-world adventure with over 1,000 planets to explore, a single playthrough will surely have plenty of content. I'm excited to see what sort of new features or content will be available by going on the journey again. Either way, now that I know Starfield has a New Game Plus mode, perhaps I won't spend hours going back and forth on the starting traits I choose.
I suppose we'll know soon enough. Starfield releases on September 6 on PC and Xbox Series X|S. It will also be a day-one title on Xbox Game Pass. Players who pre-ordered the Premium Edition will get early access to Starfield on September 1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this summer, developer Jump Over The Age revealed Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector, a sequel that occurs “some time” after last year’s Citizen Sleeper. Today, Jump Over The Age and publisher Fellow Traveller revealed the sequel will launch on Xbox Series X/S and hit Xbox Game Pass on day one. 
The game will also be available on PC and through cloud gaming via Game Pass. Jump Over The Age also released the first-ever look at in-game footage of Citizen Sleeper 2, showcasing a new location called Hexport. Check it out below: 


“Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector will take players to a new location and once again put them in the body of a Sleeper, an escaped corporate-owned android trying to build a new life for themselves,” a press release reads. “This time, however, players will have a ramshackle ship and a crew they’ve recruited, both of which they will need to steer through a system-wide crisis.” 
This sequel will feature the same dice-based tabletop RPG mechanics of the first Citizen Sleeper, with new systems and mechanics “that will provide more depth, complexity, and challenge.” 

If you want more Citizen Sleeper right now, you can check out the Helion Dispatches, text-based narrative transmissions from the Pilgrim Seed, a refugee ship. These dispatches expand on the series’ lore, set up the narrative of the upcoming sequel, and bridge the gap between the first and second games. These dispatches are released every month and will continue to be through mid-2024. 
There’s no release date for Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector yet. 
In the meantime, watch the Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector announcement trailer and then read why Citizen Sleeper was one of our favorite games of last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AK-xolotl is a game with an elevator pitch built right into its name. The latest from publisher Playstack and developer 2Awesome Studio ranks high on the "we came up with the title first" list, but thankfully, it also looks like a good time. The top-down roguelite shooter now has a date and a trailer showing off its fast-paced fireworks.
This axolotl with an AK rolls into action on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam on September 14, 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xteTxUFl2xs
The gunplay in AK-xolotl looks pretty hectic, with some downright bullet hell-style patterns on display. In roguelite fashion, death isn't the end; it's just an excuse to start over, get stronger, and unlock new weapons. It's all accentuated with the help of nice looking pixel art visuals and some impressive sprite work, so hopefully the final game matches that energy. 
Look who's talkin'
Beyond the frantic shooting, AK-xolotl introduces an ally-raising system with the Axolittles. These little baby axolotls can be nurtured and fed until they eventually grow into adorable killing machines of their own. It looks like nurturing may involve putting diapers on them? This is the most I've ever thought about axolotls, much less changing their diapers. 
Based in Barcelona, 2Awesome Studio previously developed cyberpunk action-platformer Aeon Drive and shoot 'em up Dimension Drive. They also handle publishing and porting for a few other titles. If you want to try out their latest and give AK-xolotl a spin, the extended demo is available to play right now on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ticket sales for Genshin Concert 2023 are now underway, and every location that has opened up so far has sold out almost immediately. Genshin Concert is a live orchestral performance showcasing some of the gorgeous music in Genshin Impact. Ticket sales are staggered based on location, with Singapore and Malaysia opening up first.
Both dates for Singapore’s concerts were sold out in a matter of minutes, described by one Reddit user as an “absolute bloodbath.” Malaysia’s ticketing website was overwhelmed entirely, resulting in an error where people couldn’t even join the queue.
It’s not just Asian locations that are mad for tickets though. Two American locations began their own ticket sales shortly thereafter. New York has two concerts, and both of them reached a ticket queue of over 4,000 people within five minutes of opening. At least the website is holding up though! The same can’t be said for the website handling Mexico’s sales, which was still returning a 508 error half an hour after opening.
Other locations in the US, Asia, and Europe have yet to open their ticket sales. Boston, Los Angeles, and Chicago tickets open tomorrow. If you’re at all interested in snagging a ticket for yourself, be prepared to camp out early to get your place in the queue and may the Archons be with you.
Ticket Gacha and Scalping
The mad rush for tickets has some people suggesting that ticket sales should be based on a lottery — adding a gacha element to the gacha game’s live concert. The idea is being handled with varying degrees of seriousness, with some users joking about buying multiple tickets for a chance at a VIP seat.
Scalping has already begun too. Sale listings for Singapore and Malaysia tickets have begun appearing on Carousell, a marketplace platform for Southeast Asia. Many of these listings are auction-style, with most bids going much higher than the original selling price.

Baldur’s Gate 3 has been perhaps the biggest surprise hit of 2023 – we gave it one of the highest scores of the year – although Early Access players have been singing the RPG’s praises for a while now. It launched on PC earlier this month and is due on PlayStation 5 next month. Earlier this summer, Larian said it wants to launch Baldur’s Gate 3 on Xbox this year but might push into 2024 due to parity issues between Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.

One such nugget was the curious visual novel Milky Way Prince, which beautifully mixed surreal 2D images with even more surreal 3D backgrounds, all wrapped up in a toxic love story. Just when you thought a visual novel couldn’t get any more stylish, developer Lorenzo “Eyeguys” Redaelli comes back to one-up themself with Mediterranea Inferno, a rare game that makes you want to gobble its colours up with your eyeballs. Oh, and it’s out right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m not really one for patience in games. I’m definitely the hack and slash ‘em to bits kind of player rather than a slick stealthy player. My approach to games is pretty unruly is what I’m trying to say, but there has been one game that tamed my rampaging ways and that was Cappybara Games’ Below.
Below is a game that’s best played slowly. You’re tasked with reaching the bottom of an island’s subterranean caverns, trying to survive against monsters, traps, starvation, and dehydration. Each layer is shrouded in darkness meaning that you only have the small ring of light from your torch to watch carefully where you step. Charging through these levels is the quickest way of getting sliced and diced, and when you die, you begin back on the beach right next to the boat you arrived on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jusant is a meditative climbing adventure by Life is Strange developer Don't Nod. First revealed during Summer Game Fest, the game stars a nameless protagonist and his cuddly, water-like pet as they set out to scale a great mountain. The game mimics realistic climbing and physics, and players control each character's arms to pull themselves up and over ever-changing surfaces and obstacles while thoughtfully using a rope to extend their reach. Along the way, you'll explore the ruins of a lost civilization that once called the mountain its home. What happened to these people? What awaits at the summit for our hero? Jusant invites you to strap on your climbing gear and find out.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they explore a slice of Jusant's early chapters and provide a hands-on impression of this enigmatic adventure. Jusant is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC on October 31.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forget Starfield. Let's play something more old school instead. How about The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind? That's a classic Bethesda title, and it's still having mods made for it. But if you want a mix of the two, then we've got you covered on that front.
Before you take to the skies in Starfield, feel free to check out AnyOldName3's contribution to the current trend. Over on Nexus Mods, you'll find a small download for Morrowind that implements the contentious Starfield main menu screen.
[caption id="attachment_398649" align="aligncenter" width="640"] Image via AnyOldName3/Nexus Mods.[/caption]
That's right, the Starfield menu that has caused an uproar can be a part of one of the best role-playing games of a bygone era. And all before Bethesda's new sci-fi game even hits the shelves.
Shitpost modding is still modding
AnyOldName3's mod is a simple affair, replacing Morrowind's menu screen with Starfield's. If you do want to download it (just for shits and giggles, I guess), you will need OpenMW, as it only works though that.
That's basically all this mod does. As far as we can tell, it's still the same old Elder Scrolls 3. If you want to fundamentally improve or alter Morrowind in any way that's gameplay worthy, there are mods galore for that sort of thing.
As for Starfield, we are inching ever closer to its release date. By now, you've probably heard just about everything there is to know about Bethesda's brand-new IP. But in case you've forgotten, the game will be releasing on September 6 for PC and Xbox Series X|S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[October is already the most stacked month for releases, and Mike Mignola’s Hellboy: Web of Wyrd joins the pack. The upcoming brawler based on the popular comic series kicks off Halloween month with its arrival on October 4.
The game was first revealed during last year’s Game Awards and features an original story by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. The late Lance Reddick voices the titular half-demon. Web of Wyrd evokes its paperback origins with an art direction that faithfully replicates the look of the original comics. Players travel to The Wyrd, a brutal world teeming with supernatural threats, in an investigation to locate a missing member of the B.P.R.D.. The journey takes Hellboy and his allies to the Butterfly House, a location with a mysterious and likely sinister legacy. 
Web of Wyrd is a pure brawler, with players using Hellboy’s powerful fists to pummel foes while dodging and parrying incoming attacks. His gun, on the other hand, helps keep distant foes at bay. Developer Upstream Arcade also states that the game has roguelike elements. 


If that sounds up your alley, you can pick up Hellboy: Web of Wyrd on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

First announced in 2021 and based on the original film trilogy, players step into the metallic boots of RoboCop to protect Detroit from its criminal underground. 
Actor Peter Weller reprises his role as the titular hero, and a new trailer provides a glimpse into the game’s supporting players. We see Murphy team up with his faithful partner Anne Lewis while being introduced to police psychologist Dr. Olivia Blanche. 


Naturally, gameplay involves riddling targets with bullets as you march through levels like the walking tank that RoboCop is, but you’ll use investigative features to uncover clues and pinpoint suspects. Rogue City also presents a number of dialogue options to let players decide how to tackle missions. Developer Teyon is behind the project, the team behind Terminator Resistance. 
RoboCop: Rogue City will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We'll probably never see a third installment in Valve's legendary Left 4 Dead series, but that's okay. L4D2 is still getting a lot of love and, in fact, it recently received a small update that comes packed with tweaks, as well as one sought-after change.
As spotted by PC Gamer, the patch notes for the latest update to Left 4 Dead 2 notes that, among other things, Valve has finally decided to name the Swamp Fever gator, something that's apparently been requested by the community. From this day forth, the "swamp gator" shall canonically be known as...Fred. Do with this info as you must.
[caption id="attachment_398633" align="aligncenter" width="640"] Image via Valve/Steam.[/caption]
According to my own Steam account, this patch is only a 2MB download, but as you can see from the notes, there's a laundry list of tinkering that's gone on.
Still rockin' the Steam charts
And why shouldn't the developer keep its 14-year-old zombie co-op game alive and well? It's an absolute classic in the genre, giving more of what people loved in the original release. It's still going pretty strong overall. At the time of writing, SteamDB registers almost 27,000 players fightin' hordes in Left 4 Dead 2 right now. Also, the game is currently at the number 44 spot on the Steam charts.
That might not sound impressive, but considering Elden Ring is just ahead at 40 and Cyberpunk 2077 is trailing behind at position 48, Valve's classic FPS is still managing to pull in enough players. Although we were supposed to be seeing a return to the L4D format with Turtle Rock Studios' Back 4 Blood, it didn't quite hit the mark. For many, it was a decent zombie shooter, but it just couldn't reach the heights of Valve's long-dormant series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video game and general graphical technology is advancing so fast, that it's tough to keep up with it. Now, Nvidia has announced that the latest version of its Deep Learning Super Sampling (or DLSS) is on the way, and it's already going to support some modern titles.
Details can be found on Nvidia's website. The long and the short of it is: DLSS 3.5 is due to release sometime this fall. It represents the next stage in Team Green's upscaling AI tech, with a recent video from the company explaining just how it's better than previous iterations.
https://youtu.be/sGKCrcNsVzo
On top of that, games like Alan Wake 2 and Portal RTX will support version 3.5, as will the upcoming Phantom Liberty DLC for Cyberpunk 2077.
One for you graphical purists
The recent video announcing DLSS 3.5 gives an overview of how the people at Nvidia have improved the image upscaling algorithm. Bryan Catanzaro, Vice President of Applied Deep Learning Research, says this latest version will feature Ray Reconstruction.
How does it work? Catanzaro gives some insight into how it differs from the ray tracing technology many of us have come to be familiar with. Suffice it to say, most casual gamers probably won't be too concerned with the details. However, side-by-side comparisons showing Cyberpunk with all the iterations of DLSS (including 3.5) do show a difference in quality, especially when it comes to bolder colors in light reflections.
As always, the upcoming Nvidia AI will only be compatible with RTX-enabled graphics cards. Bit of a shame that it's not more open source, but no doubt AMD (and possibly Intel) will follow closely with newer and more powerful versions of their own upscaling alternatives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BioWare is a large studio known for titles such as Mass Effect: Andromeda and Dragon Age: Inquisition. It appears that all is not well at the studio, as on August 23, it announced that it is "eliminating approximately 50 roles."
According to a statement released by general manager Gary McKay, the move was made to help BioWare become a "more agile and more focused studio." McKay states that this is an unavoidable outcome, and steps will be taken to "ensure the process is handled with empathy, respect, and clear communication."
[caption id="attachment_398647" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Bioware.[/caption]
What's going on at BioWare?
According to McKay, BioWare's long-term vision is to deliver "exceptional story-driven single-player experiences filled with vast worlds and rich characters." This involves ensuring that the upcoming Dragon Age and Mass Effect games are a success. The announcement reveals that the studio's dedication to Dragon Age: Dreadwolf hasn't wavered, and that a team led by Mike Gamble is still working on the next Mass Effect game.
Employees affected by the layoffs won't be left stranded, according to McKay who promises to provide "impacted colleagues with as many internal opportunities as possible," though he does state that it is unlikely that everyone will find new internal roles. With several roles opening up in Electronic Arts' other studios, affected workers will also be assisted with their applications for these positions.
This is unfortunate news, though BioWare isn't the only studio that has suffered layoffs this year. The AR gaming studio Niantic has also met the same fate, as well as CD Projekt Red and  The Callisto Protocol's Striking Distance, to name a few.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Lil Gator Game launched last December, it captured our hearts as a fun, cozy adventure that drew obvious inspiration from the Legend of Zelda franchise. The low-stakes exploration, vibrant environments, and charming cast of characters all made for a cute, low-stress adventure that we couldn't help but enjoy (read our review here). Today, developer MegaWobble and publisher Playtonic Friends announced a new content update for its well-liked title to entice players to give it another go.
The free update, which arrives today on both versions of the game, adds new content as well as additional languages. If you've beaten the game (which doesn't take long), you can now access New Game Plus. This lets you carry your upgrades from you completed save file directly into the new game, giving you more exploration and customization options right off the bat. It also adds Baby Mode, which allows you to play the entire game as the baby version of Gator. Finally, the game is now playable in French, German, Brazilian Portuguese, and Latin American Spanish.
Lil Gator Game is available now on Switch and PC. For more on the short-but-sweet adventure, check out our review.]]></summary>

As I’ve been finding out, it’s also a fine fit for the Steam Deck: performance issues are few, controls translate comfortably, and it won’t hog too much space on a microSD card. Handheld life is good for Fires of Rubicon, even if it likes to keep yours brutish and short.

However, these underlying cases seem to go nowhere.

Is this a mere coincidence, or a pragmatic legal strategy?

But this year I got to spend a good 30-minutes in a match against other players and have come away… pleasantly surprised. I like the way it eschews the sometimes slow, methodical pace of other extraction shooters in favour of a faster-paced team deathmatch. While it's way too early to make big judgement calls like, "the entire game will be good", it might have more of a chance at launch survival than I thought.

At its core, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk wants to remind you how cool other games were. Specifically, Jet Set Radio, Jet Set Radio Future, and a tiny bit of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The problem is, by choosing nostalgia as its sole focus, Bomb Rush lacks an identity of its own – it only reminds me of why I'd rather play those other games instead. 
Bomb Rush attempts to right one of Sega's great crimes: the 21 years we've gone without a new Jet Set Radio game. For the uninitiated, Jet Set was an action sports series that put you in control of a gang of rollerbladers terrorizi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Playstack and developer 2Awesome have revealed that AK-xolotl will hit consoles and Switch this September. More specifically, the top-down roguelike shooter about a cute but deadly-with-a-gun axolotl will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 14. 
The team announced this release date during today’s Future Games Show presentation with a new trailer showing more of the amphibious creature’s violent stroll through the animal kingdom, and it looks great. It features a fun retro throwback visual style and plenty of arcade-like action in combat. 
Check out the AK-xolotl release date trailer for yourself below: 


To coincide with today’s news, a new extended AK-xolotl demo is now live on Steam. Playstack vice president of publishing Rob Crossley says the game’s previously released demo hit almost 70,000 downloads and with player feedback from that demo, 2Awesome has “really managed to expand on some ideas and add a few new really cool features as well.” Some of those new features are present in the new demo, but Crossley says some are being held for the final release. 
AK-xolotl features five unique biomes, each with a variety of enemies, as well as dozens of weapons and power-ups. There are “tons of Axolittles to find and raise” and bosses you’ll love to hate, Playstack says. 

AK-xolotl hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 14.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Crunching Koalas and Developer Label This Studio revealed its psychological thriller, The Gap, last year at the 2022 Future Games Show. Now, the team has returned to this year’s Future Games Show with a new trailer for The Gap and an October release date. 
The Gap will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 19, and preorders for the game are now live. Today’s new trailer is about Maria, who seems to be either the wife of protagonist Joshua Hayes or his daughter. In The Gap, players must explore Joshua’s memories, both of the joyous and heart-wrenching kind, to find a solution to his family’s affliction thanks to a new rare genetic disorder. 
Check out the latest trailer for The Gap for yourself below: 


“Delve deep into the human psyche in The Gap, a psychological thriller that seamlessly weaves together the realms of memories, emotions, and corporate intrigue,” a press release reads. “The game revolves around Joshua Hayes, a dedicated neuroscientist, whose life takes a sudden turn when his family becomes afflicted by a rare genetic disorder. As memories fade and sanity slips away, Joshua is faced with an unimaginable challenge: finding a cure before his family’s essence is forever lost.” 
Here are some screenshots from The Gap:

And you'd better believe that it was like Eldritch Christmas for me, because the 2007 original is quite possibly one of my favourite PC games of all time.

Developer Atlus dropped another gorgeous trailer that gives us a wee peek at its new anime cutscenes, fan favourite cast, and… wait a second. There aren’t any cool menus in this trailer and my day is ruined. But the trailer also confirms that the game is due to launch on February 2nd, 2024, so we can gawk at the level-up screens soon.

Do you prefer ones that fire straight up and then swoop down like birds of prey, or the kind that jet off to the sides, trapping the target in a pincer formation? How about a single missile that splits into a swarm of smaller missiles? Perhaps a zig-zagger that leaves a trail of explosive charges in its wake, detonating them like dynamite dominoes once it impacts? Well, whatever your fancy, Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon has a loadout for every occasion. With as many combinations as Dolly Parton's wardrobe, it’s almost a scandal to equip the same gear twice.

As a member of the niche mech-action genre, Armored Core has been out of commission for some time. The last entry in the series was a full 10 years ago, and since then, developer From Software’s other titles (Elden Ring, Bloodborne, etc.) have made the developer a household name. Now, the studio has returned with Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon (ACVI), applying many lessons from its other action games. Armored Core VI doesn’t revolutionize the mech game formula but refines it to create one of the genre's…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aperture Desk Job is full of unexplained details. Right at the start, as the camera pans down from the retrofuturist reception area to your lowly desk-based workstation, we see all manner of orange tubes, future Grady cores being trained to fool captcha image tests, a giant chicken, and what appears to be the origin point of Half-Life's ammo boxes being constructed. But there's also a pointed shot between the floorboards, showing us a pair of green praying mantises fumbling around over some electrical wiring and a rogue lightbulb. 
On its own, this mantis scene is no stranger than anything else we've witnessed in the last 30 seconds. But as your journey through Aperture goes on, things start getting really weird, really fast. Over the course of the next half hour, we'll see these mantises discover electricity, evolve into a society of tiny house-dwelling insects with their own carriages and courtship dances, and eventually a futuristic civilization who have mastered flying saucers and created an eternally self-sustaining power source. All in the same time it takes your supervisor core Grady to come up with a rudimentary prototype for what will eventually go on to become Portal's creepy turret. But you, yes you, CHARLIE, had to go and ruin it all by dropping the giant metal head of corporate mega-bastard Cave Johnson through the floorboards. What might those mantises have become, if they hadn't been so rudely crushed by your rampant disregard for their wellbeing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this summer, PlayStation revealed a dedicated handheld remote play device that puts one half of a DualSense controller on each side of an LCD screen. However, it stopped short of revealing its name or a price. Today, PlayStation has revealed it’s called the PlayStation Portal and will cost $199.99 when it’s released later this year.

The PlayStation Portal remote player includes the features you’d expect from a DualSense controller like adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. But wedged between the two controller halves is an 8-inch LCD screen capable of 1080p/60FPS playback. PlayStation says the device is “for gamers in households where they might need to share their living room TV or simply want to play PS5 games in another room of the house.” 
The PlayStation Portal will connect remotely to your PS5 over Wi-FI, and can play supported games installed on your console. The device includes a 3.5mm audio jack for wired audio, although the new PlayStation Pulse Elite headset and Pulse Explore earbuds will connect to it wirelessly via new technology the company is calling PlayStation Link. You can read more about these two new audio devices here. 

PSVR2 games, which require the headset, and games streamed through PlayStation Plus Premium’s cloud streaming are not supported, however. 
PlayStation Portal will launch later this year for $199.99. There’s no release date yet for the device, but PlayStation says it will have more details soon on when preorders begin.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tencent are bringing back NovaLogic's venerable tactical FPS series Delta Force. Created by Shenzen-based TiMI Studios, who have now acquired the IP from THQ Nordic, the new Delta Force will be a free-to-play military-realist PvP shooter set on destructible maps featuring driveable vehicles and aircraft, with dynamic weather and a variety of enemy factions and classes. It'll launch in 2024 across PC, consoles and mobile, and will support crossplay.


The original Delta Force launched in 1998, which was a busy year for videogames: it saw the release of Half-Life, Starcraft, Thief: The Dark Project, Baldur's Gate, Fallout 2 and Grim Fandango, together with Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Metal Gear Solid on the console side. I'm not sure Delta Force can hold a candle to any of those, but it had a decent critical reception and attracted enough fans to spawn a fairly staggering number of sequels. It stands apart in my memory mostly for its huge draw distances and its corresponding emphasis on long-distance firefights.

Now, two and a half years following the release of the last mainline entry, fans of the first two critically acclaimed games have something new to be excited for. Bandai Namco has announced that Until Dawn developer Supermassive Games is developing a new entry in the Little Nightmares universe. Not only that, but we got our first look at Little Nightmares III.
Little Nightmares III gives players the story of Low and Alone, two children trapped within The Spiral, which is a cluster of disturbing places, and they need to work together to escape from a threat that is lurking in the shadows.

This summer’s announcement of Mortal Kombat 1 brought with it a new era for the long-running fighting franchise. The latest game from NetherRealm Studios brings the outstanding fighting mechanics the series has been known for since the 2011 reboot, but adds layers of complexity. The most notable addition to the core mechanics in this entry is perhaps the Kameo feature, where you can bring in a secondary character to perform a quick move at a crucial time in a fight. But as I learned during my final time seeing the game before launch, during w…]]></summary>

Given that the first season is uninteresting, I'm not super fussed about that. What does sound good is quality-of-life changes coming alongside the new season. For starters, your inventory will no longer become clogged with six billion gems. Season Of Blood will also let you pick specific Unique and Uber Unique items to farm bosses for, which is most welcome given how vital Uniques can be for builds. Here, watch the trailer.

And thus, a new Snyderverse is born. Not that they showed us said game, mind, or really told us anything about it. It will be set after both Rebel Moon films, though, so you better get watching if you want to know what the hell is going on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Across years of updates and new missions, Payday 2 ultimately escalated to such a ridiculous degree that the gang broke into the White House to stole pre-signed Presidential pardons for themselves. It was good ridiculousness. Now Payday 3 is on its way, and the cooperative heisting looks far more down-to-Earth in a new trailer fresh out of Gamescom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during Gamescom's Opening Night Live, we got a new look at the gameplay and live-action scenes in the upcoming Alan Wake 2. The trailer begins with a slew of live-action footage – including Wake on a talk show.
The footage is then followed by gameplay showing combat with dual protagonists Saga Anderson and, of course, Alan Wake. It's all very spooky.
The footage was brief, but to see it yourself, check out the trailer below:


Alan Wake 2 was originally set to be released on October 17 but was pushed back to October 27. For more info, check out our recent preview.]]></summary>

Not too far away from 2023’s punch-a-thon, though, and to tide us over, publisher Bandai Namco dropped a brand new trailer at Gamescom’s Opening Night Live. Bears, arcades, and lots of kicking down below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you can't wait for Path Of Exile 2, and you've long since lost interest in Diablo 4, then you might want to cast your loot-hungry eyes toward Last Epoch, an upcoming time-travel fantasy ARPG that's been enjoying a successful stint in early access since 2019 and, as tonight's Gamescom Opening Night Live show revealed, is on track for a full release later this year. The Geoffcom mega show also revealed there's a new mage class called the Runemaster heading to the game next month that's capable of casting 40 different spells on a single attack key, but given this is the first time we've written about Last Epoch, I realise that probably won't mean much to a lot of you. So let's back up a bit and introduce Last Epoch properly, because hoo boy, if you love customisable skill trees, this is the ARPG for you, my friend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetherRealm Studios has released a brand new trailer for Mortal Kombat 1, and it’s one of the wildest ones yet. It confirms that both Sindel and General Shao are playable characters, and we get another look at Liu Kang’s chosen champion, Raiden. 
The trailer begins with a cinematic cutscene setting up the ensuing fight as Liu Kang challenges Sindel to a duel by way of Raiden. It doesn’t take long for the trailer to become a gory mess of blood and guts, though, as we see Sindel, General Shao, and Raiden face off in various fights. The trailer also reveals two additional Kameo fighters: Motaro and Shujinko. 
Check out the Rulers of Outworld Mortal Kombat 1 trailer for yourself below: 


"As supreme ruler of Outworld’s army, General Shao has proven loyalty to his realm through countless victories in battle and possesses a gameplay style that dominates opponents with conquering strength and iron will," a press release reads. "Sindel is the empress of Outworld who fights to protect her family and empire with the ability to vanquish enemies with her mystifying hair, piercing scream, and power of levitation." 
Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on September 19. 

For more about the game, check out this trailer that confirms Reptile, Ashrah, and Havik are on the roster and then watch this Keepers of Time trailer. After that, watch this trailer all about Rain and Smoke and then check out Game Informer’s hands-on Mortal Kombat 1 gameplay after that.

Announced at tonight's Gamescom Opening Night Live show, Frontier Developments also showed off the game's new single-player Conquest mode, a procedurally generated series of challenges that will pit players against increasingly unpredictable combat scenarios, as well as its third playable faction: the wraith-like Nighthaunt. They'll be going up against the Stormcast Eternals alongside the Orruk Kruleboyz in the game's campaign, and I got to see them in action ahead of tonight's showcase. And I can confirm: they're a nasty bunch of spectral rags, this lot, especially when they pile on in large numbers.

It's the chintzy big swing fantasy (okay, Victoriana urban fantasy but it still counts) coming from Aaryn Flynn-founded studio Inflexion Games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Snap took fans of both the popular comics and movies company and collectible card games by storm last year thanks to its bite-sized, exciting gameplay and compelling collection and leveling-up mechanics. Both the mobile and Early Access PC versions have received various updates that include a Conquest series mode, friend PvP, and a ton of new cards and variants, but the PC version has remained in Steam Early Access until now.
However, during today's Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase, developer Second Dinner Studios' Ben Brode announced that Marvel Snap has exited Steam Early Access and is officially out now on PC. To celebrate, players who log into the PC version of Marvel Snap will receive a Devil Dinosaur Mech Variant. Additionally, players who watch the Marvel Snap category on Twitch will be eligible for drops starting today and running until August 29. 
"Launching the game on PC has been a dream of ours for years now, and we've worked really hard to ensure it's an experience that players new and old are going to absolutely love," Brode said in a press release. "This is especially an exciting time for the streaming community, who have welcomed Marvel Snap with open arms. The game looks absolutely beautiful on PC and we can't wait to see the epic streams on Twitch now that we're live."
The PC version includes a native widescreen format. You can see the animated reveal trailer debuted during today's livestream below.


Marvel Snap was so well-received in 2022 that it was a rare free-to-play mobile title to land on Game Informer's Top 10 Games of the Year list.

But during tonight's Gamescom Opening Night Live show, we got our first proper look at this demonic alien faction, as well as three of the units that will be at our disposal on release. And sure, the worker Imp and its long ears will no doubt appease the Grogu fans out there, but my personal highlight is the creepy flesh monster, the Brute. It looks rightly horrific, with its pair of grinning maws and glistening, pale skin, but at the tap of a key, it will rip itself down the middle in a mess of blood and gore so that two Fiends can burst forth Alien-style to continue the assault. It's kinda gross, but also weirdly rad? In any case, I'm into it.

Now, the studio has formally unveiled The Final Shape, the expansion concluding this decade-long story arc, and it launches on February 27, 2024. 
Bungie says in The Final Shape, Guardians will confront their ultimate adversary, The Witness, alongside companions from their years of adventures in Destiny 2, like Ikora Rey, Commander Zavala, and Cayde-6, who has somehow returned after dying in the game’s Forsaken expansion. The Final Shape will take players right into the heart of the Traveler to end the War of Light and Darkness with the Vanguard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Sonic Frontiers was released late last year, it was generally regarded as good but "rough around the edges." Because of that, it's been great to see Sega move to support the game further post-launch with a series of updates with free content. Teased today at Gamescom, the next pack of content, known as "The Final Horizon" update, is the most exciting yet, promising new story, new challenges, and even new playable characters.


The teaser itself doesn't give us much to go on. Sonic and friends stand on the edge of a cliff, ready to face a massive Titan. Knuckles, Amy, and Tails are all candidates to be playable characters in the future, but there's no indication of that here – Sonic summons the Chaos Emeralds to become Super Sonic, ready to face off against this mysterious threat, then powers up yet again as he races toward the Titan.
For any more details, we'll have to wait until the full update drops on September 28, just over a month from now.

In a month that already features the likes of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Alan Wake 2, Assassin's Creed Mirage, Forza Motorsport, and Cities: Skylines II, we have another high-profile game that will contend with our precious free time. Sonic Superstars joins the mix with a release date of October 17.
Sonic Superstars brings the Classic Sonic action into a more modernized setting with 3D visuals and myriad new powers. It's also the first Sonic game to feature true cooperative play. As our most recent cover story, we've played and talked a lot about Sonic Superstars, including an exclusive look at every Emerald Power in the game, plus a first look at several never-before-seen zones.
This announcement also brought us a look at other multiplayer modes, which you can see in the trailer below.


Sonic Superstars arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 17. That date puts it the same week as another highly anticipated 2D game from one of gaming's most fabled and beloved franchises, as Super Mario Bros. Wonder arrives on October 20. We already knew this fall and holiday season would be fantastic for gamers, but it looks to be particularly awesome for fans of 2D platforming. For more on Sonic Superstars, be sure to hit the banner below for exclusive details surrounding the highly anticipated 2D adventure.]]></summary>

This combination proved popular, and today there's a deal on the modern successor to the 27GL850 - the 27GP850. 
The 27GP850 is down to $299.99 at Amazon, versus an original price of $429.99. We saw a lot of sales on the 1440p 144Hz 27GL850 when it reached this price, so seeing an even better 1440p 180Hz model at the same point could result in quite a popular pickup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gamescom Opening Night Live provided a platform for a new gameplay walkthrough of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. The video focuses on a new wrinkle called Open Combat Missions. These are player-directed missions, letting players engage how they want.
You can play stealthy with appropriate gear, go loud, use vehicles, tacticals, and even use killstreaks in campaigns. They work seamlessly with cinematic moments, with the idea being that players have increased agency and flexibility in how they choose to tackle story missions. 
Similar to last year’s Modern Warfare 2 gameplay reveal, we see a squad infiltrate a deep-sea vessel during a violent storm. After making their way into a base situated within an old fort, they proceed underground into a facility, blasting foes along the way. Though it's hard to get a sense of the Open Combat Missions in this demo, the video provides a nice look at MWIII's impressive visuals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightingale, the highly anticipated debut game from Inflexion Games, received a new Early Access release date during today's Gamescom Opening Night Live stream. We now know that the shared-world survival game will hit Steam and Epic Games Store in an Early Access state on February 22, 2024. 
In Nightingale, you control a Realmwalker as you venture through arcane portals in a procedurally generated Victorian gaslamp fantasy universe. Though survival crafting serves as the core gameplay loop, the studio touts its world-building and excellent visuals. The studio also pushes forward its ever-evolving narrative, which emphasizes play autonomy.

"[The Early Access date] is a few months later than previously announced," Inflexion Games CEO Aaryn Flynn said in a press release. "But as a studio, we're committed to quality and take player satisfaction very seriously. We want to ensure that the game delivers on the expectations of our community, who have played a vital role in the development to date. We strive to ensure that Nightingale not only fulfils our vision but also becomes a cherished place for our players to explore and discover with their friends for many years to come."
You can watch the Nightingale Early Access release date trailer below:


Nightingale arrives in Early Access via Steam and Epic Games Store on February 22, 2024, for $30. According to Inflexion Games, this launch will mark the beginning of the road to a 1.0 launch, with a high level of collaboration with the community. Inflexion hopes to continue iterating, improving, and adding to the game as the Early Access period continues.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco brought some news to this year's Gamescom 2023 Geoff Fest show that was very exciting for me, personally. Though it was but a short teaser trailer, we now know that Little Nightmares 3 is coming next year - and it's a co-op game that you can play with your pals. Good for moral support with a creepy horror game, although it's online co-op, so don't expect anyone to literally hold your hand. Also, and this is kind of unexpected, but there's a podcast tie-in.

It's one of those live-action affairs with CG up the wazoo, complete with an 'epic' cover of Elton John's Rocket Man that would bring a tear to the eye of Zack Snyder*, and only Zack Snyder. It does not show the game at all, nor does it capture the thrill of escaping our Earthly bonds to find a load of grey rocks just like we have at home. But you can watch the trailer below.

        <updated>2023-08-22T18:31:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pearly Abyss, the studio behind Black Desert Online, has released a new trailer for its upcoming single-player open-world RPG, Crimson Desert, and it features our first look at new gameplay since 2020. 
The studio released this trailer as part of Geoff Keighley’s Opening Night Live presentation for Gamescom, and it features new 4K footage of protagonist Kliff investigating the region of Hernand. It also highlights various other areas in this sprawling open world, NPCs, and more. And, of course, it features a healthy dose of the game’s hand-to-hand combat and wrestling-inspired moves. 
Check out the Crimson Desert gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, we also see some of the game's traversal, including skydiving, Kliff climbing up buildings and trees, and more. We also see some minigames featured in Crimson Desert, like fishing, arm-wrestling, and the one that occurs when trying to tame wild horses. 
“Developed on Pearl Abyss’ proprietary next-generation ‘BlackSpace Engine,’ Crimson Desert is an open world action-adventure game,” a press release reads. “With an engaging setting and realistic characters, Crimson Desert depicts the story of mercenaries fighting for survival on the expansive continent of Pywel.” 

Pearl Abyss says it aims for a simultaneous global release of Crimson Desert on PC and console. While the studio’s CEO, Jin-Young Heo, stated earlier this year the game was targeting a fall 2023 release window, there’s still no word on when to expect it to launch. 
For more about the game, check out the Crimson Desert gameplay debut trailer and then find out why it’s on our list of the top 10 upcoming action games.

        <updated>2023-08-22T18:05:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Game Science has released a new trailer for Black Myth: Wukong. Revealed during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony today, Black Myth: Wukong continues to look great.
Today’s trailer showcases more of the game’s action RPG combat alongside its dive into Chinese mythology. The combat looks reminiscent of From Software’s Sekiro and this year’s Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty from Team Ninja, but it’s clear it’s aiming for its own take on the fast-paced action combat. 
You can check out the Black Myth: Wukong trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Black Myth: Wukong pits the player’s monkey warrior character – the Destined One – against various legends, foes, and creatures from throughout Chinese mythology, and it looks fun (and difficult). Game Science says Black Myth: Wukong’s story is based on Journey to the West, one of the four great classical novels of Chinese literature. “You shall set out as the Destined One to venture into the challenges and marvels ahead, to uncover the obscured truth beneath the veil of a glorious legend from the past.” 
Today’s trailer did not reveal anything by way of a release date for the game, but it’s due out sometime in the summer of next year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

The correct bundle of analogies is actually "Tacoma if it was made by Supermassive Games or Quantic Dream - and also, if it were set in a moodier corner of Ridley Scott flick The Martian". If you're unfamiliar with all of those things, here's the translation: this is a creepy but seldom scary mystery-horror game about a couple of engineers exploring an abandoned spacebase full of quick-time events (aka, "push the button before the prompt vanishes") and audio/video diaries from the Project X Proceeds Apace School of Ominous Backstory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During Gamescom's Opening Night Live event, CD Projekt Red shared a new trailer and took to the stage to share what is coming to Cyberpunk 2077 with its 2.0 update and Phantom Liberty expansion. Phantom Liberty is a paid expansion that will include all kinds of new story content and Idris Elba, but even if you don't buy into the expansion, the game will receive all kinds of improvements.


The footage from the game showed protagonist V launching herself from a motorcycle to slam into a group of enemies. New weapons, like guns and blades will be added and perks have been redesigned. There are also all kinds of new animations in the combat. We also saw V throwing an enemy at another in combat and dashing in mid-dair. The police have also been revamped and will call in MaxTac to fight you, you can hack while driving, and new vehicles will have built in guns for expanded car combat.
The 2.0 update releases September 26 and the paid Phantom Liberty expansion will also be available that day. You can find Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review by following the link.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hyper Light Breaker, the upcoming action title by Solar Ash and Hyper Light Drifter developer Heart Machine, has been delayed. It was set to launch in Steam Early Access later this year, but the team needs more time to bring it together.
As such, the game will now launch early next year. A developer video simply informs fans of the team’s desire to spend more time with Hyper Light Breaker, with creative director Alx Preston stating in a press release, 
“We've made remarkable progress and the game has come a long way since we started development. Taking this additional time to focus on Hyper Light Breaker’s development will allow us to bring the game to its full potential and we are incredibly grateful for the support from our community that’s been with us every step of the way. We thank you for your patience and understanding as we work to deliver a new adventure that lives up to what fans expect from a Heart Machine title.”


Hyper Light Breaker is a spiritual follow-up to Hyper Light Drifter, set within the same universe but imagined in 3D graphics. The third-person action game can be played alone or with friends in 3-player online co-op. Players roam the large, colorful world discovering new areas, battling monsters in flashy combat, and obtaining powerful gear in a quest to overthrow a powerful king.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out of all of Supergiant’s games, I feel like Pyre is the odd duck out. Bastion, Transistor, and Hades - all fit nicely into the action-RPG genre (as well as all being absolute bangers) but Pyre is something else entirely. Sure it also has action-RPG elements, but also is a story-rich visual novel and sports game? And they not only work together but also compliment each other?? It’s a magical wizardry mix of genres that still feels fresh today, even though it’s been five years since it released. It’s story following a group of ethereal exiles playing fantasy sports ball in mystical purgatory isn’t half bad too (by which I mean it’s amazing).
The rules of the sport are simple - two teams are placed at opposite ends of a pitch each with a flame  (the titular pyre) they must protect. An energy ball appears on the map and the two teams must grab the ball and dunk it into the opponent’s flame until that flame has been snuffed out. Each character has a special ability, movement feels good, and when you pull off a combo you feel fantastic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Sad Cat Studios have delayed their debut cyberpunk platformer Replaced into 2024, because they “can’t afford to release a sub-par game.” The Belarusian-based studio previously pushed the game from 2022 into 2023 due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, but based on its moody retrofuturist trailers I’m happy to wait until every pixel is perfectly positioned, as long as the teams are staying safe.


“After Replaced's initial announcement in 2021 and its follow-up trailer in 2022 we had this incredibly high bar of community's expectations,” the studio wrote in a recent Steam blog. “And at this point, we knew that we can't afford to release a sub-par game. We truly want Replaced to be something special and memorable for everybody. This is our first game, and we want to make every aspect of it the best it can be.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before the 1983 video game crash and Nintendo’s subsequent takeover of the industry with the NES, the Atari 2600 reigned supreme. The popular console was pretty much the poster child for ‘late 70s/early ‘80s gaming, boasting a vast library of titles that have since inspired a multitude of games for decades to come. Over 30 years after the 2600 was discontinued, it’s making a contemporary comeback. 
Atari and Plaion have announced the 2600+, a modernized recreation of the four-switch model introduced in 1980. In addition to sharing the same woodgrain aesthetics and metal switches, it also includes modern features such as HDMI output, USB port, and support for multiple screen resolutions. The console comes with a new CX40+ joystick faithful to the original and supports two players. 


The 2600+ includes the single cartridge slot and can play original 2600 and 7800 cartridges (including physical versions of newly released titles, such as Mr. Run and Jump and Bezerker Enhanced Edition). Additionally, the console comes bundled with a 10-in-1 cartridge with the following games:
Adventure
Combat
Dodge ‘Em
Haunted House
Maze Craze
Missle Command
Realsports Volleyball
Surround
Video Pinball
Yar’s Revenge
“We’re excited to be working with Atari to bring back the Atari 2600 and help meet the growing consumer demand for retro hardware,” said commercial director of retro at Plaion, Ben Jones in a press release. “For gamers who remember the thrill of playing arcade games at home for the very first time, the Atari 2600+ will bring you right back. For everyone else, the offer is one of timeless fun and the chance to experience a golden age of video games in a way that could only come from Atari.”
The Atari 2600+ launches on November 17 for $129.99. You can pre-order it now on Atari’s website. CX40 joysticks will also be sold separately for $24.99. Atari and Plaion also plan to launch the CX-30 Paddle Controller bundle that includes the paddle and a 4-in-1 game cartridge for $39.99.]]></summary>

Chief among these is an upcoming new version, DLSS 3.5, which will add to DLSS 3’s existing toolkit of upscaling and AI frame generation with a new trick named Ray Reconstruction. And it sounds pretty clever, if currently limited in application.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia are making an early start on their Gamescom announcements, which include the reveal of Half-Life 2 RTX. This incoming mod for the seminal 2004 FPS will, in the style of Portal with RTX, rejig the original game with modern technical goodies like ray tracing, updated environmental details, and Nvidia Reflex support. DLSS will also be on hand to absorb the inevitably mahoosive performance hit from bouncing all those rays around, and that includes DLSS 3, provided you have a compatible graphics card.
It’s being developed by a collective of experienced HL2 modders, Orbifold Studios, without direct input from Valve. No release date yet, as Half-Life 2 RTX – or to use its full name, Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project – is still in the early stages. There is a teaser trailer, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has submitted a new deal to the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority regulatory agency that proposes Ubisoft get the rights to Activision Blizzard game streaming for 15 years. 
After the CMA blocked Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion back in April over cloud gaming concerns, Microsoft set its sights on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for approval. In July, a California judge denied the FTC’s request for a preliminary injunction in its case to block Microsoft’s proposed acquisition. Shortly after that decision, Microsoft announced it was pausing its appeal efforts in the U.K. to negotiate with the CMA, and the CMA extended the company’s deadline to do so to August 29, 2023. 


Today, the CMA confirmed it is blocking Microsoft’s…]]></summary>

Games about cults and starving stick together, you know, so both games are celebrating each other’s birthdays with free updates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone whose auto-battler experience has, up until now, only been limited to minor forays into the excellent Alice0-recommended Super Auto Pets, sitting down to play a run of Tales & Tactics was somewhat overwhelming. Recently launched into early access and made by the same team behind Slay The Spire's popular Downfall mod, this is a fantasy autobattler cloaked in the skin of a roguelike. That means that in addition to creating an army of tabletop-esque miniatures to do your automatic bidding on a grid-based board, you'll also be picking from randomly generated opponents on a lightly branching story map as you sword chop your way to your ultimate goal: The Grand Tournament. 
It's an intriguing combo, but as a relative newcomer to the auto-battling genre, there's maybe a bit too much going on here for its own good. That's not to say I haven't had a good time with it so far, but there are so many things to juggle in my brain that I feel like I'm fumbling my way through it by chance rather than making confident and informed tactical choices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immortals of Aveum is making me wonder whether there’s some kind of gigantic hidden market for floaty magic shooters with overcooked YA dialogue and exceedingly high PC hardware demands. After this and Forspoken releasing within a few months of each other, I’m half expecting Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 to open with Captain Price shooting GPU-smelting laser beams out of his 'tache.
Indeed, this first person sorcery adventure will be hell on your hardware, even if you’ve tooled up with a high-grade graphics card and CPU. This is somewhat more understandable than with the other low-performing PC games we’ve seen this year, as Immortals of Aveum is one of the first Unreal Engine 5.1 games, and makes extensive use of its sparkly new lighting and VFX tech. Sadly, it also aims so high that the only way to get playable performance on lower-end and older mid-range kit it to gut the quality settings.

Plenty of great first-person shooters take players on globe-trotting adventures using modern military technology, to World Wars, and sometimes the moon or even hell. Immortals of Aveum carves out its own place in the broad genre of shooters by setting its first-person action in the fantasy realm of Aveum, and it’s refreshing to shoot at ax-wielding knights, magic sorcerers, dragons, and more. 
It helps that Immortals of Aveum mixes up its competent shooting with unique, puzzle-like twists to keep most encounters fresh and ex…]]></summary>

Keep it there for as long as you can. Hurts after a while, huh? This is the default position for Jak, awesome FPS wizard with a magic gun arm, and possessor of a personality so inoffensive that when I am not playing the game I struggle to remember he exists. I noticed how hard it is to hold your arm in wizard mode when I was about 10 hours into the 20-or-so span of Immortals Of Aveum, and half way through is too early for a game to make me go all Cinema Sins out of boredom.
Despite this, I very much appreciate Immortals Of Aveum taking a crack at a good old-fashioned mid-length action adventure. There are shining moments where it's great fun (though sometimes by accident; I have never, in my life, laughed so hard at some tiny wee orphans being exploded in front of me), but it's let down by its FPS combat becoming too repetitive too early, which is the kiss of death for a game built around shooting stuff. It also commits the terrible crime of taking itself too seriously, but then I level that charge at most fantasy I encounter.

That's a winning combination for models backed by positive critical reviews, and today we spotted a deal on perhaps their best monitor yet - the Innocn 27M2V, a 27-inch 4K 160Hz monitor with a Mini LED backlight and HDMI 2.1 ports, providing an extremely good HDR experience and full compatibility with PS5, Xbox Series X and PC.

These wraps work similarly to Sony’s PlayStation 5 console covers, allowing players to change the console’s cosmetic look without buying an entirely new one. Instead of sliding covers off like with the PS5, Xbox’s solution is to wrap the cosmetic change around the console, hence the name. The company has revealed three wraps to kick off the product, including a special edition Starfield wrap. 
“The Starfield-inspired console wrap reimagines your console as an on-board avionics module, powering you through your adventures,” an Xbox blog post reads. “Key internal console components are highlighted through outlined access panel and game-inspired graphics.

Madden NFL 24 from EA Tiburon expands on the rebuilt fundamentals from last year, creating a football simulation that takes a solid next step toward authenticity. However, new poorly implemented features and an interface showing its age are enough of a drag to make this latest iteration feel like a step back for a series badly in need of forward progress.
The on-the-field gameplay is more realistic than ever. The physics-based player interactions are noticeably improved, with ball carriers pushing against piles…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When listing off my favourite games, I'm shamefully likely to neglect to mention Firewatch. This is probably because Firewatch isn't a game that had some huge formative impact on me, or reframed my entire relationship with gaming, or became an enduring obsession of my hyperfixation-prone brain. Firewatch is, quite simply, a very lovely game, and one that I happily revisit on a fairly regular basis.
I think the main draw of Firewatch, for me, is the forest. I am one of those people who's often happiest on a day-long hike into the middle of nowhere; and when life doesn't provide me with the opportunity to do something as often as I'd like, I'll turn to thematically appropriate video games to tide me over.
Don't get me wrong: Firewatch's central story of Henry and Delilah is a good one, and the marvellous Cissy Jones deservedly picked up a BAFTA for her performance as the latter. But the free-roam mode is, to my mind, just as important for ensuring Firewatch's enduring appeal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Invincible will be released this November. 
More specifically, publisher 11 bit studios and developer Starward Industries have revealed that its upcoming sci-fi mystery game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on November 6. Starward Industries has released a new trailer highlighting this release date as well as new footage of the game, and you can watch it below: 


In The Invincible, players control Yasna, an astrobiologist in search of her lost crew that she must bring back dead or alive. They’re lost somewhere on the Mars-like planet of Regis III.
“On the surface, it may seem that Regis III is uninhabited but that doesn’t mean the people who visit here can feel like unopposed rulers,” a press release reads.
Starward Industries says the philosophical nature of what happens to Yasna on Regis III will have her forever questioning “the scale of humankind’s ambitions.” 

The Invincible is based on Stanislaw Lem’s novel of the same name, which mixes “retro-futuristic and atompunk design and aesthetics” to create a poppy art style. We’ve experienced a decent chunk of the game already, and you can read our preview thoughts of The Invincible right here.

Initially set to release sometime this year, the team recently announced that it is delaying the game to early 2024, as reported by Eurogamer. As for why, Ironwood Studios says it needs more room to make Pacific Drive the best it can be while also prioritizing the health of everyone on the team. 
As summer comes to a close, we’d like to share that Pacific Drive is moving its release to early 2024.

“As many know, we’ve been hard at work bringing this idea to life for quite some time, and every day adds even more to a game we’re all proud of,” the studio writes on Twitter. “In this final stretch, however, it’s important to us that we stay true to ourselves, and not compromise on the team’s well-being. 
“As our community grows, the support and excitement everyone has shown has been incredible and we can’t wait for everyone to take their own set of wheels out into the Zone. Everyone here at Ironwood truly appreciates your patience and understanding.”
Ironwood Studios says it has a surprise to share this week, as it will be a part of the Future Games Show with a new trailer. 
The team revealed Pacific Drive in 2022, and after checking out a hands-off preview of the survival game last year, we came away excited about its potential. It mixes elements of racing with the survival genre alongside a spooky Pacific Northwest setting that we can’t wait to see more of. You can read our Pacific Drive preview thoughts here.

It was a teasing release schedule that only aided the game’s surreal mystery, so it’s no surprise that the studio have dropped the game’s first major update three years after the fifth and final chapter wrapped things up. The aptly named Postmodern Update overhauls the game’s user interface with a new Modern mode, alongside a host of bug fixes and more language options. 


“The new ‘Modern’ interface is designed to be more flexible and readable on a wider variety of devices, including tablets and the Steam Deck,” the studio wrote in a recent Steam blog. Kentucky Route Zero’s smaller acts and text-based nature make it almost perfect for on-the-go devices, although I’m more interested in using the game as bedtime reading instead, as someone who regrettably bounced off of it in the early acts. “We've also overhauled and improved the ‘Classic’ interface from the original release, and its lo-fi companion, ‘Retro,’” the studio also wrote.


The update also lets you “zoom in on details in the scene,” which sounds handy for smaller screens. New translations now support Arabic, Chinese, Polish, Thai, Swedish, Turkish, and Brazilian Portuguese, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's hard to know where to start with Six Ages 2 Colon Lights Going Out. The initial uncertainty and esoteric nature of its world has always been the series' biggest problem, as it appears to demand a lot of foreknowledge to play. But rather than memorising facts and (ugh) "lore", it's a series that encourages a different mindset to pretty much any other game. These games are about culture and myth, and how both interact and change over time.
It's harder, though, to write about this entry without just repeating myself. It is a Part Two of a planned three, thus much the same as before, yet different in some interesting, but esoteric ways. Do I try to convince the unfamiliar, detail those differences for fans, or try to cover both and succeed in neither?

The kaiju crustaceans left such a good impression that developer Calappa Games went fishing for more maybe-not-voluntary battlers and announced a follow-up: Fight Crab 2. Just in case you’re uncomfortable with imposing a combat sport on sea creatures, the sequel adds humans to the mix, so you can enjoy the zany announcement trailer with a clear conscience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If someone were to write the history of internet video, I think they'd need to mention Killer Bean. Released in 1996, just a year after Toy Story, it was a two-minute, 3D animated short about gun-toting beans, and almost entirely the work of one person. A slightly longer and much improved sequel, Killer Bean 2: The Party, was released in 2000.

Now it's getting a video game from original creator Jeff Lew, and it's an open world, first- and third-person roguelike shooter with the same acrobatic, John Woo-inspired combat as the nearly thirty-year-old animations. There's a first trailer below.

First up, we talk with Katie Chrzanowski, who you may know as the social media manager for the Sonic the Hedgehog brand. However, she's also the producer of the Sonic Symphony, which was livestreamed in 2021 and is heading up the world tour happening this fall. Then, Brian is joined by Tee Lopes, composer of Sonic Mania and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge. He also happens to be the composer for the upcoming Sonic Superstars.

Expectedly, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III's campaign picks up where Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II left off. Modern Warfare III will also include what Activision is calling an, "open world Zombies set on the largest Call of Duty Zombies map ever." It is also promising a big collection of fan favorite and brand new multiplayer maps. You can check out screens from the campaign in the gallery below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little while has passed since the release of 2.7.0, and we are now excited to present you with the bugfix release 2.7.1.
We have included a significant amount of fixes and small improvements, in particular:
Added ScummVM Log file viewer, so you can easily report the problems on platforms with limited file access, e.g. Android, iOS or even modern Windows.
Fixed the shader-based scaler loading on some platforms.
Added multiple improvements to AGI, AGS, Cryomni3D and 12 more engines.
We also improved the detection of Broken Sword 1 & Broken Sword 2, so more original versions get properly detected. Thank you to those who submitted bug reports about this, and if you still locate a version that is not recognised, please report it to us (beware that the frankenstein versions that are floating around the internet will not be accepted, only those copied from the original media).
For the full and comprehensive list of notable changes, please refer to the Release Notes.
If you are as excited about the release as we are, you can share our joy by downloading it from our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, or either of the Ubuntu Snap or Flatpack packages, the autoupdater will pick up the ScummVM 2.7.1 release automatically. For our Android app users, the update will be available on the Play Store.
Thank you very much for your continued support. Enjoy!
