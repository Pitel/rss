Quick-time events are a staple of Supermassive Games' cinematic horror adventures, but are the QTEs too easy in The Quarry? It's a more mainstream game, for sure. And while it can be annoying to botch a micro-event and have that snowball into sweeping story changes, the threat of failure ratchets up the stakes. With a new update today, Supermassive will let The Quarry players increase the speed of QTEs to raise the tension.
The setting in question, Min Timer, is under QTE Speed, which is located in the Accessibility settings from The Quarry's main menu. It's only usable in single-player.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two Point Campus opened its door today, and we think it’s pretty darn good. But what does a real college professor think? Sega answers this burning question by releasing a video of a qualified educator putting the simulator through its paces. 
Sega enlisted Tracy Fullerton, professor, and director of the game innovation lab at the Univerity of Southern California Games, to enroll in Two Point Campus and react to its zany brand of higher education. Besides providing a nice look at the moment-to-moment gameplay for those curious about the title, it's fun to listen to Fullerton's takes as both a game maker and a college professor. Check it out below.

Embark Studios recently confirmed it was pushing back one of its titles, ARC Raiders. Alongside the reasoning it gave, the company also shed some light on its future production plans, including a game that it plans to have out ahead of ARC Raiders.
In a blog post, Embark CEO and founder Patrick Söderlund discussed the ARC Raiders delay. As the studio confirmed, the co-op shooter won't be launching until next year.
For transparency, Söderlund confirms Embark has several projects in development. Alongside ARC Raiders, the studio is working on a team-based first-person shooter codenamed Project Discovery. It was teased in a tweet, in November of last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry, loot box fans
Overwatch's third Anniversary Remix event is finally here, and it will be the last that we know of — unless it rolls over into the sequel. The seasonal event has been a fan favorite, not just because you can get some cool limited-time skins, emotes, and voice lines in Overwatch loot boxes, but also because you can replay other limited-time game modes from the other seasonal events.
While it's exciting that the Anniversary Remix is back yet again, Blizzard announced some not-as-exciting news along with it: players will no longer be able to buy loot boxes after the end of the event. To be clear, you'll be able to purchase loot boxes up from now until August 30 as part of the Anniversary. However, this just applies to the purchase of loot boxes — you can still earn standard loot boxes in gameplay after the event is over.
[caption id="attachment_338843" align="alignnone" width="1920"] Genjiman Genji in Anniversary Remix Vol. 3.
[/caption]
As would be expected, more changes are coming after Overwatch 2 launches, namely that loot boxes will be done with altogether because the game will be replacing its predecessor.
Because Overwatch 2 will be free-to-play, it will be adopting the seasonal model, which will include both free and paid battle passes. In addition, players will be able to purchase individual cosmetic items as well, in case there's just that one skin you can't live without. It took me a few years to get the Witch Mercy skin back in the day, so I wish this had been an option a few years ago, to be honest.
While this feels like the end of an era, it's probably for the best. Loot boxes can be pretty exploitative, especially for games with younger player bases like Overwatch.
Some countries are banning the practice entirely, so it was only a matter of time before we see the randomized loot box model phased out of games entirely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get your very own Skyrim foe
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim can be modded to the moon and back with new magic, models, and systems. But a new Skyrim mod adds the Nemesis system, for a little extra Shadow of Mordor in your Elder Scrolls.
Created by modder Syclonix, the "Shadow of Skyrim" mod adds a new Nemesis-style system to Skyrim. It essentially adds a new player death mechanic, making it so dying in Skyrim adds a bit more narrative flavor and mechanics.
When an enemy takes the player down, they gain a unique name, stats, and more. For example, they might become a shield-breaking vampire. Toggles can allow the enemy to also loot your stuff and use it against you, donning armor the player had been wearing.
Not only does this give you a new objective and quest, but it can turn into a boon, too. The player might gain a certain debuff upon dying, but be able to remove that and replace it with a new buff in its place once besting their rival.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-_56Ouy8II
Rivals of Skyrim
While the mod takes inspiration from the Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War games, the modder emphasizes that it's not drawing on specific Mordor gameplay ideas. The concept might have arisen from having a named Nemesis, but its systems are notably different.
And while the important distinctions are one thing, I also like the twists Syclonix puts on this rival system. The flavor text is fun, and I like the idea of gaining rewards and having to recover your armor, almost in a Tarkov-style manner. It's also designed to work with a number of other The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim mods. For full compatibility info, you'll need to check out the mod page.
You can find the Shadow of Skyrim mod for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim on NexusMods here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now get to Slashin'
Input lag — even in 2022, it continues to be a frustrating thorn in the sides of online fighting game players. And, ironically, while the ninth generation of gaming is well underway, it appears that Sony's shiny new PlayStation 5 platform tends to exacerbate the issue, rather than repair it.
Case in point: Arc System Works' Guilty Gear Strive, which currently suffers from an estimated 4.5 frames of input lag on PS5 when compared to its sibling PS4, which only suffers from around 2.5 frames. Input lag is an inevitability in almost all fighting games, but the lower a developer can get the fateful number, the better it is for all players.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GYL5FVpjG4
To that end, ArcSys has released Version 1.21 on both PlayStation and PC platforms, bringing with it a few small bug fixes, optimized controls for the Figure Mode and much requested improvements to the server connection time on startup. Specifically for PS5, however, the input includes reoptimized input lag. This should bring the PS5 edition more in line with its PS4 and PC brethren, although ArcSys is tight-lipped on exactly how much faster your chosen fighter will respond to your instructions.
Courtesy of Kimagre Gaming, here are some post-patch results for all platforms.
https://twitter.com/kimagreGaming/status/1556955540001267712?s=20&t=jIt6z9pG9PRXOEUaWIyCYQ
Guilty Gear Strive is preparing to launch its second season, bringing with it new characters, new stages, a new competitive season, and further updates. The wonderful Bridget is already available today, with more content coming to the title over the coming year. Guilty Gear Strive has already smashed the one million sales mark, and hopefully, this popularity will continue across the remainder of 2022 and into 2023.

We don't have answers for you, but we do have Frogun, a charmingly goofy action-platformer game that combines elements of pretty much every action-platformer between 1985 and 2005.

        <updated>2022-08-09T18:34:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embark Studios, a young team of former DICE employees led by ex-EA head Patrick Söderlund, has delayed its upcoming shooter, Arc Raiders. The title was initially slated to arrive this year but will now launch in 2023. 
The reason is that the team has decided to pivot and focus on launching another team-based shooter codenamed Project Discovery. A blog post written by Söderlund explains that Embark has several projects in development and that Discovery progressed so quickly that it seemingly caught up to Arc Raiders, presenting the team with the possibility of shipping two games within the same timeframe. However, doing would've been more than the small team can handle. 
“For a young, relatively small studio like ours, releasing two games in short succession would have strained our teams and resources, many of which are shared between the two projects.” Söderlund explains. 
“As such, we decided to let Project Discovery be our studio’s first game to market, pushing Arc Raiders to a 2023 release. It’s a decision that will also allow us to expand and refine the Arc Raiders experience.”
Outside of being a team-based first-person shooter, little is known about Project Discovery. The concept art posted above hints that it's set in the current day or perhaps the near future. Söderlund promises to reveal more details “very soon.” 
Arc Raiders made its debut during the 2021 Game Awards and will be a free-to-play cooperative shooter where players work together to battle mechanical creatures from space. It will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

Nintendo has been loving the last-minute announcements and specific game Directs lately, so it's not a huge surprise to see that they warned us of a Splatoon 3 Direct just two days before it was due to happen on Wednesday, the 10th of August. Even with only two days to go, Nintendo of Europe managed to mess up, and almost accidentally revealed the Direct a day earlier than planned.
The squid-filled shooter is scheduled to launch on September 9th, exactly a month from today... and maybe Nintendo forgot that the game was due on the 9th (of September), but the Direct was due on the 10th (of August).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back to the links?
Clap Hanz, the indie outfit behind the beloved Everybody's Golf franchise, has registered two new golf-related trademarks, suggesting that the Yokohama-based studio might be preparing to return to the green in the near future.
As spotted by ResetEra users, (and later reported by VGC), the trademarks Easy Come, Easy Golf and いつでもGOLF, (which roughly translates to "Golf Anytime"), were registered together, which suggests that they are localized names for the exact same project. Whether this represents an all-new golfing franchise or is merely a rebranding for the previously released Apple Arcade game Clap Hanz Golf is unknown.
Everybody's Golf launched on PlayStation in 1997 to immediate success, presenting quality golf gameplay with accessible controls, tight mechanics, and a generally cheerful and charming comedic aesthetic. This original release would be followed by over 10 sequels and spin-offs on various PlayStation and mobile platforms. The last iteration launched on PSVR in 2019. Given the closure of PlayStation Studios — as well as an overall disinterest in supporting third-party projects — the chance of the series returning anytime soon is incredibly unlikely.
The franchise is definitely missed by its dedicated playerbase. Given golf's intricate technicalities, titles such as the Clap Hanz series — as well as franchises such as Mario Golf and Golf Story — are often very successful, stripping back the simulation efforts and replacing them with colorful and charismatic visuals. Hopefully, Clap Hanz will reveal its plans for the new trademarks very soon.

A monster hunter's work is never over, it seems. Capcom showed off a few of the monsters arriving in this week's free Title Update 1 for Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, and they're some nasty ones.
The free title update arrives on August 10 for Nintendo Switch and PC, bringing more giant monsters into the fold. From massive wings and whip-like tails to an apparent smoldering magma beast, they all look terrifying in this new trailer.

Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are on their way, presumably adding another hundred-or-so critters to our 'Dex, and we can't lie — some of them are already winding their way into our hearts. There's Fidough, the purebread dog that everyone loves, Smoliv and Lechonk, the little guys with meme names, and Pawmi, Gen IX's Pikachu stand-in, not to mention the cute starters of Quaxly, Sprigatito, and Fuecoco.
But, ahead of Scarlet and Violet tearing up our list of favourite Pokémon, we thought we might take the time to decide who holds the top spot in our hearts — and what that says about us as people, players, and trainers. Join in with us in the comments!

A new string of Super Punch-Out cheat code combinations is now lurking about, thanks to community member Unlisted Cheats (who uncovers old school cheats mostly for the NES, Game Boy, and SNES systems).
The first code allows players to access a level select, likely serving as a debug feature. The next code is even more fascinating, as it lets a second player take control of a CPU opponent, to create a "versus" like system. These codes in tandem must have been really useful in testing balance changes. I'm definitely going to be playing as Narcis Prince immediately. You can find out how to use them below.
Amazingly, these codes do work in the Switch Online version of the game, so you don't need the original hardware. How's that for relevance! Honestly, it's been too long since Punch-Out was in the zeitgeist. I can't believe that the last major release was in 2009!
The Super Punch-Out fighter select cheat code
All combinations must be held on Joypad [controller] 2. Then press A or start on Joypad 1.
At the title, hold Y+R, then press A or start.
The Super Punch-Out multiplayer cheat code
Reminder: All combinations must be held on Joypad 2. Then press A or start on Joypad 1.
In the above free match mode, at the character info screen, hold B+Y then press A or start.

The next generation of Pokémon is here! Pokémon Scarlet & Violet kick off the 9th generation of the Pokémon RPGs in style with a few significant changes, including a wholly open world and the chance to tackle the Gyms in whatever order you see fit!

Like with most Pokémon games, the biggest difference will be the list of version-exclusive Pokémon, but Scarlet & Violet are also introducing a few other differences depending on what version you pick up.

Activision Blizzard has quietly pulled a new DLC skin from its billion-dollar shooters Call of Duty: Vanguard and Call of Duty: Warzone following accusations of plagiarism from an online artist.
The "Loyal Samoyed" skin is a bizarre conception that features a realistically depicted head of a Samoyed breed canine plastered on the body of a heavily armed mercenary. The strange look is part of a new range of in-game skins just released for Vanguard and Warzone — a pack that also includes looks stylized after characters from movies The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day.
However, artist and Call of Duty fan Sail Lin has expressed their disappointment, given that the Loyal Samoyed skin is, almost indisputably, pulled from Lin's portfolio of animal-based Call of …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peter is a guy with his head in the clouds. Literally. Well, sort of. A climate science lecturer at Cambridge University, Peter's great passion in life is cloud research. All he wants to do is study clouds: their different formations, their flight paths, their properties, everything.  He can’t get enough of them, and finds them fascinating enough to be the subject of his 100-page PhD thesis. It’s a poetic subject and one that matches his temperament as a boyish and awkward researcher and 'path of least resistance' kinda guy. But around him the world is spiralling from the political tensions of the Cold War, and as much as Peter wishes to escape to in the clouds, current events are keeping him firmly tethered to the realities of an impending war. 
It’s this tension that makes South Of The Circle such an engrossing story. With player choices that subtly tug the game’s narrative needle in ways you might not expect, it's clear skies and fair winds for the game’s three-hour journey. But with an abrupt ending after a calculated slow-burn drama, it's a rough landing.

Elden Ring patch 1.06 is now live, and there's several things that probably need to be highlighted, among balance changes.
Arguably the most interesting tidbit involves White Mask Varre’s questline, which previously required players to engage in PVP to complete it. Now there is a "new way to advance" the quest, without having to resort to PVP. It's a big win for 100%ers who don't otherwise engage in online play. Speaking of multiplayer though, Elden Ring has "added the function to send summoning signs to summoning pools in multiple areas, including distant areas." Everyone wins!
As far as the balance stuff goes motion speed has been increased across the board for several weapons, and great axes have been given a general buff (everything is faster). Light equipment loa…]]></summary>

If you've been alive for the past couple of decades, you've probably, at some point, dreamed of packing it all in, throwing your phone and computer into a lake, moving to a cottage in the forest, and living off the land. We're with you, friend.
The video game equivalent of that is eschewing modern photorealistic games that are all five exciting shades of brown, and instead playing and making new games that draw from the experiences of our childhood. Restless Soul, like many before it, has chosen to ditch the third dimension and combine Pokémon, Earthbound, and Paper Mario to create a 2D-3D black-and-white adventure with plenty of fourth-wall-breaking comedy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To say that Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was successful would be an understatement. The highest-grossing video game film in U.S. history already had a confirmed threequel in the works, but today we found out exactly when we'll see Sonic and friends return to the big screen, and it’ll be chillier than usual.
The official movie Twitter account announced the unofficially titled Sonic the Hedgehog 3 will premiere in theaters on December 20, 2024. This marks a big seasonal shift for the franchise as Sonic 1 and 2 arrived during the first halves of their respective years, with the first movie premiering on Valentine's Day and the second arriving in April. 
Running faster, flying higher, and punching harder. #SonicMovie3 hits theatres on December 20, 2024. pic.twitter.com/DcFGbaKUao
August 9, 2022
The tweet doesn’t reveal anything else about the film, but if you’ve seen the post-credits scene for Sonic 2, you already have a good inkling of where the series is headed. 
December 2024 is a long way off, but Paramount plans to fill the gap with a live-action series starring Idris Elba’s Knuckles hitting Paramount+ next year. There’s also Sonic Prime, Netflix’s animated series that, while disconnected from the film universe, provides another avenue to enjoy the Blue Blur on the small screen. With the next big video game, Sonic Frontiers, slated to launch this fall, the next few years look pretty bright for Sega's mascot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Still due out this month
Thanks to a new clip from Bandai Namco, we have the new remastered Pac-Man World intro to give us a clue as to what we can expect from the re-release.
Dubbed Pac-Man World Re-Pac, the game will remaster the 1999 adventure, which tasks the titular Pac-Man with rescuing his family. Here's the original synopsis:
"In Pac-Man World, Pac-Man arrives home on his birthday to find the Ghosts have kidnapped Pac-Man's family & friends and ruined his party! Pac-Man must set out to adventure through the six areas of Ghost Island to rescue his family and friends, and face-off against the Ghosts’ boss, Toc-Man!"

As you can see when comparing them directly, the original is a bit longer, showing off more of the Ghost Island locale after Pac-Man actually sees the invite (it's a whole minute and a half of extra footage). Maybe that bit will be slotted into a later cutscene, but either way, it gets the point across with a completely new tone, and respects our time a bit more (if you're not into long PSX cutscenes).
Pac-Man World intro remastered:

Pac-Man World intro original:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwLnlWACzzs
Even better than an intro, Bandai Namco has also given us a graphical showdown of sorts with regular gameplay. The backgrounds especially look massively upgraded, and have me excited. We're flush with mascot platformers these days!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Join host Wesley LeBlanc as he rides solo today to showcase a quick glimpse of You Suck At Parking, an upcoming racer with a very unique twist. Instead of racing to a finish line, your objective is stop...in the marked parking stop.  
Stopping in a parking spot might sound easy but as you'll soon find out, it's anything but because each track is littered with obstacles such as barriers that immediately destroy your car, magnets aiming to pull you off the track, boosters, jump pads, and more. You must survive through it all in order to reach the coveted parking spot at the end of the road. 
Check it out for yourself in the New Gameplay Today below: 


Enjoy this first look at You Suck At Parking as Wesley briefly introduces you to the world of the game before taking a back seat to let you enjoy some uninterrupted gameplay (that's harder than it looks so when you see me die a bunch of times, no you didn't). You Suck At Parking is slated to launch sometime this year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lost in translation.
Mega Man: The Power Battle was a 1995 arcade release followed by a sequel, Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters. Both are one-on-one fighting games, and they retain the series hallmark of obtaining enemy skills for tactical use. Controlling either Mega Man, Proto Man or Bass (and Duo for the sequel) imagine Mega Man minus the stage-long preamble, and that’s about the size things.
Both games very recently appeared as plug-in entries in the recent Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium for $4 a piece. While that nominal price tag and the assumption that the arcade games are superior might put some off of this new collection, Mega Man Battle & Fighters, but there are still valid reasons to pick it up. Originally released on the Neo Geo Pocket Colour in 2000, SNK’s wonder handheld renders the game with remarkable finesse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise may have turned 30 years old last year, but the party is still going for some. We already knew additional Sonic-themed costumes were planned for Fall Guys this month, but developer Mediatonic this morning announced the details of the collaboration event with Sega's iconic brand. The event is meant to celebrate over 30 years of Sonic the Hedgehog and includes a new Sonic-themed level and new outfits. 
The new level is called "Bean Hill Zone" and tasks the Fall Guys beans with collecting as many rings as possible to win special rewards. If players earn 200 points, they get a "Bean Hill Zone" nameplate. Earning 400 points yields 200 kudos, 600 points get a Bonus Rings Pattern outfit, 800 points gives 400 kudos, and 1,000 points gives you access to Sonic's iconic sneakers.
Those aren't the only rewards you can snatch up during this event, though. New costumes for Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Super Sonic, and Dr. Robotnik are all available in the store during the event. You can also buy the Sonic Foot Tap emote.
This isn't Sonic's first appearance in Fall Guys as a costume. Back in 2020, players could pick up this Sonic costume. This special Fall Guys event featuring Sonic the Hedgehog begins on Thursday, August 11, and runs until Monday, August 15.
Fall Guys originally launched on PlayStation 4 and PC, where it found overwhelming success as a fun gameshow-style twist on the battle royale genre, in 2020. In 2021, publisher Epic Games acquired Fall Guys developer Mediatonic. Earlier this summer, Fall Guys changed from a premium model to a free-to-play model, and launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Switch.]]></summary>

Tactics fans are not left wanting this year. From re-releases and remasters to brand-new titles, there hasn't been a shortage of good strategy options to go around, and Square Enix has been at the forefront of it. Because of that, I was left wondering where a new IP like The DioField Chronicle would fit in.
The answer, as it turns out, is that it doesn't. The DioField Chronicle, from Square Enix and Lancarse, isn't a classic turn-based tactics game like Tactics Ogre. It's not turn-based at all. It's a real-time strategy RPG, and those two flavors meld together to make a surprisingly interesting and novel concept that stands out all on its own.

Not only will you be getting a glimpse at what combat in the game looks like, but he gives you a brief glimpse of what you're doing in The DioField Chronicle when you're not in a battle. 
Developed by Lancarse and Square Enix, this RPG is aiming to feel unique amongst a sea of other tactical RPGs by infusing real-time combat into its formula. So while you are controlling units on a battlefield, you're watching their moves play out in real-time, and you must adjust your classic tried-and-true TRPG strategies to match it. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


Enjoy this first look at The DioField Chronicle as Wesley walks you through one full expedition in the game before showing you around the main palace that acts as your home base. The demo showcased here takes place completely within Chapter 1 so if you're worried about spoilers, you should be alright. The DioField Chronicle hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Sept. 22.

Bandai Namco's upcoming remaster of Pac-Man World is set to hit shelves on August 26th, and to drum up excitement, the studio has revealed the game's opening short movie in which Pac-Man's friends are kidnapped by Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde in a series of Loony Tunes-esque ways.
Fans of the original game will instantly spot the references to the remaster's source material, though Re-Pac's opening demonstrates that the game is more than a simple visual upgrade.

Paramount Pictures has quickly realized that it is on to a good thing and to strike while the iron is most assuredly hot — as such, the studio has announced that the second sequel in the hugely successful Sonic the Hedgehog movie franchise will premiere December 2024, a little over two years on from the release of the most recent entry, Sonic the Hedgehog 2.
"Running faster, flying higher, and punching harder," teased the studio on the official Sonic Twitter. "#SonicMovie3 hits theatres on December 20, 2024."

Publisher Spike Chunsoft has showcased a brand new overview trailer for its upcoming RPG title Made in Abyss: Binary Star Falling into Darkness. The game is set to launch on the Nintendo Switch on September 2nd, so if you're somewhat on the fence about the title at this stage, then hopefully this new trailer will give you some interesting new information to chew on.
As for the trailer itself, it gives a brief rundown of some of the key characters you'll be encountering, along with their respective voice actors (be sure to take note of the rather bizarre creature noise at 0:30), before moving onto the 'Basics of Exploration'. Here, the trailer provides some information on buying and selling items, acquiring new abilities and skills, and... whistles? Sure!

Well we can brace ourselves for another trip into the uncanny valley as THR has reported that Pac-Man will be the latest video game legend to make his way into the live-action world.
The project is currently helmed by Bandai Namco Entertainment (no surprises there) and Wayfarer Studios, and is said to be based on an original idea by Sonic the Hedgehog mastermind, Chuck Williams.

With a second delay in effect, Marvel's Midnight Suns won't be showing up in October 2022 as previously planned, and even then, it'll have a scaled-back launch when it does arrive.
As it stands, 2K expects the tactical superhero game to land before the end of March 2023 — but that only goes for the PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S versions. The other console versions, which are still on the way, don't have a release window yet. So if you've been keeping tabs on the Nintendo Switch, PS4, or Xbox One editions of Midnight Suns, they're even further out. I hope they aren't ultimately canceled as we get closer.

A Take-Two earnings report revealed that the game had been pushed out of its October 7 date to an unspecified release within the 2023 fiscal year. That means it will now arrive sometime before March 31, 2023.
The game’s Twitter account confirmed the delay with a message, embedded below, that also revealed that the game will now have a staggered release. Midnight Suns will come to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC first within the fiscal year. The PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions arrive sometime after that. 
Important update from the Midnight Suns team pic.twitter.com/79yVfzpDED
August 8, 2022
While Midnight Suns will only face a five-month setback at most (for current-gen, at least) and could technically still arrive in 2022, seeing it suffer another delay is disappointing nonetheless. The game was first announced almost a year ago at last year’s Gamescom. It graced Game Informer’s cover that month and was first scheduled to launch this March before being delayed to October. A reimagining of the Rise of the Midnight Sons comic event, players control a team of occult heroes like Blade, Magik, and Nico Minoru and Avengers like Iron Man, Captain America, and Spider-Man to battle Lilith, the mother of all demons. Midnight Suns' turn-based combat utilizes a card system for selecting commands, and between battles players explore a headquarters where they can socialize and bond with their teammates. 
We played the first four hours of Marvel’s Midnight Suns in June and wrote up seven takeaways based on our time with it. You can also watch us battle Venom as Spider-Man and other heroes in this episode of New Gameplay Today.]]></summary>

One of the coolest visuals in Elden Ring, the Walking Mausoleum, caught my eye long before we got to play the game or knew it by name — the stomping giant was in the first gameplay trailer, and I distinctly remember it setting off sparks in my imagination. In a trailer full of cool shit, it stood out to me; it got me wondering about the gameplay possibilities that could come out of an open-ended world designed by FromSoftware.
Months after exhausting the game (for now), I still think about these big boys.
A fan on Reddit, HoboSapient, shares my enthusiasm — and then some. They created a big, detailed, surprisingly heavy LEGO version of Elden Ring's Walking Mausoleum. (Thanks, PC Gamer.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because sure, why not
It looks like Pac-Man could be hitting the silver screen. A new report claims a film is in development, based on Pac-Man, and it's live-action.
The Hollywood Reporter says the project is in the works between Bandai Namco Entertainment and Wayfarer Studios. It's apparently based on an original idea from Chuck Williams of Lightbeam Entertainment, a producer on 2020's Sonic the Hedgehog.
Wayfarer was founded by Justin Baldoni and Steve Sarowitz, and was behind Disney+ feature Clouds. No further details have been reported on what direction this live-action adaptation of the arcade classic might take.
Bandai Namco, meanwhile, has seen a number of video game adaptations come and go. They've ranged from varying Tekken films to series and anime adaptations. Tekken itself is getting another iteration on Netflix later this month, with Tekken: Bloodline.

Puck Man to the rescue
Considering there isn't too much narrative fodder to work with, I have to wonder where exactly a Pac-Man movie goes. Maybe a comedy that imagines the Pac-Man world and its everyday action as a standard 9-to-5 world, like Wreck-It Ralph.
Or maybe it goes a darker, grim route, imagining Pac-Man as some grizzled ghost hunter. What if the "games" are put on by a higher power, and Pac-Man is in some kind of Squid Games situation, fighting to survive in a maze full of ghosts and dots?
Honestly, I have no clue. But since video game adaptations have shown absolutely no sign of slowing down in the near future, I'm down for whatever. Resident Evil has had multiple adaptations in the last few years, Castlevania keeps tearing it up on Netflix, and League of Legends struck gold with Arcane. If Mario and Sonic, are both returning to the silver screen, then Pac-Man should get a shot too.

This laptop is slim and compact, yet sports a brilliant 14-inch 2560x1600 120Hz display, a powerful RX 6700S graphics card and a top-end Ryzen 9 6900HS processor. This is backed with a 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of DDR5 RAM (!!), an impressive loadout that uses basically the fastest and latest-gen components you can fit into a laptop of this size. 
Today Best Buy in the US are doing a great price on this spec of the Zephyrus G14, charging $1399.99 for it rather than the launch price of $1649.99 - a $250 reduction. That's the best price we've seen for this model and an awesome deal on a compact yet powerful all-AMD laptop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not quite time to embark
ARC Raiders, the debut effort from Embark Studios, is taking a little extra time to come together. The developer announced today that it has delayed ARC Raiders to 2023.
In a statement, the team says it appreciates support so far. "ARC Raiders is an ambitious game, and we will be using this extra time to expand the experience, and allow it to reach its fullest potential," reads the post on social media.
https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1556656803265609728
The studio says it will be going into more details about ARC Raiders as soon as it starts to more extensively test the game with players.
Invaders from outer space
First teased and then officially shown off at The Game Awards 2021, ARC Raiders is a co-op PvE shooter. Players will have to band together to fight off killer enemies from outer space.
It has a big retro-future vibe, in the same vein as Deathloop and the upcoming Rollerdrome. It's also got some notable industry names attached to its developer, Embark Studios.
Embark is headed up by former DICE CEO Patrick Söderlund, so it could have some similar ideas. And honestly, a co-op PvE game with a mix of outer-space and tinge of Battlefield sounds pretty alright to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BKASgkxK1g
We haven't seen too much of ARC Raiders yet though, aside from what was shown at last year's Game Awards. It's third-person, and seems to have a pretty hefty amount of gunfire and explosions, as well as some fearsome and massive robots to take down. It's some borderline Earth Defense Force vibes, which I'll be honest, I'm here for! Big robots versus small soldiers sounds like a good time.
We'll see how the project comes together as Embark continues to work on it and show off more. Until then, we'll have to wait for the new year to see more of ARC Raiders.

With the release of Wave 2 of the Booster Course Pass, new is exactly what we're getting.
One of the courses featured in the Turnip Cup and Propeller Cup is new to the Mario Kart franchise, making its debut here before it pops up in Mario Kart Tour. I like the idea of Booster Course Pass players getting early access to these new tracks – because lord knows I'm never going back to MKT. But these tracks have their work cut out for them if they want to stand o…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball FighterZ is finally getting rollback netcode by way of the newly announced PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of the game. The update will also be available on PC.
For the unfamiliar, rollback netcode is a system that provides a nearly lag-free online experience, hence why it's always a highly desirable feature in the fighting game community. During EVO 2022, DBFZ producer Tomoko Hiroki shared that the current-gen versions will support rollback netcode, whereas the PS4 and Xbox One editions will not. There's no release window for upgraded ports, but a message from Bandai Namco's Twitter account states we'll learn more information later and that it will take "some time" before the system is finished. 
While that's bad news for those who don't own a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, Bandai Namco is at least planning some sort of upgrade path for existing game owners on current consoles (such as Smart Delivery on Xbox). There's no mention if the Switch version will receive a rollback netcode.  
Hiroki also announced that Dragon Ball FighterZ is now content-complete, meaning it will not receive any more fighters or balance updates. The game received three DLC fighter packs during its lifetime that added over a dozen characters to its roster. 
Dragon Ball FighterZ first launched in January 2018 and was hailed as one of the best fighting games of the decade and arguably the best Dragon Ball video game period. You can read our review of the launch version of the game here.]]></summary>

Aside from my – our – achievements, I learned that the game is a perfect measurement of fatigue. Where rulers calculate distance or Ollie's highly scientific WIPERS precipitation system measured the best rain in games, Spelunky 2 is the ultimate tool for accurately determining just how tired someone is.

Recently, there have been staff comments alluding to the potential end of the Xenoblade series, but that's not exactly correct. Instead, the team is mostly referring to the end of the "trilogy," as a new email from Xenoblade Chronicles 3 director Tetsuya Takahashi (obtained by Nintendo Everything) sheds some more light on where the series is going from here.
Note that there is one spoilery element, which I have removed with the bold emphasis below:
Greetings to everyone who purchased Xenoblade Chronicles 3. This is Takahashi from Monolith Soft. Thanks to your support, we’ve released the third Xenoblade title, twelve years after the original Xenoblade was released for the Wii in 2010.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it lazy to describe Turbo Golf Racing as ‘Rocket League if the cars were playing golf instead of football?' A bit, yes. But it’s also largely accurate. Up to eight players race across a track, ramming their boost-enabled car into their huge futuristic golf ball to send it flying forwards until (depending on your skill or luck) it flies/rolls/plops anticlimactically into the big hole at the end. It’s golf, sort of, but fast, demanding, and often unpredictable. You don’t even have to wear silly trousers while playing it, but that’s just my personal choice.
Of course, it’s not quite so simple as hitting your ball forward and relying on the videogame gods to deem your ball worthy of reaching the goal before everybody else’s. There are 30 courses of varying length and complexity, and none of them are a simple drag race to the end. There are ramps, twists, turns, and plenty of obstacles. While the very shortest courses are pretty frictionless (I’ve won a few in under 20 seconds), the longest ones are practically begging you to make agonising mistakes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco revealed a big update for Tekken 7 during this weekend’s EVO tournament, which may have also teased the next entry in the long-running series.
A trailer running down the Tekken 7 balance update, which arrives on August 17 and introduces balance adjustments and new tactics, concluded on a tantalizing note. A clip of Kazuya’s semi-infamous Tekken 1 arcade ending, in which he drops Heihachi off a cliff before giving a cheesy smile to the camera, transitions to a smirking modern Kazuya with a message of “Get Ready.” The clip begins at the 1:40 mark. 


Fans have excitedly interpreted this footage as a teaser for Tekken 8. That would make sense; Tekken 7 launched on consoles in 2017, so it feels like the right time to begin hinting at the next entry. Perhaps it’s a different Tekken project entirely. Or Bandai Namco simply thought this would be a humorous footnote to wrap up its Tekken 7 news.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's still so much to learn about how Splatoon 3 will differentiate itself from the pack
In what will most likely be the last major update until launch, Nintendo has announced a Splatoon 3 Direct: debuting on August 10 at 6AM PT. That's in two days!
Somehow, Nintendo plans on spending "roughly 30 minutes" on the game, which is on the longer side for these sorts of micro/single game Directs. Even the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Direct was about 24 minutes, so they're clearly aiming high here. There are precedents though. Back in 2015 (!) Nintendo essentially had to sell people on a brand new franchise, and spent 33 minutes explaining the universe of the first game. Then a few years later for the sequel, that Direct was nearly 27 minutes long.
Either way, there's a lot we can still glean from another Direct, like:
Story (Return of the Mammalians)/lore info
Campaign structure
More multiplayer maps/weapons
Salmon Run (co-op) info
Secrets/extras like amiibo support
The last part is what I'm rooting for, and serves as perfect Direct material. That sort of mysterious tease is what gets all the speculation going once the video is done, and Nintendo is generally pretty good at it! Plus, I hope there's some form of amiibo support (even minor): as it stands, there's no mention of amiibo on the game's various regional store pages, which could be confirmation or an oversight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed that it will live stream a Splatoon 3 Direct this week. 
More specifically, it will begin at 6 a.m. PT on Wednesday, Aug. 10, and will feature roughly 30 minutes of updates. Check out the announcement for yourself below:
Tune in on August 10 at 6 a.m. PT for a livestreamed #Splatoon3 Direct presentation. Join us in the Splatlands for roughly 30 minutes of updates! pic.twitter.com/iFfaU3V6vM
August 8, 2022
As you can see, there’s not much else to glean from this news. If you’re the kind of person who anticipates game-focused Directs to reveal information about other anticipated titles, I would say you should not do that with this one. It seems very much a “we’re only going to talk about Splatoon 3” kind of Direct announcement. Of course, I could be wrong, but you know, expectations and all that. 
However, if you’re a Splatoon fan, it sounds like Wednesday will be an excellent day. Not only are you getting new Splatoon 3 details and information, but “roughly 30” minutes of it – that’s a lot! As for what to expect, new weapons, characters, maps, and story details will likely be showcased. This will probably be the last Splatoon 3-focused Direct, too, considering the game hits Switch less than a month after it on Sept. 9. 
While waiting for Wednesday’s Direct, check out this Splatoon 3-themed Switch console and then listen to this new punk rock-inspired track from Splatoon 3’s soundtrack. After that, check out the latest Splatoon 3 gameplay trailer.

        <id>118915</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/08/08/snk-reveals-a-new-fatal-fury-game-the-first-in-more-than-20-years-is-now-in-development"/>
        <updated>2022-08-08T13:05:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SNK revealed during the Evo 2022 fighting game tournament held in Las Vegas that a new Fatal Fury game has been greenlit and is now in development. 
This news comes from a short teaser trailer that showcases a new look at some Fatal Fury art alongside the following message, which plays on screen: “The city of legend still breathes. Hungry wolves back on the prowl. A new destiny hidden in darkness. New Fatal Fury/Garou green-lit.” 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, SNK didn’t reveal much else, and if you’re a Fatal Fury fan, you probably have many questions. Will this new game adopt a 3D art style like other modern fighting franchises such as Street Fighter 6, or will it stick with traditional 2D art? Which fighters are returning? Will there be new fighters? Only time will tell. 
If you’re unfamiliar with Fatal Fury, you might recognize the name Terry Bogard, who regained some popularity after his inclusion in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. He’s the protagonist of the Fatal Fury fighting game series. If you don’t recognize that name either, nobody can blame you – the last Fatal Fury game came out 23 years ago, with Fatal Fury: Mark of the Wolves’ release in 1999. 
It’s unclear when we’ll hear more about this new Fatal Fury game, but it’s nice to know at least a game is in development for the classic fighting franchise.

Returning competitor Juri is a “sadistic thrill seeker who enjoys the suffering of others, taking immense joy in obliterating her foes,” according to PlayStation. She first appeared in Super Street Fighter IV. Before SF6, her primary motivation was exacting revenge on M. Bison, but since his fall in Street Fighter V, she now waits for a new motivation to arrive. If you’re a fan of Juri, don’t sweat – she retains many of her past moves in Street Fighter 6, although you can expect them to have “different properties” now. 
For example, Fuhajin returns and sees Juri perform an upwards kick that stores Fuha stocks upon completion. Saihasho, Ankensatsu, and Go Ohsatsu are new special moves but “…]]></summary>

Demons Happened is a curious blend of very rapid action faintly reminiscent of Hotline Miami, and an Abe's Oddysee type of puzzle game. Such disparate genres don't often blend as well as this, and I'm disappointed that it hasn't got a bigger reception.

Now, it looks a whole lot like Microsoft’s Game Pass: For roughly the same amount of money, both offer access to a Netflix-style games-on-demand library. Obviously, we had to stack the two services up against each other.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Nintendo first introduced the Switch Online classic games catalog featuring NES games, I bemoaned the announcement of what I saw as an inferior content delivery system. Not only were we asked to play with a substantially smaller library of games than what we had on Wii or Wii U, but I didn't even have the option to buy those games. Instead, we were given a small library of games from a single console with no way to carry over entitlements from previous purchases or actually own the classic games I was playing. I felt Nintendo Switch Online was a worse service in every way, even as Nintendo expanded the offerings to include a robust NES and SNES library.
Then in 2020, something changed. With many of my normal social activities put on hold, I found myself with more free time at home tha…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-08-05T18:41:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia is an upcoming indie survival horror with one of the most interesting visual styles I’ve seen in the genre in a minute. 
Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, Saturnalia is influenced heavily by the folklore of Sardinia, Italy, and inspired by Italian Giallo horror films (typically more horror-esque mystery thrillers). In it, you control four different characters, all connected through a mysterious storyline that ties back to the “haunting traditions” of an ancient village. 
“The village itself is an elaborate maze with no two iterations being precisely the same – you will have to explore and solve mysteries of the game largely unguided,” the game’s website reads. “Die, and watch the village reconfigure itself into a new form. Solve puzzles and open shortcuts to new areas with tools and items you find along the way, unlocking every piece of the story with different characters, each suited for another aspect of exploration and investigation.” 
All of that sounds great, but Saturnalia's unique art style makes me most excited. It’s like a mix of stop-motion and sketchbook, which looks like it’ll lend itself nicely to the game's horror elements. Check it out for yourself below:


Santa Ragione is the studio behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia. Saturnalia does not yet a launch date, but it will hit PC exclusively via the Epic Games Store sometime in 2022. The studio is planning to launch the game on other platforms, but the timing on that remains TBA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Sonic Origins arrived on consoles and PC in June, it delivered a four-pack of classic Sonic the Hedgehog games from the '90s. While the bundle was praised for bringing Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD to modern platforms with various gameplay enhancements and other additions, it was also heavily criticized. Various bugs, mislabeled titles in the in-game museum, and overall stability (particularly with the PC version) frustrated the player base as they waited for Sega to fix the problems. This week, Sega released that long-awaited patch, addressing those problems and more, hopefully stabilizing the compilation and making the overall experience more enjoyable.
The two biggest items this patch addresses include fixing issues with the game crashing and one of the most annoying bugs of the year: Tails falling behind in Sonic 2 and constantly jumping instead of respawning on the player – we can finally turn off mute when playing Sonic 2. The patch also includes fixes for sound bugs, menu and controller issues, museum mislabels, and data-saving issues. Unfortunately, the replacement music in Ice Cap, Carnival Night, and Launch Base remain in place. 
The patch is available to download now for all platforms. Sonic Origins arrived on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on June 23. For more on the speedy selection of games, check out our review here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most beloved fighting games of all time is finally getting the Arcade1Up treatment. Marvel vs. Capcom 2, the legendary crossover extravaganza from 2000, is the latest game featured by the replica arcade cabinet company. 
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 gathers 56 playable heroes and villains from both Marvel and Capcom's robust catalogs of characters in an over-the-top 3v3 fighting game. In addition to giving you something approximating the original arcade experience through this replica cabinet, the Arcade1Up release also features online play via Wi-Fi. 
As it has done with most of its recent cabinets, Arcade1Up offers more than just the game on the marquee. You can see the full list of eight classic Marvel games included in this cabinet below.
Marvel vs. Capcom 2
Marvel vs. Capcom
Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter
X-Men vs. Street Fighter
Marvel Super Heroes
X-Men: Children of the Atom
X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse
Marvel Super Heroes in War of the Gems
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 has been largely unavailable since 2013, with home digital versions getting delisted or physical copies skyrocketing in price. Arcade1Up's Marvel vs. Capcom 2 cabinet opens up for pre-orders starting September 8, with orders shipping a few weeks later in early October. The package includes a matching custom riser, light-up marquee, a headphone jack, and exclusive side-panel art. You can sign up to be notified of when pre-orders go live at Arcade1Up's official page.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love Final Fantasy. I’ve played nearly every numbered entry and have beaten most of them. I adore Final Fantasy Tactics. I watched both terrible feature films. My ringtone is the FFVII victory fanfare theme. But the biggest hole in my fandom for years has been Final Fantasy XIV.
MMOs have never appealed to me, but as I listened to friends and colleagues rave about FFXIV over its long existence, the more I felt like I was missing out on something special. Every expansion and free trial had me hovering over the purchase button, but I always told myself I didn’t have the time to invest in such a behemoth of a game. The excuses have come to an end. 
I’ve finally broken the seal and dived headfirst into one of the most celebrated games on the planet. Join me on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as I trek through my first dungeon with the help of two of the biggest FFXIV experts I know. First up is the returning Jon Woodey, Game Informer web programmer extraordinaire. I’ll also have a special guest: MinnMax cohort Sarah Podzorski joins our party to lend her bubbly brand of insight. Watch along to learn some valuable tips and tricks and, if you’re like me, get an early taste of FFXIV to see if it’s something you want to jump into as well!
Watch on Twitch!
If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

It's a downhill mountain biking game with dangerous speeds and even more dangerous stunts, including leaping through a ring of fire over of a moving train. This is fun. The roguelikelike campaign structure this is all built into, eh, I don't think it has added any enjoyment. But it is very fun to stack a double-backflip, slam into a rock, and watch your ragdoll corpse rocket downhill. It's a good reminder to ride whichever way you enjoy, expectations and pressures be damned.

Discovery – then you know things have been bleak the past couple of days. 
The HBO Max film, Batgirl, a complete movie, has been canned alongside a sequel to 2020’s Scoob! There are rumors of massive layoffs at HBO Max to the tune of a 70% reduction in staff (thanks, The Wrap), as well as word that in-the-works projects like DC’s Supergirl movie will not be moving forward. Warner Bros. Discovery will roll HBO Max into Discovery's streaming service, Discovery+, with less emphasis on premium scripted content fans of HBO Max have come to know and love, as reported by The Hollywood Reporter.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/08/05/here-are-capcoms-top-10-best-selling-games"/>
        <updated>2022-08-05T12:40:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much in the same way Nintendo recently released its financial results for the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2023, which ends March 2023, Capcom has done the same. As a result, we now have an updated list of the best-selling Capcom games as of June 30, 2022, which is when the company’s latest financial quarter ended, as reported by MyNintendoNews. 
If you’re a Capcom fan, there’s likely no surprise as to which games are at the top, but there might be a few surprises for you in it elsewhere.
Here are the top 10 best-selling Capcom games: 
Monster Hunter World: 18.3 million 
Resident Evil 7: Biohazard: 11 million
Monster Hunter Rise: 10.3 million
Resident Evil 2: 9.8 million
Monster Hunter World: Iceborn: 9.5 million 
Resident Evil 5: 8.3 million
Resident Evil 6: 8.3 million
Street Fighter V: 6.6 million
Resident Evil Village: 6.4 million
Street Fighter II: 6.3 million
As you can see, this list is mostly Monster Hunter and Resident Evil, as anyone tuned into Capcom’s releases probably could have guessed. However, it's important to note that Capcom, strangely, breaks each individual release up as its own game, meaning each of the multiple Resident Evil 4 re-releases counts as its own game. Collectively, though, Resident Evil 4 would be on this top 10 list. The same can be said for various other titles, such as Dragon's Dogma and its re-release, and more. 
Now that you’ve seen this top 10 list, go check out the top 10 best-selling games on Switch and then read Game Informer’s review of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, the recent expansion for the game. After that, read about Capcom’s remake of Resident Evil 4, which is due out next March.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation revealed that the long-rumored remake of The Last of Us was real in a leak hours before Naughty Dog could officially reveal it during Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, but alas, it’s real nonetheless.
Following in the steps of its sequel, The Last of Us Part II, the remake is called The Last of Us Part 1, and it’s beautiful. It will also cost $70, and some fans have criticized Naughty Dog and PlayStation for that price, citing that $70 is a high price tag for a game released on the PlayStation 3 before getting remastered for the PlayStation 4 a year later. It also appears to be very much the same game – just with improved graphics and some changes to AI systems and other under-the-hood things. Nonetheless, it’s out on Sept. 1 and will cost $70. 
Since the reveal, Naughty Dog has been slowly dolling out information about the upcoming title, including neat comparison videos that showcase how drastic the visual upgrades are. The studio released a new one this morning, this time comparing a sequence with Ellie and Joel riding horses on a road. Check it out for yourself below:

As you can see, the difference is night and day, with the remake looking a lot more like Part II. For more information, be sure to read our write-up about all the changes coming to The Last of Us Part I, and then read Game Informer’s original review of The Last of Us.

Summer camp culture isn't as much of a thing in the UK, possibly because we're fairly happy to allow our children to learn to tie knots by themselves, by affixing each other to disused railway tracks or sick trees. In any case, the summer camps I've seen portrayed are usually unwholesome ones, because they're good horror fodder. Camp Canyonwood is a camp counsellor sim, out now in early access, where you (an bird) look after a flock of demanding smaller birds. It sounds like it would be twee, except the owner is cutting corners and you dream about a talking jackalope. I have not explored these aspects much because I am constantly trying to feed the children.

It’s the setup to 1996's classic Super Mario 64, sure, but it’s also very much also a survival horror pitch, which is why this new fan-made project is such a perfect fit.

If Recipe for Disaster is any indication, running a successful eatery is a challenging, trial-and-error affair with plenty of stress and frustration, but one that, once mastered, offers excitement and gratification to balance it all out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ooblets, the long-in-development indie title that blends monster collecting, farming, and dancing, has gone Gold. That means the game has completed certifications for release, signaling that its impending 1.0 launch is fast approaching. 
Developer Glumberland shared the news on Twitter, stating that they’ll announce the release date of the game’s full launch in the near future. Pre-orders for the recently announced Switch version will begin soon as well.
We just found out that Ooblets has gone 🌟GOLD🌟!!
pic.twitter.com/LHdJtgKTHV
August 4, 2022
Ooblets was first announced in 2016 and has been playable in PC early access and Xbox Game Preview since 2020. The farming sim game tasks players with planting and growing lovable creatures called Ooblets, who can then perform tasks and battle other Ooblets in dance battles. You can decorate and expand your farm, plus complete side quests from the many residents of Badge Town. Ooblets has received numerous content updates over the years, such as new creatures, locations, decor, and even seasons. Glumberland announced in May that the game would go 1.0 this summer, so today's news seems to reaffirm that release window. 
We've enjoyed Ooblets whenever we've checked in on it over the years, so it's exciting to see it approaching the finish line. Ooblets is slated to launch for Xbox One, Switch, and PC via The Epic Games Store.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ice Code Games may have called it Hard West 2, but 'round these parts we refer to it as "The Laughing Deer Show". New to town, are ya? Let me clue you in. Laughing Deer is a six-foot man of raw muscle and rage, a native American warrior with shoulders like a pair of yoked oxen and a personality best described as "barely contained". Unlike the rest of his posse, which includes a cowboy without a shadow, a woman with ties to the occult, and one very stubborn corpse, Laughing Deer doesn't really "do" guns. While his compatriots are all crouched behind crates, ricocheting bullets off buckets and wheelbarrows to hit enemies from behind, Laughing Deer is getting in their faces (shortly before his club gets significantly further into their faces).
Now, bringing a club to a gunfight might not seem like the smartest idea. But while pistols require two of a gunslinger's action points to shoot, and rifles take all three, it only takes one action point to whack some neckerchief-wearing bandit with a big ol' stick. And Laughing Deer whacks a whole point of damage harder than normal, meaning he can rush foes and nail them into the ground with a couple of hard swings before they can pull the trigger. Better yet, killing an enemy completely refills a character's action points in Hard West, meaning that, when set up right, Laughing Deer can ping around the battlefield like a weaponised pinball.

Vantage hails from the icy world of Pagos, and her skills as a sharpshooter are borne out in her three powerful abilities - not least of which is her custom sniper rifle Ultimate, which she can bring out before the ability has even fully charged in order to snipe enemies and mark them for increased damage for her entire team.
Take a closer look at her dangerous-sounding abilities in the new Apex Legends vignette trailer below.

These are both relevant, because the email from James suggests that we talk about the games that we'd like to play for the first time again - just erase them from our heads and encounter them anew. Thus, we discuss Lucasarts games like the Monkey Island series. See, I tied it all together.
In fact, I'm not sure if I'd wipe Monkey Island from my head or not, because I can't be sure how much of my love for it is fuelled by nostalgia. Matthew has other concerns, though, because as is our usual fashion we spend some time discussing the question "what games would you play for the first time again?" more literally than is intended. What grave consequences would come from erasing certain things from your brain? What sort of person would co-host Nate be if he wiped the Civ games from his memory? Listen in to find out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mega Man fans in the west got a surprise treat with the global launch of Mega Man Battle & Fighters on Switch. The game was originally released for the Neo Geo Pocket Color and has never been released outside of Japan until now. 
The game was first released in 2000 and serves as a portable bundle of two arcade games: Mega Man: The Power Battle and Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters (both of which were recently included in the Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium collection). Players can play as Mega Man, Proto Man, Bass, and Duo to engage in a series of boss battles against robot masters from Mega Man 1 through 7. A total of 40 bosses await, and players gain character data by defeating them with the added goal of filling a personal database. 


Despite launching stateside, this is a largely direct port of the Japanese version, and the game’s original link cable trading function has been disabled. You can pick it up now for $7.99.]]></summary>

But its foundations remain the same: you're a manager with a budget and you've got to turn the fortunes of increasingly prestigious – and in some cases, bonkers – institutions around. Of course, this time you're not dealing with injured mummies and lazy surgeons, you're in charge of running university campuses (campi?) and ensuring they deliver a solid education.
The job of a university president is a pretty relaxed affair, which means you're able to soak in the joys of watching your oddball students grow. But this leniency means it struggles to reward you for constructing a campus that's uniquely yours.

As a kid who grew up with little money, I’ve always loved the fantasy tycoon games realize: the possibility of cashing in on whimsical business schemes like theme parks, restaurants, and aquariums. It’s always been satisfying to start with an empty plot of land and then build the foundation of a business atop it, customizing small details like paint colors, furniture layouts, and walking paths along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like Xbox and PlayStation, Nintendo also suffers from supply issues and component shortages. This might explain why a recent Nikkei report – relayed by Bloomberg's game and tech writer, Takashi Mochizuki (see below) – stated that there wouldn't be new hardware releases this fiscal year. 
Nikkei: there will be no new Nintendo hardware this fiscal year, which ends in March 2023. Not immediately clear whether that part of the article is from Nikkei's own reporting or what Nintendo President, who Nikkei interviewed for the story, said. https://t.co/HJVqk9Kbef

Mochizuki's tweet reads, "There will be no new Nintendo hardware this fiscal year, which ends in March 2023. Not immediately clear whether that part of the article is from Nikkei's own reporting or what Nintendo President, who Nikkei interviewed for the story, said."
For all the Nintendo fans speculating a Switch “Pro” release – sorry, it looks like that’s not happening any time soon. In any case, the Switch recently crossed 111 million units sold, but overall sales are down by 22.9%. Perhaps Nintendo will pivot to hardware announcements after the fiscal year comes to a close.]]></summary>

More specifically, it will hit PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on Nov. 11. Square Enix revealed this heavily rumored (and leaked) remaster today with the first official trailer, and you can check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Tactics Ogre: Reborn now features voice acting, improved visuals, and more. Square Enix says, “Tactics Ogre: Reborn features updated game design, fully-voiced cutscenes, improved graphics, and sound.” Tactics Ogre: Reborn will be available as a physical and digital Standard Edition on PS5, PS4, and Switch and a digital-only Standard Edition on PC. A digital Premium Edition will be available for all platforms the game is coming to later this year. 
The digital Standard Edition includes a selection of three songs from the remaster’s soundtrack as a preorder bonus. The digital Premium Edition contains the entire soundtrack as a preorder bonus and a “Tactics Ogre (1995) Digital Mini Soundtrack.”

From Adventure Time to Game of Thrones, Player First Games' debut title is a wacky fusion of legendary franchises that's left fans enamored with the light-hearted art style and Super Smash-inspired gameplay. Sadly, the rising champ's first season and next playable character, Morty (Rick & Morty), have been pushed back. A finalized release date remains unknown.  
We want to let everyone know that we are delaying the start of Season 1 & the release of Morty to a later date. We know this might be disappointing for some and want to assure our Community that we are dedicated to delivering new and exciting content that delights players. (2/3)
August 4, 2022
Tweets released by the MultiVersus dev team thank players for their continued support and patience while announcing the unexpected news (seen above). You can read the complete statement below:
Season 1 was initially slated to launch on August 9. For now, you'll just have to keep busy kicking Lebron James' butt. John Carson previewed MultiVersus for us and concluded his findings by stating, "I went into the alpha test of MultiVersus with low expectations. Besides Smash Bros., the big brand mash-up fighters feel hollow and feature underwhelming rosters, but I've come away impressed with what I've played so far. The cast is great so far, and each character brings unique gameplay and mechanics to the fray."

The concert, which takes place on August 25, hopes to become the largest concert ever put on at the massive annual gaming convention. 
Several of the vocalists featured in Metal: Hellsinger will be on hand to perform their songs from the soundtrack. Matt Heafy of Trivium, Alissa White-Gluz of Arch Enemy, Mikael Stanne of Dark Tranquility, Dennis Lyxzén of Refused and INVSN, and James Dorton of Black Crown Initiate are all currently scheduled to take the stage. The concert is set to kick off at 7 p.m. Central European Summer Time (1 p.m. Eastern/10 a.m. Pacific). The event is free and open to thousands of in-person attendees, with potentially millions being able to join through a livestream, which will be detailed at a later date. The first 200 people to enter the hall for the concert will receive a bag full of exclusive Metal: Hellsinger merchandise.


Metal: Hellsinger comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 15. If you want to try the game for yourself, a demo is currently available on all three of those platforms. If you'd rather read my hands-on impressions, you can do so here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its first season launch in 2016, I’ve always felt like the Westworld TV series offered an especially compelling commentary on the video game hobby. Like a lot of sci-fi, the show leverages futuristic technology and far-fetched ideas to get its point across. But at its core, it’s still a show about the psychology of people playing a game and how that game is really just about life and the decisions we make that shape that life. Westworld may not borrow from a longstanding video game license. Still, with its incisive and often surprising perspectives, it has emerged as the best show about video games, their potential, and their threat that I’ve ever seen.
SPOILERS follow for the entirety of the Westworld TV series, up to and including current episodes of Season 4.

For me, there have been two such technologies I’ve never really bought into: ultra-high 360Hz monitor refresh rates, and Nvidia Reflex, a kind of setup-wide latency reduction system. Now, having spent some quality time with the MSI Oculux NXG253R – which features both – I’ll cop to being wrong about one of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Throughout 2022's Pokémon Go Fest events in cities like Seattle, Berlin, and Sapporo, Ultra Beasts, wormhole-dwelling creatures introduced in Gen VII's Pokémon Sun and Moon, have appeared for trainers to catch. If you weren't able to attend those events (or the virtual event earlier this year), you've missed out on your opportunity to catch them to this point. However, that changes later this month, as the four Ultra Beasts are set to gather during the Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale event.
The finale is a global event that trainers can enjoy regardless of location. In addition to the Ultra Beasts, participating trainers will encounter other Pokémon they may not usually see in the wild, as well as the Mythical Pokémon Shaymin, who can be obtained by completing special research missions. This also features the conclusion of the story of Professor Willow being sucked into an Ultra Wormhole. The Ultra Beasts available in Pokémon Go through this event include Pheromosa, Nihilego, Buzzwole, and Xurkitree.
Finally, Daily Adventure Incenses have been added to the game. These special incenses can be used once a day and last for 15 minutes. This special daily item can attract Pokémon not typically found in your area and can even pull in Legendary Pokémon. 
Since the game's launch in 2016, Pokémon Go has expanded well beyond the original 151 creatures. As of this writing, you can now catch, train, and battle more than 700 Pokémon throughout your travels. The Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale is set to happen on Saturday, August 27, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo released its latest round of financial results, this time for Quarter 1 of the 2023 Fiscal Year, which accounts for April, May, and June of 2022. In it, the company revealed that the Switch surpassed 111 million units sold but, despite that, overall sales are down. 
In terms of hardware, sales are down 22.9%, with Nintendo citing the ongoing semiconductor shortage as why. Software sales are down too, declining 8.6% this quarter. However, while 8.6% is a sizeable drop, Nintendo still moved 41.41 million units in Q1 FY23. It also revealed its top 10 best-selling Switch games, with many having seen increases since the last round of financial results earlier this year. 
Here are the top 10 best-selling Nintendo Switch games as of June 2022: 
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe: 46.82 million 
Animal Crossing: New Horizons: 39.38 million
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate: 28.82 million
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild: 27.14 million
Pokemon Sword/Pokemon Shield: 24.50 million
Super Mario Odyssey: 23.93 million
Super Mario Party: 18.06 million
Pokemon Brilliant Diamond/Pokemon Shining Pearl: 14.79 million
Pokemon: Let's Go, Pikachu!/Pokemon: Let's Go, Eevee!: 14.66 million
Ring Fit Adventure: 14.54 million
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe had the biggest jump in this list, selling 1.48 million units this quarter. According to Nintendo, new 2022 releases are also selling well. Nintendo Switch Sports sold 4.84 million units, Mario Strikers: Battle League sold 1.91 million, and Kirby and the Forgotten Land sold 1.88 million units, making it the second-best selling Kirby game of all-time.

After that, feast your eyes upon all the new Pokemon from Scarlet and Violet revealed in today's Pokemon Presents showcase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon's cloud-based gaming service, Luna, is the latest addition to the Samsung Gaming Hub, a recently added feature available on all 2022 Samsung smart TV and smart monitor models. Amazon Luna joins an ever-growing list of cloud-gaming services that already include the likes of Google Stadia, Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and more in the Samsung Gaming Hub.
The hub, which was added to all 2022 models in late June, collects your various catalogs of cloud entitlements on one screen with no additional hardware required. That means if you own one game's entitlement on Google Stadia but another's rights on Amazon Luna, you can access them through the same hub without the need for any consoles. Not only that, but you can play these games using any supported Bluetooth controller.
Amazon Luna offers various subscription plans, with the top-tier subscription, Luna+, offering access to triple-A titles from publishers like Sega and Capcom as well as various independent titles. If you're an Amazon Prime subscriber, you can access a rotating collection of titles. This month's offerings include Control: Ultimate Edition, Myst, Steel Assault, and Garfield Kart. You can also add Ubisoft+ to your subscription for an additional cost to play games in franchises like Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs, Ghost Recon, and Far Cry. 
Through the addition of Amazon Luna to the library of cloud-gaming services, Samsung Gaming Hub now offers more than 1,000 games to choose from. I came away impressed from my time with the company's new gaming initiative at Summer Game Fest this year. You can read my full impressions of my experience with the cloud-based gaming feature here.]]></summary>

The Pokémon Company describes the Paldea region as "a land of vast open spaces dotted with lakes, towering peaks, wastelands, and mountain ranges." Players can expect everything from small farming villages to bustling port towns.

After heavy rumors, THQ Nordic is confirmed as the game’s publisher. Moreover, we got a rundown of the game’s modes, a batch of fresh screenshots, as well as the unveiling of the box art. 
AEW: Fight Forever is being developed by Yuke’s and has been billed as an homage to classic, arcade-style wrestling games such as WWF No Mercy (including input from director Hideyuki “Geta” Iwashita). In addition to capturing an old-school feel, the game hopes to emulate AEW's in-ring style with the newly revealed addition of elaborate tandem offense moves for tag team bouts. 
First off, here’s what the box art looks like:

While hardware sales of the base Switch, the OLED model, and the Switch Lite have surpassed 111 million units sold, sales are down nearly 23% overall. 
More specifically, hardware sales for Nintendo are down 22.9% this quarter. Broken up, the base Switch's sales are down 60% in Q1 while Switch Lite sales are down 48.4%. Nintendo did not report OLED model Switch sales, possibly because it groups the OLED model with the base Switch. As for why hardware sales are down this quarter, Nintendo sites the ongoing semiconductor shortage, which affects other hardware makers like Xbox and PlayStation too.

​NBA 2K is still in a rebuilding phase. While it has shown some flash on the court and tantalized with RPG systems in MyCareer, it has a long way to go to reach the championship form we celebrated years ago. Last year's game was a step in the right direction that laid the foundation for a promising future with a more dynamic defensive game, better perimeter play for smaller players, and great depth found in The City and MyTeam. It'll be interesting to see if Visual Concepts can build off of these gains in NBA 2K23 and continue to innovate on the court, and find ways to better integrate the WNBA into its modes. As always, making VC less intrusive is a necessity.
We still don't have insight into any of this year's modes – other than the Jordan Challenge returning with 15 flashback moments from Michael Jordan's career – but we do know what to expect from gameplay. Visual Concepts uses the word "authenticity" to sum up this year's changes, which appear to apply a high level of realism to little interactions between players and how the ball is handled. Here are the key additions and changes you can expect to see on the court when NBA 2K23 launches on September 9:
Easier Play
More Pro for the Pro Stick
Hang on the Rim
Shooting is a Weapon
Killing Stalls with Adrenaline 
Defensive Play
Improved A.I.
Badges Sound More Confusing But Better?

I have a bunch of friends who persisted and now spend their weekends in gyms and car parks, where they skate under 11/10 names like Correctional Felicity and give each other huge bruises. I can't be sure, but from their activity on social media I estimate they spend about 114% of their time being excited about roller derby, which I endorse. Now both they (and people like me, who find wheels frightening), can spend even more free time on roller derby with the annoucenment of 2023's sports management game Roller Drama.

While it wasn’t their first Life Is Strange - the Colorado studio released the spin-off  game Before The Storm in 2017 - it was the first time they were tasked with creating their own world and characters, instead of inheriting Dontnod’s creations. 


Fortunately Deck Nine successfully managed the tightrope walk of honouring the series’ existing DNA, while still taking the Life Is Strange world in new directions. To find out more about how it was done, I sat down with Philip Lawrence and Sarah Van Rompeay, respectively the Senior Narrative Designer and Senior Producer at Square Enix External Studios.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We spotted a rare discount on Lenovo's brand new Legion 5i Pro 16 laptop, and it's a high-end model with a 12th-gen Core i7 processor, RTX 3070 Ti graphics card and a stunning 16-in 2560x1600 165Hz display. Normally this laptop retails for £1500, but thanks to an Ebay code (AUG15) you can take £60 off. This isn't a massive discount, but it's a notable price reduction for a laptop that is literally brand new with the latest-gen tech inside.

What began as a library of just 20 NES games has grown to include dozens more. Plus, Nintendo has since introduced SNES, Nintendo 64, and even Sega Genesis games, giving players a chance to play some fan-favorite classics and some deep cuts, too. It’s hard to predict when new games might arrive as the company has maintained a somewhat inconsistent cadence in doing so, but that’s okay because this list is all you need. 
As Nintendo adds new titles, we’ll be sure to update this list to include them. If you’re looking for something specific, use this story’s Table of Contents to jump to the different consoles quickly. Here’s every NES, SNES, 64, and Genesis game added …]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-08-02T12:11:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Herschel "Guy" Beahm IV, known by most as Dr. Disrespect, helped form a "AAA game studio" with former Call of Duty and Halo developers in December of last year. Dubbed Midnight Society, the studio's first project was slated to be a multiplayer shooter. More details about it have been released, including word that it's a PvPvE extraction shooter. 
Now, Midnight Society's first game has a name – Deadrop – and gameplay footage. This gameplay comes from players who had (very) early access to the title, so it's less of a demo or vertical slice of gameplay and more of a proof of concept. Check it out for yourself in the tweets below from Okami Games. 
Here's another gameplay clip in a different firing range. #DEADROP pic.twitter.com/odT5QHYtFp

One more clip showing the outdoor areas and world design.
@oOStep_Oo for the clips, go give him a follow!#DEADROP pic.twitter.com/5XGN5uPSxx
July 30, 2022
As you can see, the gameplay as it stands today consists of a firing range with a single weapon. You can catch glimpses of the world design, too, and it looks somewhat cyberpunk-y. Only time will tell what the final product will look like, as all signs point to this game being years away from release. 
The reception to the gameplay has been less than great, to say the least. It doesn't help that Beahm tweeted, "I can take a screenshot right now...blows out anything from the [Call of Duty] engine" back in June because this game does not appear to stack up against Call of Duty's visuals. Perhaps it will one day, but that remains to be seen. 
What do you think of Deadrop's gameplay? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

The price drop only applies in a few regions, but means that anyone who pre-ordered the game there might want to cancel theirs and buy it again. Or, you know, just wait until the game’s out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RTX 3080 graphics cards are continuing their inevitable price decline, as at least one new next-gen GPU is rumoured to be announced within the next few months. That means it's a good time to pick up current-gen models at a discount while availability is good - and this RTX 3080 12GB model is the cheapest we've ever seen it. 
Right now, you can pick up this Gainward Phantom RTX 3080 12GB for £724 when you use code AFF25 at the checkout at CCL. If you're not familiar with CCL, the British retailer is a minnow compared to the whale of Amazon, but it's one that has existed since 1996 and has always proved reliable for me.

Today, as part of IGN First coverage, the studio released the first 16 minutes of Gotham Knights gameplay and the focus is exclusively on Batgirl. If you're worried about spoilers, don't fret – there's not much revealed story-wise in this gameplay, but it does feature a look at the first mission as well as some of the in-game mechanics we'll be utilizing to solve mysteries and fight crime. According to the video, this takes place right after the prologue. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


For more about Gotham Knights, be sure to watch this Batgirl-centric trailer and then check out this one detailing some of Robin's moveset. After that, check out Game Informer's exclusive interview with the game's executive producer and director for details about alternate suits, missions, and the Elseworlds-like cooperative play.

However, it wasn't the massive generation-defining game CD Projekt Red (and admittedly, many of us fans) propped it up to be. 
I played it on Xbox Series X at release, and it ran fine enough that I could roll credits thinking I had just completed a fun game that I'm glad I played. However, getting an Xbox Series X or a PlayStation 5 around the time Cyberpunk 2077 was released in 2020 was challenging, and many had to play CDPR's latest RPG on last-gen consoles. You probably already know the story of how that went – it was not a good game to play on last-gen consoles at all.

I can't keep pace with professionals so it's fine if I run long, and today I want to take my time and enjoy the journey. I'm playing Aran's Bike Trip, a visual novel/interactive diary/thingamy where Dutch indie dev Aran Koning (the designer of Stacklands) documents a two-day bike tour with 360° photos. It's a lovely little adventure, taking in sights including an art deco radio station and the tallest waterfall in the Netherlands. The waterfall is... about what you might expect in a notoriously flat country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Logitech have launched the Aurora Collection, a set of bright, customisable PC gaming peripherals built to be “gender inclusive”. Fortunately, that seems to be more than just pastel colours and cynical “For girls” marketing – the G375 headset, G705 mouse, and the G715 and G713 keyboards are all proper gaming-spec accessories, and they’ve been crafted by mostly female design and engineering teams based on feedback from women PC players.


The G705, then, is a wireless mouse designed for smaller hands, while the G375 headset – also wireless – is proportioned to fit smaller heads and has more space in the earcups to accommodate earrings. It’s safe to say I’m not the Aurora Collection’s target audience, but having used the G705, the G375, and the G715 wireless keyboard as my main peripherals for a few days, I can say all three are pretty swish playthings regardless of how you identify. What’s more, their light, soft-cornered aesthetic is a nice break from the blacks, greys and harsh angles that have become standard design language for gaming gear. Anyone who’s ever cringed their face inside out at a peripheral resembling Megatron’s running shoe may indeed find these more to their tastes.

Those words alone are enough to get me interested, but there's a trailer below that shows it in action if you need a little more.

If you're not so lucky, then good news: Valve say they're speeding up production and everyone who has currently ordered one should receive their Steam Deck before the end of the year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Minecraft: Java Edition's latest update introduced a new player reporting tool, which allows players to submit "inappropriate chat messages or dangerous behaviour" for moderators to review. That seems like a good thing on the its face, but many Minecraft players aren't happy that it extends to private servers. 

Naturally, because this is Minecraft, players have changed what they don't like. There are now mods which strip messages of information tieing them to your player profile.

I've had a cracking gaming year, and I thinnnk that's down to lots of new games? Maybe? This type of question has always brushed over the fact that people play games for years and start 'old' games all the time, and maybe it's less useful than ever now every other game is a live service. But I've had a good gaming year, and that's what matters. So what are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the age of years-long development cycles, it seems miraculous that Wolfenstein 3D, a game that spawned the modern-day FPS as we know it, was developed by six people in just six months. The story of Wolfenstein 3D’s development makes for a fascinating time capsule of those early days of game development - a milestone in gaming history that underlines just how much the industry has grown over the decades since.
But that’s getting ahead of ourselves a bit. The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.

A grubby game with fuzzy deductive puzzles as you rule out the many possible causes of similar symptoms. As far as I can find, no such game exists. But I did see two upcoming games with similar names: Bicycle Mechanic Simulator and Bike Mechanic Simulator 2023. Alas, I fear they might be PlayWay-style sims where you just click stuff in order then it all works tickety-boo. That is not the bike repair I know and begrudgingly enjoy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During last year’s Game Awards, Falcon Age developers Outerloop announced Thirsty Suitors, a stylish story-driven RPG about battling your exes and disappointing your parents. Since then, the team have been keeping game details under wraps, but now thanks to the Annapurna Interactive showcase, Outerloop have released a free Steam demo, meaning now we can all have a go at beating the pulp out of our exes - a dream come true. 
You play as Jala, a young woman who just got booted out of her shared apartment after having a fight with her, now, ex-partner. With nowhere else to go, she’s decided to take the bus back to her hometown of Timber Hills to move back in with her parents (hopefully, temporarily). While she's killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life. Is she really a lost cause in love?

And now I've returned to the open beta phase of the multiverse where Bugs Bunny and Taz The Tazmanian Devil are joined by... Lebron James?! Honestly, my thoughts remain largely unchanged – which is a good thing! It's a fun free-to-play fighter that iterates on the Smash formula but can't quite emulate its predecessor's polish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a set of Unreal assets that Alice of Bees once described as "angry playmobil". I've wanted to quote that for years but had yet to play a game using them that grabbed me enough to warrant an article. Let us be thankful, then, for ADACA, an angry playmobil FPS.
It's actually two games, and I'm not sure which to call the main event. I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who's inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you're swarmed by creepy mutants. It was good enough to tempt me this week, despite a few minor niggles, but its other half, Zone Patrol, is a Stalker-esque sandbox where it really shines.

But what other games from the year of our Horace deserve to be preserved and saved above everything else? Find out which games made the cut below.

Was it a secret area? An unfinished area? A hoax? Viral marketing? A mod? If it was a mod, it was far more complex than any so far. Turns out, that's because a group of fans have secretly been making their own mod tools, and plan to release them soon. In the meantime, I've enjoyed pranksters memeing on the mystery by creating secret churches in other games, including Half-Life 2 and Super Mario 64.
