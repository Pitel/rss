The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has been out for less than month and it seems speedrunners are already improving drastically improving their times.
Following a story about one individual completing the game in just 94 minutes on release, Speedrunner 'Zdi' has now managed to beat the sequel to Breath of the Wild (in an "Any%" run on Version 1.1.1) in just 59 minutes and 22 seconds. Apparently, it's a whole three minutes faster than the previous world record holder and again, less than one hour!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back from the dead.
One of the unfortunate casualties of the end of DS and 3DS eras was the death of games that were uniquely suited to the quirky dual-screened devices. The Etrian Odyssey series, the first three games of which are represented in the new Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection (also available separately) was a good example of this bespoke design, as you were presented with dungeon-crawling RPG adventures that required you to actively make maps using their stylus on the touch screen. So, how do these games play now on the Switch, a console that they clearly were designed made for? Pretty well, believe it or not! Though we would have liked Atlus to give these games a little more love for this re-release, all three games in the Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection hold up quite well today.
In a rare subversion of typical RPG tropes, the story in each of these games is something that mostly takes a backseat. None of your characters individually ‘exist’ in the plot because each of them is custom-made and named by you, so the narratives mostly deal with broad ideas that could fit any party and character type. For example, the second game is about a legendary treasure held within a flying sky castle that can only be reached by entering the Yggdrasil labyrinth, while the third game is about a highly advanced city that sank into the ocean which can also only be accessed by delving into another maze. These games hardly feature dynamic plots packed with all kinds of twists and interesting characters, just basic premises and a whole lot of dungeon-crawling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Plus a Trek to Yomi
The PlayStation Plus monthly game lineup for June 2023 is out, and it's got a strange mix of titles. Sports fans, archaeologists, and sword aficionados will all have something to look forward to in June, at the least.
For June 2023 PlayStation Plus is getting NBA 2K23, the most recent entry in the basketball series, for PlayStation 4 and PS5. Reviews on this particular entry seem medium-warm, though I'll admit, I haven't played some virtual hoops in quite a while. My go-to is NBA Street, personally. But if you want to play the modern-day, professional basketball, this a cheap way to try it out.
Otherwise, if you're a bit more keen on dinosaurs, Jurassic World Evolution 2 is also on this month's docket. These dinos (probably) can't play basketball, but they can cause havoc for you and your parkgoers. Ever think you could run Jurassic Park and have it not turn into a terrifying mess? Well, this is your shot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g76Zx7zydXQ
If you just want a cinematically inclined, action-driven story about a swordsman, Trek to Yomi can cover that. Following Hiroki, a blademaster who fails in his vow to protect the people he cares for, you can expect a lot of slicing and dicing in this 2D action-adventure game.
Of course, a new month means we see some old games depart. If they look appealing, make sure to get them before they're gone. Here's everything coming and going on the PlayStation Plus monthly lineup in June 2023. You've got until June 6 to lock them onto your account.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dillon rolls into the sunset
Vanpool Inc. is closing its doors. The Japanese studio, known for both its support work on Nintendo games as well as its own games, such as Dillon's Rolling Western, has announced it is shutting down.
The news was posted on the studio's official site, saying the team has decided to disband. No overt reason was given, but the studio does express gratitude for its fans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNUer6t0bl4
Vanpool was one of the studios started by former Love-de-Lic developers, alongside studios like Punchline (Chulip, Rule of Rose) and Skip Ltd. (Chibi-Robo!, LOL).
Back in 2001, Vanpool released its first game with Endonesia on the PS2. From there on, it made some fun, unique games; Dillon's Rolling Western, for one. And there's also the bizarre, memorable Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland.
A slight tingle
Alongside its own games, Vanpool also supported several Nintendo titles. The Kirby series (including Forgotten Land and the recently released Return to Dream Land Deluxe) dots Vanpool's resume. The studio also contributed to Paper Mario: Sticker Star and Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash.
It's a shame to see a studio like this go. It's hard not to think of Alphadream, or the curiously quiet Skip Ltd. mentioned before, too. These studios, and their history, represent a different kind of games than we usually see. And it's a team that played a role in Nintendo's recent success with Kirby, too.
Hopefully, everyone involved lands somewhere new.

“We actually get this question kind of a lot – people ask us if the rating went up because [we] wanted to make a more violent game, and the answer to that is no,” producer Naoki Yoshida says. “On the outside, it doesn’t appear [the rating system] has changed.

Diablo 4 will be here real soon: in nearly 24 hours, actually!  When that zero hour actually hits, who knows what's going to happen?
There was a server slam stress test held on the weekend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's release that supposedly went well, but you can't plan for everything. You can, however, plan to a point, and Blizzard has apparently done just that. Speaking to GamesRadar, Blizzard General Manager Rod Fergusson said the following about the publisher's prep work for Diablo 4's launch:
"We learned a lot from each of them [the previous D4 tests]. We're feeling better, like we feel good about that, like all the stuff that we've learned."
"We've done the work, and we've done a lot of testing, and so we're prepared. But you know, never say never. It might be a little bumpy on the first day, but our hopes are that, like we did on those weekends, we learn and adapt."

It's going to be hard to top Diablo 3's launch woes
If you're planning on taking a few days off of work to play Diablo 4, just note that "it might be a little bumpy on the first day" seems like a realistic vibe, even from a very optimistic company spokesperson. In any case, it's going to be extremely difficult to top the rocky launch of Diablo 3.
When Fergusson directly refers to Diablo 4's testing in the interview, it's clear that Blizard has learned quite a bit from Diablo 3's development. We haven't seen the full extent of Diablo 4's microtransaction monetization in 1.0, but there are likely lessons learned from Diablo Immortal there, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finally, a justification for all that plastic
Today, Nintendo finally unveiled some more details for the upcoming September 1-4 "Nintendo Live" expo in Seattle, Washington: and there's a crazy curio buried in that memo. While the customary competitive events for Smash, Mario Kart 8, and Splatoon 3 will commence as normal, an amiibo tournament is also happening.
Here's the full schedule of all of the events being held at Nintendo Live
Gaming tournaments:
Sept. 1: On the first day of Nintendo Live 2023, the Super Smash Bros. Squad Strike tournament will be open for fans ages 13+ who want to show off their versatile skills in the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate game.
Sept. 2: The Mario Kart 8 Deluxe 2023 Championships will be held on Sept. 2, with an on-site last-chance qualifier for those looking to race their way onto the big stage.
Sept. 3: On Sept. 3, the spotlight will be on the next generation of fighters with the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate amiibo+me Exhibition 2023. Attendees 10-16 years of age can train up their amiibo fighters and take on other entrants and their amiibo fighters to see who will win.
Sept. 4: Closing out the event is the Splatoon 3 2023 Championships, featuring the top qualifying teams from the upcoming Splatoon 3 Championship Qualifiers 2023 coming up June 3-4 and June 10-11.
Note the curious addition of "Super Smash Bros. Ultimate amiibo+me Exhibition 2023" According to the brief description of the event, attendees "10-16 years of age" will train figures to fight in CPU matches. It's a fascinating feature that should have been pushed a bit more at launch, especially since every single Smash line amiibo works with it.
You can find all of the latest info on Nintendo Live here. You have until June 22, 2023 to register.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA['Tune in for the final Monster Hunter Rise: #Sunbreak Digital Event on June 7, 7am PDT/15:00 BST!'
Monster Hunter Rise has enjoyed an extraordinary lifecycle. Following up on Monster Hunter World helped boost its cachet quite a bit, but it earned all of its success since its original release (which includes being a top 5 all-time Capcom best-seller) in March of 2021. Since then it's expanded to PC, hosted a full-on expansion in Sunbreak, and eventually came out on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. It's ubiquitous, and it's been in the headlines consistently since its debut.
But unless there's another expansion announcement at some point, we're nearing the end of Rise's reign. Capcom has announced the date/time for the "final" Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak digital event.
https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1663832692876804096
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak final stream date/time/info/where to watch
While the upcoming "bonus update" isn't as sizable as prior content patches, Capcom is calling this the "final digital event" for Sunbreak, and will contain a "bevy of info on the bonus update version .16, as well as some dev interviews." It's likely that there will be some info on subsequent update timing on Sony/Microsoft platforms. The exact time of the Sunbreak stream is 7:00AM PT on June 7, 2023. You can catch it here on the official Monster Hunter Twitch channel.
The stream will be hosted by the following franchise heavy-hitters:
Series Producer: Ryozo Tsujimot
Director: Yasunori Ichinose 
Director: Yoshitake Suzuki

Mattel and Milestone have announced that we’re getting the follow-up we’ve all been waiting for: Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged. Better yet, we’ve got a trailer and a release date set for October 19, 2023.
https://youtu.be/46dYAG-mqXg
A CG trailer? For a racing game? Why even do that? We understand the concept of cars and driving.
Oh well, at least they provided a press kit. Let’s check out these screenshots.
[caption id="attachment_383082" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Milestone[/caption]
That’s not anything. That’s a car. What did I just say?
I really enjoyed Hot Wheels Unleashed when I reviewed it back in 2021. I didn’t expect a sequel so soon, so I’m glad I don’t have to wait long to get my hands on it. Even though the trailer and screenshots show us nothing, they do seem to demonstrate some concepts the new game will go for.
To start with, there will be bikes. There also seems to be a sort of mid-air jump mechanic. It looks like there’s going to be off-roading, as well. My favorite part of any toy car game is driving through a big world, so I’m actually liking what I’m seeing. I guess I’ll have to wait to see if the actual gameplay reflects this.
We do know that the track editor is back, there will be over 130 cars to unlock and choose from, and the main campaign will be story-driven. Sounds weird. I’m in.
We don’t have to wait too long, as Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged is set to launch on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Switch October 19, 2023.

The pre-load is now live for Capcom's stellar sequel Street Fighter 6 — But if you're thinking of picking up the new scrapper on PC, and want to be sure that your rig is up to snuff, then a new benchmark tool is now available, offering an analysis of your PC component's ahead of Friday's launch.
Once downloaded, (from right here), the tool performs a Shader Warming process, before running a typical one-on-one matchup, taking a wander around the Battle Hub, and exploring a little bit of World Tour. At the end of the demo, your PC is graded out of 100 on its ability to run the new fighter at varying settings levels. If you so wish, you can fine-tune the settings and then run the tool again.

It should also be noted that there is a demo already available on Steam, which will give you an equally good impression of how to set your PC for Street Fighter 6. Both of these options should provide you with a relatively accurate estimation of the optimal settings for your rig. Oh, and the Benchmark Took is also a surprisingly meaty 15 GB, so bear that in mind before you suck up that precious bandwidth.
Street Fighter 6 launches June 2 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. You can check out our newly released review right here.

Telltale has announced that 2008's certified classic adventure game Strong Bad’s Cool Game for Attractive People is facing imminent delisting. It’s now or never if you want to own one of the most impactful and significant masterpieces in human existence.
In a heart-rending press release, Telltale states, “Unfortunately, we can no longer support Strong Bad’s Cool Game for Attractive People. We no longer have the rights to the IP, and so we can no longer sell or support the game series.”
Oh man, the press release is, like, two non-paragraphs long, so I’ll just give you the rest. “So, whether you’ve had a dance party with The Cheat or you poked fun at Homestar Runner, you can still download all your episodes from the PC digital storefronts where you bought the game.”

Valve likes to make up for games that never come out by just releasing other games that nobody even knew were in the making. That's the story of Aperture Desk Job, a small but hilarious experience meant to introduce people to the then-new Steam Deck.

I did an escape room once as an after-work company activity. I didn’t do too badly, but I wouldn’t say I was great. At least I wasn’t like the guy who was such a poor team player that he was fired, like, the last week. What I’m saying is don’t go to an escape room with your employer. It might actually reflect on your job performance.
Playing escape room video games is a lot safer. You (probably) won’t be fired if you do poorly.
Thankfully, there are a few of those. Last year, I played Madison and Escape Academy. But you know what neither of those had? Horror. Oh, no, wait. Madison was a horror game.
Anyway, here’s The Tartarus Key.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you woke up in a mysterious mansion, with no memory of how you got there and only a walkie-talkie and a bunch of security cameras for company, how d'you reckon you'd handle it? Personally I know, sure as eggs is eggs, that I would absolutely go to pieces. I'm not hitting the end credits of The Tartarus Key in real life, but fortunately, it's a nails thriller puzzle game that fuses PS1-style retro graphics with Saw-esque murder traps. Plus, you know, it's only about six hours end to end, which isn't bad for a semi-magical kidnap plot.
In this situation I am not me, of course, but Alex Young, and Alex upon escaping a locked study (an easy warm-up puzzle involving postcards) she finds and frees Torres, an ex-cop turned private detective, who sets up a base of operations around the mysterious mansions main fireplace. From there game's rhythm is clearing the different wings of the house by completing increasingly difficult puzzle rooms, each eventually culminating in finding a new person to save from a new death trap - concocting the antidote for poison or following the instructions to get through an electrocuted floor maze.
It's an odd group, but if you rescue everyone you start to see the edges of a wider story. There's a nice layering of paranoia, because most of the puzzles have an element of, for want of a better word, magic to them. One of the very first sees you tasked with getting an academic out of a living flesh-blob, and failure results in it and him vanishing into nowhere. You also find an underground lab with notes on scientific experiments, and a holding cell slash testing chamber - but given that next door is a giant meat freezer sokoban, is it not the case that the lab is just another puzzle room set? The low-poly, low-draw distance style of everything really adds to this, and you keep suspecting that some new puzzle or trap or maybe a weird murderer is going to suddenly loom out of the darkness in front of you. It's the kind of head melting I haven't had since playing Old Gods Rising.

Yeah, sure the Aardman films are whimsical and fun, but have you seen those early Wallace and Gromit shorts? There’s something kind of unsettling about the odd shape of Wallace’s uneven head and I've always deeply hated that you can sometimes see the subtle lines of a thumb imprint on parts of his face, like he’s been smothered inbetween the pads of two giant fingers. It’s so uncomfortable - and don’t even get me started on that monster Morph.
Ever since I first spotted the creepy Twitter gifs of claymation game Elation For The Wonder Box 6000, I’ve felt that same discomfort in the pit of my stomach. It’s not out yet, or even has a confirmed release date, but I just need people to witness this game. Like, just clicking through the screenshots make the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. It’s awful, and wonderful. You can watch the trailer below. The bit where the lumps of clay wriggle inside the gun's bullet chambers goes through me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my absolute favourite elements of Citizen Sleeper is how you essentially play as a nobody. When we first meet the Sleeper they've had their memories completely erased; the last thing they remember is stuffing themselves into a cargo container and shooting off into the depths of space - a last resort in wanting to escape the clutches of a scary corporation. They now find themselves on a dishevelled space station called Erlin's Eye, desperate and alone. They're essentially an empty shell, and one which you can etch your own story onto.
But it’s not their lack of personal identity that makes the Sleeper a nobody (after all, you essentially forge an identity for them as you make decisions throughout the game). It’s the realisation that, in this vast universe that developer Gareth Damian Martin has written, you’re no one. A single grain of sand in a vast desert. No one knows who you are, no one cares about you, and you’re stuck on a lawless space station, helpless, scared, and dying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix and Final Fantasy XVI developer Creative Business Unit III have been open about the game spanning decades of protagonist Clive Rosfield’s life for years. It’s an interesting aspect of this story because it speaks to how broad its horizons might be. What starts as a revenge story will grow into one of war, its effects on people, and ultimately, Valisthea’s place in a fight between Eikons, Dominants, and more over crystals. 
It also means we’ll be seeing a lot of Clive’s life. During my cover story trip, I played a few of FFXVI’s opening hours, much of which took place in the past, when Clive is just 15 and his younger brother Joshua even younger. I learned a lot about their relationship with each other as well as with their parents, and more I won’t spoil here. But I also flashe…]]></summary>

The third entry follows a similar formula to the previous ones, asking you to help vehicles cross gaps from one side of the map to the other, all while constructing normal bridges, loop-de-loop bridges, drawbridges, and bridges that break everything I thought I knew about physics. All sorts of bridges; it’s in the name.

        <updated>2023-05-31T15:02:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a licensed racing game, 2021’s Hot Wheels Unleashed was a fun and respectable debut, and now we’ll get to see how developer Milestone builds on that foundation with an upcoming sequel. 
Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged arrives on October 19 and retains the fun “little toy car in a big world” presentation with new additions under the hood. Players can now get behind the wheel of motorcycles and ATVs, and the game has over 130 vehicles total at launch.
Players race across five diverse environments using new skills: double jumping and lateral dashing. The double jump can be performed at any time to leap over rivals and obstacles, while dashing is great for sideswiping nearby opponents or dodging hazards. Milestone touts increased interactivity between vehicles and objects on and off the track, and playstyles can be customized using perks earned by earning skill points. 


Modes include a revamped story-driven campaign starring four original characters, complete with animated cutscenes. Other challenges include events designed to test players’ skills such as drifting and evading crashes. For online multiplayer, the game supports cross-play (except on Switch), and players can now create friend parties. Local two-player splitscreen also makes a return. 
The popular creation suite from the first game now features a refined Track Editor with expanded features and a Livery Editor update introducing the Sticker Editor to create and save custom patterns and shapes. Best of all, all user-generated content will be sharable cross-platform at launch, though it's unclear if any player-made content from the original can be imported into this game. 
Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Check out some of the sequel's cars in the screenshot gallery below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s get to know each other, over and over again.
There are plenty of roguelike games on Nintendo Switch, but Loop8: Summer of Gods takes an interesting twist to the formula: a classic turn-based Japanese RPG that has roguelike elements. More specifically, the game is similar to something like Persona. However, Loop8 implements neither Persona’s excellent school-life pacing nor the fun “just one more run” feeling of games like Hades or Neon White. What results is a long-winded and repetitive adventure that makes you want to put the controller down and walk away.
Loop8 starts off with an incredibly enticing premise. The main character, Nini, crashes into 1983 Ashihara after his space station gets destroyed by demons called Kegai. He also has an ability called Demon Sight that allows him to reset the timeline every time he fails to stop the Kegai from destroying Ashihara. Nini continuously repeats the month of August until he can put an end to the Kegai once and for all.

As if our knuckles weren't already red 'n' raw from the past two years of street-scrollin' smackers, Modus Games has announced that grandaddy brawler Double Dragon will be making its grand return in July, in the form of the previously announced Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons.
Developed by studio Secret Base, Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons offers a new twist on the classic side-scrolling franchise, incorporating a permanent tag-team mechanic, a roster of new and returning heroes and villains, and even challenging roguelike elements. Billy Lee, Jimmy Lee, Marian and others will once again be doling out vigilante justice to the warriors of the night. Cleaning out the New York City of 199x as only they know how: At the business end of a back elbow > headbutt combo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c0ff_uZQrY
Sporting a dynamic mission function, Double Dragon Gaiden will task the player with clearing out multiple sectors of the city, taking down gang bosses, and leveling up their squad of scrappers. Earn cash through extended combos and successive battles, before spending those hard-fought gains on upgrades and power-ups for your team. And should you fall in battle, simply regroup, restrategize, and return to the fight, a little stronger, a little wiser, and a little more determined.
It's interesting to see Secret Base adapt the Double Dragon formula in a semi-roguelike capacity, offering new twists on one of the beat-'em-up genre's pioneer titles. And we won't have to wait all that long to find out how well these interesting mechanics synergize. Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons launching July 27 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Oh yeah, we’ve got the System Shock IP,” said the insurance company. “What do you want to do with it? Do you want to make a sequel?”


It’s a question you could imagine being posed to Ken Levine, or Warren Spector, or several other notable designers who could reasonably lay claim to the legacy of Looking Glass and Irrational’s legendary immersive sims. Instead, it was asked of Stephen Kick - at the time, a recently unemployed videogame artist holidaying in a Guatemalan hostel. Up until that point, Kick had dedicated his life to creative pursuits. He had no business background, and none of the acumen required to understand contracts or negotiate licensing fees. More to the point, he had no more than $5,000 to his name. Hardly the foundation for a follow-up to two of the most acclaimed PC games of all time.

As a snappy little After Eight to the main course of Jeremy Peel’s review and OG System Shock oral history (both great, do go read those first), here’s a look at how the 2023 remake’s visuals compare to the trailblazing immsim’s previous iterations. In other words, the 2015 System Shock: Enhanced Edition, also by Nightdive, and the original. Well, System Shock Classic, which is basically the original except it runs on my PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a curious job opening at MachineGames
For all you B.J. Blazkowicz fans out there, it's possible that Wolfenstein 3 could currently be in development. While Cyberpilot and Youngblood came out in 2019, the last mainline entry in the revitalized series was back in 2017. Since then, many of you have wanted to see more exploits from the Nazi-killing protagonist.
The existence of a new job opening comes from Reddit user Hard2DaC0re, who points to a new vacancy posted by developer MachineGames. The studio has been responsible for the modern wave of Wolfenstein games, so the fact that the company is advertising a new position suggests something is on the horizon (indeed, the MachineGames website shows a number of job openings). The senior animator listing specifically states that applicants must be familiar with the developer's prior releases.
Is B.J. back?
https://youtu.be/bkrwUzWeACg
It's still early days to say for certain if Wolfenstein is poised for an immediate comeback. At the time of writing, there's been no confirmation from official parties about whether Wolfenstein 3 is currently in the works. We already know that MachineGames is making an Indiana Jones game. These new positions could be related to that project. But it's really just a matter of when in terms of Wolfenstein's triumphant return.
While 2019's Youngblood wasn't as well received, it was still a welcome continuation of the rebooted series. Plus, it's nice to see id Software's iconic FPS franchise is still finding a home in the modern gaming world. Things have certainly changed a lot over the decades, but it seems what hasn't changed is people's desire to take on the Third Reich.
Just to reiterate, the rumors about a new Wolfenstein game being in development are just that. For now, it's best to hold off any excitement, but hopefully, there'll be some official news to gorge on at some point.

Konami has confirmed that Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima will not be involved with the development of upcoming remake Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater — The publisher clarified the situation in a recent interview with IGN, confirming what many fans had already assumed.
"They are not involved," a Konami spokesperson noted. "However, the development team will work hard to create this remake and also the ports (for Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection) so that they can be enjoyed on multiple platforms by even more players all around the world."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YDauj2Ayog
Metal Gear Solid Delta, a full remake of the acclaimed 2004 sequel Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, will be handled by Konami's own in-house developers, led by Singapore-based studio Virtuos Games — which has worked on franchises including Uncharted, Call of Duty, Horizon, and Dark Souls. Konami is confident that the team can produce a Metal Gear Solid title with the authenticity of quality expected by the fanbase. Konami notes that players can expect a "faithful remake" of the fan-favorite PS2 release.
Despite creating the series back in 1987, Hideo Kojima effectively cut ties with the Metal Gear series upon departing Konami in 2015. Kojima's Studio, Kojima Productions, is currently hard at work on the sequel to its 2019 post-apocalyptic adventure, Death Stranding.
Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

Cyberpunk 2077 game director and The Witcher 3 co-game director Mateusz Kanik has co-founded Blank. with Jędrzej Mróz and Marcin Jefimow, both former executive producers on The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. Together, this new studio aims to apply "their years of experience to a clean slate" and bring "beautifully crafted games and unique experiences to players, favoring novel territory rather than well-trodden ground." A press release from Blank. says the studio has no plans to make "clones, or predictable entries."

Team17 has announced that they will be publishing Absolutely Games’ World War II title, Classified: France ‘44, sometime in ‘23. The turn-based strategy game is targeting PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.
Oh, crap. It’s just a teaser.
We get to see some Nazis get killed up in different ways, which is always fun, but no actual gameplay.

Let’s see here. There’s a press kit. It looks like an Unreal 3 Engine game. That might be why they chose to go with CG over in-engine stuff.
Aesthetics aside, WWII is a great setting for squad tactics. Killing Nazis never gets old, and when WWII gets strategic, it’s usually in the form of some grand strategy game. Which are enjoyable, don’t get me wrong. I guess Classified: France ‘44 got my attention because I’m pining for …]]></summary>

It looks like the trend of wild and fun Devolver Digital live streams will continue this year. Devolver announced via their website that we can expect their annual presentation as part of the Summer Game Fest this year. The stream will start on June 8 at 3PM Pacific Time. It looks as though the presentation will revolve around "the world's favorite video game mascot" Volvy as his original creator Ronathan Trodfield once again reveals to us the future of video games.
https://youtu.be/j10ydQAy7OM
Always a fun stream with plenty of new game announcements
As with every annual event, we can expect some new game announcements, playable demos, and some wild surprises.
Last year we got a look at a handful of new titles including roguelite action game Cult of the Lamb which just got its big "Relics of the Old Faith" update last month.
Interestingly, some of the titles from last year's show haven't actually come out. We just saw the 2D and 3D combo adventure game The Plucky Squire as part of the PlayStation Showcase last week. Anger Foot and Skate Story still have a release date of 2023 so it's possible we'll get an update on their progress and maybe even an actual release date.
Despite the promise of its return, E3 2023 was officially canceled in both physical and digital format earlier this year. Even without E3, the trend of summer game announcements and showcases will continue. The Summer Games Fest will begin on June 8 at Noon Pacific Time. Microsoft will host their Xbox Games Showcase and Starfield Direct just three days later on June 11 at 10AM Pacific Time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2021's Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City blended together the stories of the first Resident Evil game and its sequel, Resident Evil 2 (which received a fantastic remake in 2019), and while it wasn't a complete knockout hit, some have been asking for a sequel. It seems one might be on the way. 
According to a new report on Sudbury.com, a news organization that covers the Greater Sudbury area in Canada, which is where Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City was filmed, Sudbury is receiving an $11 million injection from the provincial government, as reported by PCGamesN. This government is funding 20 local projects through the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation and while a sequel to Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City hasn't officially been named as one of those 20 projects, there is one called "Umbrella Chronicles," and it's receiving $2 million. 
If you're familiar with the Resident Evil series, you know "Umbrella Chronicles" is likely a nod to The Umbrella Chronicles spinoff game. Add in that the film company behind "Umbrella Chronicles" is Raccoon HG Film Productions, the same company behind Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City, and the picture gets a little clearer: we might be getting a sequel. 
It's important to note this isn't an official confirmation of a sequel. Perhaps Raccoon HG Film Productions is making a different Resident Evil movie unattached to Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, watch our interview with two of the 2021 film's stars and then check out this featurette from Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City with some behind-the-scenes details.

By which, we mean that they stole copies of Tears of the Kingdom and have subsequently paid the price. Plonkers.

The open-world fantasy of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom would lend itself nicely to some tabletop RPG action in the real world, wouldn't you say? With this exact combination in mind, Nintendo has teamed up with tabletop YouTube channel-turned-multiplatform entertainment company Critical Role to create a special one-shot story set in Tears of the Kingdom's Hyrule.
The special features an original story scenario and characters, all drawn from Tears of the Kingdom's world, with none other than Ganondorf voice actor Matt Mercer as game master. It aired yesterday on the Critical Role Twitch and YouTube channels, but have no fear if you missed out because the full video will be available to watch from 1st June at 12pm PT / 8pm BST on YouTube.

But unlike those games, you’ll climb the wrestling ladder from fresh-faced rookie to world champ - instead of the usual RPG trope where you go from a village’s rat-killer to the universe’s god-killer.

[Update: A new update from Mega Cat Studios states that WrestleQuest will now launch August 8 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and (newly announced) iOS and Android platforms.]
Skybound Games and developer Mega Cat Studios has announced that the colorful pro-wrestling RPG WrestleQuest will no longer meet its May release window and will now step into the ring sometime this summer.
In a shoot-worked promo posted to Twitter, Mega Cat Studios spoke of its excitement with the title so far, but notes that a recently secured "partnership" has forced the studio to push back the title's launch. This seems to suggest that the delay is a positive one, and will allow the studio to implement whatever benefits the new partnership has allowed for. Mega Cat notes that it expects to announce a new release before May is done and dusted.
https://twitter.com/megacatstudios/status/1658095888227770370?s=20
"While we are disappointed that we couldn’t share the entirety of WrestleQuest with you sooner like we hoped," concludes the studio, "we firmly believe this is the right choice with respect to our players and the sweat, sweat, and more sweat we have poured into building the best game we have ever made. We can’t wait to get your hands on it!"
WrestleQuest, as we have previously reported, combines the wild spectacle of golden age wrestling with the stat-based strategy of turn-based RPGs. Players will guide custom superstars through the territory system of the 1980s, aided or hindered by a roster of over 30 real-world wrestlers including “Macho Man” Randy Savage, Koko B. Ware, Jake “The Snake” Roberts, The Road Warriors, Sgt. Slaughter, and Andre the Giant. Jeff Jarrett is also in the mix, because he can't stay out of fucking anything.
WrestleQuest is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tune in for updates on the Like a Dragon series
Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is ready to share more info on its upcoming slate of games. The Like a Dragon developer has announced it will be hosting a new studio show, the RGG Summit Summer 2023, on June 15.
The show will go live at 8 p.m. PT / 11 p.m. ET on June 15, on both the Sega YouTube and Twitch channels. No word yet on how long the stream will be.
https://twitter.com/RGGStudio/status/1662792394733961217
As for what they'll have in store, it sounds like a few updates. Via a press release, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio plans on sharing updates about upcoming titles, as well as community efforts and developer discussions.
The future of Like a Dragon
We already have some inkling of what's in store for the Like a Dragon series, or Yakuza as those in the west previously knew it. Last year, RGG Studio confirmed that Like a Dragon 8 is in development, with a 2024 target. Both Kazuma Kiryu and Ichiban Kasuga are set to play leading roles in the game, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJhqN7R_oAg
Meanwhile, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name looks to be a side-story telling the story of what happened to Kiryu in-between the past games and new. While he made an appearance in Yakuza: Like a Dragon (Like a Dragon 7), there are still some gaps to fill between the end of the sixth game and the upcoming eighth entry. It's currently aiming for a 2023 launch, too.
We also got the remaster of Like a Dragon: Ishin! earlier this year, a solid historical brawler that finally brought the tale to the west. There's certainly some games for RGG to show off at this showcase, amid all the hubbub of June's gaming news. We'll see what RGG is planning for the future on June 15.

That’s because it’s Logan Hannan, the voice of Hugo de Rune from Asobo Studio’s A Plague Tale series. 
Naturally, the voices Hannan uses between Joshua and Hugo are different but there’s a young familiarity to it and it turns out, it was actually his performance as the latter that landed him the role of the former, according to FFXVI localization director Michael-Christopher Koji Fox. 
Koji says the auditions for Joshua’s voice were some of the first to happen. The team chose an actor that was very close to puberty, he says, but at the time, it seemed like it’d work out just fine. In some instances within ga…]]></summary>

"Nothing has changed on our end," Kiciński said. "I can repeat what we’ve been saying throughout the years: CD Projekt is not for sale. We want to remain independent; we have–I believe–an excellent strategy. For sure it’s not easy to execute, but it’s very exciting to follow our own p…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now with more fur
A Steam page has gone live for Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, and it contains a lot of information on the port. For one thing, it’s coming July 26, which (checks watch) is pretty soon.
Originally released in 2021, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is the continued version of the eponymous Lombax and his robot companion. I didn’t play it, but Destructoid’s resident fancypants Chris Carter gave it a pretty glowing review. I didn’t own a PS5 at the time, but since getting one, it’s been on my list to circle back to it. I just haven’t yet. I really just want to play as that lady-Lombax. She seems really cool.
https://youtu.be/i_jZ3BV6Adc
Maybe I will get around to it now that it’s coming to PC. The port boasts “ultra-wide support for 21:9, 32:9, and 48:9 (triple monitor support) resolutions!” for those of you with more desk space than I do. However, I have a pretty classy graphics card, so I’ll be able to benefit from unlocked frame rates, ray-traced reflections, and shadows in exteriors.
On top of that, there are some fancy image and performance options like “NVIDIA DLSS 3, AMD FSR 2, Intel XeSS and Insomniac Games’ Temporal Injection. NVIDIA Reflex and image quality-enhancing NVIDIA DLAA are also supported.” Plus, it supports the features of the DualSense controller.
That’s it, that’s what I’ve got for you. You can double-check the Steam page right here yourself. It's also headed to the Epic Games Store, and those who pre-purchases can get early access to the Pixelizer weapon and Carbonox armor (which are also achievable in-game).
Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is currently available on PS5, but you can get it on PC starting July 26, 2023.

In case you haven't heard, there's going to be a Lord of the Rings Magic: The Gathering set out this summer. While the art shown off so far has been marvelous, it turns out that the team over at Wizards of the Coast has a lot more going for it than cool art. We spoke to Ovidio Cartagena, lead art director on the set, about what to expect. Spoiler alert: Wizards is going big on this set.
What's the deal with the Lord of the Rings set? A recap
Beyond the obvious reason of "money," Cartagena likens the Lord of the Rings set as a natural fit for Magic: The Gathering because of its commitment to "Universes Beyond," which have crossed over with franchises like Transformers, Warhammer 40K, as well as Secret Lair drops like The Walking Dead, Fortnite, and Street Fi…]]></summary>

Many complain about the Souls series being the hardest games of all time, and most of that implied difficulty comes from its boss battles. But obviously, this series didn't really invent the concept of impossible bosses. In fact, one thing the series deserves a lot of praise for is for coming up with bosses that put up a tough challenge, but a fair one.
Below is a list of some in-game bosses that are so unfair that they make most of the Dark Souls roster feel like a walk in the park.

Much like me, Hyrule has always been bad with money. It's hardly surprising. In an economy where you can find cold, hard cash in rocks, trees, bushes, pots, grass, and even sometimes just lying on the floor, you don't have to be a financial expert to know that you're going to experience inflation at some point.

I don't think it's ruining any surprise to tell you that it's one of those games with horrible, horrible mannequins which can move when you're not looking. I hate this type of monster! It's a very good type of monster! And I hate it! And this little game is a decent one of these. So that's a short bit of fun for you.

During my time with Diablo 4, I couldn’t stop thinking about how precise a good loot-based action-RPG is.
When done right, games of the genre put you in a hypnotic trance. The flow of hacking and slashing as you find rare loot and make numbers go up fires off powerful waves of happiness chemicals in your brain. However, such an inherently repetitive gameplay loop will become tedious if the execution isn't just right. Since Diablo set the formula that countless action-RPGs since followed, new games in the series come with high expectations. Will Diablo 4 remind us of why we enjoy this genre to begin with, or will the king need to give up its throne?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing Diablo IV gave me a real case of the "have I changed, or have the games changed?", and I think the answer is "yes". For the uninitiated, Diablo forms one of the jewels in Blizzard's crown (maybe a smaller one, just offset to the Warfcraft centre stone), an action-RPG series that's like if the kind of 90s metal album cover that has a skeleton on it asked to be turned into a game where you explode many hundreds of near-identical monsters to get incrementally better loot. This is a spoiler-free review of the latest greatest addition, following 2012's Diablo III, but a Diablo game's story is sort of unspoilable, both because a) paying attention to it is of passing importance to playing, and b) the plot of them is always basically the same anyway.
To wit: Sanctuary, a high-fantasy world with a low-fantasy vibe, where so much as going to the next town over will be a brush with some horrible little goblin rat called a Flesh Thresher, was created as a respite from the eternal battle between heaven and hell. After X number of years of relative peace, one (or many) of the Lords Of Hell is doin' some bad stuff. Usually Diablo, I'll grant you. In this case it's Lilith, a kind of Dante's Lady Dimetrescu, who's making people horny for being stepped on power. Diablo games have always had a Grand Canyon sized gulf between the cinematics (epic; luscious; brutal) and the game in practise (clicking). IV is no different. And you know. It's fine.

However, I’m not ready to assign a score until I’ve gotten to play the game under normal conditions: with the servers live and teeming with players hunting Lilith. That means you won’t see a full review until I've spent a good deal of time with the launch version of the adventure. Until then, I’ll give my impressions on the things I can talk about.

Blizzard has revealed a Diablo 4 Hardcore Race to 100 via the official Diablo Twitter. As part of the race, the first 1000 players to reach the max level of 100 on Hardcore mode—with proof—will be declared the winners. The stakes for the race are as real as they get. Winners of the race will have their Battle.net BattleTag engraved on a physical Lilith statue, immortalizing their victory forever.
This race is certainly not for the faint of heart. In Diablo 4's Hardcore mode, death results in the permanent deletion of the character. This means in order to win the race you will have to level up all the way to the max level without dying a single time. Permanent death occurs in both PvE and PvP, so Hardcore players looking to win the race should stay away …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can't escape your past
It's a great day for horror fans, as Genvid Technologies and Behaviour Interactive have released a new trailer for Silent Hill: Ascension. Representing just one slice of the SH rejuvenation, this teaser gives a brief taste of things to come. Unlike the other projects, Ascension is going to be an interactive experience, produced in conjunction with J.J. Abrams' production company Bad Robots. The fact that it's being co-developed by the Dead by Daylight team should intrigue a few people.
The trailer itself does suggest that the game may depart from what fans have come to love about the iconic, yet criminally dormant, survival horror series. That's not surprising, seeing as Ascension is pretty much a spin-off. However, the fact that you'll get to influence the story directly should be enough of a pull. In any case, some of you are probably still pinching yourself that Silent Hill is finally coming back.
https://youtu.be/hxBuL8lU3Bs
Not since 2012's Book of Memories has there been a new entry, so it was a pleasant shock when, in November 2022, Konami announced a multitude of games under the SH umbrella. While such projects as Silent Hill f, with its creepy Japanese flavor, and Townfall are ones to look out for, the one that's on everyone's watch list is the remake of the 2001 masterpiece Silent Hill 2. This reimagining is being helmed by Layers of Fear developer Bloober Team. Make of that what you will.
On top of games, there's also a new Silent Hill movie in production, which is being directed by Christophe Gans who did the 2006 adaptation. Essentially, it's all go for Konami's legendary horror series. Silent Hill: Ascension is currently in development, and is scheduled for release in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is the next first-party PlayStation title making the jump to Steam on July 26, marking the series' first appearance on PC. 
The 2021 dimension-hopping adventure served as one of the earliest showcases of the PlayStation 5’s tech (namely it’s fast-loading SSD), and the PC version sports additional bells and whistles such as: 
Performance-enhancing upscaling for Nvidia DLSS 3, AMD FSR 2, and Intel XeSS
Unlocked framerate
Ray-traced reflections/shadows
Ultra-wide support for 21:9, 32:9, and 48:9 monitors


Developer Nixxes Software is handling this PC port of the acclaimed action platformer, which sees Ratchet & Clank fighting to stop their old foe Dr. Nefarious from conquering the multiverse with the help of Ratchet's alternate universe counterpart, Rivet. In our review, we scored the game a 9 out of 10, with former editor-in-chief Andrew Reiner writing, "It’s a great continuation of the series that is just a joy to play. It steals your eye with its stunning vistas, makes you care about the characters, and is loaded to the hilt with fan service (especially in the alternate dimension and a weapon you have to assemble)."

On one hand, you likely want to appeal to the fans of the series, and on the other, you want to attract new players. But it’s impossible to please everyone when making big changes like developer Creative Business Unit III is doing with Final Fantasy XVI – using a real-time action combat system that couldn’t be further from the series’ classic turn-based roots. 
As someone who loves the franchise’s turn-based format and its more action-forward design as of late, and as someone who’s played FFXVI for more than five hours at this point, I’m quite pleased with the combat. It’s fast-paced, action-heavy, and perhaps most importantly, fitting of this world and these characters. I especially like the singular focus on Clive,…]]></summary>

That could be worth upgrading to, if the T700 itself stayed within reach of most PC owners.
Reader, the price is not right.

Naughty Dog has released a statement concerning the state of play on its untitled multiplayer project set within the miserable world of The Last of Us — Originally announced at the start of the year as part of the series' 10th-anniversary celebrations, the studio has remained quiet on the release, offering up little news on its concept, gameplay style, or launch window.
"We know many of you have been looking forward to hearing more about our The Last of Us multiplayer game," wrote the studio on Twitter. "We’re incredibly proud of the job our studio has done thus far, but as development has continued, we’ve realized what is best for the game is to give it more time."

"Our team will continue to work on the project, as well as our other games in development, including a brand new single-player experience; we look forward to sharing more soon. We’re grateful to our fantastic community for your support thank you for your passion for our games, it continues to drive us."
The referenced "brand new single-player experience" is something of a whispered announcement, and seemingly represents a second Last of Us project in the works at the Santa Monica developer. I doubt very much that they are openly referring to the inevitable The Last of Us Part III, but perhaps there is a VR project or some other spin-off in the works. Given the stupendous success of the series, its remasters, sequels, and remakes, one can imagine Sony is badgering ND for TLOU products on a regular basis.

Every fighting game franchise owes an unpayable debt to Street Fighter.
Oh, sure, Street Fighter wasn't the first slugger on the block, and we can tip our hats to forerunners such as Technos' Karate Champ and Irem's Yie Are Kung Fu for pioneering the genre itself. But, inarguably, it was the 1991 arrival of Capcom's Street Fighter II that truly popularised the one-on-one fighter on a global basis, reinventing competitive gaming, garnering millions of sales in the arcade and home market, and galvanizing itself as one of the premier franchises in history.
Street Fighter II wrote the blueprint that would be followed by every franchise eager to raise fists and feet in its wake. And while a handful of these excellent fighters would go on to achieve amazing success in th…]]></summary>

It has been a little while since we last heard about WrestleQuest, the turn-based wrestling-meets-fantasy RPG from developer Mega Cat Studios that was initially slated for release this month. That release date was pushed to "Summer 2023" just a few weeks ago, but we now know that the game will in fact be coming our way on 8th August thanks to an awesome new trailer.
This latest look, titled the 'Legends Trailer', showcases the game's recruitment mechanics where you will be able to call on the help of wrestling legends (with some familiar faces) to assist you in the ring. These boosts look like they can come in the form of ability perks, enemy disadvantages or environmental changes to make sure that your hits land harder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who knew slaying demons could be finger-licking good?
After Activision Blizzard and KFC partnered up to offer beta codes in exchange for chicken sandwiches, rumors started circulating that the partnership would continue with the actual release of Diablo 4. It turns out those rumors were true after all. The promotion appears to be similar to the one offered a couple of months ago that gave access to the beta.
Basically your purchase of a chicken sandwich — by itself or as part of a combo — via the KFC website or through the official KFC app will grant you a code. You can then link your KFC account with your Battle.net account and redeem the code. After redeeming you can then select one of five Diablo 4 KFC cosmetic rewards.
Although pricing varies by location, it looks like the cheapest item that qualifies for the promo is the classic chicken sandwich. At $4.99, this means you would need to spend about $25 (plus tax) in order to get enough codes to unlock all five of them.
What are the Diablo 4 KFC Cosmetic Rewards?
A couple of weeks ago the graphics for the five rewards were datamined and posted on Reddit.
All five of the rewards appear to be cosmetics for various weapons. Though the names for all the items appear to reference KFC in some way, the actual cosmetics themselves seem ordinary. None of them look too out of place in terms of graphical style. That being said, they also look quite...plain.
In my opinion, none of the weapon skins look interesting enough to me to bother going out of my way to get a chicken sandwich to redeem it. They all look quite simplistic and, honestly, I saw much better weapons within the first hour of the game.
We already know the battle pass will be full of cosmetics, likely better-looking ones than this promo.
Diablo 4 launches June 5 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox. Owners of the Deluxe or Ultimate Edition can enter early access from June 1.

Professional procrastinators can now rejoice as there’s a new way to play the blocky puzzler: Setris, or Tetris with sand.

Bandai Namco has revealed yet another veteran fighter headed to the roster of its upcoming sequel, Tekken 8 — And following on from the fun 'n' games of Lili Rochefort and Asuka Kazama, this newest trailer brings a whole lot more darkness, fear, and pain, with the return of psychopathic mercenary Bryan Fury!
Making his debut in 1997's Tekken 3, Bryan Fury is a former Hong Kong Interpol agent who was killed in a shootout, also involving celebrated detective Lei Wu-Long. Fury's corpse was rushed to the laboratory of the moral-free Dr. Abel, who wished to experiment on reanimated bodies for the purpose of future warfare. Now essentially a reanimated half-cyborg, Bryan's mind is all but completely lost, creating a sociopathic weapon capable of incredible destruction without as much as a raised eyebrow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0cwK2V4og
Fury's new trailer reveals that our favourite zombie's hard-hunting punches and trademark backfists are in full effect, along with his capabilities for superhuman feats of strength, defying the power of his Actually Alive brethren. Of course, Fury's penchant for maniacal laughter rings through the entire trailer, because if you can't have a good ol' chuckle when you're dead, when can you?
Bryan Fury's trailer was, unfortunately, leaked a little ahead of schedule, upsetting Tekken producer Katsuhiro Harada. But the preview finally got its official debut at the climax of this weekend's Combo Breaker tournament in Illinois, where the madman's return was welcome by the Tekken faithful.
Tekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch late in 2023 or early 2024. Be sure to check out the previous trailers for  Jin Kazama, Marshall Law, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, Jack-8, Lars Alexandersson, Kazuya Mishima, Jun Kazama, Ling Xiayou, Asuka Kazama, Leroy Smith, Lili Rochefort, and Hwoarang.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The October 2022 announcement of Silent Hill: Ascension, an interactive streaming series from Genvid Entertainment and Konami, raised some eyebrows from fans but provided little in the way of details. Today, Genvid broke its silence by not only giving us new details on the series but also a trailer.
In this series, which will unfold simultaneously across the globe, those watching can help decide the fates of Ascension's main characters. This means that as the story plays out, the audience will have a say in who survives the surely horrific story, who will be redeemed or damned by their actions, and who will suffer the almost certainly ghastly consequences. According to Genvid Entertainment, not even the developers will know the results of the story until it unfolds.
Silent Hill: Ascension features an ensemble of new characters, monsters, and locations within the Silent Hill universe. Genvid has crafted a real-time interactive system that allows viewers from around the world to decide these characters' fates within the narrative the studio has crafted. Beginning later in 2023, fans can tune in to live story moments where each day is different based on audience interactions. 
Silent Hill: Ascension is set to stream later this year. If this unique concept has piqued your interest, you can check out the reveal trailer below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a certain sort of PC gaming fan, System Shock is where it all began. 30 years of immersive sim development started here, as Looking Glass escaped the restraints of the RPG genre and embraced thoughtful first-person action. SHODAN broke free, and the world was never the same. Without System Shock, there would be no Thief or Gloomwood, no Prey or Dead Space. Bioshock was conceived as its sequel. The creative figureheads behind Deus Ex and Dishonored were wrapped up in its creation, and forever changed by contact with Looking Glass and its unique philosophy.
Countless studios have used Citadel Station as a star to steer by, measuring their own work against System Shock’s commitment to simulation, dense atmosphere, and method-ish refusal to break character. This was not so much a game as an alternate reality. As one of our interviewees tells us: “We were trying to build the holodeck.”
Here’s the story of how it was made, as told by the people who made it.

It’s no secret that Street Fighter V got off to a disastrous start, and despite years of course correction, its flawed foundation made a comeback difficult. By contrast, Street Fighter 6 is a thorough response to its predecessor’s failings, defined by well-considered central mechanics, formidable single-player offerings, and a plethora of smart decisions that make for a powerful opening punch.
Those primarily interested in duking it out against other players have a lot to look forward to; between the snappy movement and wealth of strategic op…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in February 1991, Capcom released Street Fighter 2 to arcades. Unbeknownst to Capcom at the time, Street Fighter 2’s massive success would cause it to become the blueprint for fighting games - a genre the game effectively created upon its release. This blueprint proved to be so influential that even some of Street Fighter 2’s most underwhelming elements are still being parroted in fighting games today. As a result, more than 30 years later, one constant in the fighting game genre has always remained true: the story mode is gonna suck.
There have been some valiant attempts at rectifying this in the last decade, but the core issue has always remained the same; fighting games are inherently designed to be played against other people, and back-to-back fights with AI controlled characters will never be able to properly match the competition of the real thing. Yet, with Street Fighter 6, Capcom have seemingly done the impossible. Street Fighter 6 has the best story mode in any fighting game I’ve played. Admittedly a low bar, but still, Capcom could have easily half-assed the story mode, just as so many other fighting games still choose to do, and still have been widely praised based solely on the strength of its multiplayer. Instead, Capcom are offering fighting game developers a new blueprint to copy - one that prioritises teaching new players above everything else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI’s combat is fast, chaotic, and, most importantly, fun. There are plenty of combos to pull off, and in just the small taste of the action during my cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, office, I saw so much variance in setting up Clive’s combative abilities that I can’t wait to see what others do in-game. 
I also watched combat director Ryota Suzuki play through some of the most challenging encounters in the game, and unsurprisingly, he excelled, taking maybe one or two hits in the 20 minutes he played. He used combos I didn’t really comprehend – admittedly, he was playing at a much later portion of the game than I had hands-on access with – and it got me thinking: is he excited to see what players do with FFXVI’s combat, much like I was sitting there watching him pull off intricate combos against myriad enemies? 
“I’ve always tried to give players a lot of freedom when it comes to the controls and the action in the game, and give them lots of options that they can take and then do their own thing with,” Suzuki tells me. “So I’m expecting that there’s going to be a lot of weird things that they’re going to do with certain abilities. I can’t say what those abilities are, but I already have a few ideas because I’ve left a lot of things open-ended in that way. 
“I’m really excited to see what players will do with them because there are definitely things that I didn’t expect, but I do like putting that stuff out there so that they have stuff to play with and surprise me with. When they do things I expected, I’m happy, but I’m also really happy when they [...] do something that is completely unexpected. It’s one of the exciting things about being a developer.”
Like Suzuki, I look forward to seeing what far more advanced players do with FFXVI’s combat, and fortunately, we have less than a month to go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On May 27, the development team behind Wii and GameCube emulator Dolphin announced a massive roadblock: Nintendo's legal team was moving to prevent the software from launching on Steam. While the Dolphin team is investigating its options, the project is currently "indefinitely postponed." Here's the full quote from their blog post:
It is with much disappointment that we have to announce that the Dolphin on Steam release has been indefinitely postponed. We were notified by Valve that Nintendo has issued a cease and desist citing the DMCA against Dolphin's Steam page, and have removed Dolphin from Steam until the matter is settled. We are currently investigating our options and will have a more in-depth response in the near future.
We appreciate your patience in the meantime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remakes tend to be more exciting than remasters because the improvements often go beyond mere bumps in resolution or framerate. At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window. This will be an evolving list t…]]></summary>

And it occurs to me that the vast, vast, vast majority of you will never have met me in real life. The evidence that I exist in physical space is comparatively minimal! How do you know I'm not an AI? An AI could probably replicate my writing style quite thoroughly, because there are at present many thousands of my - mine, my own - words on the internet, and they and everything else have and are being scraped by AI. This thought process is as a result of a few AI things intersecting with my workspace at once recently. Several of them are quite funny, and also not. If you think AI tools are actually good for writers then I have to assume you don't really think much about either.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Robosen Robotics has for some years fostered a fun partnership with Hasbro and its Transformers license, including an awesome fully transformable Generation 1 Optimus Prime that would change between robot and truck on its own.
In a similar spirit, the same team now has a new robotic collectible coming to market, this time emulating the Optimus Prime character as he appears in the new Rise of the Beasts live-action film. Instead of full transformation like the previous G1-style incarnation, this new collectible is built as a display piece that can shift between various aerial action poses, speak lines of dialogue, and respond to voice and app commands from your phone or other device.
The figure features 21 precision servo motors and 69 microchips. Even before mounting on his included stand, Prime stands at 16 inches tall.
The team even brought in legendary voice actor Peter Cullen to reprise his role and record brand-new lines for the character to spout.
The new Rise of the Beasts Optimus Prime limited edition collectible will put you back a hefty sum; it’s currently on a preorder sale of $699 (instead of the regular price of $899). If that's not too high a price for controlling an intergalactic hero, he's all yours. The vaunted Aubobot leader will be ready to head out on a mission to your home in the fourth quarter of 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI is the most action-forward game in the mainline series’ history, and while it’s been a point of contention between players excited for this and fans of the franchise who yearn for something turn-based, it’s hard to deny the combat looks flashy and fun. And as someone who’s played a few hours of the game, I can say it is. 
While I attribute most of that to how great it feels to control Clive, it turns out there might be some tricks developer Creative Business Unit III learned developing Final Fantasy XIV’s action to make FFXVI’s combat feel even more satisfying beyond the actual gameplay.

Not an assault rifle or mini-pistol, but a decades-old email chain between her TriOptimum bosses and a psychologist named Jeffrey Hammer. In the early stages of Citadel’s construction, Hammer suggested that each level of the station be designed in such a way as to induce stress and anxiety, so that experts could study their impact on the human psyche during space travel.
“I always knew something was off about this place!”, wrote Stacy to a colleague. “We are just rats in a maze.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When my Sleeper escaped their ramshackle life on the fringes of Erlin's Eye at the end of last year, they left behind a lot of unfinished business. I had to stop short my efforts to help Bliss make a go of her repair bay business, and Tala was left to finish making her brand-new distillery on her own. Yatagan agent Rabiyah probably has my name on an employment blacklist, too, after I upped sticks without telling them, and the spores of mushroom algae I'd been cultivating for Riko over in Greenway were no doubt left to rot and moulder somewhere. Instead, I jacked that all in to smuggle myself, my engineering pal Lem and his tiny daughter Mina onto a ship headed for some far-flung star out in the void. The Sidereal ship wasn't going to wait. It was now or never.
Fortunately hitting an ending in Citizen Sleeper doesn't mean the end of your save. Booting it back up again for this month's RPS Game Club, I wanted to play out a different ending to my Sleeper's story. Turning my back on Lem and Mina still brought its own kind of sadness, admittedly, but I wanted to dig into the game's trio of free DLC episodes first and foremost, as that was another thing I never got time to start last year. I've only played through the first chapter, Flux, so far, but man alive, it was not an auspicious start for the refugee flotilla ship hoping to make a new life for themselves here. In fact, I don't think it could have gone any worse, such was the monumental failure of my collective dice rolls and decision making. But despite absolutely beefing it in Flux, I also came to realise an important lesson. It's okay to fail, and that failure can often make the consequences of your actions feel all the more poignant. Sure, it might not feel nice, and yes, I wish it could have gone better. But sometimes the odds really are stacked against you, and you've just got to roll with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI’s Valisthea is sprawling, comprising a mix of five main nations, various more-linear dungeons, and some open field areas. The primary focus of FFXVI will be playing through Clive’s story and all it entails, but there’s more to the game than just the main scenario. 
I was curious about how players will get around Valisthea, especially with developer Creative Business Unit III at the helm. In its MMO, Final Fantasy XIV, mounts are abundant. You can ride chocobos, the Regalia from Final Fantasy XV, Magitek armor, and more. There are dozens of mounts to acquire in-game, and I wondered if that would bleed over into FFXVI. 
“To tell you the truth, it’s pretty much just chocobos,” FFXVI director Hiroshi Takai tells me. “In past Final Fantasy games, you’d have canoes or boats or …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Replay returns, and we're checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts! Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. 
Watch on Twitch!

After the Steam Deck proved that handheld gaming PCs could flourish outside of a microscopic niche, it was surely only a matter of time before one of the big PC hardware movers would have a crack at the concept. This time, with more powerful internals, and none of the SteamOS compatibility problems that led to Valve creating a whole new verification system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most video games are too big. Their lands are too expansive, their histories over-explained, their playtimes too long. Most of everything is too long (songs, books, movies, everything) but it's especially felt in games, where the magical "What's next?" feeling of discovering a world often fades to leave the "What task must I complete now?" drudgery of playing a video game. So I hugely admire Cosmo D's Off-Peak series, which has built the feeling of a huge and fascinating city through only four tiny locations visited across four games with a combined playtime of under eight hours.

It's also extremely unfair on Smalland Colon Survive The Wilds, a lovely survival game about being a teeny tiny person in the wilderness, where bottlecaps serve as tabletops and beetles are a deadly threat. It is absolutely comparable to Obsidian's garden adventure, but a peer rather than a pretender. I even prefer it in some ways, but they have such a different vibe that there's plenty of room for both.

But I was also given an exclusive tour of FFXVI’s endgame and other supplementary content by creative director Hiroshi Takai and combat director Ryota Suzuki. 
It’s safe to say there’s plenty to play, especially if you enjoy chasing numbers in combat. 

FFXVI features an Arcade Mode, allowing players to run through stages they’ve already completed, this time with an on-screen score calculator and combat grader. But a New Game+ playthrough opens up two additional versions, and both are more difficult than the game’s base Story Mode and Action Mode difficulties. It’s important to note you can play through New Game+ on one of these base difficulties if you’d like, but you’re missing …]]></summary>

Luckily, we have a pretty promising one of those on the horizon with Cross Blitz, a deckbuilding RPG that follows some furry animal pirates across the high seas, digitally represented on a grid-based map this time around. Cross Blitz was announced two years ago, but the indie team at Tako Boy have secured a publisher and are now ready to launch into early access later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zelda received its second post-release patch last night, and just like its first post-release update, the patch notes cover a lot of ground without diving into many specifics.
Here are the patch notes from Nintendo's website:
Ver. 1.1.2 (Released May 25, 2023)
Additional Fixes
Alongside fixing the audio issue and the Camera Work in the Depths quest, the "Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience," note is covering a lot of ground. It seems most if not all of the duplication glitches players discovered, which allowed them to duplicate rare items in the game with suprisingly little effort, have effectively been removed from the game, according to posters on the r/NintendoSwitch subreddit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion, Scarlet & Violet – Paldea Evolved, arrives next month. As the name implies, this new version delivers plenty of evolved forms of Paldean Pokémon while expanding on the pre-existing catalog of Paldean and non-Paldean monsters.
This second expansion in the Scarlet & Violet series of cards brings with it more than 190 new cards, including 15 Pokémon ex cards, Tera Pokémon ex cards with a crystalline appearance, more than 30 Trainer cards, and dozens of Pokémon and Trainer cards with special illustrations. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to open and see what we could pull, and those with the special illustrations ended up being the highlight of my pack-opening experience.
You can see my favorite of the cards I pulled in the gallery below.

I was pretty happy with the cards I pulled from the packs. My favorite is probably the special Elite Trainer Box Pikachu card, which features the three Paldean starters in the background, though I also love the Pikachu I pulled from a booster pack. Outside of that, I enjoyed seeing the various Paldean starters' evolved forms, though, for some reason, my pulls skewed heavily toward Quaxly's evolution line. Outside of this most recent generation of Pokémon, I was happy to snag some updated cards of old favorites, such as Gyarados, Raichu, and Tyranitar.
In addition to being the second Pokémon Trading Card Game to bear the Scarlet & Violet name, it's also the second pack to come at a higher price tag. However, The Pokémon Company has at least tried to deliver some benefits to this, as each pack includes more foils, and even the wrapper of each booster pack feels thicker and of higher quality than the original Scarlet & Violet expansion.
Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Paldea Evolved arrives on June 9. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking the banner below!]]></summary>

Before Resident Evil and Silent Hill, 1992’s Alone in the Dark helped lay the foundation for 3D survival horror before the genre even had a name. Players explored a haunted building laden with elaborate puzzles and scary monsters, with gameplay emphasizing thoughtful management of scarce resources. It even featured two playable characters with separate scenarios, an idea later adopted by Resident Evil 2. Numerous sequels of varying quality followed, but it’s been many years since the series was culturally relevant.

Here, Clive meets Cidolfus Telamon, or Cid for short – because this is Final Fantasy, after all. Shortly after, Cid brings Clive to a place dubbed Cid’s hideaway. 
This hideaway is one of the main hubs in FFXVI. While I’m not sure of its location in Valisthea, the continent where the game takes place, it looks built into a cavernous structure. It features a pub where you speak with locals about what’s going on in the world, side quests to pick up, and a music player, as well. I discover music tracks exploring Valisthea, and while these are new tracks from the score of FFXV…]]></summary>

One after the other, developers' dreams of making the next big Destiny-like have gradually collapsed in on themselves. Like a deflated concertina, their last honks of life have been crushed down to desperate, fizzling squeals as servers lie empty and the cost of maintaining them spirals out of control. Some are still hanging in there, sure, but the genre as a whole feels like it's at a tipping point - and I couldn't help but sigh as five more multiplayer shooters joined the fray last night as part of Sony's PlayStation Showcase.

I got to see a little bit of an alpha build of Realms Of Ruin in action ahead of tonight's Skulls stream, and if you're a fan of tabletop miniatures, this is definitely an RTS you'll want to keep an eye on, as Frontier have gone all out on making this look as close to Age Of Sigmar's TT origins as they can.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When discussing Final Fantasy XVI’s combat or watching gameplay, it’s hard not to think about other action combat games, such as Capcom’s Devil May Cry series. And if its combat reminds you of DMC, it’s probably because the combat director of FFXVI is Ryota Suzuki, who helped design combat on Devil May Cry 4 and Devil May Cry 5. But he also worked on Marvel Vs. Capcom 2. 
While the DMC inspirations laced within FFXVI’s combat are hard to miss, Suzuki told me that Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 inspired some of FFXVI's systems as well. 
“There’s actually something from Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 that we took and put into Final Fantasy XVI, and that is, as you may or may not know, in Marvel Vs. Capcom 2, we had the Assist system where you could give orders to your partner in battle,” Suzuki says. “And by impl…]]></summary>

Neva is a new puzzle platformer from the creators of Gris that tells the story of a red-capped swordswoman named Alba and her faithful wolf pup as they "embark on a perilous journey through a once beautiful world as it slowly decays around them." That's not much to go on, but feast your eyes on the stunning animated trailer below. It's a looker.

Revealed during Sony's PlayStation Showcase, Sword Of The Sea comes from Giant Squid Studio, the folks behind 2016's Abzû and 2020's The Pathless, and sees you play as The Wraith, a lone explorer on a quest to restore submerged cities that have been buried beneath a sea of golden dunes. You're able to slickly travel across the sandy terrain thanks to a rad-as-heck hoversword, a traversal tool that's described on the PlayStation blog as a "snowboard, skateboard, and hoverboard all in one." You can witness some major sand-shredding and see what else Sword Of The Sea has in store by watching the lavish announcement trailer below.

        <updated>2023-05-25T12:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari and developer Sneakybox have announced Days of Doom, an apocalyptic turn-based tactical roguelite. The game hopes to subvert the expectations of those who are tired of the brown and gray color palettes of other apocalypse settings by placing the action over vibrant and colorful backdrops as you battle through hordes of zombies, raiders, and mutant lizards. 
Navigating the wasteland to reach a sanctuary will require strategy, as you must combat the encroaching mutated forces using your group of distinct survivors. Beyond the turn-based tactics at play, you must also manage your scarce collection of resources and keep your wits about you as you maneuver through the hordes of the undead.

Each of the eight survivor classes features unique abilities that can be used to shift your fortunes in battle. For example, the Pyro class allows you to burn enemies and leave them with residual damage each turn while combining the Hydromancer with the Thrasher can drench enemies with water before electrocuting them for a devastating synergy. Players will need to use these abilities to their advantage and think strategically with these abilities to overcome the seemingly insurmountable odds.
And, of course, with it being a roguelite game, players can expect each run to feel unique. More than 50 randomly occurring events present risk-reward scenarios for players during their runs, while more than 70 collectible items and runes can help you turn the odds in your favor in your given run. However, as you play several runs and make progress, you unlock permanent upgrades, such as party size increases and resource accumulation speed.
If you'd like to learn more, you can check out the reveal trailer below.


Days of Doom arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Atari VCS later this year.]]></summary>

Hence why Phantom Blade Zero has perked me up to no end, as it's an action RPG announced at last night's PlayStation Showcase which marries Chinese martial arts with a steampunk aesthetic. I'm on board, if cautious! The action seems rad, but it's so fast, it's hard to tell how it actually plays.

Essentially, this sounds like a Benjamin Button situation.

In fact, I’ve had about as much fun with it as I would on a spa day in the Barad-dûr sulfur pits. Between the soulless platforming, undercooked stealth, tedious storytelling, and framerate stuttering so bad it’s got me killed twice, Gollum is perilously short on likeable qualities. Especially if you’re not into LOTR lore, or fine hattery.
In my unclad head, then, Gollum’s highlight so far has been DLSS 3. It’s one of just a few dozen games to support the newest, most artificially intelligent version of Nvidia’s deep learning-powered upscaler, and frankly makes a very compelling argument for switching it on. Graphics card allowing, obviously.

This wacky new multiplayer shooter pits two teams of four against each other using weapons that shoot, you guessed it, foam. Battlefields are covered in soapy foam, which players can use to their advantage by creating slippery surfaces to slide at high speeds. Foam can also be used in other ways, such as to shield yourself and your teammates from attacks or create vantage points. The trailer shows off a bunch of goofy weapons and the game pretty much feels like the anti-thesis of Splatoon. 


Square Enix promises to share more about Foamstars in the future, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5 and 4.]]></summary>

An opening cinematic reveals some insight into the villainous Kraven the Hunter. Tired of easy prey in the deep jungle, one of his minions suggests a move to a new hunting ground in New York, where the likes of Spider-Man, Black Cat, and Tombstone promise more challenging targets.


The action jumps to six months later in Queens, as a black-suited Peter Parker bursts from a basement to battle some of the Hunter’s goons. The gameplay sequence that follows is impressive, showing off Spider-Man’s new symbiote abilities, which allow for an array of tenta…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 2020 first-person action title Ghostrunner has garnered a strong community of fans thanks to its precise controls and high-octane action. Perhaps that's why, less than a year following its initial PC release, a sequel was announced. However, outside of some concept art, we haven't seen or heard much from developer One More Level or publisher 505 Games.
However, that changed today, as the studio released a first gameplay look for the highly anticipated sequel. Revealed during today's PlayStation Showcase, the trailer shows the game's cyber-ninja protagonist, Jack, participating in the series' trademark fast-paced, always-forward combat and traversal. According to the team, the sequel looks to elevate the formula in every category, including the addition of vehicular combat.
You can see the trailer for yourself below.


Ghostrunner 2 arrives later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie is best known as the team behind Halo and Destiny, but it's digging through the crates of its past to bring back one of its original successes, Marathon.
Marathon was first released for the Apple Macintosh in 1994 and was a first-person shooter centering on a space-faring security cop fighting to stop an alien invasion. It was followed by two sequels, with the third entry arriving in 1996. This new Marathon sports a distinctly vibrant look and will also be a first-person shooter, but is a PvP extraction-style experience. Players control a runner in order to, according to the game's website, "compete for survival, riches, and renown in a world of evolving, persistent zones, where any run can lead to greatness."


The game's website also has the following synopsis:
Marathon is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will support cross-play and cross-progression but does not have a release window.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the biggest 2023 PlayStation Showcase announcements was a confirmation of the long-rumored remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. At the tail end of that announcement, however, was another exciting, admittedly smaller announcement that the first three Metal Gear Solid games will be ported to PlayStation 5 in one presumed package.
The single image above appeared at the end of the Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater remake teaser with the words, "Sneak back into the original games on PlayStation 5," with an autumn 2023 release window. The package is called Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Volume 1, which implies more Metal Gears may be on the way. A Volume 2 could, hopefully, finally free Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots from its PlayStation 3 prison – the only platform that game has ever been made available on.
Update: According to the game's listing on the PlayStation Store, the package will also include the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake. Here is how the the listing of included games is worded on the page.

Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake
Metal Gear Solid (Including VR Missions/Special Missions)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft showed off a new look at Assassin’s Creed Mirage at today's PlayStation Showcase. The trailer shows protagonist Basim as he leaps, slides, and fights his way across the ancient streets of Baghdad.
Basim was introduced to Assassin’s Creed players in the earlier release of Valhalla, but this new game jumps back to an earlier time in the character’s life.


The action on display looks slick and modern but strongly calls to mind the flow of gameplay that longtime players may recall from early games in the series, controlling the likes of Altair and Ezio as they moved through large urban cityscapes. The new combat system, in particular, features some especially impressive animations and combat moves. The trailer also suggests that players will have a number of choices in how to approach a given mission, with clear decisions outlined in pre-mission briefings and then the chance to execute on a chosen plan.
Assassin’s Creed Mirage is targeting release on October 12 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rumors were true. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is getting remade for PlayStation 5 and Xbox. 
The remake is officially called Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. A cinematic teaser showcased a jungle filled with dangerous animals vying for dominance, with Naked Snake emerging from the depth of a bog to show off his remade look. Originally released in 2004, the title is a 1960s-era prequel to the Metal Gear series that tells the origin story of Big Boss and lays the groundwork for the entire Metal Gear fiction. 


Unfortunately, we don't get to see gameplay, and the title doesn’t have a release window, but the first three Metal Gear Solid games are also being bundled in a collection heading to PlayStation 5 this fall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 had an appearance today during the PlayStation Showcase event. And as you might've guessed, the trailer left a lot of questions. But it did answer an all-important one: when the game is coming out. 


Here's what we gathered: Alan is trapped ... somewhere. According to him, he has to write to escape. Ostensibly, that's from the cult members chasing and attacking seemingly everyone within a 50-mile radius. Alan is writing about the police investigation into the death of Robert Nightingale, one of the antagonists of the first game. Here, the trailer splits into multiple perspectives: that of Alan and that of two investigators (one of which is voiced by James McCaffrey, of Max Payne fame, which Remedy also developed). Notably, we see that we'll play at least two different characters in Alan Wake 2: Alan, of course, but then also one of the investigators, a young woman named Saga Anderson. 
The trailer closes with the game's release date: October 17, 2023. 
Alan Wake 2 was originally announced back at The Game Awards 2021 via a cinematic trailer. This is the first time we've seen the game in action.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s PlayStation Showcase brought the reveal of Sword of the Sea, a new game from Giant Squid, the development team behind Abzu and The Pathless.
The most striking visuals of the new game come from a vast desert that brings to mind thatgamecompany’s Journey. That’s not coincidence, since Giant Squid’s founder is Matt Nava, who was previously art director at thatgamecompany. But while this new game is destined to draw strong comparisons to that classic title, there were some notable differences on display. First, the desert itself looks much more like a flowing sea, and the character you control like a surfer moving through the water. In certain sequences, the desert seems to actually transform into water, suggesting a mystery at the core of the game.
In the footage shown, we see a focus on flow movement for the protagonist as they ride across the sand and trick off of half-pipes. From surrounding descriptions about the game, we know that you control a character named the Wraith, who was brought back to life to restore life to a ruined world, while facing off against vast leviathans that attempt to block progress.
Sword of the Sea is coming to PS5, but no word yet on a release date.]]></summary>

While it was hard to ascertain specifics from the trailer, we did get glimpses at the game's action RPG combat, which is fast, frenetic, and stylish. According to a YouTube description, Phantom Blade 0 is inspired by Chinese martial arts and steampunk. In it, you play as the Dark Raider, out for revenge against "The Order." Additionally, the voiceover twice asks a disembodied character what they will do with what little time they have left. Specifically, 66 days. Their response is to get their heart back.

Phantom Blade 0 is being developed by Cruel Man Studio, based in Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong. The studio was founded in 2019, and thus far, has worked with Tencent and Square Enix.]]></summary>

I am an impartial observer here but oops oh no I have accidentally copy/pasted a remark from commenter Oli Baba, who said "Rewards upfront is one of the coolest mechanics to grace gaming and seems to be losing only because so few people have come across it." Whoops, I really must fix those hotkeys. Next, I ask you to choose between cooly saying nothing, or being told how cool you are. What's better: a silent protagonist, or combat style ratings?

While I'm sure the majority of tonight's announcements won't have an immediate and direct impact on us over in PC town, it's well known that Sony have been stepping up their PC game recently, and so a lot of what you see here will probably make the jump eventually, even if it's several years down the line. So come and join us for an early glimpse of PC's possible future. I'll be liveblogging tonight's proceedings, which kick off at 9pm BST / 1pm PDT. See you there!

I've built my fair share over the past few years, but new models continue to come into the market offering impressive looks, thermals, buildability for their size. One recent release is the Asus AP201, a Micro ATX case that offers excellent cooling potential, a stylish, unshowy appearance and a very reasonable price - especially today, as the black and white versions of this SFF case have dropped to $70 on Newegg following a $15 discount.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well then. Mere minutes after Nvidia hit the launch button on the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, AMD rocked up with a new 1080p graphics card of their own: the Radeon RX 7600. Though it’s likely more of an RTX 4060 rival, given the RX 7600 will go on sale tomorrow – May 25th – at £260 / $269, slightly less than the $299-tagged 4060.
Based on the same RDNA 3 architecture as the Radeon RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 XTX, the RX 7600 nonetheless targets a much more widely-used monitor resolution than those 4K-minded GPU hulks. Which makes a nice change, and means AMD will beat Nvidia’s RTX 40 series to the punch on a sub-£300 GPU, with the RTX 4060 not set for release until July.

Thank the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti for its mercy, then – assuming you can find one at RRP,  it’s the first of its family not to plonk a price premium over the last-gen equivalent. And even though it’s only moderately faster than the RTX 3060 Ti in most games, its efficiency improvements and DLSS 3 support ensure the RTX 4060 Ti keeps some crowd pleasing potential.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Swedish developers The Bearded Ladies certainly have a type. If you’ve played the memorably odd Mutant Year Zero or the largely forgettable Corruption 2029, you’ll know it by now – a blend of real-time stealth and turn-based tactics, where you quietly pick off stragglers from enemy squads before confronting the rest in a team scrap. Now here’s Miasma Chronicles, the Ladies’ third effort, and let’s just say they’re clearly happy to stick with what they know.
While the patterns of play are to a great extent the same, though, Miasma Chronicles is a more ambitious project. Addressing criticisms that those earlier games weren’t substantial enough, it’s a broader, denser beast, in which you could easily spend twice as long – 30 hours or so – seeing all the sights and shooting the nasties that populate them. That means there’s a lot more space available for this game to coax out varied strategies and introduce more elements, which is great. But it also means the weaker elements of the formula are left more exposed, which isn’t.

It looks like the kind of game I'd ignore right up until the moment when I wake up and discover it's the most popular game in the world. That day will have to wait a while longer, though. Developer Bandai Namco and publisher Amazon Games have announced that its western release has been delayed until 2024.

That's an awesome deal for an 8GB graphics card that delivers excellent RT performance for its tier, AV1 encoding/decoding and a solid upscaling solution in XeSS. If you're in the market for a GPU that can handle 1080p gaming with a relatively modern motherboard that supports the Resizeable BAR feature, this is an awesome pickup for the money.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun is possibly one of the most perfectly named games in history. The first bit lets you know you’re playing a game set in the venerable Warhammer 40,000 tabletop universe, while the second bit tells you everything else you need to know. What kind of game is it? Boltgun. What’s the gameplay like? Boltgun! What’s the story? BOLTGUN! Okay, there is technically a story, but it’s a thin excuse to let you shoot crunchy Chaos things in 40k, and shooting things in 40k means BOLTGUN!!!
Boltgun is a retro-styled first-person shooter, or boomer shooter, to use the parlance of our times. Cast as a Space Marine, one of 40k’s genetically engineered fascist super soldiers, it’s your job to secure the Plot Device and prevent 40k’s already crappy Imperium from getting even crappier. As you can probably guess, this means running around at incredible speeds and shooting hordes of cultists, traitors and daemons in the face until they fall down, explode into chunks of bright red gore, or both.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For whatever reason, I'm quite good at reading physical books, but when presented with a visual novel game my attention span slumps. "It's not you, it's me", rings true here, as it's definitely not the fault of the video games. I trust that Phoenix Wright or Paranormasight are brilliant, but the sudden act of having to read lots in a game has never worked out for me.
Then Citizen Sleeper came along for this month's RPS Game Club - and I think I'm a changed man? I think I now get why people are excited about static images and dialogue boxes. And I'm certain it's the game's cyclic nature that's managed to lasso my brain and keep it focused on the task at hand: help an AI trapped in a vending machine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After giving us an early glimpse of its unstoppable raptor hordes in a closed beta test last summer, Capcom recently let us loose with the opening hours of their upcoming dinosaur multiplayer shooter, Exoprimal. Its final release isn't far away now - its July 14th launch fast becoming the sole highlight of an otherwise desolate month - and I was excited to finally play the game that RPS vid bud Liam literally hasn't been able to stop talking about ever since he first clapped eyes (and his thumbs) on its somersaulting T-Rexes. (You should also read his excellent interview with the devs while you're at it, too). 
I'll hold my hands up now and say I didn't get to play as much of Exoprimal as I would have liked, but the handful of missions I did play really are as daft and brilliant as Liam described last year. I won't waste time repeating its fundamentals (you can read them here), but the basic setup is thus: in a world plagued by dinosaurs that periodically pour out of strange portals for some reason, you play a rookie dino hunter that gets pulled into a time-looping wargame set up by your company's clearly psychotic AI called Leviathan. In order to gather valuable 'combat data' for its simulations to fight said dinosaur threat, Leviathan endlessly ropes you and other rookie exosuit wearers into deadly feats of speed and skill. It's a neat, if patently preposterous setup for its 5v5 PvP multiplayer missions, but the thing that struck me most wasn't its gloriously silly dinosaurs or Leviathan's perfectly pitched ham lines. It was its bot companions, because heck, they're great to play with, but absolute fiends if you're on the wrong side of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no secret that Sony have been making increasing efforts to bring their exclusive PlayStation games to PC over the last couple of years, but one thing they've never quite been clear about is when we can expect to see them. They said a few years ago that we obviously shouldn't expect a simultaneous launch release, but some such as Death Stranding and The Last Of Us Part 1 have taken as little as six to eight months to come across, while others such as Spider-Man and Uncharted 4 have taken several years. 
According to PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, though, data from fans seem to suggest that the only "acceptable" route from a player point of view is a wait of two to three years. Outrageous, I say, but also: surely that means the long-sought-after Bloodborne must be next in line, right? Surely. It's been eight years, come on now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida has said he thinks "Maybe it's time we removed the numbers" from Final Fantasy games. In an interview with GQ, he talked about the baggage that inevitably comes with having a 35-year-old series with soon to be 16 numbered mainline games in it (not including the sequels and spin-offs, I might add), and the confusion it continues to create with new players. "Every numbered title we release in the series, we have to go into it like, 'It's OK, you don't have to play the rest of them,'" he said, and removing them is "something that I've discussed with the higher-ups". It's an understandable problem, for sure, although I think I'd be quite sad to see the numerals go entirely. As long as they don't pull a Mortal Kombat and go back to 1, though, we're good.

Mostly, we used to store a lot more personal information when you created an account, like email addresses, passwords, etc. As we now use GitHub to handle all that, we can slim down our privacy policy, as we store very little personal information. For the cookie policy, for years now we only use cookies for the authenticated part of our websites and nothing else. OpenTTD’s privacy policy has always been: we want to know as little personal information about you as possible. And although these changes were rolled out years ago, the policies did not reflect that yet. They do now! In short: we removed statements from the policy about information we track, as we haven’t done that for years now. So, what about this automated opt-in survey you are talking about?]]></summary>
