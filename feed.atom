        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Covert Sneakers are widely considered the best Boots in Modern Warfare 3, so Sledgehammer Games responded in Season 4 by decreasing the volume of enemy footsteps to devalue using the perk. 


As part of the Season 4 update, all enemies have quieter footsteps. Since Covert Sneakers eliminates footstep audio, it's rendered redundant, considering everyone makes less noise. This comes after Sledgehammer Games already attempted to overhaul the Boots category in Season 3 Reloaded. 


The developer removed Climbing Boots and introduced All-Terrain Boots, which offer significantly increased movement speed at the cost of tactical sprinting. In addition, Running Sneakers received a buff to improve sprint to fire time by 25 percent while tactical sprinting, and Stalker Boots were buffed to increase strafe speed and decreased the bounciness of aiming down sight. Those changes didn't do enough to satisfy the development team.

"Last season, we made several adjustments to Perks to distribute usage in the Boots category more evenly," Sledgehammer Games said. "Despite these changes, the pick rate of Covert Sneakers remains far ahead of other Boots." 


After this Season 4 change and the buffs from a previous update, there are plenty of compelling options worth considering. Taking everything into consideration, the best Boots option is now Stalker Boots as they give you faster strafing and ADS speed. Running Sneakers are also a viable choice as they increase tactical sprinting duration and reduce the refresh time.


The indirect nerf to Covert Sneakers will also impact the Call of Duty League. Reports suggest that Major 4 will be played on the latest patch, meaning we could see pro players experiment with other perks. Either way, the next time you load into a match, don't be afraid to try out a new Boots option.

According to stats provided by TrueGameData, the MK 20 SSR has a faster time-to-kill speed up to 35 meters away than the ACR 6.8, AK-47, M16A4, and M60. You must consider that the MK 20 SSR is a single-shot rifle with only a 10-bullet magazine. However, if you are accurate with your aim, it's possible to take down an enemy in two shots, or even one on an already weakened enemy. This marksman rifle requires a bit of a learning curve, as you will get punished with missed shots. 


Despite being a marksman rifle, the MK 20 SSR does not thrive in long-range engagements. A massive damage dropoff after 40 meters means you should prioritize shorte‚Ä¶]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Serie A TOTS Upgrade SBC is now live in EA FC 24 Ultimate Team, offering a guaranteed way to obtain a special card. 


The ongoing promo features special cards for the best footballers from Serie A. Some of these items are extremely strong on the in-game meta, but they can only be obtained from the packs (or from the market). While normal packs don't guarantee a Team of the Season card, this special SBC reward will only feature items from the Serie A TOTS. 


What are EA FC 24 Serie A TOTS Upgrade SBC tasks?


The latest TOTS SBC has two separate tasks. Both of them have their own conditions. To earn the special pack, you'll need to complete both tasks as per their stated conditions. 


Task 1 - 85-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 85



Task 2 - 86-Rated Squad



Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS (Except UT Champions)


Min. Team Rating: 86

EA FC 24 Serie A TOTS Upgrade SBC Cheapest Solutions


The Serie A TOTS Upgrade SBC should not cost too much in EA FC 24 to complete. Comparatively, special cards, like Trinity Rodman TOTS, cost much more to obtain. Still, always go for the cheapest solution to save your in-game resources for future content. 


Task 1 - 85-Rated Squad



Dani Parejo 86


Cristiana Girelli 86


Bella Bixby 84


Nacho Fernandez 83


Merle Frohms 85


Koke 84


Dabritz 84


Alex Grimaldo 84


Koen Casteels 84


Jude Bellingham 86


Romelu Lukaku 84



Task 2 - 86-Rated Squad



Ilkay Gundogan 86


Gabriel Megalhaes 84


Bella Bixby 84


Nacho Fernandez 83


Merle Frohms 85


Koke 84


Dabritz 84


Lucas Hernandez 84


Koen Casteels 84


Cucho Hernandez TOTS 88


Romelu Lukaku 84



Once again, the potential value of the Serie A TOTS Upgrade SBC relies entirely on luck. The aim is to get some of the higher-rated cards from the EA FC 24 Serie A TOTS promo. If you're looking for a cheaper alternative,  consider the Albert Gudmundsson Serie A TOTS SBC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sofia Huerta TOTS SBC is the latest special challenge in EA FC 24 Ultimate Team. It's another with lower requirements and a single, easy task. 


For tonight's content, EA Sports has decided to release a TOTS item from the NWSL. She can be a great fit with other items like Alex Morgan and Sophia Smith, who are available in different packs. To get this card, you'll have to complete Huerta's SBC before it expires from Ultimate Team. 


What are the EA FC 24 Sofia Huerta TOTS SBC tasks?


The latest TOTS SBC is extremely easy to complete, as it has only one task. The solo task does have certain conditions, but this is a perfect challenge to complete for beginners. 


Task 1 - Sofia Huerta



Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW


Min. Team Rating: 83



You'll need to use at least one TOTS or TOTW item, and my suggestion will be to use the latter. The 83+ TOTW Pick SBC allows players to craft as many items as they want in exchange for lower-rated fodder. TOTS items have higher ratings, and are far more expensive to get. It's best to save them for SBCs that require higher-rated squads.

EA FC 24 Sofia Huerta TOTS SBC Cheapest Solutions


While there's just one task, always go for the cheapest solution. This will help you to preserve in-game resources, or use them in other content like the Henrikh Mkhitaryan TOTS SBC. 


Task 1 - Sofia Huerta



Melvine Malard 82


Jadon Sancho 82


Leah Galton 83


Alana Cook 82


Klara Buhl 83


Mathilde Bourdieu 83


Joao Palhinha 83


Sophie Schmidt 83


Gaetan Laborde 82


Jorginho 83


Nicolas Otamendi TOTW 84



The Sofia Huerta TOTS SBC certainly offers a lot of value in EA FC 24, and the 92-rated RB item can play in several positions. It also has the Whipped Cross+ and Intercept+ playstyles, along with H/H work-rates. This item, in many ways, is a cheap beast like last evening's Albert Gudmundsson Serie A TOTS card.

Outbreak Refined III is a short chain of missions with the most difficult part being locating two switches in the labryinthe Zero Hour mission and completing the run within 20 minutes. Here's how to beat it with no wasted time searching.


Where to find the final pair of switches in Destiny 2 Zero Hour


Just like the previous two quests in this chain, you'll need to speak with Ada-1 in the Tower's Annex to acquire the Outbreak Refined III quest. Should you be skipping ahead or planning on rushing through them before The Final Shape is released, here are the other two guides.



Outbreak Refined I


Outbreak Refined II



The first step in Outbreak Refined III requires defeating Fallen in The Devils' Lair strike to collect Inert SIVA Clusters. This can be launched by selecting it from the Cosmodrome map in the Director. I had this complete by the time my fireteam reached Sepiks Prime, so you shouldn't have to worry about multiple runs.

As for the switches themselves, they're on the wall section. Instead of jumping left like you normally would, go right to find the first switch. From there, head left as you normally would. Once you reach the final drain, there will be a series of small pipes with grates on them, stacked three high. Jump all the way to the top for the second switch.


From there, it's just a matter of completing Zero Hour on Legend. Since this final pair of switches isn't out of the way, your fireteam shouldn't have too much difficulty hitting them and then taking down the boss.

Lampylumen Ore spawns almost exclusively around Tiger's Maw, the region directly south of Jinzhou. While you'll occasionally spot this resource in other areas, Tiger's Maw is your best bet for farming this material, as it spawns in abundance around the facility and the surrounding landscape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Euro 2024 promo could be a surprise hit with EA FC 24 Ultimate Team players and breathe new life into it following the TOTS celebrations.


Euro 2024 will kick off in June and pit the best of Europe against each other. To celebrate this special tournament, EA Sports is reportedly planning to release an exclusive promo in Ultimate Team. While the developers have remained tight-lipped as of this writing, FUT Scoreboard, a reliable source for leaks in the past, has provided the information on X.


When will the Euro 2024 promo release in EA FC 24?


For now, it's all speculation, but our best guess places a Euro 24 promo for EA FC 24 on June 14. The actual Euro 2024 begins on June 14, too, with the first contest featuring Germany and Scotland. We're assuming it'll go live around the same time, putting it a week after the EA FC 24 TOTS promo ends on June 7.


As things stand, it's unclear what plans EA Sports has for the unique promo. The upcoming set of cards could create the same frenzy we saw earlier in FIFA 23 when the World Cup-themed items were released. For the time being, it's best to wait patiently until EA Sports makes the news official. 




There haven't been many rumors so far, as the TOTS promo is active. However, the leaks indicate that the Euro 2024 promo could have its own versions of Heroes and Icons. The Heroes and Icons are always pretty popular, and a new version will certainly incentivize many players to continue playing after the TOTS promo.


It will be interesting to find out which footballers will get unique cards in EA FC 24 as part of the Euro promo. For the time being, players can start preparing for the Ultimate TOTS promo, which goes live on Friday, May 31. It will feature some of the best rewards from the previous TOTS lineups and give the community a great chance to get their hands on some really strong items.

The patriotic and maniacal leader of The Seven shows no quarter to his new MK adversaries, obliterating them with an offensive style that is very reminiscent of Superman‚Äôs playstyle in the Injustice series. The trailer also shows off the new DLC Kameo fighter Ferra, the smaller, more feral half of the Ferra & Torr team from Mortal Kombat X, who also joins the game sometime in June.¬†


Homelander joins Peacemaker, Invincible‚Äôs Omni-Man, Ermac, Quan-Chi, and the upcoming Takeda in the Year 1 DLC roster. Mortal Kombat 1 also has a story expansion on the way, but there‚Äôs still no word on what that will entail or when it will arrive.¬†

Last month, Bandai Namco unveiled a first look at That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime ISEKAI Chronicles, an upcoming RPG based on the popular anime series. The game isn't set to come our way until 8th August, but to keep us going until then, the publisher has revealed the opening movie in all its animated glory.
If you were wondering how closely the game will stick to its anime source material, we'd wager that this opening movie will give you a hint. Fans of the anime will see more than a few familiar faces here, but the game promises new storylines and characters from author Fuse so there will still be a few surprises along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has announced that their next State of Play is coming up tomorrow (May 30). This kicks off the deluge of streams where publishers show off their upcoming games around the wreckage of where E3 once stood.


The exact timing for the State of Play stream is May 30 at 3pm PT / 6pm ET | May 31 12am CEST / 7am JST.


The stream is set to be over 30 minutes long, and Sony is stating that it will feature 14 titles. It will cover updates on PS5 and PS VR2 titles, plus a look at PlayStation Studios games arriving later this year.


Aside from that, there aren‚Äôt many hints on what‚Äôs going to be at the stream. There have been teases at a new Astro Bot game, but nothing really aside from that. There‚Äôs potential that Insomniac‚Äôs Wolverine game might make an appearance, but that still seems like a long way off.




Otherwise, I‚Äôm hoping for a new Intelligence Qube. Maybe a new Twisted Metal. I‚Äôm a simple person. I‚Äôd just like to see something from the properties that Sony seems to have forgotten about.


The stream will be viewable on Twitch, YouTube, and TikTok.

But what if I told you there's a way to work around the issue and get your game running at least a little closer to how it was meant to be?  


So that you can experience its key moments as intended, here's how to fix the delayed audio in cutscenes bug in Wuthering Waves.


How to fix the cutscene audio delay bug in Wuthering Waves


When faced with the issue during the final cutscenes of the available main storyline, I was able to decrease the delay to an almost unnoticeable degree by disabling V-Sync and changing my screen mode to Windowed. You can find the option to do both by heading to Graphic Settings whi‚Ä¶]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-05-29T15:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hive Jump 2: Survivors arrives in Steam Early Access today. To celebrate, publisher Midwest Games and developer Graphite Lab have shared an exclusive trailer for the Survivors-like sequel. The first Hive Jump caught our eye way back in 2015 when we named it one of the most promising indie titles on display at PAX West that year before its launch in 2017. The original Hive Jump served as a four-player co-op homage to Super Metroid, but Hive Jump 2: Survivors takes inspiration from a different title: Vampire Survivors.
The genre, called "bullet heaven," puts players in the shoes of a single character who eventually builds up to become extremely powerful as the waves of enemies grow more intense. Hive Jump 2: Survivors carries forward the look of its Metroidvania predecessor but from the genre-standard top-down perspective. You take control of a lone survivor of an alien attack who must now face seemingly insurmountable odds to survive. You can customize your loadout and upgrade your jetpack to destroy enemies and escape tough situations.
The jetpack also allows you to traverse the levels in ways not available in Vampire Survivors. The Jumpers have specific builds that allow you to cater to your play style, which combines with the upgrades you select before each run. You can play with auto-assist aiming or switch to manual controls. If you can survive 14 rounds, you can challenge big boss battles. As you collect goo from fallen enemies, you can earn better weapons, upgrades, and relics to improve your odds. Meanwhile, amber you find in the field can be traded for permanent upgrades to stats, magnets for auto-scavenging, or even screen-wiping nukes.
You can see an exclusive look at the Early Access launch trailer below.


Hive Jump 2: Survivors launches into Steam Early Access today. For more on the work produced by Graphite Lab, check out our review of their 2023 2D platformer, Mr. Run and Jump,¬†here.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-05-29T14:56:42.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new trailer for the second season of NieR: Automata Ver1.1a just dropped, bringing exciting new information about the second course of NieR: Automata's beautiful but beleaguered anime adaptation to the series' fans. Among these new tidbits was an estimated release window of July 2024.


Carrying the weight of the world




According to the trailer, which premiered simultaneously on X and Aniplex's official YouTube page, the second season of NieR: Automata Ver1.1a will premiere sometime in July of this year. If the first season of NieR: Automata Ver1.1a is anything to go off of, the second season will feature a total of twelve episodes, meaning that its run will probably wrap up in either August or September, depending on when in July it premieres.


While the second season is currently set to be released in the summer, NieR: Automata Ver1.1a developed a reputation for its production schedule. The first season was infamously marred with COVID-related production issues that caused it to be delayed twice, so NieR fans have a right to be a little skeptical about the schedule for the second phase of 2B and 9S's adventures.


The first season of NieR: Automata Ver1.1a adapted a version of the game's story through Endings A and B, which are only two of the five endings that players need to arrive at to gain a complete understanding of NieR's events. Given what we see in the trailer, the second cour will likely adapt Endings C through E, which completely flip the story of NieR: Automata on its head and turn what appears to be a story of humanoid androids warring against robots into something a bit more complicated.

Sony has no additional details, but Some PlayStation Studios developers we have not heard from in awhile include Asobi (Astro's Playroom), Bend Studio (Days Gone), Bluepoint (Demon's Souls remake) , Guerrilla (Horizon Zero Dawn), Housemarque (Returnal), Insomniac Games (Spider-Man), Naughty Dog (The Last of Us), Santa Monica Studio (God of War), and Sucker Punch (Ghost of Tsushima). There are more, but those are arguably the developers gamers would be most excited to receive updates from.
At the very, very least, I am hoping for an Astro Bot: Rescue Mission PlayStation VR2 port.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A nest of Namco nonograms.
It‚Äôs been rough out there for poor Picross fans during this generation, as they‚Äôve been cruelly starved for content with only 23 game releases on Switch (if you count the 'e' series) that offer up a paltry sum of over 5,000 puzzles to solve. Those puzzles aren‚Äôt even all original either‚Äîif you really want to be pedantic, the Mega Picross puzzles are usually repeats.
But it‚Äôs all going to be okay now. After the success of a Sega-themed Picross S Genesis & Master System Edition release a few years ago, Jupiter has now committed to another crossover, this time borrowing from Namco‚Äôs extensive arcade history with Picross S Namco Legendary Edition. What does this mean for you? Well, it‚Äôs another few hundred puzzles to complete, but this time some of them might have Pac-Man characters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A producer on Kerbal Space Program 2 has confirmed that those working on the space flight sim are being laid off en masse. We already knew that the developers at Intercept Games would be losing their jobs thanks to a closure announcement from Washington State. Until remarks from Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two Interactive, muddied the waters. Zelnick refused to acknowledge that the studio was being closed when asked by a reporter, even going so far as to claim the opposite. "We didn't shutter those studios," he told IGN. But it seems clear from one producer's testimony that Zelnick's remarks are inaccurate.

Celeste composer and game developer Lena Raine has revealed her latest project ANOTHEREAL, a shmup RPG that combines exploration, puzzle-solving, and tense combat encounters.
Though a Switch release has not been confirmed at the time of writing, we remain hopeful that the eventual Steam release will pave the way for more platform launches (and maybe our enthusiasm will give publisher Radical Dreamland a bit of a nudge!). Similarly, a release date has not yet been set, so we could be in for a bit of a wait.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.
Created by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2's new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer's favourite - on which you'll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings.

Lidia follows on the heels of Eddy Gordo as the two revealed Year 1 season pass fighters. Owners of Tekken 8‚Äôs Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions automatically receive these fighters. Each can also be purchased individually for $7.99. Two more fighters remain in the Year 1 pass, who will be added during the fall and winter

Team 17 and Catchweight Studio have revealed Conscript, a new survival horror set in World War 1 (or The Great War), heading to the Switch later this year.
No specific release date has been set at the time of writing, but if you want a taste of the action, a Steam demo will be made available from 10th June 2024. Judging from the trailer, however, it looks like the title takes a bit of inspiration from the critically acclaimed Signalis, which hit the Switch back in 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the biggest reasons Xbox acquired Activision Blizzard was for the Call of Duty series, a first-person shooter that has dominated the best-selling games list for decades. This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one.
We don't know much about the game yet, but two live-action teasers have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say,¬†"The truth lies." The second, released today, can be seen below.


It features world leaders' black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game's full title, along with a reminder that the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox's summer showcase.

The last Silent Hill Transmission happened in 2022 and revealed a surprising amount of Silent Hill news including the reveal of the remake of Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill f, a new Silent Hill movie, and more.
The post announcing the event reads, "Consider this your invitation letter to Silent Hill. ‚úâÔ∏è Tune in May 30 at 4 p.m. PDT to our SILENT HILL YouTube channel for the second installment of the #SILENTHILL Transmission where we'll share game updates, a deeper look at the film, and new merch."
The safe bet is a teaser trailer for the movie and hopefully new details about the Silent Hill 2 remake and Silent Hill f, the latter of which seems like the franchise's next big original entry. Silent Hill Ascension, the online mobile narrative game where players dictated the story choices, also finished up its first season (though the developer may have a different term for it), so it's possible we may learn what's next for that game.]]></summary>

You‚Äôll quickly realise this a school-with-no-trousers-esque dream sequence, but the matted mess of thick black cables that carpet this dingy side-stage is painfully accurate. Pissing around with gear is roughly 70% of the band experience, in my limited experience of being in bands.

If you haven‚Äôt seen the trailer for Kingmakers, I encourage you to watch it now before continuing. If you have, or perhaps you are reading this magazine in an effort to limit screen time (you‚Äôre doing great, and we appreciate your support), I can‚Äôt continue to talk about the game without spoiling its major twist. The trailer teases what appears to be a medieval strategy game with base-building elements before a contemporary, but admittedly junky truck screams through time to arrive in the middle of a battlefield brimming with horses, suits of armor, and presumably the shouting of old English phrases, but it‚Äôs difficult to hear through the chaos.

It had a simple premise: Your character flees through a crumbling urban landscape, making great leaps across rooftops at the touch of your phone screen. It met great success and charted in what was then only a burgeoning mobile game ecosystem. Canabalt popularized the infinite runner genre and would ultimately put its designer, Adam Saltsman, on the map.
Now working under the name of Finji as its creative director, Adam‚Äôs rise as a designer as well as his partner‚Äôs, Bekah Saltsman, as both a publisher and CEO, has been stunning to watch, especially considering the simplicity of that first big hit.

During that conversation, Nakayama shared an intriguing anecdote about how important Ed was to the development of Street Fighter 6.
When the team sits down to decide on the characters, they think of balancing out the roster not only in style, but through the regions and countries the characters represent. However, the story of the game ‚Äìin Street Fighter 6's case, World Tour ‚Äì also plays a big role.

It would be another nine years before Expend4bles shook things up with a new title format but little else had changed. Expendables movies come with a three-point guarantee: lots of explosions, a solid 6/10 aggregate score on the Internet Movie Database, and thousands of people being monitored on BitTorrent so they can be sued at a later date. Almost 3,000 now face action in Canada's Federal Court.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is out this week, but the starting line for developer Ninja Theory's foray into the world of action games with a focus on performance capture began with Heavenly Sword. Released in 2007 for the PlayStation 3, the game featured Andy Serkis just a few years removed from his work on the Lord of the Rings films, and is a weird action game that has incredible moments of action that doesn't last quite as long as you'd like. It's a special game to me, however, and one I am always happy to revisit. I am pessimistic, but I would love to play a version of the game at 60 FPS.

We learned about the upcoming VR game (releasing June 13 on Quest), why the American Comedy Central version of the show didn't work, whether or not it is time to give an American version another shot, and what it is like to meet yourself in VR. So without further ado... it's little Alex Horne!

That near-decade has brought a whole heap of additions, expansions, packs and updates to the enduring life sim game, to the degree that the underlying tech serving as the foundation for dozens of later mechanical and visual elements can sometimes look a bit wobbly these days.

We're not going to talk about any of that hoity-toity quantum wheeling-and-dealing in this piece, however. We're going to talk about the fact that the opening stretch reminded me of Gears Of War and the many over-the-shoulder adventures it has influenced. I'm sorry. It's been a complicated week involving minimal sleep, and I no longer have the grey cells for branching timelines, though they are certainly the more fascinating aspect of this game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Asus ROG Ally X, a sort of semi-sequel to last year‚Äôs ROG Ally handheld PC, has had its specs spilled over at Videocardz. I‚Äôm usually a lot more suspicious of hardware leaks, which are often just out-of-date or otherwise inaccurate info, but I‚Äôve also sat through enough mic-muted prebriefings to know an official slideshow when I see one, and that appears to be exactly what Videocardz got its hands on. Besides, these specs include a gigantic 80Whr battery upgrade (doubling the ROG Ally‚Äôs 40Whr capacity), so we can at least file this under "News James wants to be true."

Warhammer is big, so it needs must have multiple of them, hence their yearly event Skulls, which collates a bunch of Games Workshop related announcements into a sort of bizzaro world Nintendo Direct if Yoshi was actually a parasitic corpse emperor. There‚Äôs usually at least a few game announcements in there, and this year was a bumper. The headline announcement being an upcoming sequel to well-loved space-pope turn-based strategy Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus. Yes, yes. I‚Äôm getting to the dog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Videogames and especially role-playing games are chock-full of sheltered upbringings that go tits up. Innocent times and places like the prologue for Baldur's Gate, which unfolds in the vast, fortified monastery of Candlekeep (beware spoilers from this point on).
BioWare's first ever RPG opens with your unsuspecting Chosen One learning the ropes from the old sage Gorion. There are fetchquests that take you around the enormous citadel, bits of combat training to do, cosy formative chinwags to have with characters like your childhood friend Imoen. But it's not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer. When you return to Candlekeep later in the game, this once-proud bastion of learning has been filled with doppelgangers of Gorion and other acquaintances, a parade of chatbots waiting to stab you in the back.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Game Informer¬†revealed the exclusive first details and screenshots of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the video game set after the events of 2023 film,¬†Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. Following that March reveal, developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games has largely gone quiet. Today, the publisher revealed what players can expect from the Deluxe and Collector's Editions of Mutants Unleashed if they want to splurge on the game when it arrives later this year.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed allows you to take control of the four turtles in a 3D brawler/platformer for up to two players. The premium editions of the game will provide additional physical goodies for fans of the franchise. The Deluxe Edition includes the game, an exclusive steelbook, four pin badges, four keychains, and an artbook. Meanwhile, the Collector's Edition includes the game, Season Pass, pizza van statue, LED sign, five pin badges, four patches, a mouse mat, notebook, pen, artbook, poster, stickers, and a collector's box. The Deluxe Edition retails for $60, while the Collector's Edition will set you back $200.
Oddly enough, both the Deluxe and Collector's Editions are exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and Switch versions of the game. If you're not planning to experience this title on those systems, but still want to at least play through the game, you're in luck, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleahsed arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year.
For more on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in video games, be sure to read our in-depth feature on the history of the video game franchise here, and if you want something else to look forward to, read a comment from TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman on the upcoming video game based on The Last Ronin here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acquisitions have been rampant in the games industry recently. While the prime example on everyone's mind is likely Xbox's recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard, several have already occurred in 2024. The latest was announced today by Atari, which¬†confirmed it is acquiring its longtime rival, Intellivision.
Atari announced it has purchased the Intellivision brand and more than 200 games from Intellvision Entertainment. As part of the deal, Intellivision Entertainment will rebrand and continue developing and distributing the Amico game console with a license from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on the console. Atari will also look to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore licensing opportunities.¬†
"This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision, and the golden age of gaming," chairman and CEO of Atari Wade Rosen said in a press release.¬†
"Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellvision brand," CEO of Intellivision Entertainment Phil Adam said. "We look forward to our expanded collaboration and bringing a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles to the Amico and Amico Home family gaming platforms."
Atari has been experiencing a bit of a re-emergence in the public consciousness lately. In addition to other acquisitions, such as Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, Atari has also published well-received games like Mr. Run and Jump and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. For more on Atari's outlook and current strategy, be sure to listen to a 2023 episode of All Things Nintendo, which featured an in-depth conversation with Wade Rosen right here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Xbox revealed the date of its summer showcase, it included a mysterious teaser. Immediately following the presentation, there will be a second livestream to highlight an upcoming game in a "beloved" series. Today, the subject of that showcase has been revealed, and surprising no one, it's a new Call of Duty game.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a title that might confuse some, seeing as there technically isn't a game titled Black Ops 5. This is because the fifth entry of the sub-series, which launched in 2021, was Black Ops Cold War, temporarily removing the numbered naming convention. The news was announced on social media, but was accompanied by a teaser on YouTube that seems to hint at the events of the game's campaign.


The 40-second clip follows a group of people sneaking onto the top of Mount Rushmore, where they place blindfolds over the eyes of the presidents carved into the mountainside. The first three blindfolds read, "The truth lies," while the fourth features a three-headed wolf logo that was used in the initial redacted teaser of the game.
The game will be revealed in full during a presentation on Saturday, June 9, immediately following the Xbox showcase that will start at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. Microsoft is reportedly debating on whether or not the launch the game on Game Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I‚Äôve always thought the race towards graphical hyperrealism isn‚Äôt as pervasive as it's often perceived, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is definitely one of those games. The kind that probably has twelve artists dedicated to the recreation of visible pores, that sort of thing. It‚Äôs so focused on looking pretty that it hasn‚Äôt even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.
Sure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it‚Äôs no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.

This is just one of many laughs your diaphragm will endure as you navigate "the escalating adventures of a girl trying to make zines in a town of giallo-style masked serial murderers". The horror comedy already won its creators the Nuovo Award at the Independent Games Festival this year, recognition that has been a long time coming for prolific game maker Stephen "thecatamites" Gillmurphy. If you're unfamiliar with his work, you can get acquainted next week, when Anthology of the Killer gets its full release on Itch.io on May 28th.  At which point you can explore its unsettling urban hell of shady corporations and cops who think they're cool. There's a trailer below.

As such, I‚Äôm accepting defeat. Obviously with apologies to any studious Steam Deck Academy readers.

Massimiliano Capitanio notes that Google's defense failed the moment it became more than a passive host. "The same line should be adopted to eradicate piracy," Capitanio says.

Lorelei and the Laser Eyes‚Äô setup is bland compared to the others in the puzzle genre. You are a bespectacled woman carrying a clutch who walks with incredible poise into a mansion with little understanding of why you are there or what you are doing. The lack of context doesn‚Äôt matter, though, because the game immediately showers you with an incredible sense of mood. You may not know why you are petting the dog in the courtyard, checking every door, or reading every scrap of paper you come across initially, but you want to be there and see everything the game has to offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We‚Äôve known since October 2022 that Season 3 of Netflix‚Äôs The Witcher would be actor Henry Cavill‚Äôs last as Geralt of Rivia and that Liam Hemsworth would don the silvery mane going forward. Today, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for Season 4 giving fans their first look at Hemsworth in the role.


Unfortunately, Hemsworth doesn‚Äôt speak in the brief clip, so we still don‚Äôt know how his Geralt voice compares to Cavill‚Äôs (or the games, for that matter). But he definitely doesn‚Äôt look out of place as the White Wolf and, hopefully, won‚Äôt be too much of a distraction in this new season.
Season 4 is currently in production in the UK and will be filmed back-to-back with Season 5, which will also be the show's finale. It has no release date but is speculated to premiere in 2025. These last two seasons will cover the three remaining Witcher books: Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake. The returning cast includes Anya Chalotra (Yennifer) and¬†Freya Allan¬†(Ciri).¬†

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crytek has announced the release date for Hunt: Showdown‚Äôs new-gen update, which will also conclude support for the current console versions. This update was first announced last September and will essentially force last-gen players to migrate to current consoles to continue playing the popular shooter.¬†
In a developer update, general manager David Fifield announced that the CryEngine 5.11 Update will go live on August 15. This update is treated as a ‚Äúsignificant relaunch‚Äù that brings native PS5/Xbox Series X/S support along with a host of technical improvements. However, it also means the PS4 and Xbox One versions will become unplayable.
That means these players must upgrade to current hardware to continue playing their copies of the game.¬†Crytek assures these players that if they decide to upgrade, player accounts, entitlements, and all owned DLC will transfer to the new-gen version for no extra cost.¬†


In addition to technical improvements, the 5.11 Update also introduces a new map and biome. In the months leading to 5.11‚Äôs launch, Crytek plans to address community and survey feedback. That includes improved reporting systems to address cheating and toxic player behavior, design reworks tackling hunter revival, health chunks, restorations, burning down hunters, and reducing stalemates. The game is also getting a new user interface, and Crytek will continue evolving the game's recruitment and prestige progression requirements.¬†
Hunt: Showdown first launched for Xbox and PC in 2019, with the PS4 version arriving in 2020. The PvPvE first-person shooter is set in 1865 Louisiana as players, either alone or with two or three friends, hunt supernatural bounties in the bayou while fending off other player-controlled bounty hunters.¬†

Liam has created a spreadsheet of things we're ticking off to prepare for the upcoming expansion, and I think it's the perfect summation of what the game is to us: something that makes no sense at all and yet something that makes our brains hum with happiness.
And what we've found with Destiny, in all of its bloat, is that we haven't explored for a single second since our return. Everything is accomplished through menus, making it quite Starfield-esque, which is terrible‚Ä¶ but also good. We can't make sense of it and we don't think we ever will.

After years spent representing movie rightsholders, the law firm felt copyright law should be interpreted as granting it rightsholder-like powers to obtain names, addresses, and similar information, without the rightsholders themselves having to be part of the action.

The pre-rendered trailer features no gameplay (as near as I can tell) and tells the story of Miquella and the war that sent them to the Land of Shadow. The footage hints at a location around the Lands Between that you and others will presumably visit.


Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC will be released on June 21 and will not be a standalone expansion. It requires ownership of the original game and will cost¬†$39.99.

On June 13, you can purchase the following titles on Steam:

Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 +2.5 ReMIX
Kingdom Hearts Final Mix
Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories
Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days (HD remastered cinematics)
Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix
Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix

The franchise‚Äôs move to Steam also comes shortly after Square Enix announced it would ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù pursue a multi-platform strategy after Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Final Fantasy XVI fell short of sales expectations. The publisher is in the midst of a structural reform that led to a swath of layoffs across its California and UK offices last week.]]></summary>

The Mario brand of RPG represents some of my favorite adventures in the genre. The comedic tone, inviting art, and active battle systems have always been highlights for me, but Thousand-Year Door was a personal blind spot. I played prior and subsequent Mario RPGs, but I skipped it when the original was released in 2004, and notably was not yet employed at Game Informer at the time. With Nintendo remastering the acclaimed RPG for Switch, I welcomed the excuse to finally play it. I am impressed by how improved the‚Ä¶]]></summary>

Until fairly recently the nearly 15-game-strong series, where Disney characters cross over with Final Fantasy and go to war alongside a child wielding a key (I said I don't properly understand it), wasn't on PC. After some games arrived on the Epic Games Store in 2021, Squeenix have confirmed that multiple Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Steam next month, on June 13th. Unlucky for some, maybe, but not Donald Duck and Goofy, two of the main characters. Long has Goofy been seen as just a joke character in the minds of people people who didn't watch A Goofy Movie. Hopefully this brings his heroism to a wider audience.

Its strategy fundamentals were already strong enough to impress me in 2022 that it's been quite tricky to even remember what's changed.

And you know what? It's great! From early reveals and previews I thought it might veer into being too wacky, but it nails its tone, has some really striking levels, and bugs in earlier builds have been squashed (much as you can manually splat small parasites that make their way into your hospital). I can see this becoming a go-to comfort game for me.

Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands looked funny and all, but it‚Äôs a turn-based RPG, a subgenre that usually elicits the same amount of enthusiasm from me as the phrase "by Ernest Cline" does from Alice. Deathbulge, however, is a clever little sod of a game, managing to devise not only a turn-based combat system that avoids the usual waiting-around tedium but one that‚Äôs outright good fun in itself.

It's the game that laid the groundwork for experiences like Bioshock, 2017's Prey, and many more in the genre, and the remake is both faithful and impressively contemporary. Join Wesley LeBlanc, Marcus Stewart, and me for a look at the game's opening moments on Xbox Series X and a discussion about the state of the genre that System Shock arguably invented.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are management games and there are micro-management games. Prison Architect 2 is the latter. I don't mean this as an annoying thing, like when Harold from corporate starts commenting all over your document at 4.30pm on a Friday. I mean it as a distinction between those games that let you plop down a house, and others that need you to stack the bricks, install the plumbing, fit the lights, and select the wallpaper. The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn't finished yet, but it's taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.

Games have released the launch trailer for its upcoming platform fighter, MultiVersus, seemingly revealing¬†Friday the 13th's¬†Jason Voorhees and The Matrix's¬†Agent Smith as new roster additions. This trailer arrives just a few weeks after we learned MultiVersus finally (re)launches next week.¬†
After roughly two minutes of MultiVersus hijinks with various characters from the game, the Joker, which we recently learned is joining the game with a voice by Mark Hamill, is seen sitting on¬†the Iron Throne of¬†Game of Thrones¬†fame. Then, mysteriously, Jason and Agent Smith appear beside him, likely alluding to them joining the launch day roster.¬†
Check it out for yourself in the MultiVersus launch trailer below:¬†


MultiVersus is a free-to-play game and will launch on May 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.¬†

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios, the team behind last year's Baldur's Gate 3, has opened a new studio in Warsaw, Poland. Larian Studios Warsaw is the developer-publisher's seventh studio worldwide, and joins others in Barcelona, Dublin, Gent, Guildford, Kuala Lumpur, and Quebec.¬†
"With two very ambitious RPGs now starting development, what better way to see our visions realized than by growing our team and opening a 7th studio in the heart of Poland's lively gaming scene," the company's announcement post on X (formerly) Twitter reads.¬†


As for what those two RPGs are, don't expect a sequel to Baldur's Gate 3. Despite winning countless awards last year, including Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2023, Larian's CEO revealed back in March that the studio is done with both Baldur's Gate 3 ‚Äì so no expansions ‚Äì and the Baldur's Gate series in general.¬†
Over on a separate blog post about Larian Studios Warsaw, the company talks about its plans with seven worldwide studios open now.¬†
"Larian Studios set up base in one of the greatest RPG development hubs in the world ‚Äì Poland, where we opened our doors in the historic city of Warsaw," the blog post reads. "Like its sister studios across the globe, Larian Studios Warsaw is dedicated to fostering an environment where developers can thrive creatively and reclaim their agency. Systems-heavy RPGs need best-in-class developers; that's why we've put the people who build those systems at the center of our culture."¬†

My brand new fancy shmancy ottoman bed is arriving in my new flat, after two weeks of curling up on the sofa with a weighted blanket. I'll also be topping it with my brand new ultra-thick memory foam mattress topper, raising me off the floor another crucial few inches. Think of the view I'll get from up there! To imagine there'll be any time for games! Pah!
I kid. Plenty of time for games for us all, even while reclining on gloriously beds with ungodly amounts of storage space. We love playing games here at Rock Paper Shotgun. Even Alice, who has routinely told me that actually there are no good games. Here's what we'll be clicking on this weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five Nights At Freddy‚Äôs 2, the sequel to the 2023 film adaptation of the popular horror game, has a premiere date. Freddy Fazbear and friends will return to the big screen on December 5, 2025.
As reported by Variety, Blumhouse Productions announced the date alongside a slate of other upcoming films, including M3GAN 2.0 and The Black Phone 2. It's not surprising to see Five Nights At Freddy‚Äôs getting a follow-up. It simultaneously premiered in theaters and on Peacock on October 27, 2023, and still managed to be a massive box office success. Grossing $297 million globally, it became the year's highest-grossing horror film,¬†Blumhouse‚Äôs highest-grossing film ever, and the most-watched movie on Peacock for five straight days.¬†
The tagline for Five Nights At Freddy's 2 reads, "Anyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances." The sequel‚Äôs cast has not been announced, but the original starred Josh Hutchinson and included Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Piper Rubio. Director Emma Tammi is returning to direct the sequel, with FNAF creator Scott Cawthorn and Blumhouse founder Jason Blum once again assuming producer roles.¬†
FNAF 2 won't be the only video game film arriving in 2025. Mortal Kombat 2, the sequel to the 2021 reboot film, was recently confirmed to release in October of that year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a great time to be a Fallout fan, thanks to its excellent Amazon Prime series and the next-gen update for Fallout 4. But it seems like the fallout from this recent boom in popularity hasn't died down quite yet. Thanks to a teaser shared on Fortnite's official social media pages, we know that Fallout will be coming to Fortnite pretty soon
pic.twitter.com/AKjFXVnHST
May 17, 2024
The teaser image shows power armor in a cloud of orange dust, accompanied by what appears to be some sort of industrial building. Other than that, there's not much to go on, but we can make educated guesses. For one, Fortnite's current season will end on May 24, so this is the perfect time to tease the skins that might be coming in the next battle pass. And if it's anything like the recent Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars crossovers, we might see Fallout-themed mechanics or areas appear on the battle royale map itself.
It will almost certainly involve some sort of cosmetic pack as well, which could include characters from the games, the Amazon Prime show, or both. Thanks to the teaser, we know power armor will be making an appearance, but it's unclear whether it will be an item to equip in-game or a skin that can be unlocked or purchased.
For more Fortnite news, read about its recent crossover with¬†Billie Eilish, its decision to allow players to block certain emotes, and its¬†huge and mysterious collaboration with Disney.

It quietly does several things in a modest little way, that are all the more impressive for its lack of fanfare. The core one though, is that it takes the kind of simulationist foundation normally reserved for the punishing Dwarf Fortress derivatives or gnarly logistics games, and builds on them an approachable, gentle, even philosophical game instead. In a word: it's lovely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, EA Sports College Football 25‚Äôs cover athletes and release date were revealed. Today, the game‚Äôs first full trailer provides the look at it in action.¬†
The trailer shows that EA is seemingly going all out to replicate the pomp and passion of college football, with over-the-top team entrances, marching band performances, and mascots galore. It remains to be seen how fun or different the on-field action is compared to its Madden counterpart, but the game at least seems to capture the school spirit.¬†


EA also released a batch of new screenshots, which you can view in this gallery.¬†

EA Sports College Football 25 launches on July 19 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. You can learn more about its various editions, pricing, and features here.]]></summary>

The same requirement, you might recall, that Helldivers 2 players recently lobbied Sony into abandoning. No such luck here, and as previously warned, the need for said PSN sign-in to happen over Windows means that Ghost of Tsushima is essentially missing a chunk of itself on the Steam Deck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hades II has taken the gaming world by storm, and I'm not just saying that because it's the subject of our current cover story. But while many have been surprised by the sheer volume of content available so far, it's still in Early Access, so the team at Supergiant will be updating and patching it for the foreseeable future. The first of those patches came today, and it adds a few small quality-of-life improvements.
Our first Early Access patch for Hades II is out now on Steam and the Epic Games Store!! We're very grateful for all the feedback so far, which inspired this first set of targeted improvements and fixes.

        <updated>2024-05-17T14:10:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft is reportedly planning to launch this year's Call of Duty on its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, according to¬†The Wall Stree Journal. This follows reports in previous weeks indicating Microsoft and Xbox were mulling over whether or not to launch the next iteration in the franchise on Game Pass, out of fear it might hurt sales.¬†
After acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion last year, fans and analysts have speculated about how Microsoft will handle the Call of Duty franchise moving forward. It will obviously be a big draw for Xbox Game Pass, pulling in new subscribers, but most every year, the new Call of Duty is the best-selling game of the year ‚Äì save for last year, where Hogwarts Legacy took that crown ‚Äì and a Game Pass launch could affect those sales numbers.¬†


However, this new report from¬†The Wall Street Journal¬†seemingly clears the air around that topic.¬†
"Microsoft plans a major shake up of its video game sales strategy by releasing the coming installment of Call of Duty to its subscription service instead of the longtime, lucrative approach of only selling it a la carte," the story reads.¬†
Of course, things could change so we'll see what happens. It's likely we'll be learning what the next Call of Duty game is next month as part of the gaming showcase summer that includes Summer Game Fest, Ubisoft Forward, and an Xbox Games Showcase followed by a secret direct that is probably focused on Call of Duty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2K will reveal the next iteration of one of its biggest franchises at Summer Game Fest. Fans online are already speculating what it could be, considering some of 2K's biggest franchises are prime for a new game.¬†
As for when to expect this new game, the official SGF X (formerly Twitter) account says it will be announced on June 7, during the Summer Game Fest livestream that begins at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET. That's less than a month away so we don't have to speculate too long on what this mystery iteration could be.¬†

May 16, 2024
While there are plenty of 2K franchises that fit the bill, our eyes are on three franchises: Borderlands, Mafia, and BioShock.¬†
The last mainline Borderlands entry ‚Äì Borderlands 3 ‚Äì hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2019, and with the live-action¬†Borderlands¬†movie hitting theaters this August, a new game would make sense. However, we did just get New Tales From The Borderlands in 2022, if you're looking for something to play through in that universe.¬†
On the Mafia front, the last mainline entry was Mafia III in 2016, although 2K released Mafia: Definitive Edition ‚Äì a remake ‚Äì in 2020. And we know the next Mafia game is in development, too, so it might be time for an announcement.¬†
BioShock has been dormant since BioShock Infinite in 2013, unless you count the 2016 remasters, and we know 2K created Cloud Chamber in 2019 to work on the next entry in the franchise. It's been almost five years since then, so SGF seems like a great moment to announce the next BioShock. Speaking of, here's what we want in a BioShock 4.¬†
SGF returns to Los Angeles next month, with the live showcase happening on June 7. For more, check out some of the studios, publishers, and partners to be featured during the event, and then check out¬†Game Informer's¬†summer gaming showcase schedule.¬†

Well, scratch that August release, as now it's been shifted back to September instead! But hey, there's a demo coming out real soon that'll hopefully give us a better sense of what the game's like. I imagine it'll involve a lot of fighting spindly monsters, dying, and resurrecting at whatever object they've decided will be the equivalent of Dark Souls' bonfires. Likely something Leonardo da Vinci made or drew or invented. That man's stats were specced high.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare's big fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is not a stat I'm particularly proud of. I'm not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist Corey Brickley, via the Maw, there's a lot of filler. Brickley has collated a list of suggested mods to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.
I find this list of mods interesting! It's a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it's very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller. Still, there's at least one item on there I'd push back on, but also this isn't really a new problem for Dragon Age as a series.

Buried among the chatter of "profitable growth trajectories" and "B2B partnerships" was a brief note about looter shooter The Division Heartland. "Ubisoft has decided to stop development on The Division Heartland," it reads, "and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six."
