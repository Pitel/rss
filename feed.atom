In her review, Alice Bee (RPS in peace) said that it was such a large thing it ultimately felt "small, cold and unlived in". I remember thinking the same. Would I have thought differently if it had copious amounts of gore? No. But would I have had a better time? Probably yes. Well, a former senior artist at Bethesda has revealed in an interview with Kiwi Talkz podcast (cheers VGC for the spot) that they'd originally planned for it to have decapitations but decided against them in the end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty has lost a veteran multiplayer creative director after 15 years of work on the franchise. Greg Reisdorf has called time on his stint at Sledgehammer Games, bringing a long-term collaboration to an end.

Multiplayer creative director leaves Sledgehammer Games after 15 years


In a post on X, Reisdorf confirmed his decision to leave Sledgehammer Games after a decade and a half of work. The studio's first contribution to Call of Duty was 2011's Modern Warfare 3, meaning Reisdorf had worked on every mainline Sledgehammer game in the series.


What then began was a lengthy thread detailing some of his favorite features that he worked on over the years. As it turns out, he's made quite the contribution to the franchise!




Notably, Reisdorf was responsible for the weapon signatures system, which gave each gun a unique trait to make them all feel different from one another. He went on to describe Advanced Warfare as "ahead of its time" thanks to its boots-off-the-ground movement system and claimed that the emblem editor feature seen in older titles "was a hill I would have died on," despite players using it to create unsavory imagery. 


Upon reflection, not all of the creative choices were the right way forward, though. Reisdorf claims the Pick 13 class system "should not have happened," since it made players weigh up attachments and weapons against rewards like killstreaks. Similarly, the Divisions system in Call of Duty: WWII caused serious reflection, with Reisdorf stating, "It's tough to look back and know we shipped this way." The entire thread is a fascinating glimpse behind the scenes of the last 15 years of Call of Duty, and is well worth a read.


Reisdorf has yet to reveal where he will take his talents and experience next, although he's sure to be a valuable asset to any team, especially in the FPS space.

But 'tis the start of the year and I felt like I had a duty to give some of them a proper whirl and see what's what. Thus I was lured once again into the roguelike genre, for which I am an eternal sucker.
Developed by Wave Game, Magicraft sees you play as a kid who's isekai'd into another dimension (or at least, I think he is, because I chose the option to "skip the story" when I selected new game and only later deduced the situation) and tasked to mince all the demons within it. It's typical fantasy fare with an interesting twist: you can combine any number of spells within your inventory, which made me feel very clever, even if I had no idea what I was doing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like it or not, horror gaming is often built on jump scares. Deriding a good cheap scare ignores the endorphin rush that draws so many players to the genre, in the same way that the "elevated horror" trend forfeits some of the soul of schlocky slasher flicks and ghost movies. Don’t get me wrong, Silent Hill and Alan Wake deserve their flowers - but even those games would wither on the screen if Pyramid Head didn’t bust through a wall from time to time.
One unsung jump scare game in particular pioneered horror in the internet age, blazing everywhere from nascent social media to major television networks. In fact, if you had an internet connection circa 2005, there’s a good chance you played it. Alas, it was too ahead of its time, too successful at leveraging virality before viral horror was sought after. Next time you see a streamer throw their headphones across the room in fright, beware: the spirit of Scary Maze Game is right behind you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well over a decade since both games were released, Ubisoft has added Steam achievements to Far Cry 3 and 4. 


These games launched during a period when Ubisoft's Steam support was half-baked in favor of its own service at the time, Uplay, but the studio has come back years later to add in the important feature.


Ubisoft adds Steam achievements to Far Cry 3 and 4


In a post on Steam, Ubisoft confirmed that it has gone back and added Steam achievements to Far Cry 4. The post also claimed that Far Cry 3 achievements are on the way, but when you actually take a look at the game's page, they have already been added to the older title, too.

For PC gamers who hunted for Far Cry 3 and 4 achievements on Ubisoft Connect, there's some good news. Achievements will automatically sync across the two platforms, so you won't need to complete them all over again.


Interestingly, Far Cry 3 has actually had six achievements removed, but there's a good reason for that. These achievements were focused on the game's co-op campaign, for which the online servers have already been removed. While similar achievements also exist for Far Cry 4, they can still be earned, so they remain in these new additions.


This follows a recent trend for Ubisoft, which has been adding Steam achievements to several of its older games of late. This has included titles like Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag, Unity, and Syndicate, but it's great to see Ubisoft do the same for the Far Cry series. From what we can see, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, Primal, and New Dawn are all still missing Steam achievements, but hopefully, they're in the works.


No one's quite sure why Ubisoft is doing this, but we're certainly not complaining.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bubblegum is one of the several characters available in Anime Adventures, and you can obtain him to power up your collection.


Like every Secret unit, Bubblegum is extremely strong in his base form. However, you can also unlock the Ultimate version by evolving him with the required items. This favorite character will be a favorite for those who have a soft corner for the Dragon Ball series.


Let's take a look at how you can obtain both the base and the evolved version.


How to obtain Bubblegum in Anime Adventures


Certain characters can only be obtained from banners, but thankfully, Bubblegum isn't one of them. That doesn't mean that obtaining him is easy, as you'll have to complete either Stage Four or Stage Five of the Secret Planet raid. Even if you manage to clear these stages, there's no guarantee that you'll get Bubblegum.


However, you should prioritize grinding Stage Five, as there is a 5% chance of obtaining Bubblegum. Stage Four, on the other hand, has only a 1% chance, making it very hard for you to get the Secret unit realistically.




How to Evolve Bubblegum in Anime Adventures


To evolve Bubblegum, you'll require the following resources:



400 Mage Mark: Can be obtained from the Sacred Planet raids.


12 Star Fruit: This can be obtained from the Challenges Mode. You can also purchase it from the Traveling Merchant.


1 Star Fruit (Rainbow): Can be obtained from Challenges, or purchased from the Traveling Merchant for 300 Gems.


2 Star Fruit (Blue): Can be obtained from Challenges.


3 Star Fruit (Red): Can be obtained from Challenges.


3 Star Fruit (Pink): Can be obtained from Challenges.


2 Star Fruit (Green): Can be obtained from Challenges.



Once you get all the resources, head over to the Evolve area to transform Bubblegum to Bubblegum (Ultimate).

Unsurprisingly, in retrospect, the trailer also has big The Witcher vibes. The stringy orchestral music? The dramatic monologues? The horrible things happening to armoured grunts? This thing’s really playing the Polish fantasy hits.

Tennis fans hitting YouTube to see live matches from the Australian Open could be forgiven for thinking they've accidentally clicked on a channel recreating the tournament in Wii Sports, but no.

As noted by Kotaku, the official Australian Open TV YouTube channel is broadcasting live games from the tournament with a twist. Lacking the live broadcast rights for matches, a workaround which involves capturing the player and ball movements live on the court and rendering animated versions in real-time is giving a Mii-esque spin to the Grand Slam event.

How to get Lord in Marvel Rivals


To reach Lord in Marvel Rivals, you have to master characters. It isn’t tied to competitive play or the tournament mode. What you’ll need to do is fulfill the challenges each character has, which you can find in the Heroes selection in the Main Menu.


The challenges are also repeatable and related to the playstyle of the role they’re assigned. For example, Duelist characters typically require you to get the final hit for a KO a number of times or a Vanguard has to block an amount of damage. This is then followed by something specific to their kit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many of the Vanguard mains out there in Marvel Rivals, when is The Thing supposed to be coming out in the game? When are we going to be able to clobber our foes on the battlefield?


This is everything we know so far about when The Thing should appear in Marvel Rivals.


When is The Thing coming to Marvel Rivals?


According to the developers at NetEase, we can expect The Thing to come to Marvel Rivals around “six to seven weeks” after the release of this first Season. That means he should join the roster around February 21 to the 28. The exact dates are not known yet.


He’ll also be released alongside The Human Torch.


What are The Thing’s abilities?


The Thing will be a Vanguard (tank) character, being the first new one since launch. From what we know, he’ll play similarly to The Hulk.


The following abilities are leaks, so they may not be final and are subject to change. 


Ability
Effect


Combination Punch - Normal Attack
The Thing’s default attack.


Furious Charge
A charge attack that props enemies up in the air and leaves a “seismic zone that prohibits displacement”.


Thunderbolt Punch
A stronger version of the normal attack with a cooldown.


Battlefield Support
Perform a leap that gives you damage reduction along with nearby allies within the radius. 


Solid as Rock (Passive)
Immune to crowd control effects.


Slam Moment (Ultimate)
Knocks all enemies in front of you into the air.


Fastball Special (Team-Up with Wolverine)
The same as Hulk’s Gamma Fastball. The Thing can lift Wolverine and press the button to hurl him forward.






In terms of how much damage or what the values are — like cooldowns for each ability — is yet to be determined. 


So far, The Thing can give Bruce Banner a run for his money or be yet another Vanguard who can provide excellent distractions and stalls to enemy teams.

However, although whether or not a weapon will fit you will be directly related to your personal taste, knowing which among the game's arsenal is the best can point you in the right direction. Here are the best weapons to master in Monster Hunter: World, whether you play solo or multiplayer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The "spance" of Annihilate The Spance is apparently “an ancient, roiling storm of matter and energy” that harbours both “extreme and inexplicable phenomena” and “unfathomable riches”. I’m happy to discover this explanation, because at first I thought that “spance” was just a litigation-avoiding, supermarket rebrand of “space”. I was bracing to send the good news to developers Skyglow Softworks that, so far, nobody has managed to copyright “space”, though I’m sure somebody’s tried. Maybe, um, God? 


It’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game Obliterate Everything by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL. Anyway, here’s a trailer.

Nobody expected Nippon Ichi Software to announce a sequel to the 2004 PS2 strategy RPG 'Phantom Brave', but over 20 years later, the company did just that. Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero sets sail on Switch on 30th January, and for those who want to see what it's all about before release, NIS America has announced that a free demo will be available from 17th January (that's this Friday).
In its reveal tweet, the company noted that all save data from the demo carries over to the full version, so you can give the trial your all and not worry about having to do it all again. Ahh, bliss.

That is how Arron Hawke, a meteorologist from the UK, ended up developing a unique point-and-click adventure game as a gift for his little sister, Neighbours: the Adventure. The game was an unauthorized tie-in based on the Australian soap opera Neighbours, and it would end up being one of the very first fan games to make its way to players all over the world.

As of right now, Fallout 5 has not been revealed and has only been spoken of briefly.


It is, as far as we know, still in pre-production.


To disappoint you further, based on my observations of Bethesda and their current development position, it is unlikely we will see Fallout 5 from them any time soon. It exists, but the developer seems to have other priorities.

The behavior of the shot-stoppers has been given a major buff, which is a bit of a headache.

After the recent buff, that's no longer the case, as their reaction speeds have gone up noticeably.


That doesn't mean that you can't score past them. All you have to do is to get your aim and power correct to score effortlessly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dreaming Isles is a game that doesn't like to hold your hand. Instead, for better or for worse, this swashbuckling life simulator expects you to figure out how to interact with almost every in-game system through trial and error. This includes the all-important art of crafting.


To become the farmer everyone who lives on the Dreaming Isles needs you to be, you'll have to build the best tools for the job. Here's how to craft things in Dreaming Isles.


How to unlock the crafting table in Dreaming Isles


Image via Destructoid


Before you'll be able to build anything in Dreaming Isles, you'll need to unlock the farmhouse. We've already got a guide on how to do that, so check it out if you're having trouble. Once inside, head up to the big wooden bench on the wall next to the bedroom. This is the crafting table.


You won't be able to craft much with the materials you collected on the island, so you'll want to head down the stairs in the top-right corner of your house. This will take you to an underground tunnel where you'll encounter Elise. After you've talked with her, open the chest to the right and nab yourself a sword and a pickaxe. Use the pickaxe to mine some iron and the sword to take out a few bats and collect their fangs or hides.


Once you've got these, head back to your house and head to the crafting table. Click on it to open the crafting menu. Dreaming Isles' crafting system is easy to understand; just hover over the tool or weapon you want to build and click its icon. The game even tells you how many of each item you can craft based on how many materials you have.


Once you've got the basics of crafting down, the world of Dreaming Isles becomes your oyster. You can't build much at first, but every item you craft will help you get more valuable materials you can use to make better tools and build your farm into an agricultural goldmine.

Since you can't trade gold stickers outside of this event, it's a rare opportunity to get specific cards during brief 24-hour periods before being restricted to card pack opening again. 


It's also rare for Golden Blitz events to repeat past cards, meaning you might miss out on one you need if you're not online during a specific time. Let's check out every past Golden Blitz sticker during the Monopoly Games season to determine whether you'll still get an opportunity to trade a particular card.

Naturally, this game has inspired many other life sims, but one company may have gone a bit too far...


Meet Anime Life Sim, a brand-new video game that recently appeared in the PlayStation Store. You may have noticed (as many fans already did) that it bears a striking resemblance to Animal Crossing: New Horizons, bordering on plagiarism according to some fans. Of course, big game companies can't technically copyright an art style, but Anime Life Sim's cartoony characters, bright colors, and top-down perspective look almost identical to New Horizon's, and it definitely lacks an identity …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another Pro Open Mystery Nation objective is live in EA FC 25, and it provides an exciting opportunity for all to win a free pack right ahead of TOTY. 


If you have completed similar objectives in the past, you'll know what to do. A mystery nation will be revealed by EA Sports during the sixth matchday of the Pro Open competition. You'll then have to use a card from that specific nation in order to complete the objective. To complete the objective, you'll have to guess the nation correctly, which is difficult. But we are here to help you and get all the available rewards as quickly as possible. 


Disclaimer: Mystery Nation has been solved. 


EA FC 25 Pro Open Mystery Nation objective guide


Let's take a look at the requirements of the latest Mystery Nation objective. 



Score three goals using a Finesse Shot with a player from the mystery nation in any UT game mode. The name of the nation will be hinted at during the broadcast of FC Pro Open Matchday 6.




You can complete the objective in any game mode you want. If required, you can play quick friendlies with your friend to unlock all the rewards. Just make sure that the card you're using belongs to the correct mystery nation. Also, the goal scored will have to be using a Finesse Shot (or else it won't count). 


So far, EA Sports and the casters have been tight-lipped about any potential hints. Over the last few weeks, the community has figured out the correct solution pretty quickly, so it shouldn't take too long this time as well. 


Over the last five matchdays, we have traveled all over the world to find our mystery nations. Let's see what EA Sports has in store for us this week. While EA Sports has yet to reveal the nation, the community has already figured it out.


Our Mystery Nation for Matchday 6 is Denmark.

As you battle other players, you'll learn techniques and unlock abilities to improve yourself, bringing you one step closer to being the greatest fighter on your server.


Although this sounds simple at first, there's a lot more to it than just throwing a few punches. Thankfully, there's tons of information on The Strongest Battlegrounds' Trello board, Discord server, and Roblox group to help you learn more about the experience.

That said, there's a chance you won't find the answer you're looking for or need more information about a specific topic. In that case, you have another spot to visit: the Strongest Battlegrounds Discord server.


What is the Strongest Battlegrounds Discord?


The Strongest Battlegrounds' Discord server is the place to be if you want to ask specific questions that the Trello board doesn't answer or stay up to date on the experience's latest updates. You'll find numerous resources here, from update logs and sneak peek channels to general chats for casual conversations.

The Discord server also includes a voice chat to socialize with fellow players. If you prefer talking to people directly, you'll have plenty of chances to do so, as these channels are often full of other players chatting away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hope you aren’t afraid of heights, because The Wandering Band’s skybound city-builder, Airborne Empire launched into Early Access today. It’s now available on Steam.


Airborne Empire is the sequel to the well-received 2020 city-builder, Airborne Kingdom. It continues the concept of building flying (Airborne, if you will) civilizations. Having never played the original, it’s hard for me to tell you exactly what’s different, but I can tell you that this one has you constructing the ultimate flying fortress. You travel the world, helping people and fending off sky pirates, while developing technologies that will help your sky neighborhood soar.




According to the Early Access blurb, “When we launch into Early Access, the most important features of the game will already be there: building, researching, balance, lift, movement, dialogue, and more.” However, it gets very honest directly after that, saying, “The launch version has an enjoyable gameplay loop, but is still a bit bare-bones, lacking content and polish.” I personally appreciate the up-front warning. 


Furthermore, the Early Access run is planned for one year, during which time they “plan to add new building types, new biomes, new events/missions and expand the background story of the game.” Listen, the most important thing I can think of here: “Weather system.” I know that sounds like sarcasm, but I honestly love a good weather system in games.


Airborne Empire is now available in Early Access on PC via Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Golden Tides update has added plenty of exciting content in Fisch, and you can find the Sunken Treasures every hour at different locations.


These treasures are found in the form of chests, and their locations are random. Naturally, it will require a bit of searching on your part to come across them. However, these chests can be immensely valuable, and they can earn you some interesting rewards.


Let's find out how you can find all the Sunken Treasure chests in Fisch.


How to find Sunken Treasure chests in Fisch


Sunken Treasure chests can spawn on any of the named islands currently available in the game. Hence, finding one can be confusing, but there are some ways you can make the task easier. Firstly, there will be a server-wide notification that will state the name of the island where a Sunken Treasure chest has spawned. You can also find this out by simply asking someone in the global chat.


Once you know the name of the island, just spawn your ship from the closest Shipwright NPC available. Once you travel to the island, don't get off your boat/ship. Instead, travel the surrounding waters and keep your eyes out on the water. The chests will be floating in the ocean waters, where you'll be able to open them and obtain all the contents.




All Fisch Sunken Treasure chest rewards


Every Sunken Treasure chest will always contain credits, which are immensely useful. It can also include any of the following items inside it as well:



title


different types of baits


different types of totems


Auric Rod (very low odds, but it can be found)


Free Boat (extremely low odds, but it can be found)



All things considered, Sunken Treasure chests are highly beneficial, and you should always keep your eyes out for them. Finding them can be a bit tricky in Fisch, but the rewards are well worth your time and efforts. If you want to bypass luck and add a new rod and boat, make sure to complete the Dr. Glimmerfin quest as well.

Luffy. Naturally, there's already a brilliant mod that reflects this striking similarity.


Nexus Mods user Ercuallo recently posted this Marvel Rivals mod that swaps Mister Fantastic for Monkey D. Luffy. However, what makes this stand out from other similar mods is that this isn't any regular Luffy skin, since he actually is in his most powerful and versatile transformation, his Gear 5 form. He famously achieved this form during the recent Wano Country Arc, and it basically allows him to use as many over-the-top and cartoony attacks as his childish imagination can come u…]]></summary>

In the process, you explored a beautiful, Orientalist world map of faded mosaic tiles and dusty gold fittings. 
In Airborne Empire, out in early access today, you do much the same again, but this time the world is trying to murder you. A bit. You are no longer alone in the skies: there are merchant dirigibles you can barter with, and pirate airships who'll strafe your suburbs and set your bazaars on fire. As such, the sequel's new city technologies include a choice of offensive and defensive weapons. Here's a launch trailer.

The mod, Classic Offensive, says it has "the goal of bringing back the community aspects and aesthetics of CS," suggesting the game had become too focused on skins. Essentially, it wants to become the ultimate nostalgia trip back to Counter-Strike 1.6, using the newer visuals of CS:GO.

On this day in 2017, Nintendo finally lifted the lid on a little console called the Nintendo Switch, revealing the hybrid's technical specs, price and all-important release date to the world. Eight years on, we're desperate to see 'Switch 2' get the same treatment.
To be clear, the 2017 presentation wasn't the first time we had laid eyes on the Switch — that came in the now-iconic rooftop-party trailer a few months earlier — but it was where all the information dropped. With a Treehouse steam arriving the next day and revealing the launch line-up, the console would land in stores a mere seven weeks later (which is wild, when you think about it), beginning the era of the Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2025 off to a predictably sleepy start.
The latest UK charts are in and, with only one new release to speak of, the list is much as you might expect.
Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana was the only new entry to the chart this week, just sneaking into the top 40 to land in 38th in its debut week (with a 53%/47% console split for PS5 and Switch, respectively).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dynasty Warriors: Origins. Finally, a game brave enough to ask: "what if everything cool that went down in Romance Of The Three Kingdoms was thanks to you, a magical, beautiful boy that no-one's ever heard of?".
It's a great premise, honestly. The slate wiped clean, what if you got to be mates with everyone from all sides in this grand ensemble tale of warring states? A battle might take eight minutes. The three consecutive bonding cutscenes before the next might take ten. Origins is just as much about fighting thousands at a time as it is about eating lunch with Zhang Fei or discussing the meaning of heroism with Zhou Yu. There's a parallel story about your character and his role in a magical order of destiny godlings I didn't find the least bit interesting, but the rest is thrilling because Romance is already thrilling. The parts that Origins bogs down with its wordier take on already wordy source material are enlivened again by anime vibrance, hijinks, and melodrama.

For example, my fridge has started bleeding an iridescent fluid. Peering into the oily green depths, I see a much older, cyborg version of myself dressed in spiked leather against a background of burning oceans. The other Edwin mouths and gesticulates urgently, but I have no time for his dire warnings of global calamity. There are new entertainment products to discuss!

Monthly Splatfests are a thing of the past for Splatoon 3 these days, but Nintendo is still keeping the seasonal events coming. With Splatoween out the way, the next one to roll around is Frosty Fest, a festive celebration which will be heading to the Splatlands next month.
As revealed in a tweet by @NintendoUK, the Frosty Fest Splatfest will get underway from 11th-12th January 2025 (depending on your region), with the theme this time asking 'What would make you happiest?' There are three gift-based teams to choose between, with Team Money, Experiences and Presents all vying for your support.

We're back with the latest Japanese charts folks; the first of 2025!
It's a little bit different for this first go around, too. Famitsu has posted software sales figures for the two weeks of 23rd-29th December and 30th Dec - 5th January, but no hardware figures. We'll collate the top ten games for both weeks here, and hopefully we'll be back on track with the hardware figures next time. It's a shame, because we were sincerely hoping to see exactly how the Switch has done over the new year, but it can't be helped.

Chcete se pochlubit technickými vánočními dárky? Pak doražte na Virtuální Bastlírnu - online pokec (nejen) techniků a bastlířů!


Pokud by se konverzace zadrhla, mají organizátoři ze Strahovské Bastlírny připravena i náhradní výplňová témata. Velká studnice je to, co se dělo na hackerské konferenci CCC (Chaos Communication Conference) mezi svátky - mluvilo se tam o tom, jak se dá shodit rozvodná síť po rádiu, jak hacknout nový procesor Raspberry RP2350 a o tom jak pokračuje hackování vlaků v Polsku.


I na svět hardware jsou Strahováci připraveni. Na internetu se objevil postup, jak "snadno" vyrábět doma plošné spoje s pomocí výkonného vláknového laseru. Také se v diskuzi našel skvělý spis o tom, jak poznat falešné teploměry DS18B20 a co to vlastně znamená.


A nebojte, i na bizár může dojít. Věděli jste, že největší sériově vyráběná CRT televize váží přibližně 200 kilogramů a na světě se už ví jenom o jedné existující? A že Windows interně zkoušejí konvertovat znaky z UTF-16 do ASCII podle jejich grafické podobnosti, což vede k velkému množství elegantních exploitů?


Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 14. ledna od 20:00 (pozor, změna) minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

The year is 2025 and Lord of the Rings feels very much like it's "a thing" again. We're not sure that it ever really went away, to be honest, but we've got The Rings of Power on TV (and it's actually rather good now), the War of the Rohirrim hit cinemas, a 'Hunt for Gollum' movie is planned, and, perhaps most importantly for us, more Middle Earth games are on the horizon.
Gollum launched on multiple consoles in 2023 — though the Switch version is still in limbo (something we're sure you were all devastated about) after Daedalic shut down its internal development team.

Before Nintendo's subscription service took off, fans were able to individually buy and download the company's retro titles and play them whenever they wanted thanks to the Virtual Console service.
Although this was eventually replaced with Switch Online's tier-based retro library, Nintendo apparently had plans to carry over the existing Virtual Console service and add online functionality. This information comes from "a new leak of iQue emails not too long ago" according to Yakumono's Blog, run by dataminer (and Nintendo Life user) LuigiBlood.

It's MudRunner without the mud, with a knockabout simplicity presumably as a result of its apparently one-man development team. It launched last October but I hadn't heard of it until today, when a new map was added, and now I want to play it.

How many befriended pigs like Porky have there been across the last several hundred hours of play? I'm not sure - dozens, hundreds - but soon such pigs might have a new form. After 15 years, Mojang are adding new types of pig to Minecraft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a few of you might know, each Sunday at 4pm GMT I run Booked For The Week - a regular chat with a selection of cool industry folks about what they're reading, what they're hoping to read next, and what books they recommend. The very secret goal of the column is for the guests to name every book ever written. It's a task every single one has failed miserably at with two notable exceptions. One was Dan Griliopoulos, who listed 400 books in a document before he got bored and gave up - a heroic, if ultimately futile effort. The other was Warren Spector back in November, who not only gave me the longest and most detailed reply I'd had before or since, but also followed up several times to add more books to the list.

It then cut to Majima and his crew making celebratory noises on deck. This follows last year's Infinite Wealth catching some backlash for the decision to lock the mode behind a £15/€15/$15 edition upgrade.
Unrelated, but I've decided to stop putting angry spiders through your letterbox every morning. I know, I know. Come on now. Hero is such a strong word.

You'll need to link to a PlayStation Network account to play The Last Of Us Part II on PC, say Sony. The requirement was reported by Video Games Chronicle, and sure enough, the Steam page for the "Remastered" version of the third-person fungus fighter includes a footnote in the game description that confirms it in plain language - "Account for PlayStation Network required". For a lot of people this is a minor nuisance, for others it more likely means that the game won't be on sale in your country at all. Sony's reasons for enforcing the requirement remain obscure.

It turns out you can turn off a lot of the gore and nudity. You can also swaddle yourself in some nice, sturdy, PG-13 body armor. But you're seemingly stuck with a certain base percentage of bulging, softcore gratuitousness in both the character portrait on bottom left, and in the mildly boobulent background art of the world. I'm not sure I can put up with all that, which is a shame, because Beyond Citadel is otherwise a promising, eerie FPS that mixes ideas from 90s shooters in pretty appealing ways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A long, long time ago I became obsessed with watching people play rally games beautifully. It was a blessing to see those disembodied hands sling virtual cars around with grace and precision, kicking up dirt in a way I could only dream of.
Now, though, I am going through a different phase. A less blessed phase. One where I watched the popular streamer and influencer Ludwig attempt to climb to Platinum rank in League Of Legends, all because he wanted to prove another popular streamer, who thought he couldn't do it, wrong. I know I've already put you off, so I don't blame you if you stop reading. Just know that I couldn't stop watching his streams, even as it conjured up terrible memories of a time spent doing the exact same thing at uni.

Locator is a detective puzzler where you play an interstellar cartographer tasked with tracking down a missing archeologist named Abigail Lidari on an alien world. It takes inspiration from browser geography game Geoguessr. You’ll be studying sets of photos and comparing them with notes from Abigail’s journal, then pinpointing her location on a series of lovely maps.

If you want a deeply confounding game about putting an old banger together piece by excruciating piece, while periodically sweating the grime off your body in a cramped sauna, then I can think of no better time waster.

Currently on show at CES 2025, it’s a prototype desktop build that uses clever geometry and an unconventional motherboard I/O layout to hide practically every single wire in the joint, for a clean design that's housed for your viewing pleasure within a four-sided glass chamber. It’s the closest PCs have come to the simple Victorian pleasures of a nice terrarium, and honestly, good on it.
The problem is that if Project Zero X’s components ever actually go on sale, there becomes a non-zero percent chance that I will come into possession of that see-through case. And there is a one hundred percent chance I will ruin it.

It really is high time we gave the new game some attention, then. The very first alpha launches into Steam early access on January 27th. Here’s what’s in store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year’s annual CPU tug-of-war was cleanly won by AMD, its obscenely fast Ryzen 7 9800X3D almost singlehandedly leaving Intel and their Core Ultra chips in a heap of mud and P.E.-spec rope. Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.
No pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.

The list in question is part of a strategy of counteracting what the US sees as the close relationship between China's armed forces and various civilian technology suppliers and research projects.
At the time of publication yesterday, a Tencent spokesperson had commented that the listing was based on a "misunderstanding". In a statement sent to RPS overnight and also published online, Tencent's chairman Ma Huateng and executive board have now said that they're prepared to get legal if the misunderstanding isn't resolved.

They own shares in everything from Epic Games through Ubisoft to Silent Hill 2 rebooters Bloober Team. Are you a game developer? Odds are that at least one percent of your body belongs to Tencent. Maybe one of your toes.
And now it turns out that Tencent are some kind of military operator, as well. Or at least, that's what the US Department of Defence would have us believe: they've just somewhat randomly added the firm to an infamous list of Chinese military companies, together with lithium-ion battery maker CATL. This potentially makes it difficult for Tencent to do business in the States, but Tencent say that it's all based on a "misunderstanding".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a new Lenovo Legion Go on the way, and while it’s ditching the signature detachable controllers, it’s still got something unusual to stick on its CV. The Lenovo Legion Go S is a smaller, cheaper take on Lenovo’s portable gaming PC, and it’s on track to become the first officially licensed SteamOS handheld outside of Valve’s own Steam Deck range.

A GPU that eats up to 575W and costs £1939 / $1999? Yeah, nice try, Geoffrey N. Vidia, but such a mad card couldn’t possibly exist in reality. It’s clearly only here to make the other ones, the RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070, look like better deals.

As Custodian of this dusty funereal expanse, you must place structures on tiles around your throne room, striving to fulfil the desires of whichever Dread Deity is in play, while fending off pernicious attackers from the realm of light.

The development of 2020 FPS Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War cost $700 million, making it the most expensive video game project yet reported. That’s according to a court filing reviewed by Stephen Totilo’s Game File (paywalled) in which Call Of Duty creative head Patrick Kelly divulged the budgets of three games in the series.

Yet that's the challenge taken up yesterday by speedrunners at Awesome Games Done Quick. The UFO 50 speedrun includes an impressive dart through the retro collection's most bewildering game, the ancient and mysterious Barbuta, in which your character is a frustratingly slow hero with a fearfully short attack range. They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gentle reader, I have previously written exactly two boob-related articles in my life. One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.
Now it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs. Behold.

Mass Effect 3 tried voice commands. Socom U.S Navy Seals shipped with a headset. "Dunno if I wanna be shouting out tacticool commands in my living room," wrote a Redditor on the subject four years ago, speaking to my very soul in the process. "Gimme the clunky buttons instead".
Thankfully, you can also use your keyboard to interrogate suspects in murder mystery Dead Meat. It’s a moody, slightly goofy noir puzzler that lets you ask anything you want. Whether this means you’ll always get a worthwhile response, I’m not sure. "Want to discuss their alibi? Probe them on the meaning of life? Confess your love? Or just troll them mercilessly? Your words hold power, and anything goes," reads the Steam page. Here’s a trailer.

Those eventually grew into their PCIe shoes, but only after months of dial-shifting driver updates – whereas the flagship B580 promises Nvidia-besting games performance from the off. Even at such a stage in the current graphics generation (the GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 could be revealed literally tonight, at CES 2025), there is something enticing about that proposition.

Let's see if we fare better this time round: Sonic Galactic is an absurdly accomplished Sonic fangame from Starteam that, broadly, imagines how the Mega Drive and Genesis platformers might have looked and felt had they been made for the Sega Saturn. There's a new demo, if you fancy trying it for yourself. Please find it here on Itch.io. Perhaps if I'd put the download link higher up the page in the other article, people would have got distracted and refrained from dunking on me so awfully.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An upcoming life sim which claims to be a competitor to Grand Theft Auto VI is continuing to amass followers and wishlists on Steam, despite the game being unmasked as a vehicle for a dodgy cryptocurrency. Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules. But it's still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.

That's specifically RPGs with "AAA" budgets, whatever AAA means these days. Cain is, of course, well aware that there are many RPGs from smaller teams that "evolve past the paradigm of violence being the default way in which the player interacts with the world", and that there are plenty of puzzle games, adventure games and the like in which there is no violence at all.

It also offers notable moments of lonely, loud footsteps rebounding off cold stone tiles in the seconds after felling some giant man-bastard - one of the subgenre’s greatest un-joys.

November was a little rosier for the abandoned multiplayer game, with a monthly peak of 1,028.

Who were these mysterious shufflers, flocking to the deserted, echoing halls of Valve’s disastrous flop like your mate who uses the word ‘liminal’ too much to a dead shopping center? Forbes, who first reported on the phenomena, don’t know. No one knows. Somebody might actually know but writing ‘no one knows’ makes it more dramatic. Let’s dig in.

The peals of celebration travel outward through our atmosphere, exiting the realm of Earthly sound and resonating with interstellar plasma and detritus to form a delicate ripple of comet flakes and stray photons, expanding far beyond our solar system. Where the ripple encounters larger masses, such as planets, suns and... other things, it rebounds, riding the weft of stardust back down to Earth. As it returns home, the signal is modified. Tinkered with. It acquires unsettling harmonics and a guttural undertow. By the time it re-enters our atmosphere, it has condensed to three words, which descend and shrink and spiral into your ear like an octopus entering a crevice: FEED THE MAW.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Italy's 'Piracy Shield' blocking system was originally invented to protect time-sensitive live sports streams from pirates. A year later, rightsholders are pushing for an update to cover a wider range of content, including films. This move, which is expected to be discussed in a forthcoming consultation, aims to gradually expand the 'next-gen' blocking system.

Rightsholders and authorities hope that the criminal prosecution of the 41-year-old (re)seller, who served a few hundred customers, will send a deterrent message. However, the big fish in this hugely profitable industry remain unscathed.

The longest novel ever written is generally agreed to be Proust’s Remembrance of Things Past - a coward’s pick, since it’s actually 13 different volumes. Don’t let Proust’s despicable lies sully the joy of literature for you, though. He did have a good quality moustache - a far more important literary trait than actually doing any writing, imo.

S úctou a upřímnou pokorou jsem přistoupil k aranžmá národní slovenské hymny "Nad Tatrou sa blýská" již v roce 2016. Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté "hradní" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…]]></summary>

Developers NetEase had recently doled out bans of up to 100 years to players they suspected of cheating, but in their eagerness, failed to distinguish between legitimate compatibility layers – the software that non-Windows operating systems, like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS, use to run native Windows games – and actual hacks. Per IGN, NetEase have now apologised to the affected players, and lifted the bans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll be blunt: the only thing that really entices me about SpaceCraft is that it's from Shiro Games, creators of such robust RPG and strategy fare as Dune: Spice Wars, Evoland, Northgard and Wartales. As a concept, at least, SpaceCraft seems both flavourless and oddly inclined to overplay its own familiarity. I mean, look at that title. Consider its chilly blend of functionality and punmanship. Look at that capital "C", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft. This you may do eternally, for there are thousands of planets in store.

I’m busy replaying The Suffering 2 for the sixth time to see a new 15 second cutscene that recognises which combination of morally aligned beginnings and endings I’ve picked. It reads your save from the first game and everything!". Say ‘memory card’ to a youthful, broccoli-maned Fortnite enjoyer nowadays. Go on, I dare you. You’ll be in a home before you know it.
Still, having new toys at regular intervals is one real upshot of our new live-service barrage of ephemeral novelty, perpetually flung at my dizzy eyeballs like gleaming carnival daggers at exhausted spinning wheels. Especially if they’re for the exquisite strategy of Mechabellum. Season 2 released yesterday alongside patch 1.2, bringing with it a new unit and specialist, some reworks, and lots of cosmetic bits I pretend not to care about but then get excited when I unlock a new one.

The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. "Bioshock Infinite in space", we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.
In Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brendan Greene, the modder-turned-millionaire who designed battle royale game PUBG: Battlegrounds, wants to make his studio's next game a "metaverse", although he says he's wary of using the term. The project is called "Artemis" (at least for now) and you won't be seeing it any time soon. That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. 
Greene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led "multiverse of worlds" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox. He is nonetheless "full of confidence".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's frightfully early in the year to be bustling, but I can't get enough of the crowded streets of ancient "Chinese-style" RPG The Bustling World. The latest trailer is a series of sweeping yet intimate, colourful urban cross-sections, showing dozens of NPCs selling fish, shaking hands on balconies, shouldering barrels, dancing with fans, honing their feng shui, and various other pursuits that allegedly form part of full NPC life simulations. It's like scrutinising a Hitman level from above, except that all of these people have evolving relationships and sleeping patterns and they might hunt you down if you murder any of their relatives. Me, I just want to play Where's Wally.

Intervention by Cloudflare ended that dream and 2.5 years later, despite other measures targeting the sites, it appears that at least one is still going strong. The TV companies are now taking legal action against UK ISPs; they're unlikely to put up a fight, they may not even turn up in court.

Is a Ryanair Boeing 737 safety manual art? Well, Johnson A Plane Man has done some ekphrasis with it, so I say yes. It’s a short browser Itch game that chronicles the life and times of a man named Johnson, his love for yellow life vests, his existential feelings of confinement (despite the high number of easily locatable exits), and such emancipatory joys that can only be found in yellow slides.

The newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel "Seith" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven't updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as "Ghost Of A Tail" is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.

Yet all three are games that in some way defined my year, and I feel affection for each of them. Let me explain why.

Or at least, it was middling for my own personal taste, which is quite unsavoury at the best of times. Most of my best picks made it into the calendar proper, but a couple didn't. One I hadn't even played properly until after the vote, and the other? The other is a flawed pick, but one that I couldn't stop thinking about.
Anyway, hope you all have a restful Xmas folks and a cracking new year. I hope Santa bought you some nice warm socks or a chocolate orange so dense, you could tee it off at your local golf club.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a sucker for a good first-person runabout. I don't need to shoot, but it's sometimes nice to get a sword, or a big whip. As long as I get to be immersed in an adventure. I think that's the big theme of my selection box: being grounded within my player character. I want to feel what it's like to hike through canyons with too much sellable loot in my backpack. I want to park my soul in the head of a scared Scotsman way out of his depth, hundreds of miles from shore. The closer I can comfortably fit in my character's shoes, the more I seem to buy into the world they inhabit. Even if that world is constantly glowing a magnificent crimson.

All my favourite games for the year are actually very similar: they are all the best. Unfortunately, the realities of sharing website space with several less-correctos means they didn’t all make this year’s advent calender.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. 


So! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town. And he’s brought a gift with him. Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

"Detective," she said, glaring at me with eyes like gorgeous tennis balls, "I want to open today's advent calendar door." I was confused. "Whaddya wanna do that for, missy?"

If I publish this and it turns out we have two, please divide into rival factions and have a comments war over which is the real one. Apologies! Normal service will resume next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["A tactically rich turn-based game with some meaty role-playing elements", was how Staff Sergeant James Archer characterised his Menace hands-on, back in September. The only thing missing from his account of the game was the bread needed to make that rich, meaty concoction a tasty, nourishing sandwich.
And by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m hoping you’ll forgive a spot of mission-bending here, given Should You Bother With? Is usually intended to test out the new and the strange of gaming hardware. Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.
Recently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?
