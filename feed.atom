        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An obtuse angle on stealth.
Don't you hate it when you're thrust into a totalitarian world of unrelenting fascist horror? For example, when you go outside? Ho ho! Just a bit of topical humour there. Sorry, we'll never do it again. Look, the point is, République — the game whose Nintendo Life review you are currently reading — is about escaping from such a dystopia.
Back in the day République was a phone game, the trappings of which made perfect sense for its type of input. You took control of a rogue element of indeterminate nature who essentially closes the gap between player and controller; a little like the excellent In Other Waters; here, you're in control of the various cameras, computers and other systems in the enormous complex where the female lead character finds herself captured. You're helping this girl escape, not escaping yourself. It made you feel just the right amount of helpless, just the right lack of agency. You had a lot of power, but you were still ultimately just an observer. It, dare we say it, made it easier to care, easier to get invested in this character when she had autonomy outside of your own personal whims.

We've got a slight update on Freedom Planet 2! According to developer GalaxyTrail, the game finally has a release date.
The PC (Steam) version has been narrowed down from "Spring 2022" to 13th September this year, and the current aim is to launch it on "multiple" other platforms alongside this release. These other platforms have not been revealed yet and still apparently require "more time" to go through testing and certification.

After the finals of Arc Revo America, Arc System Works revealed DNF duel will be releasing this June.
In a brief trailer showing plenty of Ghost Blade footage, it was announced that DNF Duel will be coming on June 28. The game will also be involved in multiple competitive events, including Arc World Tour 2022, a worldwide tournament tour that will have a $200,000 prize pool split between DNF and Guilty Gear Strive.
A new character other than the Ghost Blade was shown in the footage, which is the Mechanic that was teased after December's beta period. That would bring the known roster up to 12 characters, with hints at other classes remaining unconfirmed.
DNF Duel is a fighting game made in collaboration between Arc System Works and Eighting, the development house behind other fighting games such as Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 and Bloody Roar. It's based on Dungeon Fighter Online, a Korean MMO brawler made by Neople and published by Nexon, and brings the game's classes to life in a whole new way. Check out our New Gameplay Today to get a look at DNF Duel.
I've been very excited to play more of DNF Duel since its initial beta in December of last year. Combat is fun, flashy, and easy to execute, using simplified directional inputs for special attacks. It made our list of most anticipated fighting games of 2022 for a reason, and now that we have a release date, it can't come soon enough. DNF Duel will be released on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 28.]]></summary>

"A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad."
How many times have you heard this quote over the years? Twitter threads of people posting responses to game delays, or even using it as a response to people upset about delays. It's reached a kind of god-like status, like uttering these words has the opposite effect of saying Beetlejuice in the mirror three times.

Employees at Moon Studios, which is the team behind Ori and the Blind Forest/Will of the Wisps, told GamesBeat that they view the studio’s culture as “oppressive,” citing that the studio’s leaders used buzzwords about being an open and honest workplace as a cover for abuse that happens there. Examples included in the GamesBeat report include the use of offensive words by the founders, anti-Semitic jokes, and public discussion and jokes about the size of their genitals. 
GamesBeat reports that a lot of these “jokes” and inappropriate discussions happened in public chats that were open to others at the company, suggesting…]]></summary>

Gran Turismo 7 is back online after essentially being left unplayable for more than 24 hours following an earlier update. 
In a new blog post, GT7 producer Kazunori Yamauchi explains why a maintenance period that was expected to last a couple of hours lasted longer than a day. He said that right before the release of the 1.07 update, which is the one that left GT7 largely unplayable, Polyphony Digital “discovered an issue where the game would not start properly in some cases on product versions for the PS4 and PS5.”

Previously announced, Nine Sols is described by the team as “a journey of Asian fantasy inspired by Sekiro, Hollow Knight, and Katana Zero.” It’s also a “lore-rich, hand-drawn” 2D action platformer with a focus on deflection in combat.” Red Candle promises immersive storytelling and a unique “Taopunk” setting in Nine Sols, too. As for what Taopunk is, think cyberpunk meets Taoism and Far East mythology.

A belt-scroller starring kaiju and Tokosatsu-style giant mecha isn't exactly an original idea. SNK's not-that-great King of the Monsters series did it first, but here's the scoop — Dawn of the Monsters does it better, with a game that'll make you feel five hundred feet tall. And scaly. And basically a big lizard. Not in a weird David Icke conspiracy way, just... in the game.
WayForward published this one — you know, the Shantae lot — and we have to say it does recall their rather under-appreciated Godzilla Domination, a GBA title that saw a clutch of licensed Toho kaiju getting into big-time scraps in a diminutive but dominant (hence the title) fashion. In a sense, Dawn of the Monsters is a spiritual sequel, then, but developed by 13AM Games of Runbow fame; there's no need to panic, however, as these developers clearly know their kaiju. Excuse me, Nephilim.

Even if you love Final Fantasy games, expect to feel like a stranger in a strange land when playing Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin. This violent retelling of the original Final Fantasy game from 1987 largely sidesteps the series’ adventurous spirit and heartfelt mysticism to focus on muscle, attitude, and everything extreme. Square Enix labels this remake as a “hardcore action/RPG,” an apt description for a game that rarely relents in its aggression.

The ongoing crisis in Ukraine has put the spotlight on Russia and everything related to it – and, for many gamers, the most famous Russian export of all is the puzzler Tetris, which helped turn the Game Boy into a global success story in the early '90s.
While The Tetris Company – founded by Henk Rogers, Alexey Pajitnov and Blue Planet Software in 1996 to oversee licensing – is based in the United States, "From Russia with fun" was one of the original tag lines for the game, so it's easy to see why some people would want to seek clarity regarding the company's stance on the ongoing conflict.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week I took a bit of holiday to, you know, catch up on some housework, have a bit of a rest and, to change the habit of a lifetime, play some video games. I knew straight away what would be first up on my video game playlist: FAR: Changing Tides, the sequel to Okomotive's beautifully melancholy roadtrip adventure, FAR: Lone Sails. While Changing Tides tells a separate story to its predecessor, putting you in the shoes of a new protagonist and swapping its desolate wastelands for a watery seascape, the hot, beating core powering the game remains very much the same. With nothing left for you at home in the wake of an unknown disaster, it's time to pack up and head on out for a new beginning, with only your hulking great boat/steamtrain contraption for company. 
If you still haven't played FAR: Changing Tides, I'd urge you to stop reading now and come back later. There are big spoilers about the game's ending coming up in this article, and I really don't want to ruin that for you. So, fair warning, okay? If you're still here I'm assuming you've played and finished Changing Tides, because holy moly, isn't it just the most perfect thing?

In Elden Ring, sometimes that necessity looks more like a Thomas the Tank Engine mod or whatever monstrosity is happening in this video. The latest Elden Ring innovation involves players equipping an NPC’s underwear that was apparently cut from the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thy Creature is an odd one. I want to make several comparisons to other games that probably aren't very accurate or fair. I think that's because it's one of those that's made up of the gaps in between other genres. Right from the start of its anime goth girl intro I knew this wasn't really my kind of thing, and yet its striking art and sense of sincerity felt compelling. 
And it was a bit weird, which is sometimes enough. It depicts a frankenstein cast out by villagers, left to wander the wilderness, across forests and mountains, still peppered with arrows, turning up at a sinister tower that seems to welcome them. And just a few minutes in, it reveals itself as a mystery puzzle game with bullet hell parts. Almost none of this is my thing at all, but here I am playing it. Hmm.

One of the most memorable moments of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker was undoubtedly its incredibly stylish prologue sequence. Against a backdrop of beautiful rendered images and Hylian script (and who can forget the wonderful accompanying music), the sequence told the basic narrative of Ocarina of Time and gave vital backstory to Link's new adventure as he set out across The Great Sea.
Well, it turns out that a physical scroll of that exact sequence exists, originally handed out to those reviewing The Wind Waker back during the GameCube era, making the scroll itself nearly two decades old.

And all the while, the Steam Deck itself has been getting better - considerably so.

Stranger Of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is a Soulslike Final Fantasy spin-off that swings so much it misses. Your sole focus is to kill a bad guy called Chaos and the game provides fights and loot in their hundreds, possibly thousands, to ensure you're beefy enough when the time comes. But cut away the combat and you're left with little, really. Search for anything other than Chaos and you'll find there's nothing else driving you forwards. You'll finish the game and part as strangers still, probably.

With Street Fighter 6 confirmed to be the future of the series, Capcom apparently isn't done with Street Fighter V quite yet. At least not until this new patch it's calling the "definitive update." Check out the trailer above to see some of the big changes in action.
The update, slated for release on March 29, will bring a variety of character balance changes. The trailer begins by showing off new combos for a good chunk of the cast, implying there are quite a lot of adjustments being made. Capcom has yet to detail exactly what these changes are but typically releases that information up to a few days before balance changes are implemented.
Also in the update are a pair of visual filters that change the way the battles look. The first and more appealing filter adds a cel-shaded styling to the fighters. It brightens up some of the colors in costumes and makes characters look a little more cartoony, which works quite well with the models shown in the trailer. A pixel filter attempting to mimic the look of a CRT screen will also be added in the update. What's present in the footage looks a bit messy (it's hard to make a 3D art style look 2D with a simple filter alone), but I'm going to still give it a shot when the update releases and hope it'll look nicer in person. Both filters are only available in offline modes. Sorry, online warriors. 
Tracksuit costumes for each character will finally be getting new color schemes, adding that missing bit of drip your main needs to perform their best in a match. And to round out the update, season 5 characters Dan, Rose, Oro, Akira, and Luke will have new Cap-Jam remix themes added to the game.
Capcom will be involved in a Japan Fighting Game Publishers Roundtable in the wee hours of March 21 and may talk more about this big update at that time.]]></summary>

Triangle Strategy is an exceptional tactics game some worried would be buried unearth the hype of heavy-hitters like Elden Ring and Horizon Forbidden West. That apparently hasn’t been the case, as the game has already sold hundreds of thousands of copies in the two weeks it’s been available.
The game’s Japanese Twitter account announced that Triangle Strategy has sold 200,000 copies in Japan and Asia alone and nearly 800,000 worldwide. The account states that this number includes shipped physical copies and digital downloads. Not bad for a Switch-only strategy game that launched in the shadow of recent triple-A titans, especially since it took Triangle Strategy’s sort-of-predecessor Octopath Traveler about a month to ship 1 million units. Triangle Strategy is on a good pace. The tweet also included a new art piece by Illustrator Naoki Ikushima to celebrate the occasion:
Triangle Strategy launched March 4 on Switch and is worth checking out if you enjoy turn-based strategy with heaps of choice-driven storytelling and political intrigue. We scored it an 8.25 out of 10, and you can read our full review here.]]></summary>

She becomes Wonder Momo when she builds up her Wonder meter with kicks and can transform into the titular hero by spinning around.

Combat is elegant and the story seems refined, not bloated, which makes this a ronin romp worth watching out for.

We've been keeping a keen eye on the Evercade project ever since it was announced, and continue to be impressed with its expanding range of physical carts showcasing many previously hard-to-obtain retro titles.
The two latest carts cover the work of North American publisher Renovation and UK studio Gremlin Graphics. Like previous offerings, these packs include multiple games and represent excellent value for money – perhaps more than is immediately apparent, in fact.

Triangle Strategy has been quietly doing the rounds here at Nintendo Life, impressing us with its gorgeous visuals and in-depth tactical combat. And it seems like many people around the world agree with our review that it's pretty darn brilliant. You should read it in case you're still thinking about picking it up.
Producer Tomoya Asano has reported that Square Enix's latest (triangle) strategy RPG has sold 800,000 copies worldwide, and for a genre that (outside of Nintendo's Fire Emblem) doesn't seem to be as big as it once was, that's pretty impressive. The game only came out two weeks ago, too.

Nintendo announced last month that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe will be getting 48 new tracks by 2023 and that the tracks would be released in six waves, with each wave adding eight new tracks. 
Now, a little over a month later, Wave 1 of the Booster Course Pass is live alongside a new 2.0.0 update. As expected, this update brings the new courses to the game for those who pay and it prepares the new courses for online play (starting March 21) alongside some minor fixes. Plus, Nintendo has released a new launch trailer that highlights the eight new courses added to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe today.

GSC Game World has quietly updated the spelling of its upcoming FPS, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl. 
The subtitle on the game was previously spelled “Heart of Chernobyl,” which features the Russian spelling of the location where the game takes place. However, likely as a result of Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine (the studio has been vocal about its support for Ukraine), GSC Game World has changed “Chernobyl” to “Chornobyl” to reflect the Ukrainian spelling of the word, as reported by PC Gamer. 
The change reportedly happened on March 14 by way of a Steam name update. The new spelling is visible in both the standard Steam entry and the title’s description and Steam-related entries. PC Gamer points out that the original spelling can still be seen on some promotional art and other listings, though. 
GSC Game World has not publicly addressed this name change, but the studio is also based in Ukraine and has made it clear it is focusing on keeping its employees safe above all else, opting to sideline the development of Stalker 2 while the conflict continues.
For more about Stalker 2, check out the latest look at it. Read about the game studios that have shown their support for Ukraine amidst Russia’s ongoing invasion of the country after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Tour begins.
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the most popular game on Switch, the very definition of an 'evergreen' title. Aside from the Battle Mode and a few minor changes, however, devoted fans have been playing the same content since the Wii U original with its DLC content, a scenario that finally changes with the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe-exclusive Booster Course Pass.
Wave 1 has landed and generated plenty of excitement, and there's certainly a thrill in booting the game up and being presented with two new Cups to enjoy — Golden Dash Cup and Lucky Cat Cup. The mix of courses reminds us that this is the equivalent of the 'bottom row' of the original line-up, with a range of retro and — for the first time — Mario Kart Tour tracks included in the eight new offerings. It's a solid initial selection though, especially as this is the first batch and therefore presumably the 'easier' Cups in what will become a whopping 48-track package.

Today's PlayStation State of Play presentation focused solely on Avalanche Software and Portkey Games' upcoming Harry Potter prequel game Hogwarts Legacy.
The game puts players in the robes of a custom character and sends them to school at the legendary wizarding academy Hogwarts. However, Legacy takes place in the late 1800s, meaning players are free to embark on their own legendary journey free from the shackles of the Harry Potter books and movies.

Final Fantasy is a staple in JRPGs and video games as a whole. It might have more entries in it than any other series out there and it won’t be slowing down anytime soon. On top of that, thanks to its anthology-like nature, if one Final Fantasy game doesn’t click for you, there’s a good chance another one will. As a result, ranking the Final Fantasy series can be highly contentious. Everyone has a lot of love for the first entry they played, and then there are heavy hitters like Final Fantasy X and VII, too. 
However, the staff here at Game Informer did the seemingly impossible: we ranked all 19 mainline numbered Final Fantasy games, including their direct sequels, from worst to best. As a reminder, this ranking is t…]]></summary>

The latest Into The Starfield developer video offers more insight into the game than anything else I've seen so far. It contains almost no in-game footage, mind you, but it contains hints about companions, romance, character start points, a new dialogue persuasion system that aims to improve on Oblivion's, and Bethesda returning to their old school RPG roots.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon cards continue to grow more and more popular, with pack pulls becoming ever so popular on Twitch and YouTube. However, another facet of Pokémon card collecting remains popular: buying extremely rare ones at auctions. 
For example, a rare Illustrator Pikachu card sold for nearly $1 million last month. Now, the latest rare Pokémon card sold at auction is making the rounds in the trading card community: a Snap Magikarp card, one of 20 known to exist. First reported by Nintendo Life, these Snap cards were given to winners of a Pokémon Snap competition held in Japan decades ago. If you were a winner, your winning Pokémon Snap in-game photograph was turned into an actual Pokémon card, so not only are these rare right off the bat as a result but only 20 of each was made.
Nintendo Life reports that one of 20 Snap Magikarp cards was recently sold at a Japanese auction for 5 million yen, or roughly $136,000. You can watch this video about the card below, uploaded by smpratte, the person who appears to be the winner:

With this one sold, there’s another 19 out there somewhere. Perhaps people safely own those other 19, or maybe, they’ve been lost to time. For now, they remain as elusive as a Magikarp doing its best not to bite the bait on an Old Rod (ok, maybe they’re a little more elusive than that). 
For more, read about the Illustrator Pikachu card sold last month and then check out the upcoming Pokémon Go trading card packs being released in stores soon.

"To be sure, SIE takes the substance of the newly submitted declarations seriously," the company's lawyers write in a new court filing.

First revealed as Secret Legend way back in 2015, Andrew Shouldice's Tunic is now out, with a surprise day-one launch on Xbox Game Pass yesterday. It's also available on PC, and regardless of where you decide to play, it's well worth your time – it's a Game Informer must-play title, after all, receiving a 9.75 out of 10 in our review. 
Today, Game Informer's Tunic reviewer, Jill Grodt, and Game Informer video editor Alex Van Aken are going to take you through Tunic's opening hours on the official Game Informer Twitch channel this afternoon at 2 p.m. Central. Alex will be on the sticks, discovering everything in-game for the first time, and Jill will be there to point out any must-see secrets and dole out combat tips along the way.

It's sure to be a great time, and we hope you join us. Tunic, with its beautiful and charming visual style, is worth checking out, and what better way to do that than by watching Alex and Jill play through its opening hours? However, be cautious. Part of the magic of this game is discovering things for yourself. So, if you want to go in blind, bookmark this page and come back after you've thrown a few hours into the title. 
If you enjoy our livestreams but haven't subscribed to our Twitch channel, we highly recommend it because it not only gives you notifications when we go live, but it gives you access to special subscriber-only emotes, too. Plus, you'll be given entry into the official Game Informer Discord, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, movies, TV, food, and so much more.]]></summary>

Delta Squad is slowly coming back together through Hasbro's awesome Star Wars: The Black Series line of action figures. GameStop today revealed that the expert hacker known as Fixer (or RC-1140) is the next to suit up again, joining the ranks of Boss. Delta Squad is best known from the Star Wars: Republic Commando video game, a first-person shooter that originally released in 2005, yet was recently reissued on PlayStation 4 and Switch.
This Fixer action figure is a GameStop exclusive and is a part of Hasbro's Black Series Gaming Greats line, which has given us action figures for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic's Darth Revan and Darth Nihilus, and even Jango Fett from Star Wars: Bounty Hunter. Boss launches on April 6, and Fixer won't be far behind him, but he doesn’t have an official release date yet. You can preorder the figure now, however.

Delta Squad won't be complete until all four of its recruits are together again. Odds are we'll see announcements in the months ahead for Scorch and Sev to join The Black Series. Which other video game Star Wars characters would you like to see added to this line of action figures? I'm still hoping KOTOR's HK-47 gets his time to shine, but also wouldn't mind seeing some of the creatures from Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order added to the mix.
Speaking of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, GameStop also revealed a 13th Batallion Trooper from the Star Wars: The Black Series line of action figures. Here's a look at it:

The long-awaited indie, Tunic, just released, and it’s one of Game Informer’s best-reviewed titles of 2022 so far. Part of the game’s magic stems from its cryptic nature, and even the simplest things, from where to go to how to use items, can be puzzling. So, having beaten the game and uncovered many of its hidden secrets, I’m ready to dish out some specially constructed hints. These spoiler-free suggestions won’t rob you of the satisfaction of figuring things out for yourself but may just help you avoid pitfalls.

Nothing could compete with my trusty staff, so I didn’t need to use spirit ashes for my first 100 hours or so. I was fine by myself, like any good romcom protagonist at the start of the movie.
As I walked into the final boss arena, I had unwaivering confidence. I strolled in, staff at the ready and prepared to win. Then, my string of easy victories came to a shocking end. I got walloped and decimated for about 10 hours and eventually announced my defeat. Elden Ring was a game I just couldn’t finish. Fortunately, love had other plans, and I entered into a whirlwind romance with the Mimic Tear Ash.

Alien Soldier is a run-and-gun action game first released for the Genesis in 1995. In the U.S., it was only available via the Sega Channel cable service. The game was re-released on the PlayStation 2, and years later, it was released again on the Wii Virtual Channel and Steam. 
Super Fantasy Zone
“Super Fantasy Zone has you powering up the ever-appearing Opa-Opa across eight colorful planets.” 
Super Fantasy Zone launched on the Sega Genesis, or Mega Drive, in Japan in 1992. It wouldn’t hit the U.S. until 2008, when it was released on the Wii. 
Light Crusader
“In Light Crusader, also from Treasure, let nobility light your way through a lovingly crafted action-RPG.” 
Light Crusader arrived on the Genesis in 1995, before it was re-released on Steam 15 years later in 2010. It combines elements of RPG, action, and platforming in one package.

With a pay-what-you-want minimum of only $10, the Bundle For Ukraine offers almost 600 indie video games as well as tabletop games, comics, and more. It is ridiculously good and for a good cause.

As well as talking a lot about heists in games, we discuss whether or not most crimes are heists. For example, theft in general is just spicy picking up, and murder is a soul heist. Matthew clues us in on what it was like to work for a secret shopper company, and Nate tells us about his repeat of his annual Eat Every Thing In Lord Of The Rings watch-along. Will this result in his daughter blocking memories? Only time will tell.

Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a slightly nerdy, romantically inept character. While her friends Annie and Lynda (played by Nancy Kyes and P.J. Soles, respectively) are with their boyfriends, Strode is stuck babysitting. Annie and Lynda are brutally murdered by killer Michael Myers – the former on her way to pick up her boyfriend, and the latter immediately post-sex. Strode, a virgin, fights back, ultim…]]></summary>

Monaco: What’s Yours Is Mine lets players live out their movie heist fantasies either alone or in a group when it launched in 2013. The newly announced Monaco II enlists fans back for one more job nearly a decade later.
Monaco II features procedurally generated 3D environments emphasizing verticality. During today’s Humble Games Showcase, creator Andy Schatz discussed the design by saying players can now break into buildings by scaling their walls or tunneling underneath them. You can even repel from the ceilings of some rooms Mission Impossible-style. Monaco 2 remains a top-down isometric game, but improved camera mechanics will seemingly provide more angles on the action.

Monaco II has only been confirmed for PC for now and has no release window. Schatz also announced that fans can follow the game’s creation by watching developer PocketWatch’s weekly Twitch streams to maintain transparency. 
We’re excited to see how Monaco II shapes up, especially since it builds upon the winning foundation of its entertaining predecessor. Monaco: What’s Yours Is Mine scored an 8.75 out of 10 from us, with reviewer Matt Miller writing, “Whether you’re all on the same couch or meeting up online, Monaco offers a multiplayer experience unlike any other game on the market.”

Jim Rossignol's Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine review in 2013 was pretty straightforward: "This is one of the most important independent games this year, and might well end up being one of the best-loved games of the decade." I don't think it panned out quite that way, partially because indie games grew so larger and more mainstream than expected across the decade, but the IGF Grand Prize winner is still a cracking game. And Monaco 2 looks pretty.

Last December, creator Daniel Mullens announced the beta for a mini-expansion to his acclaimed deck builder Inscryption called Kaycee’s Mod. The mode would allow players to indefinitely replay the game’s cabin section in a roguelike fashion but accessing it required players to (intentionally) jump through some hoops. After months of tweaking, Kaycee’s Mod is complete and readily available. 
Now that Kaycee’s Mod is fully unlocked, players will receive it via a free update on Steam, as well as the Epic Store and GOG versions of the game. The mode has you battling Leshy in increasingly difficult levels. Applying skulls to runs modifies its conditions, and conquering levels unlocks new cards and additional challenges. For fans of Inscryption’s story, the mod also unlocks developer logs written by Kaycee Hobbes that document her discoveries of the disk’s secrets.

To mark the occasion, Inscyrption currently has a 30 percent discount, which is a nice bargain for one of the best games of 2021. For more on Inscryption, be sure to check out our review, then find out which of its many twists rank among our favorite moments of the generation.]]></summary>

Netflix has released a trio of bloody posters for its upcoming live-action Resident Evil series alongside news that the horror show will hit the streaming service this July. 
More specifically, the series, which is simply called Resident Evil, will hit Netflix on July 14. The posters reveal this release date and unfortunately, for those looking for some more story details, that’s about it. However, the three posters are very nice to look at thanks to their minimalistic (and still bloody) design.

As you can see, one of the posters features the title underneath a bubble of blood, another a vial of blood with the T-Virus pathogen inside, and the third poster highlights a yellow and red pill that says “Joy,” seemingly created by the Umbrella Corporation. Here’s Netflix’s description for the series: 
And here’s a look at the cast for the show:

As for what this show is about, beyond the description for the series above, not much else is known. However, we don’t have to wait too much longer fortunately because it will hit Netflix in just a few more months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GPU-based upscaling has proven to be one of the most useful additions to gaming PC tech in years. Big performance improvements in exchange for only a minor drop in visual quality, if any at all? Yes please and thank you. Nvidia’s DLSS has established itself as the gold standard of upscalers, outperforming AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR), but the Radeon makers are now readying two new offerings: FSR 2.0 and Radeon Super Resolution (RSR).


FSR 2.0 looks to be a straight upgrade on the current 1.0 version, promising sharper picture quality with “optimised anti-aliasing” to better compete with the built-in, AI-assisted edge smoothing of DLSS. It will still need to be implemented in games by their developers, though – unlike RSR, which aims to work with just about any game by applying its upscaling algorithm at the GPU driver level.

Cozy, rustic, slow-going living with a touch of the magical has a certain appeal all its own, and as the recent announcement of Songs Of Glimmerwick proves, EastStud don’t intend on shaking up that brand any time soon. This is a wonderful thing for me because their previous outing and namesake, Eastshade, is not only one of my favourite games of all time, but also such an important kind of game in the terrifying, nightmare world we find ourselves in today.
You see, Eastshade does one thing very, very well. In fact, it does it so well that most players probably won’t even have noticed until they look back and really think on it. Eastshade teaches mindfulness, a keen and acute awareness of oneself and one’s surroundings in the present moment. And that, my friends, is where the appeal comes from.

Heroes come in many different forms, and stepping into the role isn’t an easy decision. Sometimes it’s done out of necessity, while other times, it comes down to a person’s honor and virtue. In some instances, even greed and fanfare drive these desires. No matter the reasoning, it takes great confidence and courage to take up the mantle, and sometimes finding those attributes is what makes a hero’s journey so interesting. 
Frey Holland, voiced by actress Ella Balinska (Charlie’s Angels), is the lead protagonist of Forspoken. For the most part, Frey is an ordinary young woman, but when she mysteriously gets transporte…]]></summary>

Escape rooms have become increasingly popular over the last decade, but not everyone has one in their area or the time/friends to complete one. Escape Academy brings the concept home as a co-op puzzler.
Revealed during today’s ID@Xbox showcase, the game comes from publisher iam8bit Presents and tasks players, either alone or with one other partner, to become the ultimate escape artist by unraveling a variety of puzzling locations under a time limit. The reveal trailer shows off locations such as a “mundane” office rapidly filling with gas to something as elaborate as an American Ninja Warrior-esque obstacle arena. Since you control a student attending an escape room-centric academy, you can explore the puzzle-laden campus and meet its colorful faculty members. Co-op is both local and online, with the trailer showing off split-screen gameplay.

With Arceus Legends and the surprise announcement of the late-2022 Scarlet/Violet versions, it’s easy to forget that Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl launched last Fall and are still going strong. The Sinnoh region remakes are teeming with content for its dedicated trainers, from special Easter eggs to other fun, miscellaneous gifts. Yesterday, a new Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl update followed suit, enabling trade with strangers. Moreover, two Mythical Pokémon can be encountered and caught for any players looking to fill out their ever-expanding Pokédex.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move befitting a game about immortal beings who live out countless repeating lives on artificial islands powered by human sacrifice, Paradise Killer is getting a re-release. Sort of. It's coming to next-gen consoles today, with all platforms (including PC) getting some extra bits added for free that weren't in the original 2020 release. Not bad for a game that Kaizen Game Works creative director Oli Clarke Smith thought would only really sell to "a niche of freaks". If you're not one of those freaks, I'd heartily recommend becoming one. Playing Paradise Killer is like going to a seaside cosplay party where police procedurals play on loop and cocktails are snorted in a dehydrated powder form. It is a meticulously authored murder mystery with a cast of freaks.
When I sat down to talk to both Clarke Smith and technical director Phil Crabtree about Paradise Killer's new update, it turns out that niche has already become quite large. Even Crabtree's dad has played Paradise Killer, though Crabtree isn't sure he really understood it. Crabtree also tells us he sometimes get messages from friends saying someone they know just played Paradise Killer and was talking about it. "It just seems so weird that that there is this audience there that we never expected, and it doesn't seem that far away," he says. "Like, it's not this mystery group of people, there always seems to be some connection that's quite close to you."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clink your wine glass. Tunic is not so much a love letter to Zelda as it is a wedding speech. Many games pay their respects to the blonde lawn mower and his absentee princess, but few have such fondness and understanding of the exact feelings those adventures conjure up, the precise sensation of exploring, the nook-scavenging, and the meticulous internal mapping that happens when you play Zelda's brand of wundergame. Tunic might have sacrificed some of its own identity in hitting every Ocarina note so perfectly, but when the result is such a capable homage it's hard to complain.

Tunic brilliantly captures the feeling of that special childhood title that made you fall in love with video games. Using a virtual simulation of an old-school guidebook, the game masterfully balances telling players almost nothing with giving them all the information they need. The result is a game brimming with genuine, triumphant discovery.
With its every pixel stuffed with reverence for gaming as a medium, Tunic revels in its historically inspired design. Players steeped in the hobby’s traditions will find following their instincts richly rewarding as they quest…]]></summary>

Digimon Survive has been floating around the digital ether for a few years now, and while there’s still no release date in sight, a new teaser trailer introduces us to the cast. 
Though the video premiered earlier this month during Digmon Con, today’s trailer is an English version of it. Digimon Survive is a tactical RPG that stars Takuma Momozuka, a student who gets transported to the Digital World during a school camping trip. He befriends fan-favorite Digimon, Agumon, and sets out to save the world from danger. He’s not alone though. A party of fellow youngsters and their respective Digimon partners accompany Takuma and Agumon, who you can meet in the trailer below.

Digimon Survive’s battle system consists of turn-based strategy on grid-based playing fields. Outside of combat, you’ll engage in choice-driven gameplay that leads to multiple endings, and the storytelling unfolds through a blend of visual novel-style conversations and fully animated cutscenes. 
It’s good to see even small glimpses of Digimon Survive (which was originally slated to launch in 2019) and hopefully, we’ll finally get to play it sometime this year. You can find the game on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Guerrilla Games is hard at work at making Horizon Forbidden West the best it can possibly be, fixing bugs and progression blocks, improving its visuals, and more. 
Today, Patch 1.08 went live and like the patches before it, it brings a wealth of fixes to the open-world RPG alongside some graphical improvements. As usual, the patch notes also include issues Guerrilla Games is aware of but still working to fix.

Bethesda released the second episode of its Into the Starfield series today. The developer diaries provide glimpses into the game’s development with discussions from the designers about what the game entails while sprinkling concept art and even some light game footage. 
You can catch the first episode of Into the Starfield here. This second installment sees game director Todd Howard sit down with design director Emil Pagliarulo, lead quest designer Will Shen, and lead artist Istvan Pely to discuss Starfield’s open-world design and how it gives players the freedom to carve their own path. Accomplishing that relies in part on how players can interact with the game’s factions as well as individuals, with the team chatting up Starfield’s more sophisticated persuasion system. Check out the full video below.

Bethesda has slowly rolled out information on Starfield over the last several months, but a gameplay trailer remains elusive. If you haven’t been keeping up, Bethesda has thus far divulged details of Starfield’s lore and backstory and shown off a few locations. All of that has been helpful, but we’re anxious to see how it all comes together in-game. 
Starfield launches November 11 for Xbox Series X/S and PC and launches day one on Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has revealed that it will not be holding its usual EA Play Live event this year, which is traditionally an event the company uses to reveal new games and share more info about existing games, typically held during the summer. 
This news comes by way of IGN, which reports that rather than hosting an EA Play Live event like in previous summers, the publisher will instead reveal more about its projects “when the time is right for each of them.” Here’s what an EA representative told IGN in a statement sent to the publication: 
EA Play Live events have basically become EA’s own E3-like showcase, with the publisher even opting to hold it usually around the same time as E3. It’s been doing EA Play Live since 2016. Before the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the event was a live in-person event where players could play things shown during the showcase and more. However, as a result of the pandemic, the event became a steaming one, akin to something like a Nintendo Direct or PlayStation State of Play. 
This news comes just a few months after word that E3 would not be held as in-person event this year dropped. However, Geoff Keighley’s own E3-like event, Summer Games Fest, is happening this year as usual. 
While waiting to see what EA shows throughout the year, check out the latest footage of its Dead Space remake. Read about how EA pledged total freedom to its studios with game development, including Dragon Age, Titanfall, and more last year after that.

Elden Ring has been out for just 20 days and already, it’s sold a meteoric 12 million copies, making it the best-selling From Software Soulsborne game yet. 
Comparatively, Dark Souls 3 took a couple of months to sell 3 million copies and even years later, as of 2020, it has sold 10 million. That Elden Ring surpassed Dark Souls 3’s sales (as of 2020) in less than three weeks is quite the feat. This news comes by way of a new press release From Software released, praising the game for selling 1 million of those 12 million just inside of Japan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The LimeWire name brings back many memories for many early adopters of P2P file-sharing. The popular application shut down well over a decade ago but according to many mainstream news outlets, it's making a comeback as an NFT marketplace. In reality, this new project has nothing to do with the original LimeWire, whose founder Mark Gorton is not happy with the confusion being created.

Over the past two decades, Rockstar Games has emerged as a force to be reckoned with in the games industry. Rising up from quirky Scotland-based developers with a taste for pulp and crime fiction, Rockstar evolved radically, shifting into innovators and provocateurs, creating some of the industry's most influential and blockbuster titles. In the lead up to the eagerly anticipated Red Dead Redemption 2, we came together as a staff to rank every single game that Rockstar developed (this means we excluded published titles like L.A. Noire and Smuggler's Run). From the humble top-down beginnings of Grand Theft Auto to the blood-soaked streets of Manhunt and the beautiful jaw-dropping vistas of Red Dead Redemption, you’ll find every single title put in its proper place in terms of influence, importance of innovation, and just plain fun.
With all that in mind, let’s steal a ride and roar down this road to hell. Read more...]]></summary>

Ghostwire: Tokyo launches in just over a week, and PlayStation 5 players will have a lot to consider in terms of getting the most out of the spooky experience. That’s because the game sports not one, not two, but six graphical and performance options.
We’re reviewing Ghostwire: Tokyo and have listed each mode along with their in-game explanation. However, the game only lays out what the two primary modes do, which are:  
Quality Mode: A high-fidelity rendering mode with ray tracing enabled. 30 FPS limit
Performance Mode: A high-framerate mode designed for the smoothest gameplay. 60 FPS limit.
Additionally, a category labeled HFR (High Framerate) is described as having "an uncapped framerate and tweaks to graphic quality that allow for an even higher-framerate experience." It contains four options without descriptions, but Video Games Chronicle expounded on these which we’ve shared below:
High Framerate Quality: Quality mode with an uncapped framerate between 30-50 FPS.
High Framerate Performance: Performance mode with uncapped framerate over 60 FPS.
High Framerate Quality (VSync): Same as High Framerate Quality but with Vsync enabled. 
High Framerate Performance (VSync): Same as High Framerate Performance but with Vsync enabled.
Games with multiple graphical/performance options have become the norm in recent years, but Ghostwire: Tokyo may take the cake, and figuring out which one is “best” will depend on several factors (such as your monitor) as well as personal preference. 
Ghostwire: Tokyo launches March 25 on PlayStation 5 and PC. You can watch us tour its haunted streets in this episode of New Gameplay Today.

GhostWire Tokyo, one of our most anticipated horror games of 2022, is incredibly stylish. Developer Tango Gameworks' open-world environments are as ambitious as they are unsettling, as twisting hallways and shifting rooms give way to dreadful encounters with Yōkai – wayward spirits inspired by Japanese folklore. In this episode of New Gameplay Today, I sit down with Blake Hester to share our preview impressions from the second chapter of GhostWire Tokyo. We're accompanied by footage from my hands-on gameplay session, which I captured via PS5 performance mode.

Halo: The Series is set to premiere on Paramount+ next week, on March 24, and to prepare viewers for the journey ahead, a new two-minute trailer has been released. 
The trailer features voice-over by multiple characters we’ll likely learn more about in the series, including what sounds like Dr. Halsey and others. It, of course, features plenty of the Covenant, including an Elite with a sword, and a handful of very-cool Master Chief moments.

As you can see in the trailer above, the narration that plays over it is all about the costs of protecting what’s sacred. As for what “sacred” is, it’s likely different for everyone involved. For Master Chief? It’s completing the mission, whatever it is. Like the trailers before this one, the series is looking great, and fortunately, we don’t have to wait long to watch it because it begins streaming on Paramount+ next week. 
In the meantime, watch the first teaser released for Halo: The Series and then read about how it’s already been renewed for a second season. You can also read about the decision to reveal Master Chief's face in the show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re unfamiliar with Redout, it’s an anti-gravity racer inspired by the likes of F-Zero and Wipeout. And if you’ve not played any of those before, then imagine a pod-racer from Star Wars belting it down Mario Kart’s Rainbow Road - except, hang on, there’s a mysterious white powder caked on the bristles of Mario’s mustache. The sheer speed of the first game made it pretty popular among race-heads, but a bit of a daunting prospect for those used to a traditional “wheels on the ground” racing experience.
Redout 2 doubles down on the speed element, that's for sure. But there's definitely an added air of approachability to this anti-grav racer, making the transition from Geforce to g-force a little less bruising than before. AI presets, added customisation, and more generous modes help make this a racing game you should keep up with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may not have heard much about developer Complex Games, but the Canadian studio has a surprisingly storied history. Despite spending the last two decades building mobile and browser games for the likes of Disney, Nickelodeon and Zynga, their heart has always resided with the PC. "There wasn't a lot of game development in Winnipeg, so we tried to figure it out ourselves and spent a few years trying to build a PC game," says creative director Noah Decter-Jackson. Fresh out of college, Complex's first project was a third-person hand-to-hand action prototype that they pitched to publishers at E3 2003, an endeavour that Decter-Jackson describes as "phenomenally unsuccessful".
This led to Complex remodelling as a work-for-hire outfit, and their long track-record making mobile games. But in 2015, Complex launched The Horus Heresy: Drop Assault, a fast-paced tactics game in conjunction with Games Workshop. In the wake of Drop Assault's success, the studio saw an opportunity. "We had been wanting for a long time to return to our PC roots," he says. "So we pitched a core idea for a game to Games Workshop, because Drop Assault had been quite successful... and that's essentially how Chaos Gate: Daemonhunters came to be."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First unveiled last week, Ship Of Fools is an upcoming seafaring roguelite where you and a fellow co-op pal take on hordes of horrible beasties as you sail the high seas. Depending on your choice of player two, it's also likely to be an apt description of how you'll feel playing it.
Having waded through an early preview build of its opening Forgotten Waters stage this week, this is one co-operative cannon fest that seems destined to see friends and family not so much walk the plank after an untimely defeat as get absolutely spanked by it. Imagine the visual chaos of a game like Overcooked combined with the frantic, tactile ship management of Lovers In A Dangerous Spacetime and you're pretty much there, albeit with several more barnacles, bug-spewing mosquitoes and laser-firing totem poles in the mix. The jangle of Davy Jones' locker is never far away in this storm-stricken archipelago, so beware, fools. You will not be suffered gladly.

I'm not very good at it, to be honest, so recently knocked it down to easy difficulty in order to stomp on robot heads with greater efficiency. Good ol' Aloy.
Anyway, now that I have awakened a sort of mother-surrogate AI and started the actual business of saving the world, I cannot help but ask the key question: why can I still not ride into battle atop a massive great robot T-Rex?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can't remember if I've mentioned this to you, dear readers, but I am currently mid-emigration. In about two weeks I'm moving to Ireland, which means for the past four months my live has been hellish. The paperwork the move involves, especially now we have from our European womb been untimely ripped, is a Kafkaesque nightmare. To ship my stuff without incurring importation tax I need to prove I'm going to live in Ireland and not just sell a bunch of second hand cutlery and old bras (one of those two things would probably be pretty lucrative, in fairness). This is all complicated even furtherer by the fact that I only found a flat to move to yesterday, and still don't have the tenancy agreement for it, which means no proof of address. Life, oh life.
I don't really have the option to have a piece of toast and watch the evening news, because when I'm not scanning my passport or estimating what worth to attach to my towels for the purposes of the shipping company's insurance, I am packing said towels into boxes, along with everything else I own. Basically the only free time I have is my lunch break. And what I am doing in my lunch break is making huge, virtual jigsaw puzzles in Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams. It's either that or go and sit in the toilets and have a little stress-cry. And as the move date approaches, the size of the puzzles has increased. On Thursday I started one that is 6k pieces. This may have been a miscalculation.

It launched in May 2021 in a sorry state and, while developers Frontier have been fixing it up, it's still a mess now. This week Frontier announced that to help focus their efforts on fixing Odyssey, they're cancelling the yet-unreleased console version. Good news for us on PC, I suppose, but oof! "This was not an easy decision to make, but it was made with the long-term future of Elite Dangerous in mind," Frontier frontman David Braben said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve have gathered up some crucial Windows drivers for the Steam Deck, improving performance for those who want to ditch the default SteamOS and replace it with Windows 10. GPU, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers are all available from Steam Support, so early Deck adopters looking for a change can get the requisite downloads all in one place.


These drivers come with caveats, mind. Audio drivers are still a work in progress, so only USB-C, 3.5mm, or Bluetooth headphones can output sound on Windows, and Valve’s post explains that dual-booting support still isn’t ready yet. Installing Windows, then, is an all-or-nothing switch that involves wiping SteamOS entirely.

Shadows Of Forbidden Gods is different. It's all about building the power of your evil god under the radar until it's too late for anyone to defeat you. The more I've played it, the more I start to suspect that this concept will always suffer from being gamed by player who'll seek the most efficient paths. Any system of influencing and manipulating characters will necessarily be abstracted, and at some point subtlety becomes just another numerical value.


I suppose what I'm saying is that SOFG is more fun if you revel in scheming and causing chaos, and given the choice between effective and interesting, will always do the right thing.

There are some traditional digressions, although there's no substantial Henry Cavill update this week. We spend some time discussing which dinosaur we would most like to ride as a mount, and whether we would rather fight one The Rock sized spider, or 30 spider sized The Rocks. This week's Cavern of Lies is WoW-themed, and if you'd like to listen along to Latvia's Eurovision entry this year then here's the link. Be warned that it is NSFW.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Social media sucks doesn't it? You sign up for a feed of dross that never stops, like you've paid for a rotten Fruit Winder that simply won't stop unwinding. Others who've bought into the same Fruit Winder exchange thoughts on its sour taste, until yet more, who quite like the flavour, come to its defense in droves. A war of words ensues over whether the Fruit Winder tastes nice. And it's not even a Fruit Winder, it's an app called Facebook, or Twitter, or Instagram, for goodness sakes.
Admittedly, there is something gratifying about popping off on social media. Even just getting a few likes for a dumb joke can make you feel alive. So, I say you swap Twitter for Elden Ring, a superior social media platform: You leave players helpful messages or total dross, it gets appraised, you feel great. Invading other worlds is a more interactive way of making friends and/or enemies too – it's perfect.

After a swim I'd stare longingly at the snacks I couldn't afford then stand on tip-toes before the game I couldn't afford to play, waggling a joystick and mashing buttons to pretend I was controlling the attract mode demo. Appealing to this sort of nostalgia, Konami have announced they're releasing a collection of 13 vintage Ninja Turtles games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article contains spoilers for Lost Ark's main questline.


Lost Ark is a very silly game, but not in the way it initially seems. For its first 15 hours or so, Smilegate's ARPG is like someone described Lord of the Rings to the developers through a door, an overblown yet generic riff on Western fantasy tropes with overdesigned yet underwritten characters, all of whom talk about the game's plainly ridiculous lore with the gravity of a neutron star. The game's ignorance of its own absurdity is funny, but the story itself is not much fun.


This begins to change once you approach level 50. After completing the continent of East Luterra, Lost Ark suddenly explodes in scale. It gives you a ship, and sets you off on a massive globetrotting adventure, with around a dozen other continents to explore, and dozens more tiny islands, each with their own little questlines. Your first destination across Lost Ark's ocean is an island called Tortoyk (pronounced like "Tortoise", but with a K), and it's here where the game stops pretending to be a serious high-fantasy adventure, revealing itself to be something much more entertaining.

With the right tools, then, you can plug into a monitor, add a mouse and keyboard, and get playing as if it were a (somewhat) conventional gaming rig. But how well does the Steam Deck work as a desktop PC, really? Valve’s use of the Linux-based SteamOS alone makes it less of a 1:1 equivalent to a Windows system, and its AMD APU was designed to handle the onboard display’s 1280x800 resolution – not 1080p and above.

Give it some time and it could really shine, but whether it’ll get lost in the Steam release cycle before it even has a chance to fill out remains to be seen.

The series as a whole is still electing to carry on with that subplot about super-advanced precursor god-people, like a chill friend who you ask to party knowing that they will, univited, bring along their mate who is really into a specific genre of sci-fi and will not stop derailing conversations to talk about it. In Valhalla this manifests as protagonist Eivor, Viking raider and big blonde buff meat sculpture, being the reincarnation of Odin, one of the aforementioned god-people. Dawn Of Ragnarök is Eivor dreaming that they are Odin for about 35 hours of adventuring and son-saving in the magical realm of Svartalfheim. That's a pretty intense nap.
