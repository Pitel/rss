        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For fans of Moonlighter and Littlewood.
After a strange calamity wipes out Lonesome Village, the townspeople enlist the help of Wes, the coyote, to help them rebuild. You'll have to rescue each townsperson from the perilous dungeons, escort them home, and then help them restore civilisation by fishing, gardening, decorating, and exploring — imagine Breath of the Wild, but Link actually gives a toss about Hyrule. Also, he's a coyote.
Combining dungeon crawling, puzzle solving, and social simulation, Lonesome Village is a fantasy adventure with no combat — unless you count fishing. We've covered the game before when it was announced back in September of 2021, and it's even on our list of 33 Indie Games We're Excited About On Switch In 2022, so you know we're excited about it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dread it, run from it...
Dungeons of Dreadrock is a simple little game centering around the efforts of an adventurous girl to save her brother from sacrificing himself in a haunted dungeon. He’s been taken down a hundred floors crawling with goblins, spiders, traps, and other awful things, and you’ll need to overcome it all if you wish to save him. Narrative is kept to a minimum here, but brief vignettes that play out every few floors when you nap by a bonfire help to give you a sense of the world and why your brother felt the need to sacrifice himself.
Gameplay has been compared to a dungeon crawler, but this is really a puzzle game with swords ‘n’ sorcery set dressing. Every floor of the dungeon is laid out in a grid-like fashion, and the goal is to figure out how to reach the next set of stairs safely, often necessitating you game out precisely how to dispatch of any foes and avoid triggering obstacles along the way. In this way, it’s not the kind of thing where you’ll be testing your skills or dexterity much—the emphasis here is more on forming the plan than executing it.

Reports from Variety, Gizmodo, and more indicate those 15 minutes were very hype but perhaps more interesting for those who weren’t fortunate enough to see the 15 minutes. The producer duo also teased that Across the Spider-Verse will contain more than 200 characters. More specifically, it will have 240 characters, which is quite a significant jump from Into the Spider-Verse’s 40 characters, Variety reports. 


The producers also shared that Across the Spider-Verse takes place across six different universes, starting on Earth-65, where Hailee Steinfeld’s Gwen Stacy li…]]></summary>

We're sure the delay of the Super Mario animated movie has sent shockwaves around the world. Originally on course for a 22nd December release, the film — starring Chris Pratt as the Italian plumber — has been pushed back to April 2023. In the early hours of the morning (for many of us!), Shigeru Miyamoto and Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri put out statements to deliver this poison mushroom to eager fans.
Miyamoto's statement, in particular, has fired up the inspiration of many online, because of course it has. In case you missed it, here's the statement from Nintendo's Twitter account:

With the release of Sonic Origins coming up this summer, it'll be the first time in a long, long time that all five classic main Sonic games will be grouped together and playable in one collection. So it's perhaps no surprise that Sega has announced that it will be delisting numerous versions of classic Sonic games on 20th May.
There's no reason to panic if you're a Switch owner, however. Both Sonic the Hedgehog and the sequel's SEGA AGES releases will be safe, as will the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pass release of Sonic the Hedgehog 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games has announced that the next artist in its Soundwave Series, which sees artists from around the world perform on creative islands, is rapper Emicida. 
Emicida is one of the biggest rappers in Brazil, and his performance will begin Friday, April 29, at 6 p.m. EST. It will repeat non-stop for 72 hours until Monday, May 2, at 6 p.m. EST. To accompany Emicida’s performance, the Keep Going Lobby Track and Triumphant Emote will be available in the Fortnite Item Shop starting this Thursday, April 28, at 8 p.m. EST. Upon completing Emicada’s experience, you’ll receive some XP and the Soundwave Series – Emicada Spray as a memento from the show. 
As for what to expect beyond the actual performance, you’ll find a creative island inspired by Emicida’s life journey and how it influenced his music, made by community creators BertBuilds, Paradox Builds, and Zen Creative. 
“The setlist, which includes some of Emicida’s biggest hits, tells the story of how he grew up in Jardim Cachoeira in the north of São Paulo, Brazil, and became one of the most popular rappers in Brazil and a successful artist worldwide,” an Epic Games blog post reads. “In the experience, Emicida shares a bit of his path as a rapper, from where he was doing street rap battles to becoming recognized internationally.” 

Players will have the option to watch the show via Picture-in-Picture while playing other Creative Experiences, Battle Royale, and more if they don’t want to experience it on the creator-built island. However, Epic Games says this is available only during certain times of the event. It can be accessed through the game’s settings, but interactive elements will not be playable if the experience is viewed through Picture-in-Picture. 
For more about Emicida’s Soundwave Series event, read the full Epic Games blog post.

All the familiar civilizations are back, except for the mantis-like Thalan, and there are some newbies like the Festron Hunt: crab monsters that eat other races and sound a bit like Neal Asher's Prador. Maps are now broken into discrete chunks called Star Sectors too, linked by subspace streams that have to be discovered and researched so they can be navigated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay, what's the SECOND best Star Fox game, then?
You hear that? That is the sound of a 25-year-old 64-bit Arwing firing up its turbo boosters as Lylat Wars fast approaches its quarter-century. (Yes, Lylat Wars -- look it up, kids.)
To say that the Star Fox franchise never got better than its first sequel isn't too controversial these days. The original game was a technical triumph on the 16-bit Super NES, of course, but the power of the Nintendo 64 enabled the developers to amp up the cinematic references and really immerse you in the Lylat system and the cockpit of Fox McCloud's Arwing — with the Rumble Pak providing added immersion with some chunky force feedback. To this day, it's a truly stellar game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warstride Challenges is an early access FPS that takes the retro shoot 'em up and straps it in a rally car. Each level is a course with straights and corners and demons. You must cross the finish line as fast as you possibly can, but the chequered flag only springs up if you've turned every demon along the way into a red paste.
The game is an FPS for perfectionists and speed junkies who want to look cool. It's quite literally a time attack with a learning curve that's worth investing in. Sure, the littlest mistakes can mean disaster, but when you take time to master a course, it's a payoff you'll remember.

The Pokemon Company has announced an air date for their upcoming anime web series based on the recent game Pokemon Legends: Arceus. Originally announced as part of the company's Pokémon Day celebrations, the series will be airing on Pokémon TV and the Official Pokémon YouTube channel.
You'd be forgiven if many of the most recent Pokémon Presents announcements slipped right by you after The Pokémon Company capped off its showcase with the reveal of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. But today, the official Pokémon Twitter reminded us that the show is coming, and it'll be here on 18th May. Not a very wintery time of year here in the UK, mind you, but we'll always take some new Pokémon content.

        <updated>2022-04-26T14:28:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Players suspect that a closed colosseum in Elden Ring could be the location for a potential PvP-based DLC or expansion. Popular From Software modder Lance McDonald was able to look inside it with a mod. He confirmed that the colosseum’s outer walls aren’t just set dressing but actual walls to an arena. 
As reported by Video Games Chronicle, another From Software modder, Sekiro Dubi, used a mod to enter the colosseum and explore it even further. Surprisingly, Sekiro Dubi discovered not just a colosseum to explore, but two additional Elden Ring enemies and even a new Site of Grace, which are Elden Ring’s version of Dark Souls' bonfires. 


As noted by VGC, the Site of Grace seems to indicate that this area was reachable within the game at one point or another, unless, of course, this Site of Grace will become reachable one day in a patch or DLC that allows players into the colosseum. Sekiro Dubi notes in their video above that the Site of Grace is called “?PlaceName?” (an obvious placeholder name) in the locations menu, but they point out that leaked Network Test files point to it being called Leyndell Colosseum. 
As far as new enemies go, there’s a Gladiator Large and an Old Lion of the Arena, neither of which can be found elsewhere in Elden Ring. Sekiro Dubi notes that in-game lore indicates that this colosseum was a place where warriors fought against beasts. 
For now, this colosseum remains inaccessible to the standard playerbase as it’s only reachable via mods. However, many speculate that it will become a PvP arena someday. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring review and then check out this story about how Elden Ring was the best-selling game in the U.S. for the second month in a row. Read about the latest Elden Ring patch that adjusts sorcery, incantation, and weapon skill balancing after that.

We love a good sale, and this week, it's Capcom delivering the goods. As Golden Week — a week in Japan where four national holidays occur between 29th April and 3rd May — approaches, many Japanese developers reduce the prices of their games in order to celebrate the break. Well, how else are you going to spend those extra days off?
While Golden Week isn't celebrated in the West, we do still get to see the discounts. Capcom has slashed the prices of multiple big releases across the Switch and 3DS eShops in North America, starting today! At the time of writing, the sale isn't currently live in the UK or Europe, but we'll let you know if that happens. We can't keep missing out... can we?

Publisher Ubisoft has announced that it has shut down online multiplayer functionality for a bunch of its older games, many of which can be found on the Wii and Wii U. You can view Ubisoft's full announcement here.
Naturally, this means that you'll no longer be able to play online, however the move also extends to disable unlockable content, player statistics, and functionality with Ubisoft Connect. If you've previously redeemed unlockable content on console, it will continue to be accessible unless you reset your game entirely. PC players will get the short end of the stick, however, as unlockable content will be completely inaccessible, even if you've redeemed it previously.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Apex Legends Season 12 coming to a close, fans have been eagerly waiting for news about the next chapter in Respawn’s battle royale and what it has to offer. A cinematic trailer dropped yesterday, revealing the game’s next defensive legend, Newcastle, while showcasing Titanfall Spectres and feral wildlife along Storm Point’s tropical beaches. You can watch the footage below. 


Apex loremasters might already know that Bangalore has a friendly rivalry and close relationship with her older brother, Jackson. While protecting Bangalore during the Battle of Gridiron, Jackson is presumed KIA. We join Bangalore after some time has passed; she’s announced her retirement from the Apex Games. At the same time, a masked defender named Newcastle is slated to be her replacement. Of course, explosive hijinks ensue while the two squad up for Bangalore’s final battle royale match. Bullets whiz past faces, grenades leave craters in the sand, and Titanfall Spectres ambush our favorite legends while they slay a massive beast. Bangalore is surprised to learn the truth behind Newcastle’s mysterious identity by the end of it all.
Season 13 “Saviors” might shift up the meta with the inclusion of Newcastle. While the terminology for the character’s abilities isn't clear, it’s safe to assume that he’ll keep his teammates safe with well-timed fortifications. According to speculation, he might even be able to drag downed allies out of the fight while reviving them. If this holds, then we’re in for significant changes in the casual and competitive levels of play.

Think of these complaints, for the most part, as a pre-flight checklist done long before the pilot has even sat down; if the game were not in early access, these would be big disappointments rather than exactly the kind of annoying details that early access is meant to iron out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo and Universal’s Illumination Entertainment’s upcoming film adaptation of the Super Mario Bros. series is delayed to next spring. 
Instead of hitting theaters on Dec. 21 of this year, the movie will be released on April 7 in North America and a few weeks later in Japan, on April 28. This announcement came by way of a rather odd tweet from the Nintendo of America account that seems to indicate the news comes straight from Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto himself. 
This is Miyamoto. After consulting with Chris-san, my partner at Illumination on the Super Mario Bros. film, we decided to move the global release to Spring 2023–April 28 in Japan and April 7 in North America. My deepest apologies but I promise it will be well worth the wait.
April 26, 2022
The Illumination Twitter account released the news at the same time last night with a similar message. 
“Miyamoto-san and I have been collaborating on all aspects of the Super Mario Bros. film and, together with our partners at Universal, have decided to move the global release to Spring 2023 – April 7 in North America and April 28 in Japan. We are excited to share this incredible film with you.” 
As you can see, neither company lists a definitive reason for the delay, but it seems like the movie simply needed some additional time in the oven. Considering that this is Nintendo’s first significant foray into animated silver screen features and how big the Mario brand is, it makes sense to take all the time needed to make this movie the best it can be. 
Reports from November of last year indicated that Nintendo was happy with the film thus far. Miyamoto reportedly even hinted that more movies based on Nintendo properties could be on the way. While waiting to see if that becomes true, check out the complete cast list for this Super Mario Bros. film. 
Are you excited about this movie? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Ratalaika Games keeps busy with budget releases on the Switch eShop, and the next on the way is from Brazilian developer Asterstic Game Studio. Dandy & Randy DX arrives this week on 29th April priced at $6.99USD / €6,99, and promises top-down adventure puzzling with a retro vibe.
As you can see in the trailer it has some energetic chiptune and colourful art, with the idea being that you're exploring a distant land to find riches (your character is a plucky archaeologist that's battling debt). Though, as you can tell, the plot is less important than the fact you're alternating between characters, getting around with various abilities and tackling pirate foes like 'Otto the Octopus' and 'Bruno the Bear'.

Splatoon 3 is in the process of being primed for its 9th September release date, and Nintendo has finally started shedding more light on what we can expect from the upcoming paint-based shooter.
Nintendo UK, specifically, gave us a glimpse at a brand new weapon being introduced to the Inklings and Octolings' third outing — the Ink Vac. This curious-looking device looks just like a leaf blower, except it sucks up paint. Y'know, because Splatoon is about colours and paint? Or ink.

The Super Mario range for LEGO has been coming on leaps and bounds over the past couple of years, with sets bringing in characters and items from classic Super Mario titles and Luigi's Mansion, alongside a brand new Peach's Castle expansion set to launch in August 2022.
If an online listing is to be believed, however, it seems a new 18+ Super Mario set is on its way. No details have been gleaned on what the set might entail, but after initial discovery of the listing a couple of months back, we do at least have a decent view on how much it will cost and how many LEGO pieces will be included.

Finally last year after going through many rounds of review, the new driver was merged into Linux 5.15.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been MIA for quite a while.
It seems almost unthinkable for a major website to leave out one of the most vital methods of site navigation in 2022. Yet after launching digital games on its online web store in December 2021, Nintendo Australia neglected to allow users to search for specific games. That means for a good four months or so, users were limited to browsing for games in areas like charts, sales, and recent releases. Naturally, this meant that hundreds, if not thousands, of games were effectively inaccessible to users of the web store - not ideal.
After some site maintenance, it seems Nintendo Australia has finally joined the modern age and implemented search functionality for its digital game catalogue. We've quickly tested it out ourselves; searching for a game will bring up two tabs, Physical Products and Digital Games, so if the site doesn't stock any physical products for a specific game, you can be sure they'll at least have the digital version available.

This new PIN protection leads a bevy of other features including localised keyboards, a redesigned achievements page, and support for games and apps with multiple windows, which you can now flick between via the Steam button menu.


Without the update, it’s possible to just sign into your Steam account once and never need to punch in credentials again, even after a full restart. This is convenient, especially if your Steam Deck isn’t at risk of chicanery from young siblings or vengeful housemates, but giving it the Deck a lock screen goes a long way in guarding it from prying hands. It’s definitely worth the longer-than-usual update installation, at any rate.

In a blog post today, Hideaki Nishino, senior vice president of platform experience at PlayStation, introduced VRR and described the basics of how it works.

This enhances visual performance for PS5 games by minimizing or eliminating visual artifacts, such as frame pacing issues and screen tearing," writes Nishino. “It causes the games to look smoother overall and can even reduce input latency.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A forthcoming Pokémon Go update will dramatically overhaul the game's current approach to Mega Evolutions. As they stand now, Mega Evolutions require a hefty amount of candy for a particular Pokémon to evolve into its larger form, which is only available for a set amount of time. Each time the player wants to use this powerful form, more candy is required, and it isn't easy to come by, as it is tied to timed raids and missions.
After the update hits, there will be a one-time cost for Mega Evolving a Pokémon, meaning you can evolve it freely without using more candy. The only catch here is that your Pokémon will become fatigued after transforming and will need time to regain its fighting form before evolving again.

Overwatch 2 was announced in 2019, and following years of development, the updated hero shooter is headed into its first PvP beta test starting tomorrow. Ahead of the beta, Blizzard Entertainment has posted a FAQ about the test, answering all kinds of questions about who can participate, when the test goes live, and how one can join in on the fun. We've combed through the FAQ to sift out the most crucial info you need to know. 
First, players who have been selected to participate will recieve an email to whichever address their Blizzard account is linked to. Those emails will be sent out starting tomorrow morning and will continue to be sent to more participants throughout the day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTX 3070 Ti is a great mid-range to high-end GPU, with excellent performance in rasterised games plus DLSS and RT support, but it's been hard to find at a good price if you haven't lucked out with a Founders Edition restock. Prices for third-party cards are slowly falling, and now have reached within £100 of the £549 UK RRP - an important milestone for GPUs that cost £1000 or more at the beginning of the year. 
The cheapest RTX 3070 Ti model we've found is a Zotac RTX 3070 Ti Trinity at Ebuyer, who are asking £649 with a despatch date of April 26th(tomorrow!). If you want the cheapest model that's in stock right now, then that'll be the Inno3D RTX 3070 Ti X3 at Overclockers for £10 more. Either way, you'll be left with a performant graphics card that requires only a modest 750W PSU, less than Nvidia's higher-end GPUs and much less than the company's next-gen products rumoured to arrive towards the end of this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[March 2022 was a great month for Microsoft because the Xbox Series X/S was the best-selling hardware platform last month in the U.S. in terms of dollar sales. It was also the best-selling console in dollar sales for the entire first quarter of the year. 
This news comes by way of The NPD Group’s Mat Piscatella in his usual monthly NPD numbers round-up. While Xbox Series X/S took home the gold medal in terms of dollar sales, the Switch sold the most units in March 2022 and in the first quarter of the year. Xbox’s great March sales led to March 2022 being an all-time high March record for the hardware platform. NPD reports that previous Xbox bests for March were set in March 2011 (in terms of unit sales) and in March 2014 (in terms of dollar sales). 
Overall, hardware dollar sales dropped 24…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Midnight Ghost Hunt is the latest in a steadily lengthening line of Prop Hunt-inspired party games. There are two teams: the Ghosts, and the Hunters. The Ghosts can possess objects in the world to hide inside, and their job is to survive until midnight. The Hunters must use a variety of high-tech gadgets and weapons to track down and destroy the Ghosts before that time, or else risk being hunted themselves once midnight strikes.
The game is already out on Steam Early Access, and has been for a few weeks now. You’ll probably know already whether you’d be interested in giving it a go: after all, it’s Prop Hunt. But it’s also got a fair few more bells and whistles than other Prop Hunt-likes that I’ve come across. So, a group of us decided to get together one chill winter’s eve (sunny Friday morning actually, but hey, I’m tryna set a spooky tone), and bash each other’s heads with inanimate objects for a few hours. And judging from all the yelps and shouting, I’d say we had a good time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has officially revealed Project Q, a multiplayer arena battler that leaked last year. 
In September 2021, a list of upcoming PC games was datamined and leaked from Nvidia’s GeForce Now. As Eurogamer reported at the time, Project Q was one of four codenamed titles listed by Ubisoft, who issued a DCMA takedown of the list once it hit online.  
The French publisher confirmed Project Q’s existence on Twitter on Saturday, stating that the game is in early development and that players can register for upcoming gameplay tests. The timeframe for these tests is unknown. Ubisoft subsequently clarified in the same Twitter thread that Project Q is not a battle royale and will feature several PvP modes. It also states there are no plans to add NFTs to the game, evidently a concern given Ubisoft’s enthusiastic foray into the concept with its ill-received Quartz platform. 
So, we heard you heard... 🤷

April 23, 2022
Leaked playtest footage from Exputer shows a couple of matches from the game. It appears to be a colorful third-person shooter not unlike Fortnite with zany weapons such as a fireworks gun and melee items such as a staff and even Thor’s hammer, Mjolnir. 
According to Project Q’s registration site, the game is launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Ubisoft Connect. It does not have a release window.  
In other recent Ubisoft news, several private firms are apparently looking to acquire the publisher. In terms of other new multiplayer titles, a new Ghost Recon game has entered development.]]></summary>

However, despite this, Ubisoft hasn’t reportedly entered into serious talks or negotiation proceedings with these potential purchasers and Bloomberg’s sources say it’s unclear whether Ubisoft’s major shareholder is even wiling to pursue a transaction such as this in the first place.

An odd choice, considering Shiro Games themselves downplay RTS elements in a Steam blog. Spice Wars is as much 4X as the dead eyes of two smiley faces, and one with enough forward momentum as to make such tantalising lies unnecessary. Embrace your grand strategy! It’s like John Dune always said: “Fear is the path to the dark side, Malcolm Reynolds”.

Raven Software quality assurance workers at Activision Blizzard will get the chance to vote whether or not to unionize starting this month, after a ruling from the National Labor Relations Board. 
This news comes by way of Polygon, which reports that the NLRB ruled Friday that the 21-person QA unit in question is eligible to unionize after Raven’s parent company, Activision Blizzard, challenged the effort, attempting to make it so that the entire 230-person team must vote on the decision. Now, the 21 people in question can begin voting once ballots, which are going to be mailed out on April 29, have been received. The ballots will be counted on May 23 and if a supermajority of yes is reached, the Game Workers Alliance union will be official and can begin negotiations with A…]]></summary>

Ubisoft have now offered up registration for testing and updates through Ubisoft Connect.

Diablo Immortal was revealed by Blizzard Entertainment four years ago, in 2018, and when it was announced, it was said to be a mobile-only game for iOS and Android devices. That remained the case for quite some time, but in recent betas, the team came to realize that if it truly wanted to embrace the spirit of bringing a Diablo experience to more players than ever before, Diablo Immortal needed to come to PC, too. And now, Blizzard has announced that it is, and the team has revealed an official release date, too. More specifically, it will hit iOS a…]]></summary>

Blizzard has revealed that its Diablo MMOARPG, Diablo Immortal, will finally be released to mobile devices on June 2 and in a surprise announcement, it will hit PC in open beta on the same day. 
First announced in 2018, Diablo Immortal is not just the first Diablo game to hit mobile devices – iOS and Android – but it’s also the first MMO for the series. Blizzard has also revealed that Diablo Immortal will feature crossplay and cross-progression on day one, meaning you can end a session on PC and pick right back up where you were on your mobile device. Diablo Immortal will be available on June 2 in most regions, with some Asia-Pacific regions gaining access a few weeks later.

We weren't seeded by AMD for this launch, leading us to anticipate that it's not too good for Linux gaming / not their target market. But after the great success I've had with AMD Milan-X performance on Linux, I was very eager to try out this consumer CPU with the 3D-stacked L3 cache and ended up purchasing a 5800X3D. Indeed the Ryzen 7 5800X3D turned out to be disappointing for Linux gaming performance but the 5800X3D was very interesting for a range of other technical workloads and making me very excited for future Ryzen CPUs with 3D V-Cache.]]></summary>

It is TikTok's text-to-speech voice, and it is everywhere. Now it's even in Half-Life, thanks to a mod which replaces the opening tram ride voiceover with a TikTok TTS version. It's a distressing artifact, and I hate that it kinda works. See/hear for yourself in the video below.

Not only did they construct an entire walled city to hark back to its iconic, titular location, but they also had an enormous Nautiloid crashed into the top of it. There was a Mindflayer statue on hand as well, for fans to pose with next to their official cosplayers, and a little campfire for attendees to have a small sit down on, just like they'd do when resting in the game. It was such an incredible booth that we asked Larian to give us a tour of it, and while we did so we also took the opportunity to chat a bit about the reception of Update 7, the confirmation of its 2023 release date and more.

We had another jam-packed schedule today, checking out Dome Keeper (formerly known as Ludum Dare darling Dome Romantik) over on the Raw Fury booth, before heading over to the PAX Rising Showcase to check out a specially curated selection of upcoming indie games. We also caught up with Larian to chat about Baldur's Gate 3 (watch out for a dedicated video coming in the next day or two), and we capped off the day by attending Shirley "Skyrim Grandma" Curry's panel over on the Bumblebee Theatre stage. I'll be writing up a separate post about this in the coming days, but needless to say, Shirley was an absolute delight.

Now, everyone's favourite bomb disposal expert is back in McPixel 3 (solo developer Sos Sosowski prefers we never mention the likes of McPixel 2), which we got to see in action over at the Devolver booth at PAX East 2022. Sosowski took the reins for us in this demo, showing us exactly how not to save the world in this equally comedic sequel, proving that the McPixel formula is still just as potent ten years on from the original.

Moderated by Overclocking-TV.com's Isaïe "Trouffman" Simonnet with special guests Joe Gialanella from ModMyMods, Eric "hobbseltoff" Hobbs from PC Modding Enthusiast, and Justin "Robeytech" Robey, these four experts took us through the history of PC modding over the last 15 years, the highs and lows of some of their very own builds, and what lies in store for PC modding going forward. It was a fascinating panel, and we caught up with Simonnet afterwards to try and recapture some of that excellent hardware chat for you folks at home.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've emerged from the depths of the BioShock series to begin a fresh season of Video Gameography! We're doing things differently this time as we're discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. We kick things off by examining their debut outing, Bastion.
Bastion launched on Xbox Live Arcade on July 20, 2011, and was created by a ragtag team of seven friends that formed the core of Supergiant (all of whom remain at the studio today). Developed under two years entirely in co-founder Amir Rao's father's living room, Bastion gave the upstart team a chance to create the game of their dreams after spending years working for triple-A studios. We'll discuss Bastion's unorthodox development cycle (it had no pre-production phase), the origins of beloved elements such as its narrator and soundtrack, and how the game's success launched Supergiant into stardom.  
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), and Prima Games staff writer Jesse Vitelli (@jessevitelli) for an entertaining and informative chat about the history and narrative of Bastion! You can also decide which one of us does the best narrator impression.  
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

Instead of plonking ourselves in the middle of the empty show floor after hours, we snuck back into Devolver's booth to film our Friday catch-up, where we started our day some 10 hours beforehand. We got the lowdown on McPixel 3 from solo dev Sos Sosowski, and marvelled once again at the lovely overgrown arcade cabinets of reverse citybuilder Terra Nil. We then moved over to the Focus stand to play supernatural cowboy slayer Evil West and the ultra fast FPS Warstride Challenges. We also stopped by the Pinny Arcade communtiy meet-up today, and sat in on a couple of panels, including one about the history of PC hardware modding and a Wordle Royale. Find out exactly what that means in the video below.

We've just emerged from Gearbox's 80-minute panel at PAX East 2022, and we're wondering how they managed to spend so much time talking about so little. You know something's gone wrong in a conference when you've got an entire segment dedicated to just merch, and Gearbox groupies are hollering for Tiny Tina G-Fuel cans like it was mana from heaven. Lucky for you, we suffered through all the merch plugs, the failed trailer loads, nothing announcements and yet another 20-minute magic set to bring you this condensed version of Gearbox's panel news, all so you don't have to suffer through that interminably long stream. Here's everything you need to know from the Gearbox Main Theatre Show panel in 5 minutes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chants of Sennaar is an eye-catching narrative adventure game that debuted at PAX East whose story is steeped in the legend of Babel. As a robed figure, you must unite a population shunned by the gods by restoring their primary connection: language.
The core of the experience involved decoding ancient languages to communicate with the Tower of Babel's silent residents and solve puzzles. The reveal trailer also showed off more traditional environmental puzzle-solving as well as some stealth; Chants of Sennar is a war of words, rather than fists. The game’s sharp art direction and a relaxing soundtrack lend the game both a soothing and mysterious atmosphere. 


Chants of Sennaar is slated to arrive in 2023 for Switch and PC.]]></summary>

It's only a matter of time before I end up recommending one here, since they're often pretty good, but Approaching Infinity has got there first because it's not only good, it's doing things completely differently.
It's a free-roaming space game about exploring, trading, fighting, and doing questy things. But instead of copying Elite wholesale, it merely borrows some parts, and combines them with a classic roguelike framework, and lovingly paints the result with a huge dose of Star Trek. If your eyebrows just did a thing, I'd be very surprised if you don't enjoy it.

Dubbing Godzilla and Kong as ‘Titans’ of Universal Pictures’ Monsterverse, Call Of Duty is introducing the pair to the Caldera map in the time-limited Operation Monarch event beginning May 11th. According to the patch notes, Monarch is the name of the organisation that tracks down these cryptozoological Titans. Somehow there have been two movies starring the big ape-lad and the large dragon with bad breath now, one of which came out last year. I guess this is a tie-in to that one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no secret that the Halo series has seen its fair share of ups and downs. Episode one saw an exciting introduction to both the iconic Spartans and the brutal Covenant forces that seek to tear humanity apart. 
But then we got weeks of melodrama and ill-paced storylines that made us question if we wanted to continue with the show. Episode five, titled "Reckoning," is a stark reminder of why this series has so much potential, and we're breaking it all down on this special edition of The Game Informer Show!


Join Alex Stadnik and Andrew Reiner as they bring on Kate Sanchéz, EIC and entertainment critic for But Why Tho?, to discuss and spoil the fantastic battle and more from this week's entry in the Paramount Plus series. We start the proceedings off by gauging Kate's level of enjoyment for the show and blow through some of the other less exciting plot points to get to the good stuff.
We also touch on the thankfully brief encounters with Soren and Kwan as they trek through the desert, en route to Madrigal. While that storyline continues to suffer, it wasn't much of a deterrent, as the panel all walked away from this week's show excited for what's to come.
Programming Note: Our Episode six review will premiere on Monday, May 1, instead of the regular Friday timeslot. This is due to a particular video editor and his need to take a vacation. We appreciate your patience and look forward to continuing the series review!
What do you think about Halo thus far? Be sure to let us know in the comments below. We'd also love your feedback on the extra GI Show episodes. Do you like them? Do you want to see us focus on games or the Marvel shows in the future? Please email us at podcast@gameinformer.com or reach out on Discord as we want to know what you think.]]></summary>

If you’ve been playing Call of Duty: Warzone lately, wondering to yourself, “this could really use some more kaiju,” then you’re in luck because that seems to be exactly what Operation Monarch is bringing to the battle royale. 
An Operation Monarch teaser trailer for Call of Duty: Warzone released today teases a climactic showdown between the famed King Kong and Godzilla, not unlike that seen in the 2021 movie, Godzilla vs. Kong. As for how this fight plays into the actual battle royale that is Call of Duty: Warzone, that remains unclear. Save for one of the Warzone planes going down after being grabbed out of the sky by King Kong, the soldiers we play as in the game are nowhere to be seen.
You can check out the teaser trailer for yourself below: 


Operation Monarch will go live on May 11, but hopefully before then, we learn more about how Godzilla and King Kong will actually affect Call of Duty: Warzone. Perhaps they’ll replace the ever-enclosing circle, or perhaps they’ll just be fighting in the background. Regardless, here’s hoping we get some cool skins and customization options related to the kaiju out of this. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer’s Call of Duty: Vanguard review and then read about how a Call of Duty: Modern Warfare sequel and new Warzone game are confirmed for 2022. Check out this story about how Call of Duty will reportedly skip 2023 after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has released the latest batch of games to users subscribed to its Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack and this time, it’s three more Sega Genesis games. 
More specifically, you can now play Space Harrier II, Shining Force II, and Sonic The Hedgehog Spinball on your Switch through the service. These three games join the recently-added Sega Genesis games, Altered Beast, ToeJam & Earl, Dynamite Headdy, Sword of Vermilion, and Thunder Force II, as well as Banjo-Kazooie, which was added to the service back in January. You can check out all three new Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack games in the trailer below: 


Space Harrier II
Space Harrier II was first released in 1988 and was one of the original launch titles for the Mega Drive (what the Sega Genesis was known as in Japan) and one of the six Sega Genesis launch titles in the U.S. Nintendo says Space Harrier II is “a celebrated launch title for the Genesis/Mega Drive,” and that “in this sequel to the popular 3D shoot-em-up, Harrier takes to the skies once more to defend Fantasy Land from a mysterious invader.” 
Shining Force II
Shining Force II is a tactical RPG released in 1993 and while it is a sequel for the franchise, it’s not a direct sequel to the first shining force. Nintendo says this “second entry in the popular tactical-RPG series” features “even more strategic combat.” In it, “Sir Astral’s squire, Bowie, must assemble an army of light from all the world’s races to stop evil from overtaking the land.” 
Sonic The Hedgehog Spinball
Sonic The Hedgehog Spinball is the first of the pinball-related spinoffs in the Sonic franchise. Originally released for the Mega Drive in 1993, Nintendo says “the world’s fastest hedgehog bursts onto the pinball scene in an all-new adventure,” and that “in this action pinball game anyone can pick up and enjoy, gather the Chaos Emeralds, and save four worlds from Dr. Robotnik.”

Larian’s CEO Swen Vincke didn’t make his usual armoured appearance for the announcement, unless you count his legs poking out from behind a desk. Get well soon, Swen. Larian have styled the release date announcement as a look back at Baldur’s Gate 3’s “journey so far” while it’s been in early access. It’s a bit daft, but neatly summarises how the game has evolved over the past two years.

In the latter category, first prize definitely goes to the trio of highly cursed doll babies scattered around the stand for Chernobylite, the post-apocalyptic survival horror roguelite that came out last year. They were also accompanied by two gas masks, casually strewn across the corners of TV screens, but nothing compared to the truly haunted look of these semi-melted plastic husks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no surprise that Gearbox is far from done with the Borderlands franchise following the release of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands and with the forthcoming Borderlands movie in post-production. The company announced today a popular Borderlands spinoff is returning this year with the return of Tales from the Borderlands.
In a tweet this afternoon from the Borderlands official Twitter account, it was revealed that Tales from the Borderlands would be receiving a second season, and Gearbox only lists it and 2K Games as being attached to the project. The tweet reads, "There are more stories to explore in the Borderlands universe. An all-new Tales from the Borderlands adventure is coming in 2022 from @GearboxOfficail and @2K. Stay tuned for a full announcement this summer." The message came with a piece of art featuring three characters under the Borderlands logo with a big moon shining in the background.
There are more stories to explore in the #Borderlands universe. An all new Tales from the Borderlands adventure is coming in 2022 from @GearboxOfficial and @2K.

April 21, 2022
The previous developer for season one of Tales of the Borderlands, Telltale Games, isn't mentioned in the announcement, which makes sense as that company has taken more of a publishing role since it was shuttered and resurrected over the past few years. It's unknown whether this new edition of Tales from the Borderlands will continue on with characters from the first season or move on to other stories within the universe. 
Season one of Tales of the Borderlands is an adventure game following the exploits of former Hyperion employee Rhys and con artist Fiona in the rough yet humorous world of Pandora. You can read why former Game Informer editor Javy Gwaltney loves this game in this opinion piece describing how it's his favorite entry in the entire Borderlands series. We recently ranked the entire Borderlands series, and you can check out where Tales ranked on the list here.]]></summary>

The 12700K is my personal pick of the new Intel 12th-gen family, as it offers the same number of performance cores and therefore much the same performance as the flagship 12900K - all while producing far less heat and costing much less too. It normally retails for around $385, but today a $45 discount code on Newegg brings it to just $340.

With 20 years of history behind it, beloved characters (both original and Disney’s), and more reminders of the importance of friendship and heart than in any other series, it’s hard to ignore the impact Kingdom Hearts has made in the gaming community.

Eyes in the Dark: The Curious Case of One Victoria Bloom is a black and white twin-stick platformer that debuted today at PAX East and aims to stun players with its striking visual contrast and delight with its illuminating rogue-lite gameplay.


The studio is cleverly calling Eyes in the Dark a "roguelight" where, as Victoria Bloom, you'll explore the ever-changing and pitch-black Bloom Manor searching for her missing grandfather with just a flashlight and slingshot to start with on each run. The mansion has been overrun with darkness, making every step inside fraught with peril. With the paltry light source, Victoria will ha…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds, an MMORPG that launched in Asian territories last year, heads to the west this summer. The game is a multiplayer take on Level-5 and Studio Ghibli’s whimsical universe made by developer Netmarble, and you can pre-register for free on mobile devices beginning today. 


Cross Worlds boasts a new story and the signature Studio Ghibli animation style from the first two titles (the game is made in Unreal Engine 4). The narrative centers on the player character, who hails from a futuristic city, playing what they believe to be a virtual reality game called Soul Divers. However, they discover the fantasy world they’ve entered is very much real, and a mysterious girl named Rania tasks you with rebuilding her world’s kingdom to save both of your realities. 
Players suit up as one of five classes: Swordsman, Witch, Engineer, Rogue, and Destroyer. You’ll explore an expansive world filled with NPCs to befriend and monsters to slay, as well as collect Familiars that can be tamed to fight alongside you. The Kingdom can be built up and decorated using interactive objects along with maintaining your own personal farm. Multiplayer includes both PvE and PvP modes.  
Pre-registering on the App Store or Google Play gets you the Explorer’s Outfit. Joining the game’s Discord nets you the Catarumpus Hat and a special title. 
Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds is slated to release stateside on iOS and Android in early summer. It will also be playable on PC.]]></summary>

The revival sees the boxing marsupial on a journey to find his missing sister and discover the truth behind his father’s disappearance. A fresh trailer for the colorful action platformer sets the table for the story and gameplay.

It all centres around the creepy original Altered, Erishkigal, who exudes some serious Zuul vibes and is named after the Sumerian goddess of the underworld. I googled it. With Worldslayer, People Can Fly say they're delving more into the extraterrestrial shenanigans of Enoch’s backstory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge finally has a release window, and the hotly-anticipated throwback is set to arrive sometime this summer. 
A new extended gameplay trailer shows off the game’s first two levels with all four Turtles getting a spotlight. Publisher Dotemu also brings exciting news that the Turtles' original voice actors from the 1987 cartoon reprise their roles in Shredder’s Revenge. The action gets another big dose of nostalgia with Cam Clarke (Leonardo), Townsend Coleman (Michelangelo), Barry Gordon (Donatello), and Rob Paulsen (Raphael) spouting one-liners in the midst of battle as a result. 


Those attending PAX East this week have the opportunity to play Shedder’s Revenge for the first time at Dotemu’s expo hall booth (#12043, if you’re curious). The rest of us will have to wait to play the game on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Dotemu announced that Limited Run Games will produce physical copies of the digital-only title sometime after launch. Shredder's Revenge's soundtrack, composed by Tee Lopes, will get a digital release down the line as well.

The big highlight of this update is the new advanced class, the Glaivier. Lost Ark was taken offline for maintenance around 12 a.m. PT/3 a.m. ET and is expected to remain under maintenance for eight hours, meaning it should return online with the Glaivier and the big update in just a few hours.

Before that we have a big more egg chat to get out of the way, and a decent discussion on some of Henry Cavill's recent activities. Also I complain about how there are too many Marvel heroes now and they need to kill a load of them off. Plus, in exciting news Nate manages to do his first ever accurate impression, by accident.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive has revealed that the Shadowrun Trilogy is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch this summer. 
More specifically, the newly-remastered trilogy will hit these consoles on June 21. This will be the first time these cyberpunk-fantasy RPGs have ever been released on console, having been previously exclusive to PC. The trilogy includes three games, as the name suggests: the original PC game, Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun: Dragonfall – Director’s Cut, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong – Extended Edition, all fully remastered. 


“The Shadowrun Trilogy, a remastered release of the Shadowrun Returns RPGs originally released by Harebrained Schemes, has been updated for a console experience, with upscaled graphics, improved performance, and controller-optimized gameplay,” a press release reads. “All three titles in the series will launch simultaneously for the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5, and are available for preorder on all platforms as of today.” 
Shadowrun Returns was originally funded via Kickstarter in just 28 hours, and it was the first Kickstarter-funded game to launch after raising more than $1 million on the fundraising platform, according to the press release. Shadowrun Returns, and the rest of the trilogy, is based on the Shadowrun tabletop RPG created by Jordan Weisman, who also helped design Shadowrun Returns. 
Shadowrun Trilogy will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch on June 21 and it will cost $39.99.

Glaivier is the new advanced class and she’s proper into orchestral djent judging by the trailer. The Glaivier features two skill sets, Focus and Flurry, linked to one of the ridiculously huge pointy sticks she wields: spear for fast attacks in Focus and glaive for sweeping hits in Flurry. Smilegate say a successful Glaivier can maximise their effectiveness by building up energy with one skill set for a stat boost when swapping to the other. It looks like she can really tear things up with superfast twizzles and dazzly stabbiness.

Not in the sense that is has nothing left to give, but that it feels ready to give even more. It's a rip-roaring blast through a cyberscape that doubles as a skatepark for your chainsaw leg. And amidst the sick grinds and spilling of guts you're drip fed weapons and power-ups that only serve to keep the momentum ticking over. You won't concentrate on anything harder in your lifetime. That's a guarantee.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and his production company, Seven Bucks Productions, will produce the movie treatment of Hazelight Studios’ It Takes Two. 
This news comes by way of Variety, which reports that not only is Johnson producing the movie, but it is being developed by Amazon, seemingly set for an Amazon Prime Video release (or perhaps a theater premiere, which Amazon has done for some of its movies in the past). Johnson will produce the film on behalf of Seven Bucks Production, alongside Dany Garcia and Hiram Garcia, and dj2 Entertainment will help produce it as well. 


Variety reports that its sources say that Johnson could also star in the film, but that’s obviously not official yet. As expected, this film adaptation of 2021’s It Takes Two, which won Game Of The Year at The Game Awards 2021 in December, will follow main characters May and Cody who are turned into dolls by their daughter amidst divorce proceedings. May and Cody must work together to explore fantasized areas of their home to regain their bodies while confronting the issues of their relationship.
It’s one of the best games of 2021, and you can find out why in Game Informer’s It Takes Two review. The film could shape up to be just as good, based on the team behind it. Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 writers Pat Casey and Josh Miller are adapting the game for the silver screen, according to Variety, and they will also serve as executive producers alongside Hazelight Studios’ Josef Fares, who directed the game version of It Takes Two. 
For more, read Game Informer’s It Takes Two review and then check out our thoughts on Fares’ other games, like A Way Out and Brothers – A Tale Of Two Sons.

Loopmancer is an upcoming cyberpunk time-looping action roguelite by eBrain Studio poised to slash its way to your living room this year. The game looks promising, and I got to test my mettle against a demo to see how well it’s shaping up. 
The story centers on a detective named Xiang Zixu, who gets killed during a mission tracking an underground crime lord. However, he awakens back in his apartment earlier that morning. That’s right, our officer is trapped in a mysterious loop, but he retains memories of his past “lives.” Figuring out the cause of this loop will be one of the core plot points, and eBrain…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-04-21T12:02:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has delayed Spider-Man: Across The Universe, the highly anticipated sequel to 2018’s Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse, from Oct. 7 to June 2, 2023. 
This marks a nearly eight-month delay for the animated sequel that is set to star Shameik Moore and Hailey Steinfeld as Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy, respectively, as reported by Deadline. When Across The Spider-Verse was previously revealed, it was shown to be a Part I, with Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse Part II slated to release after it. More specifically, it’s dated for March 29, 2024. 
As for why this delay has happened, that remains unclear. Sony hasn’t stated why Across The Spider-Verse Part I has been delayed. However, considering we’re in a pandemic, it’s possible the delay is related to COVID-19, which has caused delays across the movie industry, games industry, and more. Or perhaps, more simply, the filmmaking team needs more time. 
Into The Spider-Verse made roughly $375 million worldwide at the box office and considering the franchise is even more popular now than it was upon release, there’s a good chance Across The Spider-Verse easily eclipses that. Only time will tell, though. 
Deadline’s report also states that Sony’s other animated movie, Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile has moved up from its Nov. 18 date to Oct. 7, taking Across The Spider-Verse’s original release date. Elsewhere in Sony’s somewhat disjointed Spider-Man-related universe, Madame Web, which will star Euphoria’s Sydney Sweeney and Fifty Shades Of Grey’s Dakota Johnson, has received a July 7, 2023 release date. 
While waiting for Across The Spider-Verse, read Game Informer’s Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales review to find out why it’s a great Spider-Man game, and then check out the reveal of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 after that. If you need even more comic book games in your life, watch this reveal of Insomniac’s Wolverine game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony paved the way for better PS5 DualSense controller support on PC yesterday, by releasing a dedicated Windows app that handles installation of the gamepad’s firmware updates. Previously, the only way to update the wireless controller was the plug it into an actual PS5 – not a problem if you’ve managed to find one in stock, of course, but bad news if you bought the pad standalone to play on your PC.


Per Sony’s announcement tweet, you can download the app directly from the PlayStation site. 64-bit Windows 10 and Windows 11 are both supported, and using it is pretty easy: just connect the controller via its USB cable and click through a full steps. The single catch is you can only update one controller at a time.

It's been reduced to $290 when you use code 4FSBR2Z26 at the checkout, compared to a launch price of $450. Not bad for a CPU that launched less than two years ago - and a damn sight cheaper than upgrading to a 12th-gen system that requires a new CPU, motherboard and potentially expensive new DDR5 RAM as well.

Marvel's Avengers launched with six playable characters, but that's far from all the heroes we'll be able to take control of when it's all said and done.

In a succinct video message, Digimon Survive producer Kazumasa Habu confirmed the July date, which appears to be the worldwide release given that pre-orders are now live on retail sites. Check out his message below. 


The release confirmation ends a long wait for Digimon fans; Survive was first announced in 2018 with a 2019 release window. The turn-based strategy game stars a group of teens who find their way to the Digital World, and their respective Digimon partners, during a school camping trip. Goggles-wearing protagonist Takuma Momozuka and his buddy Agumon lead this gang to rescue the world from an unknown threat. You can watch the recent English teaser trailer here. 
Digimon Survive will be available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

nDreams, the developers behind VR experiences like Phantom: Covert Ops, Fracked, and Far Cry VR: Dive Into Insanity is partnering with Sony Pictures Virtual Reality to make Ghostbusters VR (working title) virtually a reality. This new Ghostbusting experience will let you team up with up to three friends in VR to track down the paranormal and blast them with your Proton Packs to trap them and take them back to your HQ. Players will run that headquarters in San Francisco, a city never explored in the Ghostbusters franchise. nDreams is promising an "expansive and engrossing" campaign that can be played alone or in co-op.


The trailer released today, while an in-engine cinematic, is not actual gameplay, but there are some hints as to what the game may look like when it's released, including fun character customizations like the cute animal hat worn by one of the 'Busters. 
There's no date on when the now-called Ghostbusters VR will hit Meta Quest 2, but a press release claims more information will become available in the coming months. But GBVR isn't the only Ghostbusters game in the works, as Illfonic's Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, an asymmetrical multiplayer title is coming later this year.]]></summary>

The streaming giant lost over 200,000 subscribers during the first quarter of the year and expects to lose two million more in the next quarter. While this drop isn't blamed on piracy, illegal downloading and streaming pose a serious concern in the competitive streaming business.

Following a 2019 reveal that had fans thinking Overwatch 2 was within reach, the development team at Blizzard went dark following a series of delays and departures of key team members (including Overwatch director Jeff Kaplan). As the development timeline stretched on, the once-abundant and enthusiastic player base showed signs of dwindling and discouragement as live-service support for the first Overwatch dried up.
However, last month, Blizzard emerged from its largely incommunicado state to reveal that Overwatch 2's PvP and PvE content has been decoupled and that it's holding a PvP beta…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've enjoyed building a house of card in Stacklands, and farms of cards, and lumberyards of cards, and... it's a new manage-o-strategy game where every building, resource, and unit is a card on a table. It's a cute conceit and fun, especially because it treats the virtual tabletop as a physical space. Your own farm animal cards will unhelpfully jostle your setup as they roam, for example, and invading monster cards will chase your villager cards across the tabletop. It's all very pleasant, a little adventure to figure out how it all works then reach the end.

This got me thinking about pirate games again, as I do every 12-18 months or so. Everyone likes the pirate concept, and there is, I think, a collective urge to make piratey games. There are a bunch of them, after all. But there hasn't yet been one that I think provides exactly what I want from a pirate game.

Lenovo make some of the best gaming laptops in the business, where their clean design, solid build quality and reliability have set them apart from other brands that tend to be a little plasticky at the sub-£1000 price points where most laptops are sold.

Still, while these may be old favourites that you’ve already sunk hours into on a desktop, you might still be wondering how these games play when transplanted to the smaller screen and gamepad-ish controls of a handheld. 


Liam was wondering it, anyway. Thus, he picked ten difference game genres from the most-played on Steam, asked me to play at least one game that would broadly represent each, and report back on which are the most (and least) suited to life on the Steam Deck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On paper, Panic's Playdate doesn't have a lot to do with PC. It's a standalone handheld console that fits into the palm of your hand (yes, even palms as small as mine), and is controlled via a d-pad, two face buttons and its unique, standout feature, the crank. But inside this dinky yellow wafer, the spirit of PC gaming has never been stronger. It's there in its eclectic first season of indie games, a series of 24 titles that not only delight in the minutiae of its hardware but are delivered weekly for free in batches of two direct to your console over Wi-Fi. It's there in the openness of the Playdate ecosystem, too, where you can make your own Playdate games in its browser-based Pulp creation tool, download the source code, share it with friends (or sell it) and sideload it onto your Playdate all in a matter of minutes. Heck, Panic have even added the ability to stream from it, capture video and screenshots from it, and hook it up to an external monitor, keyboard or controller via its Playdate Mirror app.
It's a surprisingly versatile bit of kit, the Playdate, and one I feel will enchant and enthral anyone who has a deep and inherent love of all things games. Sure, there's every possibility it may end up as another Ouya-style disaster show, but if you've ever longed for something like Lexaloffle's Pico-8 platform to be more than just a 'fantasy console', then the Playdate is exactly what you've been waiting for.

Instead, Waffle presents you with a grid of five intersecting words with all of the letters already present. Most of the letters are jumbled up, and it's up to you to identify the correct words and spell them out by swapping the letters with each other using as few moves as possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's strange now to think that, until May 2020, there were no Dread X games. Indie publishers DreadXP have become so synonymous with tightly curated, intriguing horror experiences that it's hard to believe the original demo anthology that kickstarted that reputation is only approaching its second anniversary.
Regular RPS readers may already be aware that (a) I'm a huge horror nerd, and (b) I think the games published under the DreadXP banner are something pretty special. I was equal parts grossed out and charmed by the Lovecraftian dating sim Sucker For Love: First Date when I reviewed it back in January, and was pleasantly surprised by my time with the My Friendly Neighborhood demo at the recent Steam Next Fest. So when I was offered the opportunity to interview Ted Hentschke, Head of Productions at DreadXP, as part of a digital event at last month's GDC, you can hardly blame me for jumping at the chance.

I'm here driving the RPS bus alone, nobody to stop me as I careen down the motorway screaming and trying to slam on the brakes. But I can't, because a golf ball has rolled under the pedal!
You ride this bus long enough, you see games move in cycles similar to fashion designers, or those big ferris wheels at fairgrounds. Things come round, they peak, they go round again. Often a few different people independently notice an empty niche and start working on something to fill it, so you get a bunch of games with similar themes or styles coming out within months of each other. So I ask: why and/or how have a bunch of people identified golf as a gap in the market?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The downwards march in graphics card prices continues - oh, how I've longed to write those words! After posting a deal that had the Nvidia Founders Edition RTX 3080 Ti at its UK RRP of £1049 last week, third-party cards are now reaching the same levels. Right now, you can pick up a beefy KFA2 OC card for the same price, after a £50 discount at Overclockers. 
If you'd prefer the better value RTX 3080, then there's also been movement - after appearing for £860 seven days ago, the cheapest card is now this Zotac Trinity OC model for £810. That's still a hefty chunk of change for a graphics card - and above the original RRP of £650 - but it's a damned sight better than the £1000+ these GPUs have retailed at for months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early on in my playthrough of CD Projekt Red’s 7/10 NFT screensaver Cyberpunk 2077, I realised you could climb washing lines.
I’m a real sucker for verticality, so normally I’d be immediately trying to see how high I could get, but after tentatively scaling a few floors I decided to give the urgent main quest the benefit of the doubt. There would probably just be a disappointing invisible wall anyway. I climbed back down and did my best to engage with the expensive cutscenes filled with proper actors. 50 hours of mediocre Strange Days references later, I had most of the game under my belt and was ready to go searching for something more substantial - to try to find some actual cyberpunk in this retrowave moodboard. I set about pushing Cyberpunk 2077 to the vertical limit.

We also discuss real life eggs i.e. what are the best egg formats? Nate and I are both sad because we consider boiled eggs to be inherently funny but neither of us like eating them.
We also learn that Nate has dismantled his aquarium room (for a good reason) and that Matthew witness a car exploding the other night. Blimey! Plus, stick around for a Cavern Of Egg.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of the four hulking Grey Knights under my command, teleporty sword boy was undoubtedly my favourite. Once every turn he could blink across the map, moving twice as far as he can with a regular action point, plopping him right behind a pesky Cultist’s cone of suppressing fire. It was both effective and efficient, but the real fireworks began whenever I clicked teleport strike, which repositioned him while also savaging several enemies in sequence with his power sword. He was simultaneously my initiator and my (almost) one-man clean up crew, ready to be rallied by a cry from my Justicar whenever his AP tank ran empty. I almost felt sorry for the cultists. 
I’ve played a curated, two hour slice of Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters, and I’m keen to play more. As speedy as my sword boy felt in those moments, though, at other times I felt compelled to move forward at a crawl. When I asked creative director Noah Decter-Jackson whether I was just being too cowardly, he hedged his bets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FixFox came out a couple of weeks back, and I am in the process of reviewing it. This process is, currently, one in suspended animation, and has been for longer than I anticipated. I moved just before the release and my PC is still somewhere in or about the Irish Sea. Luckily I can link this to FixFox thematically, as a big exciting incident for the story involves waking up a man who was stuck in a cryopod. Around that, you, a fox called Vix, fix things in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi future where your tools are bananas and stamps.
I was several hours into FixFox before I left it, and discovered it was much larger than I expected. It's paradoxically cosy and friendly even as its world is vast and strange. I had some minor annoyances with this - you do a lot of travelling around, and in the early stages of the game there aren't many fast travel options to mitigate this. But now I've been without it for two weeks, I've found myself missing the big spaces and warm welcomes of that world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AMD Ryzen 9 5900X is the company's best gaming CPU*, and today it's going cheap at CCL in the UK. They're asking £345 for the 12-core, 24-thread processor when you use code SAVE20 at the checkout, and tossing in three months of Game Pass Ultimate and free next-day shipping to boot. That's £20 cheaper than the current Amazon price, and a massive drop from the £430+ going rate at the beginning of the year.
*OK, the Ryzen 9 5950X is technically faster, but it costs way more and the difference in gaming performance is miniscule. The Ryzen 7 5800X3D also looks promising, but hasn't yet been released and will likely cost more than this 5900X while packing fewer cores.
