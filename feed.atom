The GameCube might not have had much success in terms of sales, but it was actually home to quite a lot of amazing first-party titles. To this day, many of them are still essentially locked off on the same Nintendo platform. This includes games like Eternal Darkness, F-Zero GX, and even third-party hits such as Sega's Phantasy Star Online.
If you have lost hope of the GameCube library returning to a Nintendo platform any time soon, there's no need to worry - as there are other ways to relive the glory days of the stylish purple system. Video game developer and YouTuber Modern Vintage Gamer has recently taken a look at the "massive update" for Dolphin (Version 1.1.2) on the Xbox Series X|S - including the new front end while showing off series like Metroid Prime.

Josef Fares award-winning cooperative title It Takes Two has hit a sales milestone recently - with developer Hazelight Studios announcing it has now sold over 10 million copies around the world.
According to an official tweet from the company, that's "potentially twice as many players" as it ever dreamed of playing the title. The Switch version arrived on the scene last November, so it presumably helped bolster sales numbers.

Remember a story we ran about some parents in the US who were trying to get their kids to sue Nintendo over "Joy-Con drift" in a class action lawsuit? Well, it seems the video game giant has come out on top.
In November last year, a federal judge ruled in favour of Nintendo in the 'Sanchez et. al. v. Nintendo of America' case. Nintendo was able to prevent the case from going any further thanks to the Switch's EULA (End User License Agreement) "which disallows lawsuits" and requires parties involved to enter a legal arbitration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Download it now.
Square Enix released another update for its Switch-exclusive Chocobo GP. This is the first update of 2023, bumping the title up to Version 1.4.1. This patch contains multiple fixes, here's the full rundown courtesy of the Square Enix support page:
Chocobo GP - Version 1.4.1 (1st Feb, 2023)

Thank you for playing “Chocobo GP”. The Ver.1.4.1 update for Chocobo GP is due for release on 2/1/2023.
*Please be aware that if the player is playing a game mode that involves online communications at the time the update is released, the system will quit out of that mode after the current race finishes and return to the title screen.
The content of this update is detailed below.
1. Fixes to an issue with multiplayer where settings would change from "mirror" mode to "master" mode if a lobby was created with mirror mode set and then play continued for a time without disbanding that lobby
2. Fixes to an issue on the Midgar short and technical courses, where racers would sometimes be judged to have gone off the course incorrectly.
3. Fixes to an issue when using Cactuar's 1000 Needles ability in Time Attack mode where the ability is immediately forced to end if Cactuar touches a ghost while hit detection for the attack is active.
4. Fixes to an issue on the sticker select screen where the cursor moves to locations that should not be selectable if it is made to skip from a specific location.
5. Fixes to an issue on the LITE edition where options that cannot be selected are displayed as options that can be selected if transitioning between screens in a specific way.
6. Fixes to an issue where the correct colour is not shown when selecting the "Premium Gold" colour for the Kwackeys' speed type vehicle.
An internet connection is required to apply these updates.
We hope you continue to enjoy “Chocobo GP”.

Remember that big old GeForce NOW leak from 2021? The one that supposedly revealed a list of in-development projects at various AAA studios? I've been thinking about that leak for just over a year now. More specifically, I've been thinking about one title on that list: a remake of Final Fantasy IX.
Recently, another, much less reputable rumor surfaced on 4chan (the thread has since been deleted, but its contents are cataloged on Reddit), suggesting that the Final Fantasy IX remake's announcement is imminent. I'm not sure whether or not I believe that rumor, but it got me pondering the prospect of this FFIX remake again. Do we need a remake of Final Fantasy IX at this point?

A pretty special shmup release has joined the ranks of Hamster's Arcade Archives this week, as Namco's mythological and controversial blaster Phelios is now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to the Japanese arcade market in 1989, before later being ported to the Sega Mega Drive, Phelios is a vertically-scrolling shmup that is (very loosely) patterned after Greek mythology. Players don the mighty armor of the sun god Apollo, who mounts his mighty steed Pegasus and embarks upon a mission to rescue his wife, Artemis, who has been abducted by the serpentine god, Typhon. Players guide Apollo through seven famously challenging stages, taking on notable boss characters such as Medusa, Antaeus, Cerberus, and The Sirens. Dusa would never.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fire of love.
For better or for worse, Fire Emblem today is a different beast to what it was a decade ago. Fire Emblem Engage brought back the weapons triangle, a combat-first focus, and the wonderful Engage mechanic, but at what cost? The social aspect (one of the biggest selling points in previous games) takes a tumble in the most recent entry. The central hub (The Somniel) is much smaller, character interactions are lessened and, most importantly of all, there is no marriage.
Ten years ago, Fire Emblem: Awakening came to the 3DS (in the US, at least) and opened our eyes to the prospect of in-game marriage. Evolved from the 'Love System' which debuted in the Fire Emblem: Geneology of the Holy War on Super Famicom, no longer was the game's romance something that you had to read into, oh no; this time around it was front and centre and came with a number of genuinely beneficial perks based on who you decided to partner up with.

In 1998, The Simpsons made a throwaway gag about Bart refusing to perform yard work at home for his mother, then demanding she let him join the queue for the yard work simulator at a local fairground. It’s funny because who would develop a virtual experience of a chore? Moreover, who would want to actually play it?
So anyway, PowerWash Simulator is a game where you use a pressure washer to clean various items and locations. You have a variety of nozzles, cleaning products, and attachments with which you can streamline the process. It’s wonderful and to be perfectly honest has absolutely no right to be as much fun as it is, whether you're going solo or joining friends online for a co-op squirt session.

I can't imagine this working out at all, but I'm always willing to try trendy new ideas.
Of course, even when I'm off work, you can still find me right here this fine Saturday, joining you all for another round of well-wishes, work exorcism, and the welcoming of what I hope will be a brighter month for you, me, all of us.

This week at Nintendo Life, we had a chance to get hands on with Theatrhythm Final Bar Line, and we also looked ahead to The Super Mario Bros. Movie after the recent trailer had us wondering which other suits we'd like to see pop up. It was also, unbelievably, the 15th anniversary of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and a group of us got together to discuss the oft-overlooked game mode 'The Subspace Emissary'.

Square Enix has had a solid run on the Nintendo Switch over the past year with releases such as Live A Live, NieR:Automata, Tactics Ogre: Reborn and more recently Crisis Core, but it seems it's not been enough. The Japanese publisher and developer has reported a drop in net sales in its latest financial results period (up to 31st December 2022).
Despite net sales falling to 255 billion yen (down by nearly 7% YoY), it's still got some big plans moving forward - teasing "multiple new titles" including games featuring brand-new IP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, we saw a new teaser trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The teaser gave us a glimpse of Cat Mario's appearance in the film, as well as Donkey Kong's reaction. Today, Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo released the official movie poster for the Super Mario Bros. Movie.
In this new poster, we get a cinematic glimpse of the cast of main characters that we know of so far, including Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Bowser, Donkey Kong, and Kamek. Additionally, we see the opposing worlds in the apparent conflict of the film, with the darkness of Bowser's Castle contrasted by the bright and joyful Mushroom Kingdom. While nobody quite matches Donkey Kong and Toad's wide-eyed and unbridled bliss, every character on the poster is at least sporting a smirk.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie features an all-star cast, including Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, Jack Black as Bowser, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, and Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong. We also know that Mario's video game voice actor, Charles Martinet, will have a cameo in the film at some point.
To this point, the movie has only received character-focused posters on top of a teaser poster that preceded the initial movie trailer. If you missed out on those posters, you can see every other character and teaser poster released for The Super Mario Bros. Movie below.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrives in theaters on April 7. For more, check out our reaction to the last full trailer during a recent episode of All Things Nintendo.]]></summary>

Online game closures are nothing new to the industry. New multiplayer and purely online games come and go with the seasons. But we're a month into 2023, and have seen a heavy smattering of live-service games announcing their imminent closure.
Live-service, or "games-as-a-service" games, constantly update. They find life in the churn, and for some, it's an extremely lucrative prospect. Look no further than Fortnite, Call of Duty Warzone, or Genshin Impact for examples. Heck, even MMOs — which existed a bit prior to the prominence of live-service titles — could fall under this umbrella. Games like Destiny 2 and Final Fantasy XIV are, and have been, going strong.
Still, this past week, we've seen a number of newer games announce their imminent closure. Fell…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thankfully not delayed for a long, long time
While The Last of Us has been making waves on HBO, PC players will have to wait a while to play the latest adaptation of the story. Naughty Dog is pushing the release date of The Last of Us Part I on PC back, from March 3 to March 28.
It's only a few weeks, but the extra time will give the Naughty Dog crew a little extra time to work on the port. The developer says it's noticed that players have been jumping back onto the story with the PS5 version of The Last of Us, and it wants to make sure the PC version puts a good foot forward.
"And so we want to make sure that The Last of Us Part I PC debut is in the best shape possible. These additional few weeks will allow us to ensure this version of The Last of Us lives up to your, and our, standards. We are so excited to bring The Last of Us Part I to a new platform, reaching new and returning players with Joel and Ellie's unforgettable story of survival, and we hope that you'll continue to look forward to its PC release on March 28."

It's not a long delay, but it does push the PC version a bit out from the finale of the HBO series. Episode 9, the last one for this season, airs on March 12. Now, rather than arriving just ahead of the finale, it'll debut a few weeks after.
https://twitter.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1621539243402174470/
We are the last of us
Though Last of Us fans on PC might be waiting a little longer, it at least give them a bit of time to decompress from the HBO finale. Given how emotional the series has been thus far, folks might need a minute to recuperate.
The Last of Us Part I now hits PC on March 28, 2023.

The God of Random Numbers is real, and he's in your house right now, sniffing all your dice. If you don't pray to him, you'll never see a natural 20 again, and all of your card decks will be stacked against you for the rest of time.
Or... RNG is exactly what it sounds like. Random. Mashing B, or A, or whatever button you fancy when the Poké Ball is tick-tocking to one side and another isn't going to influence the outcome in any way. It's a placebo, a meaningless ritual that keeps you busy while waiting for the game to arbitrarily decide the result.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay, brain. Don’t accidentally write “First Blood.”
Vampires are pretty hot, but relationship options with them are limited. You know, because they’re fictional, which always gets in the way of good romance. However, First Bite is a visual novel that knows what we want: dates with vampires. This February 14th, we’re getting even more of that in First Bite: Bad Blood because if there’s one thing better than vampire dating, it’s more vampire dating. But there’s more than just one thing that’s better. Consider werewolf dating. Also, consider minotaur dating.
First Bite: Bad Blood picks up where the base game left off, serving as a sequel that again follows Noe, a freshly-chomped vampire who is adjusting to being a cold-blooded dead person. But I’m going to have to quote the developer directly on this one, because I’m not sure I can really put it better myself: “things aren’t quite as simple as you hoped when you’re being eased into vampire life by a murder-himbo obsessed with Eurodance, a narcissist with an online shopping addiction, and a wild card with a penchant for BDSM.” Sounds magma-hot.
[caption id="attachment_361381" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via First Bite Games[/caption]
This time around, just to make things spicier, you’re going up against the most arousing force in the universe: bureaucracy. A missed email is all it takes to put your destiny in question, as the vampire council is a bit miffed about being snubbed. Wow, I can hardly contain the lust boiling atop that overwhelmingly erotic plot summary.
Sarcasm aside, First Bite is an LGBTQ+ friendly visual novel with a dark comedy approach. I’ve been going through a bit of a dry spell when it comes to my digital romances, so I might just have to sink my teeth into this one.
First Bite is available right now on Steam and itch.io, its DLC, First Bite: Bad Blood will hit Steam on February 14, 2023, and can be pre-purchased on itch.io for $4.99.

Being someone who never really stopped playing games after they reached their expiry date, I spend a lot of time thinking about the flow and evolution of game design. Why, after some successful genres reach a certain age, did the industry just collectively seem to move on? As with any art form, trends constantly emerge in the medium of video games. As is also common, we eventually circle back to the ones we fondly remember, and video games seem to be the most literal when it comes to that. It wasn’t enough for the side-scroller to reach a resurgence; the pixel-prominent visuals had to come with it.
Yet, we also live in an age where we are protective of our art. The internet has ensured that you can obscure, but you can’t destroy. If I’m ever in the mood for Roller Coaster Tyc…]]></summary>

In Splatter Royale, up to 40 players step into the viscera-soaked world of The Evil Dead, donning the gross, splatteriffic visage of any of the roster's demons, or, alternately, a Deadtite-turned variant of Evil Dead's many heroes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Running out of GAAS
If you’re keeping score on games going offline, you can add another tally mark. Smilegate Entertainment has announced that military shooter CrossfireX will be shutting down on May 18, 2023. This adds to a growing list of games-as-a-service titles that are being given the axe.
What makes CrossfireX a bit unique in this regard, however, is that it has a single-player component developed by Remedy Entertainment. And despite that this is something that should not require an internet connection, once the servers go quiet, the campaign will be inaccessible, according to an FAQ from the developers. Note that the single-player wasn’t free, but apparently, the price paid wasn’t enough to ensure any effort would be made to divest it from the servers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7yGkRV8Bl8
Whenever a game is announced as “always online,” there tends to be a bit of nose-gazing where it’s suggested that it’s perfectly okay in the modern age of fridges connected to the internet. Well, where’s your God now? Maybe CrossfireX wasn’t the most whiz-bang revolutionary game, but this sort of thing could happen to any game that requires an internet connection for whatever reason. This includes some internet-dependent DRM solutions like Denuvo.
To add more poop to the pot, while CrossfireX is free-to-play in regards to multiplayer, it was supported by in-app purchases. Smilegate will refund all of these purchases… so long as they were made fourteen days prior to this announcement. I guess there needs to be a cutoff date, since even ephemeral experiences have a price tag, but considering this announcement comes less than a year after the CrossfireX’s release, it might be hard to swallow for some.
So, that’s your four-minute warning. Crossfire X is currently available on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, but it won’t be after May 18.

It's the end of another week, and that means Epic Games Store is ready to reveal the next game it will be offering up to all of its users free of charge — And its a matter of fires, fights, and fricassees, with the arrival of kitchen and restaurant management sim Recipe for Disaster, available from February 9.
Developed by the fantastically monikered Spanish outfit Dapper Penguin, and launched on PC in the summer of 2022, Recipe for Disaster tasks players with the smooth operation of a professional kitchen and its attached dining room, ensuring the quick, efficient, and accurate work of its chefs and waiting staff, delivering high-quality meals to customers while keeping everybody happy and safe — the former being something of an impossibility in the catering industry.
Yes, Chef.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tokpkrCYvus&ab_channel=KasedoGames
Recipe for Disaster offers up customization and management goals on a huge variety of kitchen elements, from ensuring stock of quality ingredients, to purchasing top-tier equipment, and managing the distinct personalities of your staff to encourage team synergy and discourage inter-culinary brawling. You can also design the restaurant itself, and even conjure up your own recipes to really put your eatery on the map. Dapper Penguin's release was well-received by critics on release, and is well worth a look for management sim fans or anyone who believes they're cut out for the non-stop, high-pressure world of foods and feuds.
Recipe For Disaster will be available to download, free of charge, from Epic Games Store from February 9-16. Until then, users still have the opportunity to bag themselves this week's freebies, Dishonored: Death of the Outsider and City of Gangsters.

Ratalaika Games has revealed a rather quirky little platformer that's springing its way onto Switch next week. Go! Go! PogoGirl, developed by Ohsat Games (which consists of just one person, Andrej Preradovic!), follows a pogo champion whose prize pogo stick is stolen, and she must use another in order to track it down. The game launches on the eShop on 10th February, and it's giving us some serious Sega nostalgia.
Looking like it sits between the Master System and the Mega Drive, Go! Go! PogoGirl levels are themed around the four seasons and are all designed around PogoGirl's pogo-jumping skills. Each season will have five levels each for a total of 20 levels. And, well, if you take a good look at the levels, you might spot some similarities with a certain blue hedgehog's Green Hill Zone... those flowers look awfully familiar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The studio is moving on to the next big thing
Turtle Rock Studios is looking ahead towards its next project. And because of that, it'll be leaving Back 4 Blood as it is, right now.
In a short update, Turtle Rock Studios confirms it's not working on any more Back 4 Blood content. Mostly, it's because the studio is working on its next game.
"Turtle Rock Studios is actually pretty small for a studio making AAA games. We don’t have quite enough folks to continue working on Back 4 Blood content while we spin up another game – yes, another game! Given this, it’s time for us to put our heads down, get back in the lab, and get to work on the next big thing."

This doesn't mean the game is shutting down, though. Back 4 Blood will stay online, and available on both Xbox Game Pass and the PlayStation Plus extra tiers. The developers also say they will continue hanging around in places the community congregates, like the subreddit and Discord, to keep interacting. The team may be "quieter in the short term," but promises to be back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piY-dwt4eCw
Don't look Back in anger
Back 4 Blood hit back in October 2021, as a continuation of Turtle Rock's legacy of co-op zombie FPS development. As the name suggests, it follows in the footsteps of Turtle Rock's work on Left 4 Dead. And though it didn't mark the same historic highs, I did enjoy my time with the new deckbuilding ideas and characters that Turtle Rock created for Back 4 Blood.
The Turtle Rock crew rolled out a pretty decent amount of expansions for Back 4 Blood, and now it gets to move on to something new. At the very least, it's a neat and clean conclusion, and it's staying online. Considering how many online game closures we've seen in the last week alone, that's a good win for the Cleaners who want to keep running these levels.

This Duke wasn't the purple-shirted acrobat I'd known from Apogee Software's pair of platformers earlier that decade. He was brash, crude, and and didn't side-scroll anymore. It wasn't for me, so I moved on to other games. I still occasionally loaded up those earlier platformers though, wistfully remembering a time when Duke presumably used actual toilets when he needed to answer a call of nature.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Soldier Boyz
GLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)
GLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)
Obsidian
Pink Panther: Passport to Peril
Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink
Driller/Space Station Oblivion
Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
As usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!
Speaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!

In Tainted Grail, diplomacy is treated equal to combat. You’re given a unique deck of cards to resolve these encounters, and the intended solution involved using empathy-based cards to calm the child and find a caretaker for them. However, we decided on a different strategy.

Game Swing's OddBallers, a raucous top-down dodgeball party game, has been doing the rounds for quite some time now, having languished in various unreleased forms since it was first announced as "coming soon" a fair old while ago. Now it's suddenly dropped onto Nintendo Switch and, far from the mess we had thought it might turn out to be, it's actually a really fun little slice of multiplayer mayhem. However, it's not without its issues.
Oddballers sees players jump into colourful top-down arenas in order to hurl dodgeballs, chickens, bombs, and lots of other goofy items at one another in order to emerge victorious. The action is then made even more chaotic by a multitude of environmental dangers; lawnmowers, acid bombs, electrical charges, and so on, that keep you on your toes as you charge around looking to wipe out your friends and/or a bunch of the game's relatively capable bots.

Capcom renovated Resident Evil 2 from the ground up into a modernized third-person action game. Led by directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who now sit at the helm of Resident Evil 4, the game revitalized the 1998 classic, introducded it to a new generation of fans, and paved the way for the RE3 and 4 remakes to come after. Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I revisit my personal Game of the Year for 2019 to see how it holds up while discussing my Resident Evil 4 cover story.

Nintendo is still proceeding as planned with its updated storefront, which includes an incorporation of the My Nintendo program amid their pre-order system, and other merch. While communication on all of this is generally spotty; the UK and Ireland side has, at the very least, opened up a Twitter account to give folks some general updates.
It went live just hours ago, and asks users to "follow the channel to stay up to date about all things My Nintendo Store." The first order of business is setting things straight with Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon SteelBook situation, which is now a pre-order bonus for the March 17 release (in that region). All current pre-orders will be upgraded automatically.
For context, pre-order bonuses for Nintendo games are often messy, resulting in lengthy queues, system issues, or very brief sale periods. Things really came to a head with the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 situation, where that mess spilled over to multiple regions. Hopefully this Twitter account can at least ease some of the communication problems Nintendo has been having with high-ticket pre-orders.
If you're in the UK or Ireland and actually care about this stuff, consider giving it a follow!

But since then, Navorro has been releasing surreal 2D horror games on an almost annual basis. Navarro’s series Midnight Scenes has been the highlight, having disturbing premises and Twilight Zone creepiness. The newest episode, Midnight Scenes: From The Woods is due on February 9th and it looks as chilling as ever.

I haven't really been having much trouble with Dead Space on PS5 (outside of a few times I had to reload checkpoints); but folks have reported issues with stuttering on several platforms, as well as out-there problems like Twitch streaming bugs or various PC graphical anomalies. While the development team is tracking all known issues here, the recent 1.03 patch addresses some problems on PC and PS5 (with Xbox arriving later this week).
EA has been fairly vague with what patch 1.03 fixes exactly, but suffice to say many players have been responding positively to it. This is especially the case on PC, where the option to disable VRS alone has helped the stability of that platform tremendously. Update 1.04 also addresses similar issues.
Full Dead Space 1.03 patch notes
Disabling VRS is now possible on PC
Addressed PS5 stuttering
Addressed the black screen bug
General stability and performance fixes
Full Dead Space 1.04 patch notes (Source: Update Crazy)
Added performance improvements.
Addressed UI issues.
Addressed various stuttering and lag issues.
Added general stability fixes.
Other minor fixes.
A Dead Space Reddit community member has also provided a workaround for PC stuttering issues, if you're still having them:
Making sure power profile is set to AMD Performance Mode (it stutters on AMD Balanced)
Disabling Exploit Protection in Windows for "Dead Space.exe" (need to add exception)This is very common resolution of stuttering in DX12 games, Horizon Zero Dawn had the same problem.
Disable GPU scheduling (I've checked that during game GPU load is ~90% while CPU is ~60%, so I guess it's fine to do scheduling on CPU)
Disabling Adobe Creative Cloud

Historically, I have fallen hard for two kinds of VN: emotionally probing character dramas like Eliza and Watch Me Jump, or gentle and slightly silly comedies like Laura Silver and Camp W. The jokey dating-sim-but-everyone's-a-talking-table type vein never quite grabbed me. Unless Monster Prom counts? Hmm.

Raptor Boyfriend is more the lighthearted comedy kind, but with through lines on social anxiety and navigating confusing coming-of-age relationships. It is also not actually about having a raptor boyfriend.

Naughty Dog wants more time to polish up the PC port, as stated in a message posted to Twitter that you can read in full below (click the image to enlarge). 
The Last of Us Part I launched for PlayStation 5 last fall and serves as a ground-up remake of the 2013 title. It features improved graphics, reworked controls, improved enemy A.I., and a remade version of the Left Behind DLC chapter. The remake helped usher in the premiere of The Last of Us HBO series last month, which has been heavily watched and received heaps of praise thus far. The show’s second season has already been confirmed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don your best curb-stomping boots
A new report suggests that Xbox subsidiary The Coalition may have canned the production of two unannounced titles in order to begin work on the sixth mainline entry into the dystopian shooter series, Gears of War.
Speaking on the Game Mess Mornings show, Giant Bomb writer and frequent spoiler Jeff Grubb suggests that the studio had been working on multiple projects, including the aforementioned two new titles, additional support for Halo Infinite, while also helping Epic Games with its Unreal 5 tech demo The Matrix Awakens. Grubb suggests that the team may have been pulled from all of the above projects to start working on Gears 6 — a continuation of the popular and hugely successful Xbox series.
https://twitter.com/IdleSloth84_/status/1621186685873651712?s=20&t=8HHmV4uZcmpzHgcaWvhOBw
"This was all reflected in the layoffs that happened at Microsoft, which did hit The Coalition a little bit. The studio is now going to move on fully to Gears 6. I say now, it has likely moved on to Gears 6 in full over the course of the last year, but definitely, that will be their next game."
The most recent mainline entry in the Gears series, Gears 5, launched on PC and Xbox One in 2019, and follows the story of former rebel outlier Kait Diaz, as she attempts to stem the flow of the Horde hivemind and uncover the roots of her own connection to the subterranean species. The sequel was praised for its impactful and visceral action, as well as offering another intriguing and dramatic chapter to the ongoing Gears of War narrative.
While there has been no official word from The Coalition, it is common belief that the studio was expected to continue the Gears franchise at some point on Gen-9 hardware. Even if Grubb's sources are correct, it is unlikely that we'll be seeing Gears 6 rev its chainsaw bayonet anytime in the immediate future.

I’m 21 and my knees click, which means I must be turning into stone faster than someone having a staring contest with Medusa. So, I vowed to exercise a few times a week. Then, during my first week back at work, vid bud Liam told me to try Age Of Empires II. Never before has a New Year’s Resolution been abandoned so fast. I really wanted to stick with it. Promise.
But! After my first match, the following 30 hours vanished quicker than the Galaxy Caramels in a box of Celebrations. I became obsessed. I mastered AOE II's low AI difficulties and quickly used the Advanced Techniques tutorial to learn build orders. Before I knew it, I had a Google Doc filled with step-by-step plans for various playstyles, the perfect strategies for any scenario. But that Google Doc ended up ruining everything for me. If that recent Xbox release with the good gamepad controls has you tempted to revisit Age Of Empires II on PC, do not make a Google Doc. You’ve been warned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To the moon, Alice
Happy Shabby Games has announced that their quirky, Love-de-Lic-inspired adventure game, 24 Killers, is set to drop on March 9th.
While the name might seem rather aggressive, 24 Killers is a lot more wholesome than it sounds, having you befriend and help the island’s inhabitants. By doing so, you gain strength and extra powers that all you to help more of the island’s inhabitants. You play as Home, an “echo” possessing the corpse of a dead soldier. You’re given orders by an alien named Moon, who promises to help you reverse a curse that’s eating away at you. Or something. If none of that makes sense to you or you’re a visual learner, Happy Shabby Games has provided a trailer.
[embed]https://youtu.be/L0FruNm42Wk[/embed]
It doesn’t take more than a cursory glance to see that 24 Killers takes a lot of inspiration from the games of Love-de-Lic and its offshoots.  Particularly, the 2D-from-3D art style reminds a lot of Moon: Remix RPG. Overlapping this is a quirky soundtrack, and while it’s no Hirofumi Taniguchi, it’s the right amount of weird and pleasant.
Being an incessant fan of Moon: Remix RPG and Chulip, it wasn’t difficult for 24 Killers to grab my attention. I’ve spent a not-insignificant gob of time with a pre-release build of it, and it’s about what I was hoping for. It nails the aesthetic and philosophy of Love-de-Lic’s joy-makers while still presenting something reflective of its creator. Love-de-Lic fans are the best people. Just look at how great I am.
24 Killers launches on PC March 9th, 2023.

Dredge is a game that will see you play as a down-on-their-luck fisherman who is trawling the seas to make ends meet. As you get more desperate, you will have to venture into shadier parts of the ocean, each with their own equally shady sea beasties.

It's also getting a Steam Next Fest demo next week on February 6th, which gives you access to its chunky tutorial and the early portion of its campaign, plus the Historic Battle of The Battle Of Passchendaele, which is the mission I got a chance to play at the end of last year. As it turns out, I've also had a sneak peek at the Next Fest build, too, and there's a heck of a lot to sink your teeth into. Here's a small glimpse of what to expect.

There’s something meditative about being close to the water, waiting in silence for a catch, and mashing buttons to reel them in - plus I don’t need to deal with the horrendous smell from behind the safety of my desk. The indie game Dredge subverts what I like about fishing games, with an eerie eldritch horror waiting beneath the ocean’s surface. We won’t need to wait long before we see what's under there as Dredge releases on March 30th.

The studio announced in February of last year that Knockout City was going free-to-play and saying goodbye to Electronic Arts, who originally published the game as an EA Originals title, to self-publish the game's future content. That free-to-play launch happened last June with the start of Season 6 and now, Velan has announced that it will shut the game down in June of this year. More specifically, Knockout City will be shutdown on June 6.

Batsugun S-Tribute has been rated in Korea on Switch, Gematsu reports. This is potentially the next entry in City Connection's S-Tribute series, which focuses on a number of arcade and Sega Saturn titles, enhancing them for modern audiences.
Batsugun is a title from 1993 developed by Toplan which was later ported to the Saturn in 1996 in Japan only. Batsugun might look like your typical bullet hell shooter, but the game introduces experience points that allow you to upgrade your main gun, and after two upgrades, you use the experience for extra bomb stock. The game is also often considered to be the first 'manic shooter' with its ridiculous bullet patterns and complex enemy waves.

Yesterday, some Xbox fans were shocked to spot a message on the Xbox Marketplace that suggested that Microsoft was getting set to close down every element of the Xbox 360 Marketplace, from its massive game DLC library, to its demos, avatars, wallpapers, and other aesthetic content.
"We will be closing the Xbox 360 Marketplace over the next year," read the Marketplace support page, as spotted by Reddit user Gpro2005, "We encourage you to purchase any 360 games or DLC by May 2023." Clicking said message would then transfer the reader to a different page entirely, listing the 46 titles that are being removed from sale next week.
However, speaking with The Verge, Xbox global marketing manager Bree Adams has confirmed that the Xbox 360 Marketplace is not, in fact, shutting down this May. Citing that the original message was posted "in error" Adams does reiterate that the listed 46 titles are being removed from sale as of February 7, but the remainder of the Xbox 360 Marketplace catalog will remain online.
Regardless, it's a pretty intriguing error to make, given the definitiveness of the message, complete with a timeframe. Hopefully, we can chalk this one down to crossed wires and blurred communication. You can check out our previous report for a full list of the games that will be removed from the Xbox 360 Marketplace on February 7.
The Xbox 360 store won’t be closing down, despite what an Xbox support page says [The Verge]

With colourful Saturday morning cartoon visuals (the game was partially inspired by The Disney Afternoon) and puns galore, we can't wait to see how everything gels together in what looks like a charming little adventure.

Another day, another announcement of a free-to-play, games-as-a-service title shutting down. Yesterday, we learned EA is shuttering Apex Legends Mobile after less than a year of operation. Today, Velan Studios announced it will shut the doors on Knockout City later this year. The game originally launched in 2021 when it was published by EA and quickly scored more than five million players. Last year, the studio announced it would be self-publishing the game starting with Season 6 and making it free-to-play across all platformers. It was a mighty challenge for such a small team, and today, the studio posted a blog update that confirmed Knockout City would end after its next season.

Are you ready to bait some monsters?
Team17 and Black Salt Games have announced that the eldritch fishing game, Dredge, will be setting sail on March 30, 2023. That’s why I love fishing games, there are so many analogies I can make for when they launch. That’s practically another one right there! It’ll be coming to PC and all your favorite consoles.
Dredge has you set out into the murky waters to make a living by selling your fishing discoveries and running quests for the inhabitants of the islands. While you’re at it, solve a mystery, upgrade your boat, and strengthen your mind to survive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfniX3fH1l0&ab_channel=Team17
I find it difficult to imagine any sport that couldn’t be monumentally improved with eldritch horror. However, while I’m waiting for my Elder Gods Basketball, I’m definitely down for setting sail and being a harvester of the sea in Dredge. Jordan gave the demo a look back when it dropped and came away impressed. While this will be Black Salt Games’ maiden voyage, it’s looking to be a memorable one.
You’ll be seeing Dredge off the starboard bow on March 30, 2023 on Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms.

Resident Evil 7 Biohazard was, in many respects, a soft reboot for Capcom’s long-standing series. While containing more than enough easter eggs and homages referencing older series entries, RE7 made a number of major formulaic changes which set it apart from its undead-starring brethren. Instead of blockbuster setpieces or sprawling zombie-infested level layouts, Resident Evil went back to the drawing board, placing the player in (what initially appears to be) an abandoned Louisiana mansion.
Resident Evil 4 took the franchise to new highs. Unfortunately, Capcom saw this as a sign that they should reposition Resident Evil as (almost exclusively) an action, rather than horror, franchise. Throughout the later 2000s and early 2010s, Capcom plied the ma…]]></summary>

You know what's really good? Final Fantasy music. I'm not the kind of person who puts video game music in their walking-around playlists, but I'll frequently pop in a pair of earbuds and simply vibe on the Final Fantasy VII soundtrack. It's great in the context of the games - Final Fantasy as a franchise plays host to some of the most evocative JRPG battle themes of all time - but it's also just fun and pleasant to listen to.
So the philosophy behind Theatrhythm Final Bar Line makes sense. Nobody in the world will tell you that the music of Nobuo Uematsu is bad. Even the "worst" Final Fantasy soundtrack is a vibe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The daaarkness
Chimera Entertainment has pulled back the veil on their fantasy strategy game, Songs of Silence. While Chimera is mostly known for its mobile games, such as Sacred Legends and Angry Birds Evolution, Songs of Silence will be a whole-fat PC game, and it’s looking rather interesting.
Songs of Silence will feature narrative-driven, single-player campaigns on randomly generated maps. It features a fantasy world “torn between light and dark” and contains multiple sub-factions locked in an eternal war. There’s a mix of kingdom and hero management and real-time battles that sort of remind me of North and South. You don’t seem to take direct control of your forces in the midst of battle but instead play “powerful combat cards from your heroes.” There are more than a hundred different units, hundreds of cards, and six-person online multi-player.
[embed]https://youtu.be/Zcrrvsb8P3M[/embed]
While I can understand skepticism when it comes to seeing a primarily mobile developer entering the PC strategy scene, Songs of Silence looks like a real passion project. Chimera Entertainment cites Ogre Battle, Kohan, and Warlords as inspiration for this endeavor. Personally, I enjoy the kingdom management of strategy games. Even with something like the Total War series, my favorite part is the conquest rather than the individual battles.
If you need more to sweeten the deal, Hitoshi Sakimoto is signed on as the composer. He was responsible for the Final Fantasy XII, Final Fantasy Tactics, Valkyria Chronicles soundtracks among so many others. If nothing else, it demonstrates an earnest effort to live up to the classics.
No release date has been announced, but it is currently available to wishlist on Steam.

Homebrew games have come a long way, and it’s looking like they might actually be a viable, albeit limited, business model. Boutique publishers have been testing the waters for a while, and we’ve gotten some good ones that play on their intended hardware. It’s an exciting time for someone as affectionate towards old consoles as I am. Though perhaps not for someone as financially strained as I am.
First Press Games was willing to help out and actually sent me a physical copy of one of their NES titles, Blazing Rangers. I know what you’re thinking, but on the plus side, not only do I get to tell you about the game itself, but I can also let you in on the quality of First Press Games’ products. I’m excited. Are you excited?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can I tell you a secret? I'm terrible at Battle Brothers. I'm still terrible at Battle Brothers, even after playing it on and off for a few years. It's a bit like Blood Bowl, oddly, in that it's all about mitigating risks. And like Blood Bowl, despite having a decent head for tactics and planning on the fly, I am hopeless at sticking to them when I see a new idea, thus: terrible. At it.
But since an update last March looks likely to be its last big one, it's about time to get over myself and gave it a proper look as a complete package. It's long overdue, in fact. Although I still struggle to fully enjoy it, Battle Brothers is an unusually good tactical game, and the one to beat for the burgeoning subgenre of mercenary management sims. That's partly because it sticks so resolutely to its guns. Where Bannerlord faltered by throwing extraneous stuff unrelated to the core combat that should have defined it, and other open world games typically take a varied but shallow "do and be everything" approach, Battle Brothers resists dilution of that core concept.

Features such as support for 1440p output have been teased for some time while others, such as the ability to join a Discord voice chat natively, feel like they should have been announced sooner than several years into the console’s life cycle.

Sunbreak’s latest update adds new Event Quests, Anomaly Research content, paid DLC, and two new Elder Dragons to hunt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil 4 centers on Leon’s mission to rescue Ashley Graham, daughter of the U.S. president. She’s been kidnapped by a mysterious cult and held captive in a rural Spanish village players must search and survive in. Once you find Ashley, you become both her protector and, sometimes, partner. Her mechanics and interactions with Leon have some big changes, so as part of our larger cover story, I asked directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi to explain their reasons for making them. 
By clicking the right analog stick, Leon can tell Ashley to keep close (yelling "come on!") or to maintain some distance ("spread out"). You can no longer command her to stop; she follows no matter what. That means no more ditching her in a safe spot to clear out enemies lying ahead like in the original R…]]></summary>

We also discuss the reasons a developer might have to come out and clarify that their game is, in fact, real. Plus: "try cutting off their limbs"; what is Forspoken, and why so graphics?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the world continuing to disintegrate around us in real-time, it can be tempting to cast our eyes skyward in the hope of finding a better future. If KeokeN's Deliver Us games are anything to go by, though, life in outer space isn't all that peachy either. In Deliver Us The Moon, you may remember the scientists in charge of the moon's Earth-saving energy beam tech ended up having a bit of a Rapture moment, sabotaging all their good work (and the future of Earth in the process) and buggering off to goodness knows where to start life afresh in their newly birthed utopia. In its sequel, Deliver Us Mars, you find out those rogue astronauts didn't actually go that far at all. Yep, they hopped on over to the red planet and set up shop there, and when a strange transmission comes through revealing their location, it serves as the catalyst to send yet another crew into space to go and investigate. 

This time, though, you're right at the heart of its central conflict. By casting players as Kathy, the daughter of one of those rogue astronauts, Deliver Us Mars tells a much more fraught and personal tale of what kind of future humanity should be pursuing: should we, in fact, be turning our efforts toward a life in outer space, or should we be doing everything in our power to try and save the dire, pretty much almost dead husk of a planet we call home?

WWE 2K22 relaunched the franchise on the right foot, and 2K23 aims to build upon that success. The improvements and additions from last year’s game remain intact and expanded in some cases. The legendary John Cena gives his blessing of sorts by gracing the game's cover and starring in the centerpiece Showcase mode. That’s all well and good, but the addition of the long-requested WarGames match may be 2K23’s most exciting bullet point.

        <updated>2023-02-02T14:22:47.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electronic Arts has reportedly canceled a single-player game set in the shared Apex Legends and Titanfall universe. 
This news comes by way of Bloomberg, which reports that three people familiar with the matter say EA canceled the project, code-named TFL or Titanfall Legends, that was in development at Apex Legends developer Respawn Entertainment. Roughly 50 people were on the team working on this game and EA will reportedly attempt to find positions for these employees elsewhere within the company. If positions cannot be found, some might be laid off with severance packages, according to Bloomberg. 


The publication says Mohammad Alavi (Titanfall 2, Apex Legends designer) was set to direct this now-canceled game, but he left the company in 2022. 
It's likely this canceled single-player game set in the Apex Legends and Titanfall universe was the one hinted at back in July in job postings that referred to the game as an "Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title."
Word of this cancelation comes shortly after EA announced it was shutting down Apex Legends Mobile and Battlefield Mobile, and shuttering the latter's developer, Industrial Toys, as well. Plus, in the same financial results where EA revealed it was shutting these games down, the company revealed that Respawn's upcoming single-player Star Wars game, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, had been delayed to April.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony's latest financial results covering Quarter 3 of Fiscal Year 2022, which consists of the last three months of the year, reveal the PlayStation 5 had its best quarter on the market yet. 
The company has surpassed 32 million PS5 units shipped, sitting roughly at 32.1 million, after shipping 7.1 million during the last three months of 2022. It's important to note this isn't a sell-through number so theoretically, there could be consoles sitting on shelves still. But a company ships more units when the demand is there, so it's likely that the majority of these shipped consoles were sold. 
PlayStation did just as well on the first-party software side of things, selling 20.8 million during Q3 of Fiscal Year 2022, which is almost more than double the 11.3 million sold during the same period in 2021. Of those 20.8 million, roughly 11 million were of God of War: Ragnarok, which was the console's big holiday release. 


Including both first and third-party software, 86.5 million units were sold for the PS5, which is less than Q3 of Fiscal Year 2021 (92.7 million) but still an impressive number nonetheless. Sixty-two percent of the software sold this past quarter was digital. 
PlayStation Plus subscribers reached 46.4 million in Q3, which is up from Q2's 45.4 million but down from Q1's 47.3 million. The peak in the PS5's lifetime happened in Q3 of Fiscal Year 2021 at 48 million subscribers.
In terms of monthly active PlayStation users, Q3 reached a new peak for the current generation of PlayStation, hitting 112 million. That's up 10 million from the quarter before it and roughly 1 million more than the same quarter in 2021. 
All told, Q3 of Fiscal Year 2022 was the PS5's best quarter yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last night was a restless one for the Steam Deck. In addition to a huge client update for the handheld PC, Valve pushed out a Proton Experimental update to fix a crashing problem with games that use the Ubisoft Connect launcher on Steam. 
Ubi’s launcher had received an update of its own, sadly one that interfered with the ability of Proton – the layer of software that helps made-for-Windows games run on the Linux-based SteamOS – to keep it compatible with the Deck. Indeed, just like the 2K Launcher last year, with the added irony that the affected games (which include The Division 2, Watch Dogs Legion and Ghost Recon Breakpoint) only arrived on Steam in the past few weeks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans have been clamouring for a sequel to Titanfall 2 since its release in 2016, but it looks like we might need to put those hopes on hold for a little longer. According to a report from Bloomberg, EA have cancelled an unannounced project codenamed Titanfall Legends, a single-player mash-up between Titanfall and Apex Legends - Respawn’s battle royale, set in the same universe. Around 50 devs were working on the game before its cancellation earlier this week. EA are reportedly trying to find other positions for the devs, but those that aren't rehired are being laid off with severance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes I want to describe games in the most high-brow way possible. I might smugly write something like “it elevates the genre” while sipping wine and eating cheese, musing on how a game pushes the media forward as an art form. Other times I just want to write that a game is really bloody good, actually, and I like it lots.
Hi-Fi Rush falls into the latter category. Developer Tango Gameworks shadow-dropped the rhythm-action game out of nowhere shortly after an Xbox presentation, jettisoning The Evil Within’s murky mental hospitals and Ghostwire: Tokyo's supernatural shinanigans for something markedly different: bright pulsating neon colours and a gang of loveable anime ruffians, where every whack and dodge is underscored by a beat. 
Hi-Fi Rush is an action-adventure game with a mechanical core fuelled by musical beats. Protagonist Chai has undergone a risky medical procedure and emerged from the other side with a robot arm and an iPod accidentally implanted in his chest meaning his every waking moment is punctuated by a catchy beat. We too see these rhythmic motions, as Hi-Fi Rush's soda pop-infused world moves to this steady pulse - platforms move in time with the music, lights flash in pleasing rhythmic patterns, and enemies attack to the beat of the drum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony is closing the PlayStation Plus Collection, the batch of PS4 essentials that PS Plus subscribers on PS5 could download and play for no extra charge. 
In an email sent to subscribers, the message states that on May 9, the 19-game collection will disappear, and subscribers have until that date to add its games to their game library. Sony didn't provide a reason for why it's closing the collection, but it also clarifies that other PS Plus perks, such as the monthly games, will not be affected. Here’s the full message below:
The PlayStation Plus Collection launched alongside the PS5 as an added bonus to those owners. In a way, it served as a mini-version of Xbox's Game Pass, albeit only featuring last-gen titles. The collection has remained largely the same since 2020, with a couple of titles joining the roster and only Persona 5 being removed from the original line-up last year. The PS Plus Collection currently consists of the following titles: 
Batman: Arkham Knight
Battlefield 1
Bloodborne
Call of Duty: Black Ops III: Zombie Chronicles Edition
Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy
Days Gone
Detroit: Become Human
Fallout 4
Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition
God of War (2018)
Infamous: Second Son
The Last Guardian
The Last of Us Remastered
Monster Hunter: World
Mortal Kombat X
Ratchet & Clank (2016)
Resident Evil VII: Biohazard
Uncharted 4: A Thief's End
Until Dawn
Last year, Sony added two premium PlayStation Plus Subscription tiers that give those members access to a much larger (and more regularly updated) library of games across multiple generations of PlayStation. Premium members can access most, though not all, of these titles now, so perhaps Sony wants to incentivize standard PS Plus subscribers to upgrade. Regardless, be sure to nab these games now if you haven't already before the May 9 deadline sneaks up on you.]]></summary>

Hi-Fi Rush occupies an increasingly rare space in the big-budget video game industry: that of colorful, goofy, and light-hearted titles. For its 10 or 11-hour runtime, it has more in common with a Saturday morning cartoon than a thin attempt at gritty, prestige television, like most triple-A games these days, and that's easily its biggest strength. That its gameplay and combat are a unique melding of rhythm and stylish action games is merely the cherry on top.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amnesia: The Bunker, the next installment in the psychological survival horror franchise, arrives on May 16 instead of its original March window. 
The Bunker offers a different spin on the Amnesia formula. Set during World War 1, players control a French soldier who gets separated from his comrades and trapped inside a military bunker. Within this labyrinthine, trap-laden sanctuary lurks a deadly creature that stalks the player, who must use their resourcefulness to survive. If you’re a fan of Alien: Isolation, The Bunker appears to aim for a similar style with a heaping dose of its signature mind-bending scares. Check out the original reveal trailer below.

These are the four games all PlayStation Plus subscribers can add to their libraries starting next week on February 7, not to be confused with the PlayStation Plus games catalog that varies depending on the tier of subscription you have. 
Here's what PlayStation has to say about each of these games:
Evil Dead: The Game | PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4
Game Informer's Evil Dead: The Game review
OlliOlli World
Game Informer's OlliOlli World review
Destiny 2: Beyond Light
Game Informer's Destiny 2: Beyond Light review
Mafia: Definitive Edition
Game Informer's Mafia: Definitive Edition review
All four of these games will be available to PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium members from February 7 until March 6. You have until February 6 to add last month's games – Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Fallout 76, and Axiom Verge 2 – to your library. 
Elsewhere in today's announcement, PlayStation announced that the PlayStation Plus Collection, which PS5 owners subscribed to Plus have had access to since 2020, will no longer be offered starting May 9. 
"If you haven't redeemed the titles in this collection yet, you can still do so until May 9, which will enable you to access those titles even after this date for as long as you remain a PlayStation Plus member."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm running out of pictures to use when I write about Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams because I've only completed two puzzles in it. I've been doing the third one for about a year, because it's, I think, six thousand pieces. I say "i think" because it's been long enough that I can't remember if I told the game to generate it as five or six thousand. But it's a lot of thousand.
I really like jigsaws (I am in the middle of doing a real life one that is a big copy of the London Underground map) but, even though I have one of those special mats to do puzzles on so you can fold them away, they're quite inconvenient. At the same time, though, there are very few digi-jigsaws that capture the kind of tactile experience of sifting and sorting through pieces. Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams really does, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Revisiting Minecraft to discuss whether it deserved the GOTY award back in 2010 is a hard task, in the same way that discussing the importance of sliced bread is hard. It’s so significant that, when ranking the significance of other similar things, we all forget it until someone goes “wait wot about Minecraft” and then everyone unleashes a collective “oooo yeahhh”, guaranteeing it the top spot. To echo AliceB’s sentiments upon revisiting Portal, it’s fuckin’ Minecraft.
In fact, I think I could take her Portal revisited intro, replace every instance of “Portal” with “Minecraft”, and call it a day. It’s Minecraft! Of course it was game of the year. It was arguably the game of the decade, an absolute all timer. I won’t spend many words explaining why it is good, because those words would be redundant fodder, like the bloke fighting a soaring dragon by poking the ground under his feet with a sword. I’ll give it a fair go so that Alice can’t say I didn’t try, and swiftly move on to reading all of your (hopefully) lovely comments about why you also like Minecraft. If everyone brings one thing, we can have a show-and-tell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arkane’s co-op, vampire huntin’ shooter is only a couple of months away, but there's some eyebrow-raising news in Redfall land. On top of being a vampire-filled hellscape, Redfall will also require an always-online connection, even when playing the game in single-player without buddies. This comes courtesy of a Bethesda FAQ page that states a “persistent connection is required” for co-op and single-player, and that a Bethesda.net account is also necessary to play the game. Many co-op and multiplayer games have required a persistent connection as of late, but it’s disappointing in Redfall’s case since the game is playable alone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I loved Obsidian’s medieval mystery Pentiment when it released last November, and part of my admiration was for its incredible art style. It was like the dev team had nicked a bunch of 16th-century manuscripts, scanned the delicate pages, and then fully animated them to life.
Pentiment was clearly made by a team who had a deep love for the time period, and the same can be said for Inkulinati, a 2D turn-based strategy game that also uses illuminated medieval drawings. But Yaza Games have taken a bit of a different direction with Inkulinati's vibe by adding a whole heap of cheeky humour. You wouldn't think it would suit the stuffy nature of religious manuscripts, but actually those monks were pretty cheeky blokes, and Inkulinati's humour is done in a way that stays completely loyal to the source material, fart jokes and all.

Revealed at CES 2023 and set for launch in March, this is the first Vive VR headset in years with real PC gaming credentials, while borrowing from the more compact design of the mobile VR-minded Vive Flow VR glasses. I recently went to try them out over here in London, with an uneasy thought in my mind: even with a lighter design than the Vive Cosmos series, how could this possibly be worth £1299 / $1099?

Our first port of call? theHunter: Call Of The Wild.
In our first sessions with the game, we both concluded that A) deer are incredibly athletic; and B) we're the most impatient people, perhaps ever. More than that, though, we hadn't realised how important it was to fixate on your prey. Not like, track them down. But like, track them down, you know?

This news comes after 95 employees lost their jobs, following mass layoffs across Microsoft. The layoffs affected long-time 343 devs, as well as contractors who only had a few days' notice. Halo Infinite has been trying to find its footing after a rocky first year, but this report doesn’t inspire much hope from fans, at least for the series’ short-term future. The report delves into the studio’s switch to a different engine, an upcoming battle royale game, and most importantly, the lack of any single-player content in development.

The trailer features roughly two and a half minutes of new Hogwarts Legacy footage, including a mix of both cinematics from the game and gameplay. We see Hogsmeade, professors, students, and plenty of Hogwarts, of course. 
Check it out for yourself in the Hogwarts Legacy launch trailer below: 


"Hogwarts Legacy invites players to embark on an epic journey as a fifth-year student at Hogwarts, gifted with a rare ability to tap into ancient, powerful magic," a press release reads. "Guided by the Wizard's Field Guide and unique instruction from professors and other characters, fans will uncover a compelling storyline filled with thrilling challenges and mysteries."
For more about Hogwarts Legacy, check out everything we learned in the second gameplay showcase, which aired last month ,and then watch this cinematic tour of the Hogwarts castle grounds. Check out Hogwarts Legacy's PlayStation 5 DualSense features after that.
Read about how controversial Harry Potter creator JK Rowling is not involved with the making of Hogwarts Legacy (although she will almost certainly be getting money as a direct result of this game), and then check out this trailer showcasing common rooms, easter eggs, and more. 
Hogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10, and PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on April 4. The Switch version of the game will be released on July 25.]]></summary>

This Netflix-exclusive game can be played by any subscriber on iOS and Android devices. The sequel brings players back to World War I "for a dramatic narrative game following four interweaving stories of friendship, survival, and sacrifice amidst the turmoil and tragedy of war." Valiant Hearts: The Great War was a surprise hit back in 2014, garnering attention and storytelling praise from critics and players alike. 
Check out the Valiant Hearts: Coming Home release trailer below: 


"James joins the Harlem Hellfighters to search for his heroic older brother Freddie, while Anna tends to the wounded and broken," a press release about the game reads. "Ernst, a German driver, and George, a British aviator, each face their own challenges, and Walt, the canine companion from the first game, is back to aid players in their progress through exploration, puzzle-solving, and action sequences." 
Ubisoft says original core members that worked on Valiant Hearts: The Great War at Ubisoft Montepllier in 2014 have returned to develop Valiant Hearts: Coming Home in collaboration with Old Skull Games.
This is the first of three Ubisoft mobile games coming to Netflix. The next game is Mighty Quest, which is also due out this year and will bring Netflix subscribers a "roguelite-inspired hack-and-slash adventure." The third game will be an Assassin's Creed mobile game to coincide with Netflix's live-action Assassin's Creed series.

EA says it is ending Battlefield Mobile, which hadn't been fully released yet (although many had played through betas), as part of a "pivot from the current direction to best deliver on our vision for the franchise and to meet the expectations of our players." The company adds that it is hard at work evolving Battlefield 2042, which launched to disappointment from fans, and in "pre-production on our future Battlefield experiences at our studios across the globe." 
As for Apex Legends Mobile, EA says that despite the game's strong start, "the ongoing experience was not going to meet the expectations" of its players. 
"At Respawn, we aim to provide players with games that are consistently outstanding," a statement from Respawn reads. "Following a strong start, the content pipeline for Apex Legends Mobile has begun to fall short of that bar for quality, quantity, and cadence. It is for this reason, after months of working with our development partner, that we have made the mutual decision to sunset our mobile game. Although disappointing, we are proud of the game we launched, are grateful for the support of the Apex Legends community, and are confident that this is the right decision for players." 
All real-world money, in-app purchases have been disabled and the game has been removed from webstores. From now until the game's shutdown on May 1, players can spend their existing Syndicate Gold and continue playing the full game. EA says it will not be providing refunds for money spent on Apex Legends Mobile in its FAQ, which answers other questions you might have here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jett: The Far Shore was, like the jagged colossi that roamed its lavender skies, an odd beast. When it emerged on the Epic Game Store in the autumn of 2021, you could see the conflict roiling in its belly - between the linear science fiction short story on the surface, and the freeroaming “Metroid snowboarding game” fighting to get out from underneath it.
“Once the story finished, I hoped an endgame would open up and allow me to play freely in its world,” I wrote in our Jett review. “That I’d have more opportunities to watch great Ghoke, the red sun, rise in real time, and to ponder the Far Shore’s fascinating mysteries at length. Instead, I could only replay previous chapters. If only Jett had embraced a rhythm as organic as its inspired ecosystem.”


When the Jett team read that review, they didn’t disagree. “You put your finger on it more accurately than anybody else, which was, ‘It really feels like this is building up to some sort of systemic-focused, open world endgame,’” says Superbrothers founder Craig Adams. “And internally we were like, ‘Yeah, it is.’” What they knew, and I didn’t, was that The Far Shore was just the first part of a two-campaign story. That journey has now been completed with the launch of Given Time, a bonus 12-hour adventure that coincides with Jett’s long-awaited Steam release.

With that in mind, I dove into the game's recent technical test with fellow RPS Treehouse-dwellers Ollie and James to sample the game at a more leisurely pace, and to draw upon their greater strategic expertise. Did the combat hold up? Were they pleased to be dragged into a co-op session with me? Yes... and no. We had fun, but it didn't come quite as naturally without the guiding hand of the developers showing us the ropes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Iron Galaxy’s Rumbleverse, its pro-wrestling-flavored battle royale, is shutting down next month, only seven months after its full launch last August. 
Though Iron Galaxy doesn’t plainly state the reason for Rumbleverse’s demise, a blog post somewhat hints that a lack of substantial players may have played a role, stating in part:
“When you work on a video game, you imagine the community that will show up to play it someday. For years, we dreamed about a lively city filled with people fighting to become a champion. We strived to create a vibrant place that celebrated the competitive spirit. Our goal was to bring joy back to online multiplayer gaming. The people who gave Rumbleverse a chance and took it on as a new hobby have validated every day that we put into bringing our ideas to life.”
Rumbleverse’s online servers shut down on February 28 at 10 a.m. CST. Players who spent any money on or within the game will receive refunds. That includes the Rumbleverse Battle Pass or Brawlla Bills on any platform. The current battle pass will also be given to all players free of charge with double XP gain. Certain emotes and accessories have been made free to acquire as well. Today, Iron Galaxy will close the in-game store and will release the final update. 
Rumbleverse was first announced during the 2021 Game Awards and offered a unique spin to the battle royale with its emphasis on melee combat. After holding various beta tests throughout the first half of 2022, the game fully opened its doors in August to a generally warm reception from players and critics. You can watch us take it for a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today Live. 
In similar news, today Konami announced it's turning off the lights to its 2022 social deduction game, Crimesight.]]></summary>

If those two games were to come together in a high speed collision, the mangled wreckage might look like The Crew Motorfest, Ubisoft's newly announced game about a racing festival on the island of O'ahu.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Respawn Entertainment has delayed Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, but thankfully the wait won’t be terribly long. Instead of arriving on March 17, the game will now launch a little over a month later on April 28. 
In a message posted to Twitter, Respawn states the game is content complete, and it's solely focusing on fixing bugs, ensuring stability, and polishing the experience as much as possible. The team is so committed that it’s taking another six weeks to make sure Survivor plays as smoothly as butter. Check out Respawn’s full message below (click the image to enlarge). 

Star Wars Jedi: Survivor takes place five years after its predecessor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Hero Cal Kestis, now a full-fledged Jedi, still fights to survive against the Galactic Empire alongside his allies BD-1 and Cere Junda. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. For more info on the game, check out our video discussion with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan as well as our most recent preview.]]></summary>

Discovery revealed last year that Guardians of the Galaxy and Peacemaker director James Gunn and Aquaman producer Peter Safran had been hired to lead as co-CEOs of DC Studios. Since that reveal, DC fans have speculated what Gunn and Safran's new DCU, as the duo is calling the new DC cinematic universe, will look like in the coming years. 
Gunn has teased on Twitter multiple times that he, Safran, and others were formulating their long-spanning plan for the DCU and now, today, the duo has pulled back the curtain on the first 10 projects. All 10 of these projects, which span across movies and TV, will be in Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crimesight, a social deduction game released last year, got a surprising update on its steam page last night. Despite being out for less than ten months, Konami is ending support for it — and making the game unplayable.
“Thank you for playing CRIMESIGHT,” the news post reads. “This service has continued to operate with the support of many users since its launch in April 2022, but due to various circumstances, we have decided to terminate the service on Monday, May 01, 2023 at 00:00 PDT.”
Support for an online game is bound to end at some point, but seeing the service cut off so quickly has many fans caught off guard. This is also the end of more than just the online modes. At the end of the post, Konami writes, “Also, the game itself won’t be able to play.” As a result, recent Steam reviews have a score of “Mostly Negative,” as players warn future buyers from purchasing a product that will soon be unplayable.
【Important】 Service Termination Announcement

Crimesight is a multiplayer social deduction game set in a futuristic London. Moriarty's team seeks to commit a murder, and Sherlock's team tris to stop that from happening. While it was generally received positively by those that did play it, it didn't gain much traction. With only a handful of reviews on Metacritic and extremely low stats on SteamDB, a site that tracks concurrent player count, it's safe to say that one of Konami's "various circumstances" for canceling it is the size of its playerbase.
If you want to try it out, you've got until February to buy it, and until May before it stops working. If you want to try playing a different social deduction game, I've heard Among Us is good.
Do you think Crimesight should stay on Steam? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

This is the first time they've dropped to this level, and for a go-anywhere set of headphones they might just be worth a look.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We already knew that 2023 was poised to be a big year for the Street Fighter franchise, thanks in large part to the impending launch of Street Fighter 6 this summer. However, Capcom and Crunchyroll Games are piling on with a new free-to-play mobile RPG called Street Fighter: Duel. If character collection games like Summoners War, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, and Marvel Strike Force appeal to you, Street Fighter: Duel sounds like it shares many elements with those popular mobile titles.
Street Fighter: Duel includes more than 40 Street Fighter characters for players to recruit with the objective of building a team from across the franchise. Each team consists of three fighters who can be leveled up and customized with new skins. These fighters, who include characters like Ryu, Akuma, Chun-Li, Cammy, and more, all feature signature abilities and can pull off various combos through real-time 2D RPG combat or auto-battle mode. In addition to taking on Shadaloo, players can also look forward to head-to-head combat against other players.


"Street Fighter has been an iconic game for generations, and we know anime fans love to go on exciting adventures with beloved characters," Crunchyroll Games general manager and Crunchyroll senior vice president of emerging business Terry Li said in a press release. "We're excited to collaborate with Capcom to bring Street Fighter: Duel and its incredible roster of iconic fighters to anime and gaming fans alike.
Pre-registration for both mobile platforms is available now through the official website. Those who pre-register will be gifted free in-game currency when the game arrives. Street Fighter: Duel is set to launch on iOS and Android in February.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the 2022 Game Awards, the team behind Dead Cells put out an animated teaser trailer announcing that the game’s next DLC expansion would be Castlevania-themed. It came as a total surprise; Castlevania hasn’t had a new release in years, and most of Dead Cells’ other collaborations never amounted to much more than referential skins and a few weapons. To take such a big leap – and to do it with the series that inspired the game in the first place – is a huge step for the indie roguelike.
While Dead Cells was developed by Motion twin, the Castlevania DLC is being developed by Evil Empire, an indie studio made of ex-Motion Twin employees that have handled most of the game’s post-launch content.

This news comes from a Bloomberg report stating that the switch from Slipspace to Unreal will begin with a new game under the codename Tatanka, according to the publication's sources who are familiar with 343's plans. According to Bloomberg, 343 is developing Tatanka with Certain Affinity, who has helped develop various Halo games for more than 15 years. The project reportedly started off as a battle royale but has potentially evolved in different directions. 


Bloomberg reports that future Halo games "will also explore using the Unreal Engine," but that some within the studio are skeptical of dropping Slipspace entirely in favor of Epic Gam…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've come to regard the four main games in the Life Is Strange franchise as kind of like the siblings in a big family. There's the eldest, who will always be heaped with praise because no matter what the others achieve, she did it all first. Her twin is always keen to remind you that even though she's the younger and perhaps not quite as accomplished half of the duo, she's more charismatic and less coy about who she is and what she wants. Then there's the youngest, who's extremely likeable, in large part because she's learned what behaviours to avoid just by watching the others make mistakes; even if she's modelled herself on the eldest a bit too closely in her quest for approval, and so hasn't really forged her own identity.
Then there's Life Is Strange 2: the awkward middle child. Still very recognisably a member of the family, but the one that stands out in all the photos because he's just a bit gawky. He's experimented a lot with his storytelling and plotline in an attempt to make himself stand out, and it's only sort-of worked. His romantic subplots are underdeveloped, his villains are one-dimensional, and his attempt at tackling a Very Serious Issue has grown in all crooked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2005, Resident Evil 4 changed the face of survival horror. The game’s phenomenal blend of action and horror combined with its revolutionary over-the-shoulder gameplay cemented it as a bonafide classic, a magic Capcom hopes to recapture with a modernized remake. That reinvention graces Game Informer’s cover this month. 
We visited Capcom’s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, to play Chapters One and Five of Resident Evil and speak to its principal designers, including directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who previously led the Resident Evil 2 remake. You’ll read 12 pages sharing new details on the opening section, breakdowns of Ashley’s gameplay and other new tweaks, plus impressions of the church, cemetery, and house battle segments.
Issue 353 is also our 2022 Game of the Year issue! This massive spread reflects on the last year in games, featuring Top 10 lists from both the staff and our readers, our individual category awards, editor picks highlighting exceptional titles that didn’t crack the top 10, as well as the staff’s personal top 10 lists. On top of that, we have a great feature detailing the localization process of MMORPGs and previews for anticipated titles such as Death Stranding 2, Armored Core VI, and Hades II. 
You can also try to nab a Game Informer Gold version of the issue. Limited to a numbered print run per issue, this premium version of Game Informer isn't available for sale. To learn about places where you might be able to get a copy, check out our official Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, and stay tuned for more details in the coming weeks.

It's the capper on what has been a turbulent month for the company. Three weeks ago Ubisoft announced they were cancelling three unannounced games amid “worsening macroeconomic conditions.” In a letter to employees, CEO Yves Guillemot said that “the ball is in your court” in regard to hitting deadlines and overturning Ubisoft’s sticky financial situation. French union Solidaires Informatique said that Guillemot’s "words mean something: overtime, managerial pressure, burnout, etc," and called on Ubisoft Paris employees to strike for better pay and working hours. It seems some devs heard the call.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The road to launch has been a uniquely turbulent one for The Settlers: New Allies. After an eight-year absence, the next entry in Ubisoft’s beloved city-building series was finally revealed in 2018, only to be delayed indefinitely two years later. The game then reemerged in a fresh new form in 2022, but a less than favourable reception from long-term fans to its closed beta saw the game delayed indefinitely once again.


12 months later, The Settlers: New Allies is all the better for it. An extended delay is never an easy decision to make, yet the team at Ubisoft Düsseldorf (formerly Blue Byte) has seen this additional development time as an opportunity to reach out to those most familiar with the series. “We learned [more] than just what was needed for the game,” creative director Christian Hagerdorn tells me during a recent preview event. “One of our biggest focuses was to be absolutely transparent with the players. Not just on where we were standing, but where we were going. We've been collecting the feedback as we were developing”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Snap has taken the world by storm, but one glaring omission fans have asked for is the ability to battle friends instead of only random strangers. As previously promised, the wait is over because Marvel Snap’s new Battle Mode allows players to take on their buddies, and it goes live today.
Battle Mode allows players to share battle codes with each other for private one-on-one bouts. This match-up consists of multiple back-to-back games with players using the same decks throughout. Players start with 10 health each and whoever wins a game deals 1 point of damage. However, this damage can be doubled by snapping. A player loses when their health hits zero, and there’s no round limit. Developer Second Dinner states that Battle Mode will receive updates expanding its features over the coming months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whomst among us hasn't dreamt of somehow being transported to a magical world, where there are talking unicorns, and you can throw lightning and control plants because you are this universe's very special hero? Such is the fate of Frey, who falls through a portal into Athia and finds that world in mortal peril. Although if I were here I'd be a bit disappointed. It's all very well being able to zoom around doing magic parkour everywhere, but there isn't much to do or many places to go. Not a single talking unicorn to be seen.
Forspoken is somehow both full and devoid of content. There is a huge open world, but it is mostly empty. There is an epic story of magic, other universes, and saving the world, but it only takes up a couple of days. I actually enjoyed a lot of Forspoken, but it gets more fun the more you play, and then it's over; I didn't pre-order this game for sixty odd quid, and if I had I'd be disappointed. Even the much-Tweeted about annoying dialogue doesn't happen much, and isn't contextually annoying. Forspoken is annoying, though, just not in the ways you might expect if all you've seen is people discussing out-of-context clips from cutscenes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avatar Generations, a new mobile turn-based squad RPG that's free to play on Apple and Android devices, is out today, and you can prepare for the game's release with a new launch trailer. 
Developed by Navigator Games and published by Crystal Dynamics Eidos Entertainment in association with Paramount Consumer Products, Avatar Generations is an RPG that lets players team up with iconic characters from Avatar: The Last Airbender to explore a dynamic map of the Four Nations. It features retold stories from the series and new ones adding to the overall world of Avatar. 
Check it out in the Avatar Generations launch trailer below: 


"In Avatar Generations, players assemble a team of iconic Avatar heroes and adversaries as they explore a dynamic map of the Four Nations," a press release reads. "The game's turn-based battles are immersive and strategic, with customizable formations and team combos. The journey not only revisits the most memorable moments from the Avatar universe but also offers new adventures in the Avatar world. Players will relive the classic adventure of Aang and his friends, while battling powerful enemies, upgrading heroes, and mastering the elements to bring balance to the spiritual and physical world."
Avatar Generations features Katara, Sokka, Zuko, Toph, and others like the Blue Spirit, Princess Yue, Kyoshi Warrior Suki, and more. Each character has their own skills and players can level them up to unlock more and customize them further. You can even equip supports like Momo and Appa to further strengthen your characters. 

Navigator Games will add new characters and companions, additional cosmetics and gear for heroes, and more areas to explore across the Four Nations map in future updates. 
Avatar Generations is out today on iOS and Android devices.

The project was initially described as "an innovative take on The Witcher universe telling an unforgettable story.” We now know that this “unforgettable story” could potentially be told inside of a multiplayer game, or at least a game with multiplayer and social elements.

Now, IGN reports it has learned that PlayStation, Xbox, and Sony will be skipping E3 2023, a major blow to what was supposed to be E3's big comeback. The publication also reports that these companies won't have a presence on the Los Angeles Convention Center showfloor, either, which is where game companies typically have large (and flashy) booths where people can preview games and learn more about what's in store.

The crossover pack’s announcement (via the Square Enix Extreme Edges Twitter account) did tease a few of the things we can expect to clean up, including the Seventh Heaven bar, and FF7’s first boss the Guard Scorpion. The teaser image also shows off the motorcycles from FF7’s mini-game, so I’ll be expecting to hose that down in time for a quick escape.

Theatrhythm Final Fantasy quickly became one of my favorite Nintendo 3DS games when it hit the system in 2012, as did the Curtain Call sequel two years later. These weren’t perfect rhythm games, but they were unique and utilized one of the best compilations of video game scores in music history. The Final Fantasy series is special to me for many reasons, and perhaps chief among those is its music. That I ended up adoring the Theatrhythm series on 3DS was no surprise. I was surprised, though, to see publisher Square Enix and developer indieszero announce Theatrhythm Final Bar Line las…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not often that you see an OLED TV for less than $800, and it's even less common to see an OLED gaming monitor for that kind of a price - especially when it's Gigabyte's well-respected FO48U, a 48-in model that supports 4K 120Hz over HDMI 2.1 or DisplayPort. It's got USB-C charging, KVM functionality, FreeSync/G-Sync... and it cost $1499 when it launched two years ago. 
Now, you can pick it up for $729 at Newegg when you use code JAN2548, an outstanding deal for a monitor of this size and quality.

As you'd hope from a drive of this calibre, this uses more expensive TLC NAND flash and has a DRAM cache, providing noticeably better sustained performance than QLC drives without a DRAM cache.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtuless is coming this fall, and this time it's injecting the series’ absurdity with a dose of classical Japanese history. 
This latest installment in the wacky strategy series unfolds in the feudal Japan-style demonic realm of Hinomoto. Made up of multiple netherworlds, the underworld residents followed the bushido code of honor until a tyrannical regime took over to promote a code of destruction. A pair of unlikely allies must team up to stop this threat: a lazy samurai named Futo and a hyperactive otaku girl named Pirilika. 


Disgaea 7 boasts over 40 character classes, including four new ones: Maiko, Bandit, Zombie Maiden, and Big Eye. It also retains the 3D sprites introduced in Disgaea 6. New mechanics include Jumbofication, which turns characters into super-sized versions of themselves to inflict massive attack damage. Item Reincarnation lets you transform equipment and items into new forms, such as turning a weapon into a healing item. Auto-battles have been improved with deeper character customization. Now, your forces can stand a better chance against other players' troops in the new online ranked battles. 
Unlike Disgaea 6, a Switch exclusive at launch, Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtuless will be available on multiple platforms on day one. You can get the game on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some developers spend their careers inching towards their dream job, leapfrogging between roles in a grand strategy game of their own making. Others, like Randy Smith, simply show up on their first day and find they’re exactly where they’re meant to be.


“The approach that Looking Glass had to creating games was pretty unique,” he says now. “Even to this day, there are few studios who have that same ideology and mindfulness in how videogames are made.”


Thief: The Dark Project had a great director, in the form of Greg LoPiccolo, who later became a pioneer in the world of music games with Guitar Hero and Rock Band. And before him, Ken Levine had laid down the cobbles of Thief’s setting, defining its noir-ish tone before heading off to work on System Shock 2. Yet Looking Glass games weren’t driven by a singular 90s auteur. In fact, the very absence of ego in the studio’s culture meant its many “bright stars” were happy to adhere to a shared vision.

In a series of tweets published last Friday, Microsoft’s chief communications officer Frank X. Shaw said Sony were “briefing people in Brussels claiming Microsoft is unwilling to offer them parity for Call of Duty if we acquire Activision," but added that “Nothing could be further from the truth.” I would have thought that a legal venue would be a more appropriate place to air these grievances, but I suppose this gets the job done quicker. Either way, it’s a toffee popcorn-worthy accusation in the ongoing drama.

Homeworld is essentially just Battlestar Galactica, if it were a real-time strategy game that jumped through a hyperspace gate exclusively onto PC.

When Homeworld's Kushan civilisation set out on their journey to the lost planet of Hiigara in the space-year of 1999, the game was doing something very unique compared with most other RTS games on the market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After weeks of speculation and leaks last year, a Dragon Ball Super collaboration officially went live in Epic Games' battle royale, Fortnite, in August. It brought Goku, Vegeta, Bulma, and Beerus to the game alongside a Kamehameha mystic item for use in-game and the Nimbus Cloud. Now, Dragon Ball Super is coming back, starting tomorrow. 
The official Fortnite Twitter account posted an image of a Red Ribbon ship hovering over a portion of Fortnite's battle royale island with "Fortnite x Dragon Ball Super" on it this morning, alongside tomorrow's date. This means we'll be seeing some (hopefully new) Dragon Ball Super content drop into Fortnite tomorrow.

As for what to expect, that remains unknown. Given the various characters in Dragon Ball Super, it could be anybody. But Dragon Ball mainstays like Piccolo, Gohan, and Trunks, and even popular villains like Frieza, didn't make an appearance in Fortnite last year, so here's hoping we see all or some of them in the Item Shop tomorrow. There's also the possibility that we get some Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero content considering that movie hit theaters last August and was quite successful. 
Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait long because the Fortnite x Dragon Ball Super collaboration begins tomorrow. 
Who do you hope to see added to Fortnite tomorrow? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake feels like a game of yesteryear, in both good and bad ways. It’s a nostalgic romp through themed levels that feel more inspired than just another platforming tour through Bikini Bottom. It does a great job highlighting why people that grew up with SpongeBob SquarePants loved the show, and why people still love it today. At its best, the gameplay is decently fun, but at its worst, it’s mindlessly dull. This, coupled with a few bugs, like one that caused music to disappear completely, or…]]></summary>

Check it out below: 
While these two images (and the casting) look great, we still haven't seen Netflix's One Piece show in motion so here's hoping we get a trailer sooner than later. One Piece begins sometime this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The actor for the video game version of Tess in The Last of Us, Annie Wersching, has died. She was 45. 
Wersching was diagnosed with cancer in the summer of 2020 and she died following a two-year battle against it yesterday, January 29. She is survived by her husband Stephen and her three children, Freddie, Ozzie, and Archie. A GoFundMe has been created to help raise money for Wersching's family. 
In the video game industry, Wersching is perhaps best known for her role as Tess in Naughty Dog's 2013 hit, The Last of Us, but she was also known for her roles in 24 and Bosch, as reported by Variety. Many shared their love of Wersching yesterday following the news of her death, including The Last of Us co-creator and director Neil Druckmann. 
I miss my silly friend who helped bring Tess to life. Annie, you left us way too soon. You will forever be part of the TLoU & Naughty Dog family! 💔

January 29, 2023
Wersching was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and Variety reports that her first screen credit happened at 24 years old in a 2002 episode of Star Trek: Enterprise. From there, Wersching appeared in shows like Frasier, Supernatural, and Charmed, before she received recurring roles in General Hospital and 24. She played Tess in The Last of Us in 2013 and was hopefully able to watch Anna Torv's depiction of her character in HBO's The Last of Us over the past two few weeks.

Still, some lingering performance woes on the Deck mean I’m probably going to continue Isaac Clarke’s first and worst job on desktop alone.
To be fair, the remake is playable on Valve’s handheld. It’s not outright broken, despite having been so on launch day, with problems ranging from drastic FPS dips to outright hard crashes. Following some impressively fast work from Valve themselves, focusing on hotfixes for SteamOS’ Proton compatibility software, Dead Space’s Deck performance has become more or less manageable. But worthy of the best Steam Deck games? Nope, nein and non.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has released a new PlayStation add called "Live From PS5" that showcases a few of the console's biggest titles, both past and upcoming, in a fictional news segment, and among the clips are two shots that we don't recognize. And they remind us a lot of Uncharted. 
This fictional news segment highlights the efforts of Spider-Man, Kratos, Ratchet and Clank, the Eikons of the upcoming game, Final Fantasy XVI, and more from other games like Gran Turismo 7 and Returnal. However, amidst the clips, there are two shots that show what appears to be a young woman in a mysterious cave holding a torch as she approaches an ancient relic, as first reported by Video Games Chronicle. 
See if you can spot the clips yourself in the Live From PS5 ad below:

But that's precisely what makes Ludipe’s alt-ctrl game Tie Simulator 2020 so wonderfully weird. As many RPS Treehouse members found out at EGX 2022, it's a game that sees you holding your keyboard vertically, and pressing buttons to (sort of) tie your tie onscreen. Now, Ludipe's back with a new co-op sequel called Back Scratching Simulator 2023 where you're once again doing terrible, but brilliant things with a vertical keyboard.

        <updated>2023-01-30T13:03:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo and Illumination have released a new teaser that reveals Mario's famous cat suit as well as more of Seth Rogen's Donkey Kong. 
Released during one of yesterday's big NFL games, this teaser is short and sweet, but it features 10 or so seconds of new footage from The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which hits theaters on April 7. In it, we see Donkey Kong begin to pummel Mario, which is a clip we've seen before, before Mario hits a yellow "?" block. This gives him the cat suit powerup and while it's useful in the game, that doesn't appear to be the case here as Rogen's Donkey Kong begins to make fun of the suit and Mario's reliance on it. 
Check it out for yourself in The Super Mario Bros. Movie clip below: 


As you can see, this is the most Donkey Kong dialogue we have heard in a teaser for The Super Mario Bros. Movie yet, and it reveals that Rogen's character is basically just him, complete with his signature laugh, too. This clip is yet another that looks great and we can't wait for this movie to hit theaters in a few months on April 7. 
For more, check out this trailer from last year that showcases Anya Taylor-Joy's Princess Peach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lara Croft has seen her fair share of live-action adaptations, but this time she’s raiding the small screen with a Tomb Raider TV series and a film in development at Amazon. THR reported that the Emmy-winning Fleabag writer Pheobe Waller-Bridge is set to pen (and executive produce) the upcoming show, though there's no word on who's attached with the film. THR states that Amazon is looking to "build out a connected world of Tomb Raider, with the video game, TV series and film." This sounds a little ambitious, considering that Crytal Dynamics' game is already in production, so we'll have to wait and see how the adaptations interact with the games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last fall, it was announced that the 1997 classic N64 first-person shooter, GoldenEye 007, would arrive on both Xbox and Switch in 2023. Today is that long-awaited day, as one of the most beloved and influential games from its era is available now on both platforms. While these versions are both largely faithful recreations of the seminal console FPS, key differences exist in ways that don't immediately surface one as the clearly superior version. I played a decent chunk of both versions to see which one I prefer to play in 2023.
When GoldenEye 007 launched in the late 1990s, I played it obsessively both solo and with friends for months upon months. During that time, I accomplished all the missions on 00 Agent difficulty, unlocked all the cheats, and played through hundreds (if not thousan…]]></summary>

After 14 years, defunct Usenet provider News-Service Europe has won its long-standing dispute with local anti-piracy group BREIN, which now has to pay €65,000 in legal fees. This is a bittersweet victory for the provider, which continued to fight despite shutting down over a decade ago.

One noticeable standout is the option to receive a warning when something potentially sensitive or disturbing is about to happen during Isaac Clarke’s Necromorph-filled trek around the derelict, deadly USG Ishimura. Players are even able to hide any disturbing scenes, if they want. It’s an interesting option to provide in a full-on horror game.

A hyper-realistic close-up of a character’s face. A weird rat, perhaps. Maybe it’s smoking a cigarette? Whimsical. I love it. This is the main reason why I keep returning to Pizza Tower, a 2D platformer by Tour De Pizza that released on Steam yesterday. It’s a bizarre homage to Nintendo’s lesser-known Wario Land series (specifically its fourth entry) that's jam-packed with goofy little drawings that make me laugh. It’s good, but not without its issues.

What could become Far Cry 7 is reportedly being referred to as Project Blackbird internally at Ubisoft, with the multiplayer game going by the moniker of Project Maverick.

We hope there are some strong surprises.
And we've started two new things! We're breaking the pod into two segments for the foreseeable future, with one half focused on current FPS stuff, and the other on games less-travelled in the space. Our first target? Deer in theHunter: Call Of The Wild.

Forget any thoughts of friendly assistance to rack up a high score though, because this game’s subtitle is Hostile Pinball Action. You can see just how hostile Xenotilt can get by watching the trailer below.
