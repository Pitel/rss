        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frontier justice?
Ever since game fans collectively realised that crunchy polygons were worth getting nostalgic over, PS1-core indie games have been growing into the new pixel art. With Lunistice, one-person shop A Grumpy Fox has delivered a shining example of this modernised lo-fi aesthetic. Sparkling in chaotic but coordinated palettes of technicolor jaggies, it's immediately arresting – and once you start playing, it just gets better and better.
The set-up for this high-speed platforming adventure is something to do with a tanuki called Hana travelling through her dreams to get to the moon. Or whatever. You won’t be sitting through cutscenes in this game – A Grumpy Fox lets the gameplay do the talking. The skeletal narrative is sufficient excuse for playful and imaginative stage designs, ranging from a Japanese-shrine-flying-water-bubble-semi-undersea tropical resort with echos of Sonic Colors to a subdued forest of quiet autumn leaves.

Hello, and welcome to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
Before we get cracking with this week's crawl, let's have a gander at how things went down last time. We took a look at the GBA launch title F-Zero: Maximum Velocity, pitting North America and Europe against Japan. Surprisingly, although the Japanese variant is pretty awesome in its own right, it appears the vast majority of you prefered the more straight forward approach taken for the western design. As such, North America and Europe took the gold with 67% of the vote.

Publisher 3goo is currently gearing up for its rerelease of the cult 2D fighter The Rumble Fish 2 — Launching on PC and console platforms December 8, this release represents the 2005 scrapper's first-ever home appearance on the global market, filling in a long-standing gap for fight fans everywhere.
In order to get newcomers on board with the DIMPS fighter's weirdness, a new trailer spotlights the 13 characters that make up the roster — the titular "Rumble Fish (2)", as it were. These range from your standard bad-boy martial arts experts such as Zen, Lud, and Aran, to bizarre outliers such as child fighter Mito, young scribe Typhon, boxing shark dude Bazoo, and Cheeseburger in paradise-looking MF'er Boyd. Of course, sexy secret agent Sheryl is in the mix as the requisite waifu bait.
Check out the whole gang in the video below. See if you can spot your mains.

The fighter is available as a standard boxed edition for $34.99 USD, while a Collector's Edition, retailing for $64.99, includes an art book, strategy guide, command cards, a CD soundtrack, three additional DLC characters, plus a digital download for the first Rumble Fish release. Currently, this Collector's Edition is the only way to purchase the 2004 original.
The Rumble Fish 2 launches December 8 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All in the family
Something delightfully novel for this week's Arcade Archives entry as Hamster pulls '80s alien blaster Baraduke out of its big bag of Namco games and gives it a fresh release on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Originally released to the coin-op market in 1985, Baraduke, (aka Alien Sector), sees intrepid space explorer Toby "Kissy" Masuo picking her way through a series of claustrophobic interplanetary caverns, taking on an army of gooey aliens and gathering up cute, cycloptic creatures known as "Paccets". Once all of the stage's enemies are destroyed, our hero ventures down a large connecting pipe to confront one of a number of boss guardians, before heading on to the next zone.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Retro Hawk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3zzKZkNdsc
Fascinatingly, despite its relative obscurity, Baraduke predates Nintendo's legendary release Metroid by a full year, though it contains several similarities to the classic NES title. Not only does Baraduke feature a labyrinth of alien-created caverns, linked by a series of metal tubes, but the Namco game also reveals its woman protagonist as a "surprise" at the game's climax, much like the coming of Metroid's Samus Aran.
Baraduke would be followed up by little-known sequel Bakutotsu Kijūtei in 1988, before the franchise effectively ended. Hilariously, in deep Namco lore, it is said that Baraduke protagonist "Kissy" eventually married and divorced Dig Dug protagonist Taizo Hori, with one of the pairing's children being Susumu Hori of Mr. Driller fame! Someone call Kevin Fiege, I want to see a Namco Cinematic Universe!
Baraduke is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Full of Kreeses.
The magical appeal of Cobra Kai as light entertainment is that it’s totally aware of what it is: garbage. It’s Sunset Beach crossed with Saved By The Bell, driven by the one-note parody of Johnny Lawrence being stuck in the '80s. For anyone old enough to remember the original Karate Kid movies, there’s a throwback attraction about its cheesy soap opera amateur theatrics and cyclical plot threads, using the lore of the original films and their rivalries to create an enjoyable junk-food watch.
Cobra Kai 2: Dojos Rising loosely adheres to where the show is at the time of writing, now in its fifth season. With an overarching original plot, you can work your way across all three dojos — Cobra Kai, Miyagi-Do, and Eagle Fang — and take the reigns on their associated characters on different pursuits. In a nice touch, many of the characters are voiced by the show’s actors, lending authenticity to the world of this brawler.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With a "gaming" rocking chair
My Nintendo has been rolling out a fair few prize pack giveaways this year, and just finished out the Rabbids: Sparks of Hope promotion. Now it's onto something new: what Nintendo is calling the "Family Fun Holiday" prize pack.
You know the drill at this point. You can "enter" the contest with a deposit of 10 Platinum Points, with up to three entries (so 30 points in all). If you have points to spare, you may as well throw them into this: especially if they're expiring!
Here are the prizes:
A gaming rocker chair (you choose between Mario, Bowser, Peach, Yoshi, or Luigi)
A 15 inch mega-plush Mushroom
A 1-Up glow in the dark Switch wired controller
A 1-Up glow in the dark Switch case
While many contests tend to be first party games releasing at the time (like Kirby): this one smartly rolls with Nintendo's "fab" Mario squad.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

Zombie Hunter looks like a fake game. You know the opening of No More Heroes III where Travis Touchdown outlines this weird Deathman game, and the gamer part of your brain tells you that such a game couldn’t exist in the time period it’s supposedly from? That’s Zombie Hunter. It tells me it’s from 1987, but doesn’t really tell me it was developed by Lenar. Instead, it just mentions Hi-Score Media Work Corp, which was sued out of existence by Enix over a screenshot of Dragon Quest 2. I know this, because the first thing the game does upon being started is scream at you, “Hai Sukoa!” It was a nice jumpscare to start the game.

That's a lot of UI
Just look at it. Half of the screen in Zombie Hunter is taken up by its HUD. It’s excessive! Then you actually start mo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clever girl(s).
Few franchises captured the minds of children everywhere like the original Jurassic Park film did in 1993; it kicked off an entire dinosaur craze while maintaining much of the novel’s poignant message exploring the perils of genetic engineering. Jurassic World – 2015’s revival starring Mario Chris Pratt – had nowhere near the same impact, though both critics and audiences found it to be a passable popcorn action thriller (and the less said about the other two films in the World trilogy, the better). Originally developed as a VR title for the Oculus Quest and now rejigged and ported to the Nintendo Switch — with the 'Part 2' DLC content included — Jurassic Park Aftermath Collection picks up two years after the events of Jurassic World but takes after the original film thematically.
The opening moments introduce you to the voice of Dr. Amelia ‘Mia’ Everett – you never actually see other humans as all dialogue comes through radio. Taking control of a voiceless security expert named Sam, it isn’t long before the rickety plane you’re on experiences some winged-dinosaur-related issues which cause the pilots to lose control and crash land on the infamous Isla Nublar. Mia, you see, hired you to help her retrieve her life’s work as a geneticist. The crash left her with a shattered leg, holed up in a bunker somewhere. From there, she feeds you information to help save both your lives.

Good morning, friends and witnesses, and welcome to this week's Whatcha Been Playing? May I start out by thanking everybody for their very, very kind birthday wishes last weekend.

Still, I had a delicious donut and watched Sunset Boulevard for the 180th time, so it could have gone a whole lot worse. What really made it special, however, was the kindness shown to me here, in the Qposts, and on Twitter, so thank you.
I hope that your November has gotten off to a rollicking start, and as the year starts wheezing to its conclusion, I hope that November offers up some great memories — gaming or otherwise — to carry you into the coming holiday season. Go out and end this year with …]]></summary>

Trauma is different for everyone affected. It can look different, and the person can wear it differently. He Fucked the Girl Out of Me doesn’t overtly say this but seems to understand trauma like, well, someone who has dealt with it for a long time.
Selected by the International Documentary Film Festival of Amsterdam for their DocLab exhibition, He Fucked the Girl Out of Me is both difficult and important to talk about. Part of the difficulty is it’s an 18+ game with an F-bomb in the title. It gets filed right next to the games about big-breasted androids. Any site that reports on it runs the risk of getting a weird look from the robots that run the internet (breast-size unknown).

I feel like the whole "mini console" craze was custom made just for me. As someone who was alive when these systems were ushering in a new era for video games and a collector: it's just a perfect match.
Nintendo was on a roll there with the NES and SNES "Classics," but after the PlayStation effort, things kind of quieted down. Thankfully, Sega has just given us their second Genesis/Mega Drive mini, and if this iteration is any indication, I wouldn't mind of they kept going.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You had me at "dark fairytale"
With Stardew Valley being one of my most-beloved and most-played games of all time, I am constantly on the hunt for the next game that can scratch my farming/community simulator itch. There have been quite a few that I've written up over the past few months, and the newest title to add to the list of hopeful successors is the sandbox life sim RPG, Kynseed, which has been described as a "Stardew Valley-inspired game with 'dark fairytale' creatures." Yeah, sign me up.
The game has been in early access since November 8, 2018, but it's finally getting its official release on December 6, 2022, as was announced in a newly-dropped release date trailer. Fans who have followed Kynseed all through its development are beyond thrilled to see the game nearing its completed state, as can be seen in the comments sections of its trailers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4rSiixt_Q
The release trailer showcases the usual fare for these kinds of games, like farming, cooking, and fishing, but things really get wild once they dive into the combat. Fighting off monsters looks a lot more intense than the slow-paced combat of Stardew, with more of a strategic, turn-based thing going on. I've really come to appreciate combat mechanics a lot since I had a big Stardew binge a few years ago, so I'll be interested to see how Kynseed's spin on things continues to evolve the simulator genre.
Oh, and did we mention that the developers behind Kynseed are industry veterans from the classic Fable series, now under the new banner of PixelCount Studios. Based on what we know of the game so far, it seems like they've injected this new project with all of the character and whimsy we can expect, so this is definitely one I'm looking forward to checking out on release day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Planetary exploration has never been so chill.
The first Switch Doraemon: Story of Seasons launched in 2019 and was praised for harmoniously combining the cast of the much-loved children's anime with the relaxing gameplay of one of the most well-known farm sim franchises, and while it may not be the most obvious combination, its beautiful art style and pleasant vibes were generally well-received nonetheless. So it's no surprise that its success has led to the release of the sequel, Doraemon Story of Seasons: Friends of the Great Kingdom.
However, there are a lot more life and farm sims on the market these days, and while developer Marvelous will have wanted to maintain the original game's charm, it also needed to present something exciting and new to stop things from feeling repetitive or stale. The original Doraemon Story of Seasons left a few gaps — some room for improvement — which the second is quick to fill, helping to create a similar enchanting experience and preventing a mass of overly familiar content.

Kevin Conroy, the prolific voice actor who portrayed Batman across film, television, and video games, has died after a short battle with cancer. He was 66.
Conroy began his acting career on the stages of New York and San Diego after attending The Julliard School, where he studied alongside Christopher Reeve and roomed with Robin Williams. He performed on Broadway, did Shakespeare, and made the rounds on television, popping up in some of the biggest shows of the '80s. A celebrated actor, it was his command of his voice that would see him hit new professional heights when he was cast as Bruce Wayne/Batman in Batman: The Animated Series.

Nacon has announced the arrival of a new DLC expansion for its robo-revolutionary RPG Steelrising — T Cagliostro's Secrets story expansion is available to purchase now on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X, priced at $14.99. The new gameplay can be accessed once the player has completed the "Bastille" mission.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbfkLMOqw-o
Cagliostro's Secrets throws a little more heavy metal action in the divine Aegis' path. The DLC includes a new area, Hôpital Saint Louis, which features a new questline and several brand new enemies, along with variants on some of Steelrising's already established mechanical nightmares. In addition, the DLC drop adds five new weapons to our girl's arsenal of death, and includes several brand new side-quests that can be found and completed in Steelrising's other districts.
While Steelrising was not quite the gemstone it might have been, I still found it a gorgeous-looking and very challenging adventure, that rose above its budgetary shortcomings thanks to its classy visuals and in-depth combat mechanics. While certainly not for everyone, the ambitious adventure is a sign that, as a developer, Spiders is growing with each successive release, and I hope that a future sequel could really deliver upon the game's compelling premise.
Steelrising is available now on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

Netflix has announced that its upcoming animated series based on the sword 'n' sorcery of Dragon Age will finally make its debut next month — Dragon Age: Absolution will premiere on the streaming service from December 9. The studio also released a brand new trailer to get fans' hype engines in gear.
Set in the lands of Tevinter, Absolution will follow the fable of Miriam, a former elven slave who is forced to throw off her shackles and rise to become the fearsome warrior that she was always destined to be. Across each of the show's six episodes, we will journey with Miriam as she meets a party of noble and ignoble allies, confronting the tragedy of her past and forging a better future for herself, her people, and Tevinter itself. The show will feature the political drama, interpersonal relationships, and epic interspecies warfare that have made BioWare's gaming franchise such an enduring hit with RPG fans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7MZuR8RM48
The six-episode series has been written and produced by showrunner Mairghread Scott, previously responsible for the writing of several animated series within the Marvel Comics, Transformers, and Star Wars universes. Dragon Age: Absolution stars a cast of talented voice actors including Kimberley Brooks Ashley Burch, Phil LaMarr, Matt Mercer, and Sumalee Montano. Hopefully, this fresh dose of olde wurlde action will satiate the fanbase as they wait eagerly for BioWare's to wind up work on the highly anticipated Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, which is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.
Dragon Age: Absolution premieres exclusively on Netflix December 9.

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded episode below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment has announced a new deal with publisher 505 Games to co-develop and market Control 2. The news also provided insight into the sequel's development status. 
According to a press release, Control 2 (once known as Codename Heron) is currently in the concept phase, being built in Remedy’s proprietary Northlight engine. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remedy will publish the PC version while 505 will handle the game’s console releases. Control 2 has no release window, but Remedy did release a piece of concept art, posted below. 
The press release also states that Control 2’s development budget initially sat at 50 million euros. Remedy and 505 will equally split marketing and development costs, as well as revenue generated by its release. Remedy retains full ownership of the Control IP, however. The press release also reveals that the first Control has sold over 3 million copies since launching in 2019. 
“We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together,” say Rami and Raffi Galante, co-CEOs of Digital Bros Group/505 Games. “... Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2.”
This announcement was first teased last June, when Remedy and 505 revealed plans for new triple-A Control experiences. That same update revealed an upcoming multiplayer spin-off title known as Project Condor. Earlier this year, Remedy also struck a deal with Rockstar to develop remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Onions have layers, ogres have layers.
Within the Final Fantasy brand, one of the most famous sub-series is the Ivalice Alliance. Set within the fictional land of Ivalice, the handful of projects that comprised these games were marked by their focus on a more grounded setting that explored the dramatic politics of a magical medieval world. However, before Ivalice came along, its creator—Yasumi Matsuno—originally worked on another unrelated series called Ogre Battle that featured an early version of the setting. Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together on the Super NES was the second release in this series and was largely seen as one of the greatest SRPGs ever made, but it never quite garnered the following many believed it deserved. Now nearly 30 years later, Square Enix has decided to give it another crack at finding a broader audience with Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remake of the PSP remake they made about a decade ago. Though it still shows its age in some ways, Tactics Ogre Reborn does a great job of cleaning up this SRPG classic and presenting it to a new generation.
Tactics Ogre places you in the role of Denam, a Walister teen living under the bootheel of the ruling Galgastani in the wake of a civil war that took place a few decades ago. Sick of living in oppression, Denam ropes his sister and best friend into joining a resistance to overthrow the ruling regime. As more allies join and the resistance escalates into a full-scale war, Denam is tested as he navigates the political and moral landscape while staying true to his original ideals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's the verdict?
Sonic Frontiers was released earlier this week to mixed reviews across the board. The tech experts at Digital Foundry have now had the chance to put the game through its paces (pun very much intended) on the nine different consoles on which it was released so we can now see, from a technical perspective, how the Switch matches up to its competition. In short, not great.
The game has had a number of elements removed from it when compared to the other releases, and the overall product suffers because of it. Action stages look "comparably OK," though the decreased resolution (720p dropping to 480p in handheld) and lighting makes things appear "very blurry" and lacking in detail.

The news broke this morning with BTAS co-star Diane Pershing, who voiced Poison Ivy, posting on Facebook that Conroy had passed yesterday from an illness, later identified as cancer. Warner Bros. has since confirmed the news. 
"Very sad news: our beloved voice of Batman, Kevin Conroy, died yesterday," Pershing writes. "He's been ill for a while but he really put in a lot of time at the cons, to the joy of all of his fans. He will be sorely missed not just by the cast of the series but by his legion of fans all over the world ... RIP, friend."

Pokemon is coming up on its 30th anniversary in 2026, and it's been around for longer than some of you have been alive. I remember vividly when some parents at the time called it a fad: well, who's laughing now? The Pokemon Company, all the way to the bank.
Of course, said company likes to take advantage of that nostalgia at any turn, and that includes a brand new interactive digital gallery of the series. You can find the gallery here. Once you're at the landing page, click or tap "enter," and then the text in the white box after reading the terms of use (the text with the link icon will bring you here, to the terms of use page). Then select "start" at the bottom of the page.
Once you're in, you'll walk through an interactive game of sorts, where you can control a little avatar with a mouse click/tap or the arrow keys. While most of the text is in Japanese, you'll still be able to see dates for releases clearly: as well as installations like the giant Game Boy and the packaging for Pokemon Red and Green. Starters, legendaries, and key Pokemon are part of the exhibit too: and can be clicked on for further investigation (as well as items like the Pokeflute).
It's genius timing, as Scarlet and Violet are going to usher in a brand new generation in just a week.

Netflix has released the first teaser trailer for its upcoming series The Witcher: Blood Origin — The series, which will debut on the streaming service from December 25, will serve as a prequel to its smash-hit show, which is itself upon the books by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski.
The Witcher: Blood Origin is set around 1200 years before the arrival of legendary figures such as Ciri, Yennefer, and, of course, Geralt of Rivia himself, and will tell the story of the fabled "Conjunction of the Spheres", the moment when the worlds of man, elf, and monster first collided, leading to a bold and dangerous new era for man and beast alike. The series will depict the coming of the event, alongside the necessary founding of a legion of beast slayers known as "Witchers".
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ry6HYg3AsHA
The new, four-part series will be headed up by the legendary Michelle Yeoh (Shang-Chi, Everything Everywhere All at Once) as the formidable sword-elf Scian. Yeoh will be joined by Jodie Turner-Smith (Anne Boelyn, True Blood) as the highly-skilled Queen's guard officer Éile, and Laurence O'Fuarain (Game of Thrones, Vikings) as the redemption-seeking warrior Fjall. The cast is rounded out by Mirren Mack, Zach Wyatt, and Jacob-Collins Levy.
The Witcher: Blood Origin will offer up an original story, set within the same universe as the games and original novels but telling a tale of new characters and events. The show will precede the arrival of the fourth season of The Witcher, which will see Liam Hemsworth take up the dual swords of Geralt of Rivia, donning the well-worn scabbard of departing actor Henry Cavill.
The Witcher: Blood Origin premieres December 25 exclusively on Netflix.

Said anomaly fills with new sea creatures from all over the world every time it's visited, and possibly building-sized terror beasts and ancient merfolk, but Cobra's sure it'll all be fine, so in you go, mate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obviously, I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t believe in the pleasurable side of PC hardware. Building a PC (or even just swapping out a component) can be a series of lovely little tactile moments: the peeling-off of plastic wrapping, the K’nex-like click of a graphics card slotting into place, the soft whoosh of the fans on a first successful boot. Great stuff, and of course, that’s all before games start coming out of it. What’s not to like?
Oh, reader, so many things. So many, many things not to like. Gaming PCs are still only computers, after all, and computers break, often and for reasons that may be invisible to the most intensively trained eye. Introduce this volatility to a line of work that involves handling a lot of sometimes heavy, usually expensive equipment, and enjoying those little pleasures will eventually come at a cost. Namely, time spent dealing with arcane troubleshooting practices and the occasional spot of minor personal injury.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graft from the past.
Atari, and its exuberant founder Nolan Bushnell, were 1970s trailblazers who formed, established, and pioneered the video game industry. Brushing a near-century of mechanical coin-operated gaming aside and barging pinball into a dusty corner, Atari became the focal point of bars everywhere with Pong in 1972. It was the dawning of the digital age, and Bushnell and co. were here to make it fun.
Sometimes we’re in danger of forgetting these facts. The Japanese gaming revolution did so much to build on, perfect, and usurp Atari’s initial endeavours — and in such a gloriously innovative fashion — that we tend to focus our retro gaming goggles somewhere between the mid-'80s to late '90s. It is, of course, generational. For those who grew up with them, there’s still an affection for Clive Sinclair and the early PC gaming boom, the Spectrums, the Commodores, and the Amstrad; the CBS Colecovision, the Vectrex, and the Grandstand console. But 50 years on and it’s now Atari’s moment, and it wanted everyone to know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Regaining Control
In something of a subdued revelation, Remedy Entertainment has announced that it is to begin work on a sequel to its mind-warping 2019 action-adventure, Control — Control 2 will be developed as a joint project between Remedy and developer/publisher 505 Games.
"With Control, we leaped into the unknown. We wanted to create something new. Something different and unexpected. A world like no other. Thank you, the audience, for making Control such a success for us," writes game director Mikael Kasurinen on the Remedy Entertainment website.
"With Control 2, we’ll take another leap into the unknown. It’ll be an unexpected journey. It’ll take a while, but to put it mildly, this is the most exciting project I’ve ever worked on. It’s still early days, but it will be worth the wait."

505 Games also spoke of its excitement to work on the reality-breaking new project.
"We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together. Since its launch in 2019, Control has sold over three million copies," said 505 Games co-CEOs Rami and Raffi Galante. "Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2."
While details are non-existent regarding the sequel's narrative, the companies announced that the sequel would be developed for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X, utilizing Remedy’s "Northlight" engine to create its dimension-splitting worlds. Remedy will be charged with publishing duties on console platforms, while 505 Games will handle marketing/release on PC. Control 2 is clearly in its very early concept stages, so it is unlikely that we'll be seeing anything of the project within the coming year.
Control 2 is currently in development at Remedy Entertainment and 505 Games.

The currently unnamed network reportedly serves 900,000 users and reportedly generates millions of euros in monthly profits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Harvestella is a JRPG. This may seem like an incredibly obvious thing to say about a role-playing game from Square-Enix, but it’s the most important thing to know going in. Billed as a life sim RPG, and with a title that evokes farming, you could be forgiven for expecting something along the lines of Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley, but with more monster biffing. Instead, Harvestella sits firmly in the epic quest camp, with your adventuring being supported by your rural activities.
Anyone looking to build a pastoral paradise is going to be sorely disappointed, as the farming elements are somewhat rudimentary. Even calling your property a farm is a bit of a stretch. Even after a few upgrades, my plot is more of a large garden, maybe an allotment, if I’m being generous.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grass, Fire, or Water?
It's great to be back in the wild and messy world of Splatoon — and the residents of Inkopolis are especially excited this weekend, with the coming of a very special splatfest that sees the colorful shooter series crossover with the iconic Pokemon franchise, ahead of the launch of Pokemon Scarlet & Violet.
Kicking off later today, the newest battle royale will charge players with selecting their favorite stater Pokemon — choosing from the holy trinity of Grass, Fire, and Water. Once the player has selected their team of choice, they will engage in a weekend of incredibly sticky online competition — bagging points for their chosen team in a bid to prove which of these is the best Pokemon element of them all...
...That's best starter Pokemon element. We all know that Ghost is the actual best element.
https://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/1589648876046270469?s=20&t=ZNfQlHBDFuJxpdAkcH73EA
Once the ink dries on Sunday, the global scores will be trotted up and the winner announced. All participants will receive fun, in-game items, with bonus goodies going to players on the winning side. The action kicks off today, November 11 at 16:00 PT / 19:00 ET / 00:00 BST with the final whistle being blown at the same times on Sunday, November 13. You can pledge for your team in Inkopolis Square.
As y'all know, I covered pretty much every single splatfest — its topics, commentary, winners, and running score — over the course of Splatoon 2's long lifespan. And, I have to admit, it's just not the same with my girls Pearl & Marina. Still, there is plenty of fun to be had for Squid Kids and Octolings, so get out there and make your mark. Quite literally.
Splatoon 3 is available now on Nintendo Switch. Pokemon Scarlet & Violent launches November 18.

The retro-inspired FPS genre has to be one that’s difficult to stand out in. Back when the genre was fledgling, there were a lot of frontiers to push into, whereas now, most things have been explored. The course many developers have now taken is just to make things more bombastic. Bloodier, explodier, more swear words! All this while reminding you what we lost when the FPS started chasing that Half-Life success.
The problem with this is that the genre’s resurgence has been swamped. I’ve watched groups of trailers and had difficulty telling the difference in some titles. I love retro shooters, but it’s hard to pick one to try when they’re all trying to sell me on the same points. Also, they often release into Early Access.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been eagerly anticipating Pepper Grinder since I saw a series of tweets with GIFs several years ago. It's a pixel platformer in which the protagonist, Pepper, has a drill which she uses to plow through scenery, and a grappling hook for all the moments when she's not underground. It's now been officially announced with Devolver as publisher and there's a reveal trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age: Absolution is coming to Netflix on December 9. A new trailer provides a deeper look into the adult animated series' premise and new heroes. 
The story centers on Miriam, an elven mercenary and former slave tasked with stealing a powerful and dangerous artifact. When the heist goes awry, the situation escalates into a larger fight for survival for Miriam and her friends. Set in Tevinter, the show features an original cast of heroes and, potentially, some old favorites (the characters at 0:45 look a lot like Cassandra and Leliana). Check out the trailer below. 


First announced during Netflix Geeked Week in June, Dragon Age: Absolution’s cast includes Kimberly Brooks (Miriam), Matthew Mercer (Fairbanks), Ashly Burch (Qwydion), Phil Lamarr (Roland), and Josh Keaton (Rezaren). The series consists of six 30-minute episodes. 
Though steeped in Dragon Age lore, it remains to be seen if the show has any connection to the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. Absolution is far from the only video game adaptation Netflix has in the works. The CG-animated Sonic Prime also premieres in December. The streaming giant also announced a live-action Gears of War movie and its own animated series.]]></summary>

Beyond our coverage of Street Fighter 6 in the latest issue of Game Informer, issue 351 also includes a deep dive into Tchia, and the unusual trip where we learned more about the game.  
Tchia is created by the development studio known as Awaceb. Awaceb’s founders grew up in a small French territory east of Australia called New Caledonia, and this debut game from the studio is inspired by their childhood there. I visited New Caledonia in September, and joined the team from Awaceb to learn more about the culture, peoples, and geography that make it such a memorable place.  
Check out the new issue to discover more about the trip and the game.
Our video below features a small part of the lovely Tchia soundtrack alongside glimpses of video taken during the trip, as well as gameplay footage of Tchia.  


Tchia is set to release in early 2023 on PS5, PS4, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dig it!
Publisher Skybound Games has announced a release window for the intriguing and spectacularly silly-looking wrestling RPG WrestleQuest — As reported during yesterday's Nintendo Indie World Showcase, the day-glo grappler will launch on PC and console platforms in May 2023.
As we have previously reported, WrestleQuest is a unique spin on the typical RPG adventure title, as will charge players with taking their custom superstar through the territories in a bid to become the pro-wrestling king of the 1980s. Along the way, the rookie will team with, (or oppose), a who's who of 30 genuine pro-wrestling legends, including "Macho Man" Randy Savage, Koko B. Ware, Jake "The Snake" Roberts, The Road Warriors, Sgt. Slaughter, and Andre the Giant.
Also, Jeff Jarrett is in the mix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtpjlXOviKA
WrestleQuest incorporates fun pixel visuals, as well as a novel "Hasbro figure" look to each of its ring legends. As you can see from the above trailer, matches play out in turn-based fashion, with a wide variety of strikes, holds, throws, and specials available to our roster of ring-rockers. One gal even shows up on a motorbike, which might be considered cheating, all things considered. Another fun moment sees Andre show up to bodyslam the entire ring! Good work, boss.
As the player progresses through their star-spangled career, they will be given the option to customize their wardrobe, gimmick, and entrance to ensure that they become the talk of the town... or at least The Observer. With its tongue firmly stuck in its cheek, and some rad-looking visual design. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing whether this underdog delivers a five-and-a-half star matchup when it finally emerges from the locker room.
Add Bull Nakano and this is going to be my GOTY 2023.
WrestleQuest launches May 2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just keep punching, Apollo...
While Street Fighter 6 is already hoping to on-board new players with its simplified "Modern" control option, Capcom's development team are looking to go one step further, with the addition of an A.I. driven "Dynamic" system, that looks to make even the most rabid button-mashed into a World Warrior.
As demonstrated during an interview with Game Informer, the Street Fighter 6 Dynamic control option will literally ascertain a player's position on screen, and will throw out one of a number of strikes, moves, specials, and supers based on the current mise en scene. Once activated, Dynamic mode will literally allow players to mash attack buttons and have those random presses transformed into useful maneuvers.
You can check out the feature in the video below, courtesy of Game Informer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkRXTVd51dE
Now, of course, while Modern controls already offer up something of a gateway to newer players, Dynamic is truly for beginners, youngsters, and those who just want to smash buttons and hope for the best. It also fits in as another addition to the sequel's impressive list of accessibility options. As such, the mode will be locked to local play only, and will not be a viable option for online matches. It's another fine addition to the overall Street Fighter 6 package, which continues to impress month by month with its myriad modes, options, and attention to the small details.
A Capcom employee once told me that a key goal of the SF6 team was to deliver a game that felt "full" at launch. So far, they're doing a magnificent job at sticking to that idiom.
Street Fighter 6 launches 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. For further reading, check out the 50 things I loved in the beta, the leaked character roster, our Do’s and Do Not Do’s, and our look at specific characters including Guile, Juri, Kimberly, and Jamie & Luke.

With the dust settled on Assassin's Creed Valhalla, here's the five best AC games, having played all of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Network campaign co-op and campaign mission replays are among what's added
I enjoyed Halo Infinite at launch, but there was a lot that was promised that needed to eventually make it in. It seems as if this November update is going to make due on a lot of prior delays.
Here are the main sticking points of the Halo Infinite 2022 November Patch:
Network campaign co-op (four player co-op in the campaign)
Campaign mission replay (this seems like a launch type feature, but it's here now)
More campaign achievements (420 additional Gamerscore)
Forge mode (in beta form)
Season pass progression updates (more of a focus on match XP)
A 30-tier winter battle pass is live
Studio 343 explains that you can play the "entire Halo Infinite campaign together" with up to four players in total, so it doesn't seem like a half-measure. As for the Forge, 343 stresses that it's in beta form: "Halo Infinite Forge mode is currently in a beta state, meaning that additional improvements are planned. The Forge Beta will support canvas maps and not developer-made maps (such as Live Fire, Recharge, Fragmentation, etc.). Support for developer-made maps will be implemented in a future update."
Weirdly, 343 still hasn't figured out battle pass progression yet, and will be implementing a "match XP beta" (what?) on top of the challenge system.
Here's a brief look at the changes to Halo Infinite's XP progression system:
Arena Match Complete: 150 XP
Big Team Battle (BTB) Match Complete: 250 XP
Featured Match Complete: 200 XP
Winning Team: 50 XP
Match MVP: 50 XP
Top 50% of Team: 50 XP
Free-For-All placement

1st: 150 XP
2nd: 100 XP
3rd: 50 XP
4th: 50 XP
5th: 50 XP
If you can believe it, progression systems in live service games that have been in operation for nearly a year need betas.

But, for lack of a nicer way to put it, I’ll simply say things are looking pretty scary out there, huh? Capitalism is failing, the economy is crumbling, and normal people have nothing left to give. It’s something I've been thinking about a lot lately, but I don’t really talk about it. I keep it all inside, like a microwave holding a ball of tin foil while it spins on full power.
At least, that was the case until I played Citizen Sleeper. It’s a rather simple RPG inspired by tabletop roleplaying games, giving you a limited number of action dice that you can spend each day to receive consequences. Mechanically, it doesn’t stretch much further than those actions and consequences, meaning I can instead focus on connecting with characters. In its simplicity, I found a cathartic way to process my thoughts on lots of scary stuff happening in our actual world. I also realised that Starfield, the big space game looming on the horizon which I was previously pretty excited about, just doesn’t seem appealing anymore.

It's now been over a year since A Grumpy Fox first started work on the game, but I think you can agree from the announcement trailer below, it's been time well spent.

The Overwatch team has put in a lot of effort over the past few years to help make the game as enjoyable for players as possible by curbing toxicity, and one of the best moves in that direction was adding endorsements to the game.
Apparently, the mechanic helped curb bad behavior by 40% back in 2019 when they were first added. Originally introduced back in the days of the first Overwatch game, endorsements are a way for players to reward their teammates for good behavior, like good communication, teamwork, or just generally good play. Back in the day, they were broken out into categories like "Shot Caller" or "Good Teammate," but now you get awarded with a simple "Endorsement."

It's impossible to fully convey how cool most of our time at Super Nintendo World was. From the moment we exited the giant warp pipe at the entrance, we felt transported into an actual Mario game.

There are so many moving parts at this point for Stardew Valley, it can be tough to keep track of! Basically, most versions have welcomed the packed 1.5 update a while back: except mobile. But that's still set to change by the end of the year.
Here's the full picture from developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone, recently shared on Twitter:
"Hey everyone, happy 'ween (spirit's eve). I know I haven't been too active lately, but don't worry, I'm still here. And mobile 1.5 update is still on track for what I said last: 'Before the end of the year.' Thank you"

"What they said last" was roughly three months ago: but in this era of constant delays and production issues, it's great to have a more up-to-date window. When asked about progress on Haunted Chocolatier by a fan, Barone reminded folks that they were working on it (citing "yeah a little" when quizzed on whether or not they've been working on spooky in-game ghosts), so there's a lot to be done and micro-manage.
Barone has thankfully fostered a healthy environment of patience, as Stardew Valley fans trust in the process, and recognize Barone's limitations as a mostly solo developer. It's a great place to be, but they've earned that trust.

We are just several weeks into the era of "Elon Musk owns Twitter", and already there are major new issues involving the validation and verification of genuine accounts — Yesterday saw an early example of the chaos to come as fake "Verified" accounts popped up for major gaming companies such as Nintendo, Twitch, and Rockstar Games.
Perhaps the most notable and egregious of these was the "@nintendoofus" account, which simply posted a surprising render of Mario flipping the bird. A simple reply "Mario would never do that :(" added further melancholy humor to the situation. The account itself remains live as of this writing, although its paid-for "verification" tick has been removed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you're strange...
Publisher Ysbryd Games has announced that its creepy, lo-fi RPG World of Horror will finally exit its Early Access status in the summer of 2023 — Soon thereafter, the pointillistic petrifier (oh yes) will receive its long-awaited official launch on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch platforms.
Developed by one-man Polish studio Panstasz, World of Horror is a graphic adventure horror title in the vein of classic DOS and Amiga text adventures such as Personal Nightmare, WaxWorks, and Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, blended with a meticulously itchy aesthetic that blends the horrors of manga artists such as Junji Ito with intricate, but rudimentary, MS Paint visuals. The result is a game that feels like it shouldn't be getting inside your head, but is somehow able to do so. And with relative ease.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr_OEM8zP0k
Set in the town of Shiokawa, Japan, World of Horror follows a young investigator as they follow a series of obscure and bizarre clues, ultimately uncovering evidence of a coming apocalypse, heralded by a platoon of grotesque creatures. The player engages in turn-based combat with these monstrosities in their efforts to seek out the truth about armageddon and, hopefully, discover a way to prevent it.
World of Horror launches summer 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch. It is available in early access now on the Steam platform. You can check out Jordan Devore's thoughts right here.

School me in the comments, please do, but I suspect that Escape Academy: Escape From Anti-Escape Island, new DLC launching for the puzzle game today, might lend my claim some extra weight. That could always be the baggage plummeting from the sky over Anti-Escape Island though, where a summer vacation for the students of Escape Academy has gone very, very wrong.

The atmospheric and critically acclaimed puzzler Inscryption is headed to the Nintendo Switch platform in just a matter of weeks, following on from its warmly received launch on PC and PlayStation platforms. Publisher Devolver Digital announced the news during yesterday's Nintendo Indie World showcase.
Developed by Daniel Mullins Games (of Pony Island and The Hex fame), Inscryption is a skin-crawling creepy puzzle game that blends elements of RPGs, roguelikes, and deckbuilding card games to create a uniquely weird and nightmarish experience. Inscryption masterfully blends these various gaming genres while unfolding its own in-game lore in smart and immersive fashion. In the vein of titles such as Doki Doki Literature Club, Inscryption is a game best experienced, rather than explained.
Inscryption launches on Nintendo Switch December 1. It is available now on PC and PlayStation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say what you will about Square Enix's ill-fated ventures into NFTs and mildly embarrassing follies with live service games recently. Their commitment to remaking, remastering and generally sprucing up their ageing back catalogue from decades past is an admirable one in my eyes, even if they are making you pay through the nose for them almost every single time. As we all know, though, some have made more successful transitions than others. The dream, of course, at least for me, is the Final Fantasy VII Remake approach for literally everything, no matter how unfeasible, impractical or physically impossible that would be for Squeenix's enormous game library. Alas, the reality is often a lot more modest. Best case scenario: you're a 90s SNES game getting a lovely HD-2D makeover like Live A Live. Next on the rung: some added 3D zhuzh a la Final Fantasy VIII Remastered (although even that was by no means perfect). 
Mostly, though, it's your Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster treatment. A welcome update that maintains the look of the originals (albeit with some questionable font choices), but that's more or less your lot. Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remaster of the 2010 PSP remake of the 1995 SNES original, falls squarely into the latter camp, but you know what? That's fine. It's still a rollicking turn-based tactics game all these years later, and one that definitely deserves to be freed from the shackles of Sony's long-dead handheld, where it's lain dormant for the better part of a decade. Besides, I'll take a fully re-orchestrated soundtrack over slightly fancier pixels any day of the week. You know me.

It’s an experimental design to show how controlling limbs centrally can transform the functionality of quadrupedal robots.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Stadia’s impending shutdown in January, Google has begun fulfilling its promise of issuing refunds to its customers. The process started yesterday, and Google has posted an FAQ breaking down how the refund process works. 
As previously announced, Google is refunding all software purchases through the Stadia Store (such as games, DLC, in-game currency, and current pre-orders) and hardware purchases made through the Google Store; physical store purchases cannot be refunded. Eligible hardware includes:
Stadia Controller
Founder's Edition
Premiere Edition
Play and Watch with Google TV packages
Stadia Pro subscriptions will not be refunded, but members can play their Pro titles until the shutdown. However, those who purchased a subscription on or after September 29, 2022, and were charged for it will have that money returned. 
Refunds will be issued to the form of payment used to make the purchase. If that account is no longer available, Google will send an email with instructions for setting up an alternative method of receiving the refund.
Users may have already received an email notifying them of their refund status. Although payments are now being issued, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get yours today or this week. This will be a gradual rollout that will continue up until January 18. There's no way of knowing when you'll receive your refund, so eligible users should keep an eye on their inbox and bank account over the coming days or weeks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a good week for monitor deals, but a lot of what we've looked at has been fairly expensive, from a 42-inch LG OLED for £779 or a 34-inch QD-OLED ultrawide for £943. These are great monitors, don't get me wrong, but you could spend a fraction of the money and still get a brilliant monitor.
That brings us neatly to the subject of this deals post: the Dell S3422DWG, a 34-in ultrawide gaming monitor that sits at the comfortable crossroads of refresh rate and resolution: 3440x1440 and 144Hz. Rather than expensive OLED, this monitor comes with a curved VA panel, offering excellent contrast, great colours and good motion handling, while costing significantly less: just £351 when you use code GSGALLMON10 at the checkout, down from £390.

That technically makes them "cool gaming monitors" and therefore well within my RPS deals duties. Both are now discounted from Crampton & Moore via Ebay, with a 25% off coupon ("FLASH25") that maxes out at a pretty sweet £150 discount. 
That means you can pick up the 42-in for £779 and the 48-in model for £848, both of which are the best prices we've ever seen for these highly recommended TVs.

Gordon claims that Stratton later offered a six-figure amount if he never spoke about the matter, but Gordon insists he turned the money down.

It resides in the Goldilocks Zone of creepiness: just the right amount of creepy to be considered cool, and not quite creepy enough to cause nightmares. There were quite a few things I loved about the game, but none more than that deliciously haunting opening theme that played in the main menu.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love tidying up in games, and I’m not just talking about playing Unpacking and House Flipper, either. Any game I play with an inventory gets a regular, satisfying purge. I’m either marching to an in-game shopkeeper and holding my adventuring sack upside down, or just swiftly frisbeeing items straight into the bin. If it’s cluttering my screen, it’s cluttering my mind. Zero regrets. That’s the gamer dopamine hit I’m chasing.
So, as you might have guessed, I love the idea of A Little To The Left, a game that celebrates neatness and tidiness through a string of fun puzzles. If you love the satisfaction of arranging books on your shelf in order of height, or displaying your mugs in order of which can hold the most tea, then you’ll love this game too. Some simple tidying puzzles would have been enough for me, but A Little To The Left takes the idea in interesting directions through smart puzzle design.

I was lucky enough to review one for several months for Digital Foundry - I think Dell forgot about it for a while - so I consider it my duty to inform you that it is now on sale for the first time ever, dropping from £1099 to £943 - still a big chunk of change, but a fitting Black Friday price for one of the best monitors on the market of any description, hands down.

There’s something about a physical controller, custom built to emulate the action the game revolves around, that lends games a level of credibility you lose the second you try and play it with a regular pad. Playing Guitar Hero with an Xbox 360 controller feels like trying to paint a bedroom wall using a spoon. You’ll get there eventually, but if anyone spots you through a window they’ll rightly assume you’re some kind of deviant.

That's right: Our next issue proudly features Street Fighter 6 on the cover. The cover art, created by designer Goro Tokuda, features one of the original World Warriors, Ken, sporting his new look. Everyone (Capcom included) has seen your memes about Ken's rougher appearance in this game, but we traveled to the studio in Osaka, Japan, to learn more about what's happening with one of the franchise's most iconic characters.
While there, we went hands-on with the game, had extensive conversations with the developers, chatted about the lessons the team took from Street Fighter V's disappointing launch, and even learned about a new way to play Street Fig…]]></summary>

You’d think being lucky enough to actually play the damn thing would have numbed my hyper-fixation about it a touch, but, nope. I’m afraid not. It turns out the guy who owns eight physical copies (and four digital) of the original Resident Evil 4 is still pretty excited to play the remake. Who ever could have predicted this?


The day my preview went live, Capcom showed off a couple of additional bits as part of a hefty Resident Evil showcase. Alongside a fresh story trailer the company also discussed the various gubbins you’ll receive if you fork out for the game's special edition as well as a short gameplay demonstration. Surprising no one, I’ve watched these clips so many times I now have a load of thoughts that are not only completely useless but are taking up vital brain space I usually reserve for things like pin numbers and dates. If I don’t vent all of this garbage out of my skull there’s a chance I’ll forget my Mam’s birthday again, something that genuinely happened once when I was 17 and I haven’t stopped feeling guilty about it since. I bought her a plant from a Tesco Express three days later thinking that would help. It didn’t. This event haunts me more than any Resident Evil jumpscare ever could.

Baba Yaga has been forced to live in the forest having been accused of witchcraft, so it seems like one of those self-fulfilling prophecy deals.
It's a very brightly coloured, fantastical world, this forest you live in, and you're dropped in media res. I thought that hands-on preview I got would be quite a casual gadabout talking to a cute dragon and what have you, but in fact it was difficult, and weird, and very opaque in the best way. The res in question included treasure chests with teeth and talking pine-cone spirits, and exploding fireflies. But you're an archer, too, and I really, really hate using arrows in first-person, and I don't think that will change.

You can interpret “full premium release” to mean an actual game that costs $70, or an expansion packaged and sold during the ritually observed Call Of Duty release window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How To Say Goodbye starts with someone dying. It’s not shocking or distressing; quite the opposite. The person died in a hospital bed surrounded by their closest friends and family, and after they've passed on the group begins to share stories and memories from when they were alive. Death isn’t always this calm and it isn’t always this peaceful, but on rare occasions it can be. 
This is how developers Florian Veltman and Baptiste Portefaix have approached death in How To Say Goodbye, a cosy game that explores the topic with kindness and sensitivity. With its paper doll illustrations and pastel colour palette, it kinda feels like a children's pop-up book that teaches kids about grief. It’s not overly sweet or patronising, just a gentle game about a group of ghosts who discover how to mourn, how to accept their own death, and how to move on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re a Mass Effect aficionado then you’d definitely have been aware that yesterday was the annual N7 Day celebration of the series. You probably also noticed that BioWare shared some concept art of an in-construction mass relay from the next Mass Effect game, along with a snippet of jumbled audio for people to download. Enterprising Shepard stans set to work cleaning up the noise to see if anything meaningful was held within and, lo and behold, there was a short message from everyone’s favourite asari scientist Liara T’Soni.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic Frontiers is available now, marking a new era for the iconic Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. While much of the 3D action remains intact through Sonic Frontiers, the arena in which much of that action takes place is a massive departure. The open-zone setup gives players large areas in which to run, fight, and explore, but the game also presents players with linear Cyber Space stages that veer much closer to the action levels players are used to. With so much to do in Sonic Frontiers (I spent more than 30 hours clearing as much as I could off the map), I wanted to give players some tips to help them squeeze the most fun out of the Blue Blur's enjoyment.

Even after seeing credits, players are left in an uncomfortable but memorable state of mind that defies clear explanation. To try and develop some context, we spoke with the game's director, Ebb Software's Ljubomir Peklar, via e-mail to try and get some more insight into the bizarre experience. Unsurprisingly, much is meant to be left to the players' imagination, but Peklar did offer some details, like how it managed to create something so abstract, some of the incidental imagery that occurred, and the best movie from the Aliens franchise.

The streaming giant revealed the news in a tweet that's light on details but states it's partnering with Gears developer The Coalition. Based on the tweet's wording, it sounds like the animated show will come after the movie's release. It may not stop there, as Netflix also says there's “potential for more stories to follow!”

The last NFL Blitz was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in January 2012. Even then, it was considered a retro revival title developed by Madden studio EA Tiburon. Before that, we hadn't received a proper NFL-licensed Blitz title since Midway's NFL Blitz 20-03 on PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance. Despite EA Sports acquiring the license from Midway during its 2009 liquidation, the NFL has largely seemed averse to the hard-hitting arcade-style gameplay of the Blitz series.

But to pass it off as dull and basic is to do the game a disservice, as it's more refined than basically any of its competitors.

These systems are reportedly very good but that's making Russia nervous. Western anti-piracy companies dominate the market and at least in theory, could black out TV sets all over the country. A second scenario has Russia equally worried - free premium TV for all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Dungeons & Dragons RPG grew out of a connection to miniature wargames, so it’s little surprise that the DNA of tactical tabletop play has remained bound to the long-running franchise ever since. The current edition of D&D supports tremendous flexibility in playing out combat how you like, including through tabletop miniature play, allowing big battles to flow out from ongoing campaign storylines in your weekly sessions. However, perhaps your group is more into combat than interconnected storylines. Or, more likely, you sometimes just want a break from the campaign planning to have a focused evening of combat. If that’s the case, WizKids’ new Dungeons & Dragons: Onslaught game should be on your radar.

Other favourite examples of mine include last year's Boyfriend Dungeon (a dating sim and dungeon crawler), Max Gentlemen: Sexy Business (a dating and business sim), and HuniePop (a dating sim and match-3 puzzle game). Monster Prom is a dating sim and competitive multiplayer party game, where up to four players vie to romance attractive monsters and invite them to the school dance.

RimWorld is the more direct influence, really. Instead of a planet's surface, your little blobby torso people are stuck on a spaceship, which you need to rebuild around them using a fleet of robots as they gradually wake up from stasis. If you know the genre well, it will be reminiscent of several games, but its balance of survival, management, and creative building makes for a refreshingly forgiving experience at the current default settings.

Kaye’s nonchalant accent seems like a great fit, as you’ll see in the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been an interesting exercise playing Triangle Strategy and Tactics Ogre: Reborn in quick succession lately. I've now played both Square Enix strategy RPGs for around six hours apiece now - starting with Tactics Ogre for my preview the other week, and following it up with a Triangle-shaped chaser. I didn't have any history with either game before now, but it's become increasingly apparent that they're effectively cut from the same tile-based cloth. And I mean, exactly the same. They're so similar, in fact, that it's kinda hilarious Square are releasing them so close together on PC, with Tactics Ogre's release on November 11th following little more than a month after Triangle Strategy. 
At the same time, though, their approach to story-telling couldn't be more different, and comparing and contrasting them like this one after the other has been both fun and enlightening. Triangle Strategy, for example, is about 80% cutscene, 20% fighting for its first six hours, while Tactics Ogre is pretty much the opposite. And yet… I think I sort of prefer Triangle Strategy? Let me explain.

A PS5 demo came out and I only got to spend all of five minutes with it before life got in the way. I never got to truly taste the jam, which was quite sad. So, colour me very excited when I got to spend a good couple of hours battling through two short hands-on demos. I got battered by a big pig, prickled to death by a massive porcupine, and aggressively mauled by a large tiger. And I'd say I had a whale of a time. There was no killer whale in the demo, but I wouldn't count it out for the full release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[God of War Ragnarok is out next week and ahead of the game's release, developer Santa Monica Studio has revealed more than 70 accessibility features in the game. 
PlayStation has been pushing the importance of accessibility in gaming more and more with each new release and Ragnarok is no different. The studio has been quite open with its accessibility desires, detailing more than 60 in a blog post earlier this year. Now, with the game out on November 9, the studio has released an even more detailed post breaking down exactly what to expect. 


Santa Monica Studio says there are more than 70 features in Ragnarok that "enable players to customize the gameplay experience to suit their needs" and the list is a sight to behold. It includes plenty of presets, too, which could make it easier for players to easily get the game started in a way that makes the experience better for them. Presets include one for vision accessibility, hearing accessibility, motion reduction, apply motor accessibility, and a changed setting indicator as well. 
There are alternative control schemes, remappable buttons, hold and press options, in-game assistance settings, and so much more. If you're interested in what accessibility features are in Ragnarok, be sure to check out the full blog post. 
For more, read Game Informer's God of War Ragnarok review and then check out all of the performance and quality modes for the game. 
Which accessibility features do you find most helpful in games? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The composer for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Sarah Schachner, has revealed that she has parted ways with the game and the free-to-play battle royale Call of Duty: Warzone (and likely the upcoming Warzone 2). As for why, she says the working dynamic with the game's audio director has become difficult and she sees no path forward. Variety reports that the audio director in question is Stephen Miller but Schachner doesn't name this person in her announcement. 
News of her departure comes from a statement released by Schachner on Twitter on November 3, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Schachner's departure comes after years of work with Modern Warfare II studio Infinity Ward on games like 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and 2016's Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Other credits include Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Anthem, as noted by VGC. 
"I am sad to say I can no longer continue to compose music for MWII/Warzone," her statement reads. "Over the past couple of months, the working dynamic with the audio director has become increasingly challenging and I don't see any path forward. As of now, I am unsure of the status and release plan for the soundtrack as it's been taken out of my hands. While I don't have any control over how the music is presented in-game, what will be released on the soundtrack is not my artistic intent in regards to mixing and mastering." 
She then thanks fans for their support and gives some shout outs to others involved with the game's score, including mixer Frank Wolf, "creative vision" Mike Dean, and performing artists including Baseck, Brain Mantia, and M.B. Gordy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We finally have AMD’s answer to the Nvida RTX 40 series: the Radeon RX 7900 XT and Radeon RX 7900 XTX, the red team’s first graphics cards build on the RDNA 3 architecture. These are both high-end GPUs, set to cost $899 and $999 respectively when they release on December 13th, but you’ll note those prices are oodles cheaper than the £1269 / $1199 RTX 4080 and the £1679 / $1599 RTX 4090.
They’re also structurally distinct from the current Radeon RX 6000 cards to an extent that, frankly, is quite surprising to see from AMD GPUs. RDNA 3 uses a Ryzen CPU-inspired chiplet design, where the GPU is split up into different sections, and the new media engine is engineered for the 4K gaming monitors of the future as much as it is for current PC hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has rolled out its post-launch content roadmap for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Owners of the game’s season pass, whether purchased separately for $29.99 or bundled in the game’s $89.99 Gold Edition, have three big adventures aimed at keeping them glued to the game throughout 2023. 
It all kicks off early next year with the first expansion, Tower of Doooom (their spelling, not mine). This introduces a new combat mode where the team must fight their way up Madame Bwahstrella’s multi-story tower to rescue Spawny, the visor-rocking Rabbid from Kingdom Battle. What’s important to note is that Tower of Doooom will be exclusive to the season pass, meaning you’ll be unable to purchase it separately. 
The second untitled DLC arrives in mid-2023. So far, we only know it takes players to a new planet, features never-before-seen enemies, allies, and secrets, and stars a new antagonist. Finally, Rayman crashes the party in the final expansion to close out the year. Ubisoft’s limbless hero joins Rabbid Peach and Rabbid Mario on a separate adventure in a new location. Unlike Tower of Doooom, the second and third expansions can be purchased a la carte. 
I enjoyed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope quite a bit, awarding it a 9 out of 10. In my review, which you can read here, I wrote that the game “builds upon Kingdom Battle’s foundation with smart tweaks and fun additions to emerge as a better game in every way.”]]></summary>

Not long after the reveal, speculation that Abandoned was actually a Silent Hill game secretly in development began to ramp up, but studio head Hasan Kahraman took to Twitter to shut down those rumors.
From there, the speculation train arrived at the idea that famed Metal Gear Solid developer Kojima was attached to the game. Some believed that Kojima actually was Kahraman on the basis that both their first names start with "H" and both their last names start with "K."

To call the 2018 God of War a sequel almost does it a disservice. Yes, it was a continuation of Kratos’ original multi-game journey, but it placed him and a new family in a foreign world to reflect on his past and try to secure his future. Kratos’ journey to connect to his son while battling a new legion of distrustful gods was a revelation in both video game storytelling and action, setting a high bar for the inevitable sequel. Ragnarök may lack the unique impact of the prior game, but everything that worked so well the…]]></summary>

Without spoiling the ending of Village, the story left off in a way that created some big, interesting questions about the future of Resident Evil. From its beginning, the series has never claimed a singular protagonist, but moving forward, it seemed Ethan’s daughter Rose was going to be an important character to the franchise and whatever narrative direction a potential Resident Evil IX might follow. The Shadows of Rose DLC offers the first chance to play as Rose while filling in a small story gap that arguably did not need filling. Even with a somewhat benign…]]></summary>

I don’t envy the developers of puzzle games. They have to create puzzles formidable enough to be challenging and exciting, but not so much that the player feels more burdened than empowered. The best walk that line almost perfectly, and The Entropy Centre is chock full of them. But The Entropy Centre is more than its brain teasers, and it’s that “more” where the game hits its stumbling blocks. Despite that, its core design is unlike anything I’ve ever played, and genre enthusiasts will find that this game be…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atomic Heart, the BioShock-esque shooter set in an alternate reality's Soviet Union, will be released this February. 
More specifically, the game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21, 2023. Developer Mundfish and publisher Focus Entertainment announced this news in a new and bloody gameplay trailer showcasing more of what to expect in the game early next year. 
Check out the Atomic Heart release date trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Atomic Heart continues to look great in trailers and I can't wait to finally go hands-on with it in just four months, especially as a fan of BioShock. While Atomic Heart is doing its own thing, it's hard not to compare it to the BioShock series given the whole alternate reality thing, the types of guns on display here, the enemies we'll be facing, and the hand-controlled powers. 
Atomic Heart was revealed years ago, and there are plenty more trailers to watch if you're interested. Check out this 2020 gameplay trailer for an early look at the game, and then watch this 2021 trailer for a look at the creepier side of Atomic Heart. Find out why it's one of our most anticipated horror games after that, and then watch this action-packed combat trailer from earlier this summer. 
For additional information about Atomic Heart, be sure to check out Mundfish's official website, where there's info about the game's different editions available for preorder and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a Bloomberg report, video game publisher Embracer has shut down Onoma, the studio formerly known as Square Enix Montreal, just months after its acquisition. Some staff will be transferred to Eidos Montreal, another studio owned by Embracer. This news comes just a few weeks after Onoma underwent a rebranding process where it adopted the new name.
Onoma was best known for its work on the Go series, turn-based spin-offs of popular Eidos Interactive titles designed for mobile. This includes Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go, and Deus Ex Go. Their most recent work was Tomb Raider Reloaded, which came to mobile devices earlier this year, and their future plans involved a title based on Avatar: The Last Airbender.
Earlier this year, Onoma was just one part of a much larger series of Embracer’s acquisitions, which included Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. In August, Embracer proceeded to acquire Limited Run Games, Tripwire Interactive, Tuxedo Labs, the IP rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and several more studios.
The Bloomberg report also says that the closure is part of a cost-cutting initiative, and that Eidos Montreal will have projects scaled back and cut as well. Some of these resources will be redirected to assist in the development of a game in the Fable franchise, led by Playground Games.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is a very unpleasant game. Like every Call of Duty game, the majority of time spent playing involves either killing or being killed in horrendous ways, for one thing, and there’s a natural revulsion that comes from seeing so many gouts of blood shooting from bodies or the ragged slump of newly lifeless human corpses piled up in a doorway. And yet, the surface-level hideousness of its parade of death might not be so notably ugly if it wasn't for Modern Warfare II's cast of c…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The official Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel has uploaded an animated short titled “Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Divergence.” Starring Knuckles, the short reveals how he wound up on the island players explore in Sonic Frontiers. You can watch the six-minute animation in its entirety below.


In the trailer, Knuckles provides a voice-over explanation of his background up until now, including the fact that he was tasked with guarding the Master Emerald, a relic that hasn’t appeared in the Sonic series for quite some time. The trailer ends with Knuckles absolutely demolishing some robots, and while we’ve received no indication that he will be playable in Sonic Frontiers, that sequence makes me hope he will be.
Knuckles has been a core Sonic character for most of the franchise’s existence, so it’s not surprising that he’s making an appearance in the blue blur’s latest adventure. While this animated prologue gives us insight into how he wound up on the island, it’s still not entirely clear why, especially when it comes to the appearance of Sage (a new character introduced in Sonic Frontiers) at the end of the trailer. We’ll have to wait for the full game to find out.
The past month has been full of Sonic news. We got a December 14 release date for Sonic Prime, Sonic Frontiers got a trailer confirming Super Sonic would be playable in the game, and we learned that the Sonic series has sold over 1.5 billion copies worldwide. For more Sonic news, check out our cover story from earlier this year, and stay tuned for more Sonic Frontiers coverage when the game releases on November 8.]]></summary>

That's because its release is set for sometime this year, and given there are only two months left in 2022, it sounds like we won't have to wait too long to check it out. 
Outer Terror's inspirations are clear from the jump: pulpy horror comics and B-movie horror from the 1980s and 1990s with a dash of arcade fun thrown in for good measure. In the game, you'll choose from one of 10 survivors to control, each with their own unique weapons and skills, to face off against waves of enemies. You can play by yourself, but you can also team up with a friend via two-player co-op.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spry Fox, the developer of games like Cozy Grove and Alphabears, is joining Netflix games to become the company’s sixth in-house game studio. The news was announced through a blog post on the Spry Fox website, which also answers some questions about the future of the studio.
Spry Fox says the partnership will not change any of their upcoming plans, meaning that Cozy Grove 2 and their unnamed non-violent MMO will still be developed as planned. Instead, Netflix will provide them with financial support, which Spry Fox says will allow them to “stop stressing” about how their games will generate profit. Despite all of Netflix’s current games existing through their mobile app, the blog post does not mention anything about platform exclusivity.
Spry Fox joins five other in-house game developers at Netflix: Next Games (Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales), Night School Studio (Oxenfree), Boss Fight Entertainment (Dungeon Boss), and two internal studios in Helsinki, Finland and southern California.
Netflix launched its games collection just over a year ago, in November of 2021. Currently, subscribers can play over 30 games on their mobile app, including Into the Breach, Spiritfarer, and Poinpy. On top of that, Netflix has over 50 more games in development. Have you had a chance to play any games on the Netflix app? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Electronic Arts' Motive Studios announced its Iron Man game in September, we learned it would be the first of a multi-game deal between the publisher and Marvel. That was a vaguely defined arrangement at the time, but we now know the partnership will produce a minimum of three titles.
EA announced the news in a press release, with the publisher describing it as a “long-term” deal that could extend beyond three games based on the wording. The release also specifies these titles will be action-adventure games for consoles and PC, each featuring original stories in the Marvel universe. 
It's worth clarifying that EA is not getting exclusive rights to Marvel like it had with Star Wars. There are multiple Marvel games in the works at various studios, including the recently announced Captain America/Black Panther game from Amy Hennig’s Skydance New Media. 
“We have been long-time fans of Marvel and their impressive leadership, so this is a remarkable moment for our developers as well as our players and fans,” said EA COO Laura Miele. “We look forward to welcoming Marvel into the EA family of creators and know this collaboration will produce exceptional experiences for our players. We can’t wait to see players' reactions when they suit up as Iron Man and do the extraordinary things this Super Hero is known for.”
We’re curious to learn what other Marvel projects are on the docket and which EA studios are behind them. Motive’s Iron Man, a single-player third-person action game, is currently in pre-production, so it’s a long way from release (the team is also making the Dead Space remake). What heroes would you like to see EA tackle, and which studio do you want to see bring them to life? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>
