        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fasten your seatbelts.
Being a fan of sports games can be a tricky business. AAA publishers roll out the same full-price titles year-on-year with fewer improvements and added pay-to-win incentives, all bundled up in a package that is regularly less-than-optimal on Switch. Fortunately, in the darkest of days, the indie scene is there to illuminate us.
In recent years, the Switch eShop has blossomed with indie sports titles, offering a different experience to the big leagues of FIFA EA Sports FC or NBA 2K by instead focusing on the fun of the game. Deep in the mix of the sports genre's arcade rebirth is New Star Games, a team determined to bring an accessible twist to an often mechanic-filled playing field.

Super Smash Bros. Melee is 23 years old later this year, which is ridiculous to think about.

And when did you notice that, on page 48, of the manual, the date 02.01.24 is written down?
Yep, yesterday's date — 1st February 2024 — is written on page 48 of the North American manual for Super Smash Bros. Melee. We checked our UK copy to make sure, but the manual here is only 45 pages!

Don't get me wrong - I'm still very much looking forward to continuing my journey through the Helion System in the follow-up to 2022's exquisite sci-fi RPG, but when developer Jump Over The Age first announced it last June, I got the sense it would take quite a bit longer than the next 12 months to come out. Now, Jump Over The Age has confirmed that, yep, "there's around a year left of development" to go on the game, putting its release firmly into 2025 territory.

Thieves have broken into a San Jose, California store called Tofu’s Trading and made off with 35,000 Pokémon Trading Cards along with the store's cash register, as reported by ACE7 News (via The Guardian).
Though the thieves missed an opportunity to dress up as Team Rocket, they did manage to get in and out of the store within minutes before the police were able to apprehend them. That said, although they did bag a whole bunch of Pokémon cards, they missed out on what we assume would have been quite a lucrative find: a special collection of cards released once per year that was due to launch just two days after the break-in.

Speaking to Patricia Hernandez for The Guardian, Bowser — who owes Nintendo $14.5 million in fines after pleading guilty to fraud in connection with Team Xecuter, a hacking group responsible for producing mod chips and other devices that enable piracy on Switch and other platforms — talks about several aspects of his life now, including the impact of his incarceration on his health issues and how he assumes he will have to turn to food support surfaces in the future.

One early game quest sees players tasked with getting her 3 Jack Frost Dolls. It's one of the breezier quests and can be completed within a few minutes of beginning it.

How to find Jack Frost Dolls


The fastest and easiest way of getting them is just outside the arcade in Paulownia Mall. In front of it is a claw machine and a notable prize inside are Jack Frost Dolls. Depending on the day players check out the claw machine the prize is a Ganesha Bank or one of these dolls based on the Shin Megami Tensei franchise mascot. From what I've seen, the claw machine has the Jack Frost Dolls on most days, so check back the next day if they're not the prize. 


On the days they are, you can either play once for 200 yen or select another option to play until you win. Since 200 yen is a minuscule amount in Persona 3 Reload and real life, it's easiest to take an option to speed through the process even if it costs more money. 


Give the Jack Frost Dolls to Elizabeth once you have them, and that's it! Even when in Persona 3's opening hours, the protagonist should have the funds to complete this quest. The reward is a pair of Jack's Gloves for Akihiko, an excellent weapon that far outweighs what you paid to get it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A staple of turn-based RPGs is being able to control your party members. When a playable character's turn comes up, the player chooses what they do based on their skills. This might seem unnecessary to explain, but the original Persona 3 was an exception to this rule. 


Assuming Direct Control


In Persona 3 Reload, you can control your entire party or allow them to make their own decisions. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


Although previous installments allowed direct control, the franchise's soft reboot instead relied on giving CPU-controlled team members basic tactics. Direct control over party members were introduced again in Persona 4 and then Persona 3 Portable on the PSP. With a remake of the base Persona 3 called Persona 3 Reload coming out, this raises the unusual question of whether it allows players direct control over party members. 


Thankfully, this is the case, being a nice carryover from the original's sequels. Automating party members is still possible, but most players will likely be most comfortable with direct control. 


So, what else is new? 


Screenshot by Destructoid


There's quite a bit different, but it's a toss-up of what the remake is changing from the original. While direct party member control and some gameplay features from Persona 5 carry over alongside some new mechanics, Persona 3 Reload leaves some head-scratching details alone. 


Most content from Persona 3 re-releases is absent from the remake. This is largely swathes of story content including the female protagonist route and The Answer epilogue. As far as combat is concerned, it's more in line with later Persona titles, offering a snappiness that many turn-based titles don't share.

Macca’s all-new Chocolate Soft Serve is shaking up summer. To mark the occasion, Team PWR are putting their Fortnite speed skills to the test. If you think you’ve got what it takes to beat the Macca’s ChocClock, show us your best two-minute Fortnite challenge and you can win an armful of PWR merchandise. Just try not to get any soft serve on it. 


Summer doesn’t have to be vanilla. If you’re feeling the heat, head to your nearest Macca’s to get your favorite McFlurry, cone, or sundae in delicious chocolate soft serve. That’s something worth celebrating, which is why Macca’s has teamed up with PWR for the #MaccasRaceTheChoc speedrun challenge. Team PWR’s Lachlan has devised a special Fortnite challenge for teammates Bananahead, Vindooly, Overstrand, and Chanzes. You can bet he didn’t let them off easy! See it for yourselves in the video below.




Now that you’ve seen Team PWR in action against the Choc Clock, you have the chance to win prizes by cooking up a challenge of your own! Think you’re as good Team PWR, or maybe even better? Post your own video with the #MaccasRaceTheChoc and if PWR picks you as one of two winners, you’ll get an official PWR t-shirt, hoodie, mouse mat, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have plans for Valentine's Day, they better be with a fire-breathing boar. That's who you'll be tangoing with in two weeks, because Castlevania-inspired action game Lords of Exile finally has a launch date set for February 14, 2024.


It's been a while since we took a look at Lords of Exile, which initially smashed its relatively modest Kickstarter goal to the tune of 258% funding back in June 2020. Naturally, it grew into a more ambitious project in the months that followed, moving it well past the launch window they originally had in mind. As a result, it all looks pretty different from the earlier crowdfunding trailer, particularly when it shows the powers you can summon to aid you.


Look, I'm just saying, if any video game had the elevator pitch of "Castlevania with JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Stands," I'd be in before the exclamation point dropped. 




Also, is this the same boar from before? Talk about a glow-up!

Beyond any Stand-like shenanigans—referred to as Shadows in the game's menu—Lords of Exile appears to pride itself on its simplicity. It even goes so far as to include "linear level design" as a selling point, really driving home what makes classic side-scrollers so easy to go back to time and time again. The pacing is also in line with the classic 'Vanias, as our stalwart hero plods along at a snail's pace in between leaps and slashes. 


When done right, these throwback adventures can be just as memorable as the inspirations behind them. Look at the Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon games, for instance, or (hopefully) the upcoming The Transylvania Adventure of Simon Quest. Where Lords of Exile slides into the lineup remains to be seen, so we'll keep an eye on it as it heads to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC. In the meantime, you can try out a demo on Steam right now.

Sonic Mania is widely regarded as one of the blue blur’s best games. More than six years after its 2017 release, that sentiment remains as strong as ever, even after recent outings like 2022’s Sonic Frontiers and this year’s Sonic Superstars. While published by Sega, longtime Sonic fans who grew up playing the series, like Christian Whitehead, Hunter Bridges, Dave Padilla, Brad Flick, Tom Fry, and others, led the game’s development. And without speculating too much, the degree of separation afforded to these fans-turned-developers allowed Sonic Mania to feel l…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was just yesterday that I was espousing the benefits of the newly released Ryzen 7 5700X3D processor - a cutback version of legendary 5800X3D that breathes new life and exceptional gaming performance into classic Ryzen 1000, 2000, 3000 and 5000 systems. I was thrilled to see the 5700X3D debut at £233 at Amazon - before stocks were exhausted and it went back up to £240, anyway. 
Now though, the faster 5800X3D has dropped to nearly the same price, just £234 - an even better deal given its higher clock speeds and (very marginally) faster performance. If you're still running an older Ryzen processor and your motherboard can be updated to support the 5800X3D, then I highly recommend this processor, especially if you're using a comparatively low-res 1080p or 1440p display as you're more likely to be CPU-limited at these resolutions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out of everyone in my circles, I feel like the only person left who hasn't beaten Baldur's Gate 3. The FOMO of missing out on everyone's new favorite toy isn't something that typically compels me, but god  — it's like I don't make a dent in exploring Faerûn. I know why; I don't want to admit this, but at some point, I've got to stop picking up every bone, rotten basket, and fork I find. 


Okay, in my defense, it's not that bad anymore. I stopped picking up hoards of goblin garbage at the end of Act I, though not of my own volition. After approaching the 80 to 90-hour mark  — that's shaving off a generous Early Access estimate  — a friend watching me stream over Discord gently prodded me in the right direction: "Christ, Andrea, you know you don't need an inventory of broken lutes?"

Aksys Games is bringing Falcom's action RPG Tokyo Xanadu eX+ to Switch in June 2024. The publisher announced this during today's All Aksys event, which was streamed on Twitch.
Tokyo Xanadu eX+ is an enhanced version of the PS Vita RPG Tokyo Xanadu, which was released back in 2015. Taking place in an alternate reality of Tokyo, which was hit by an earthquake in 2005, the city has only just recovered from the devastation. However, things aren't as calm as they seem, as high school student Kou Tokisaka soon discovers. Kou is sucked into another world called 'Eclipse' and he eventually teams up with classmate Asuka Hiiragi to seal the eclipse vortexes.

The PS5-exclusive adventure follows a troubled teenager named Anita as she searches for her friend Maya in a decidedly not-okay apartment building. From the first-person perspective to psychological tricks and an oppressive atmosphere, The Short Message sports heavy P.T. vibes. If that sounds too terrifying, or if you don't own a PS5, you can watch me play the brief adventure from start to finish in this archived live stream.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dig back far enough into the history of any word and you'll find something sinister. Take "cute". Nowadays it means pretty, lovable or charming, albeit perhaps with an undertone of mistrust or contempt, as in the phrase "that's a cute observation, Edwin". But the word originally evolved from "acute", which very broadly means sharp or intense. "Acute" was once a Middle English word for a short-lived fever - it's related to "ague", a word you've likely come across in a medieval fantasy RPG somewhere, which refers to fits of sweating and shivering. The word "cute", then, is secretly diseased, and so, perhaps, is the experience of cuteness. There's a psychological phenomenon called "cute aggression" which refers to the desire to physically envelop, dominate and even abuse the thing you find cute - "I just want to squeeze you till you pop".

Launching on February 9, this version includes the base game, Separate Ways, and the Extra DLC pack (previously only available in the Deluxe Edition) of character skins, weapons, and items. Of course, The Mercenaries mode serves as free DLC. The price is unknown at the time of publishing, but if you haven't picked up the game on console, PC, iOS, or PS VR2, this looks to be a good way to get everything in one neat package.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you’re not feeling adequately rewarded while playing 2021’s existentially devastating FPS Cruelty Squad, achievements have been added to Steam that will tell you what a good job you’re doing.


If you’re unfamiliar, Cruelty Squad is jank pop royalty. It’s a grotesque and offensive-looking game where you play as a corporate mercenary carrying out assassinations in a world ruled by sinfully immoral rich people. What makes this different from real life, however, is that it’s maybe the future, and you can wear meat armor. Better yet, the meat armor works after a patch last March, but it didn’t when I initially played it.

Now, achievements will be doled out for your insignificant progress. “I added achievements. You can suggest new ones to add here, I will not add them but you can do that,” said developer Consumer Softproducts on the Steam community page. 


Furthermore, the game’s overlord suggests that the achievements are only awarded “for completing each of the levels,” but if there’s one thing I know about the developer, it’s that you can’t entirely take what you say at face value. All the achievements are hidden, so I can’t tell you if it’s true. Knowing Consumer Softproducts, there is probably one in there with an extremely painful or impossible objective. However, they say, “I honestly just couldn't be bothered figuring out how they work,” which, I don’t know, could be entirely true.


Adding achievements to a game is never a bad thing, but I dunno. When Cruelty Squad does it, it feels like it's insulting me.


Cruelty Squad is available for PC right now. It’s actually on sale right now, so you should buy it. As a reminder, the next game by Consumer Softproducts, Psycho Patrol R, is ready for your wishlist. I don't know if you should buy that yet, but my instincts tell me maybe.

However, having now played the first 30 minutes of Tales Of Kenzera thanks to its just-released early Steam Next Fest demo, I have seen the error of my ways. The demo might only cover the game's opening, but this 2.5D Metroidvania already looks to be quite the promising newcomer in this ever-crowded genre - so much so that it may even be able to go toe to toe with Ubisoft's Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown. Yep, I went there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inkle, the developers behind Overboard, Heaven’s Vault, 80 Days, and Highland Song, have released their next game, The Forever Labyrinth, in collaboration with Google Arts. You can play it right now.


Billed as a run-based narrative game, The Forever Labyrinth will have you diving into a variety of paintings. But unlike Super Mario 64 where you then harass the wildlife, you’ll instead solve mysteries. You enter the eponymous labyrinth looking for your friend, Professor Sheldrake, then find yourself trapped in a series of strange rooms with paintings hanging. Obviously, that’s not where you want to be, so the goal is to try and find your way out.




The game is built on InkJS, a Javascript port of Inkle’s Ink scripting language that allows it to run in browsers. It also utilizes Google Arts and Culture, which is a repository for artworks provided by museums around the world. It’s functionally a point-and-click adventure game meant to be played over and over in order to unlock all its secrets. The press release I have tells me a run takes about 20 minutes, but when you start The Forever Labyrinth, it says that the first run might take an hour. However, the game does tell you that it autosaves and picks up where you left off.


It’s pretty neat. If anything, it’s a good way to take in some paintings that you might not have seen otherwise. I’ve looked at an art once or twice before, but there aren’t really any major galleries in my area. The art framing the art is also well-executed, and it feels light and breezy.


You can play The Forever Labyrinth right now for free in your browser.

Last year's multimedia horror extravaganza game has a new patch, and of note is that it includes chapter select but, interestingly, also the "much-requested option to tune down the horror flashes", according to the notes here. What is a horror flash, you ask? It's that thing where a horror game or film or TV show suddenly flashes up a semi-transparent image of like, a monster, or a screaming woman, or a big weird eye. A jump scare meets the Kuleshov effect.

        <updated>2024-02-01T17:02:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has announced that they’re releasing Resident Evil 4 Gold Edition, which contains the base game and all its DLC, on February 9. If you’ve been holding off from buying the Resident Evil 4 remake until you could get everything in one package, your day has come.


Just in case you are someone who was waiting to play Resident Evil 4, the following trailer is crammed to the rafters with spoilers, so maybe don’t watch it.




The Resident Evil 4 remake came out last year in March. It’s a pretty faithful retelling of the adventures of Leon "Sandypants" Kennedy in the 2005 classic with updated gameplay, shiny graphics, and a maybe less ridiculous tone. Just a bit less. Then, in September, Capcom released The Mercenaries and Separate Ways DLC, the latter of which remakes an additional scenario that first appeared in the PS2 port. The latter was also paid DLC, while the former is free.


On top of that is all the paid add-ons. These are additional weapons, costumes, treasure maps, and the original soundtrack. Unfortunately, they never got around to a costume/scenario/mode that involves Tofu, so I’m rather whelmed.


I reviewed the Resident Evil 4 on release last March. I enjoyed it, but some people in the comments were very insistent that I didn’t enjoy it enough. It did, however, win Destructoid’s Best Remake/Remaster of 2023, beating out Dead Space and Super Mario RPG, so that’s high praise in a great year of remakes/remasters. However, if that wasn’t enough to get you to try it out, maybe an all-access pass like Resident Evil 4 Gold Edition will convince you.


Resident Evil 4 Gold Edition launches for PC, PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on February 9, 2024.

Steelrising is not available on PS4, so will only be downloadable on PS5.




Day One Release and two solid titles


All titles will become free to download for PlayStation Plus subscribers on February 6, which is also the same day Foamstars releases. Published by Square Enix, Foamstars is hoping it can compete with Splatoon for the genre of goofy games where you compete to cover the map in your foam as opposed to your enemies.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2013, an unassuming Xbox Live Arcade game was released called Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Early looks made it seem like a pleasant environmental puzzle game about a pair of brothers going on an adventure, but actually playing the game showcased an impressive and specific point of view from its creator, Josef Fares. You can read Game Informer's review of the original Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons by following the link. The game was both heartwarming and heartbreaking, and to this day still features some of the best examples of gameplay as storytelling, and it's all done without any proper dialogue. After Brothers' release, Fares went on to found Hazelight, the studio behind A Way Out and It Takes Two.
Now, 10 years later, developer Avantgarden Games is preparing to release a remake of the game on February 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Join Marcus Stewart and me as we take a look at the new version and reminisce about the original.
And for more on Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, read our in-depth Afterwords on the game with Josef Fares from 2013 here.

Nevertheless, now and again, one arrives with so much personality and adventurous gameplay that it's nigh impossible to not fall in love with it. Penny's Big Breakaway is one of those titles, and I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with a demo for it.

Penny’s Big Breakaway is filled with content and refined mechanics, but that shouldn’t come as a surprise; the game is the product of Evening Star, a studio which features several developers from Sonic Mania, including Christian Whitehead.

Children of the Sun takes that formula and turns it on its head, and if were just any ole shooter, it wouldn't have held my attention long. However, it manages to be so much more with its puzzle game wrapping paper, ensuring I can't get enough just from my earliest of first impressions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[They say ammo scarcity is an artform in FPS games, but I'd argue no game makes a single sniper bullet work harder than the freshly announced Children Of The Sun. I mean, why waste them when you're a young telekinetic hellbent on getting your revenge on the cult that raised you and held you hostage for your entire life? One bullet goes a long way when you can alter the path of its trajectory with each fresh kill you land - as long as they're visible in your immediate eyeline, that is. There are no swoopy swerves going on here, and the thrill of each level is working out the best (and quite literal) angle of attack to take down every last target. I've been playing the first handful of levels of Children Of The Sun over the last week or so, and no word of a lie, this murderous mix of Hitman, Holedown and Sniper Elite has shot straight into my gooey, beating heart.

WWE 2K has steadily climbed the ladder of quality over the past two entries. A strong comeback in 2K22 saw initiative but meaningful improvements in 2K23, and the series is arguably the strongest it's ever been. But a new year means another opportunity to retain the title for best wrestling sim or drop it to someone else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been paying attention to the world of graphics cards lately, you'll know that Nvidia released SUPER variants of its RTX 4070 and RTX 4070 Ti (link missing) GPU. Now, Team Green finishes its trilogy with the launch of the RTX 4080 SUPER, which was released yesterday.


Much like the aforementioned products, the new 4080 dials up the juice a bit when compared to its predecessor. For starters, it has 10,240 CUDA cores, while the previous model has 9,728. It also boosts the clock speed, memory clock, and bandwidth.




Not everything's changed, though. It still retains the 16GB of GDDR6X memory that the non-SUPER RTX 4080 has. Also, the TGP is still at 320W and the memory bus remains the same at 256-bit.


The big change seems to be the price


As noted by Videocardz, Nvidia's latest Ada Lovelace card appears to have had a price adjustment when compared to the cost of the 4080 on launch.


It's still $999, which pushes it more towards the enthusiast area of pricing, but given that its predecessor was priced at nearly $1200 in September of 2022, it feels like a good drop.


Of course, a grand is still a grand, and you can still pay upwards of RTX 4080 SUPER for $1,200 for it depending on where you shop. But at any rate, a lot of the PC hardware world is going to be watching what AMD will do next. Three new Nvidia cards in a month is quite the act to follow, even if they're not new-new, as such.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like a lot of other horror fans, I'm holding out that Bloober Team's remake of Silent Hill 2 won't be a major letdown. While we wait to find that out, however, we can treat ourselves to the new "combat trailer" shown at the most recent State of Play.


There are no prizes for guessing what the footage shows. While we get some of the cinematic goodness of the new Silent Hill 2, we also get to see James Sunderland and his guns making friends with enemies. Ha ha! Their heads ago a-splatter!




But in all seriousness, it seems the remake is doing a revamp of the combat to make it more modern. It makes sense. The original SH2 – as magnificent as it was – wouldn't work in this era with its rather outdated control scheme.


New Silent Hill when?


Of course, the question on everyone's lips is: when's it coming out? Well, we don't know that I'm afraid. The trailer doesn't give a release date or even a release window. We can "wishlist now" and it's being made exclusively for PS5.


On a personal note, I'm slightly bitter that it's only coming to PlayStation. Sure, I could get it for PC, but there's no way on this – or any other – planet my laptop would be able to run it (my laptop says hi, by the way).


From what we've seen, it looks like Bloober's take on what is considered a masterpiece has potential. Unless the studio deviates massively from everything that made the original so iconic, it's going to take a lot to really fumble an up-to-date reimagining of this horror classic.

A game as massive as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was always going to have a couple of bugs just waiting to be found by the glitch hunters out there. Since its launch, we have seen players discover ways of getting infinite items, fire immunity, even one-hit weapons, but none have felt quite as personal as this — skipping the game's introductory area.
Let's not forget, Breath of the Wild's Great Plateau was such a sticking point for the glitching community back in the day, with the possibility of skipping it becoming the holy grail of all discoveries. The answer is still yet to be found, so it's natural that certain players would take to the TOTK equivalent, The Great Sky Islands, with the same level of skippable optimism.

I think Psychonauts 2 was the last one that really took my breath away, but outside of that (as well as obviously every 3D Nintendo platformer), I often struggle to think of many games that could be considered its equal. There's always something holding them back, isn't there? Whether it's a wonky camera, slightly unwieldly controls, or the platforming itself is just a little too pedestrian to ignite the imagination.
So where does Penny's Big Breakaway fit into the equation? This is the next game from former Sonia Mania dev Christian Whitehead's new studio, Evening Star, and yep, you can definitely tell this was made by some real Sonic heads. Penny and her (strangely toothy) sentient yo-yo, err, Yo-Yo, feel like a ball of energy just waiting to bust out across the colourful scenery of their home world of Macaroon, and golly, they sure can fly with just a couple of timely button presses. Alas, there is a but. For me at least, Penny and Yo-Yo are perhaps a bit too energetic for my platforming tastes, and having spent a few hours with an early preview build, I often found them quite a rambunctious pairing to keep under control.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been patiently anticipating Chicken Police: Into the Hive since its announcement last June. I loved 2020’s Chicken Police: Paint it RED, and was hopeful for a continuation. I got an early look at the demo, and it’s a pretty bland taste, but it’s not necessarily indicative of a problem.


I think it’s difficult to build a demo of any narrative-centric game. Usually, these sorts of titles have a slow build with character introductions, and they may not begin any meaty twisting until later in the game. Trying to fit both the context and the hook into a demo without giving away too much of the overall runtime can be difficult, and Chicken Police: Into the Hive isn’t the most impressive attempt.


It doesn’t do anything to sully my excitement for the full story, but it doesn’t really heigh…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By now, it feels like a lot of us are fit to burst on all things Palworld. However, as Pocketpair sends out another patch to fix a variety of bugs, the game continues to experience more popularity than...well, a very very popular thing.


Version 0.1.4.0 has been rolling out on Steam, with a lot of fixes being implemented. For starters, there's been an issue where players have been receiving damage twice. This has now been patched out. Also, players will "no longer pass through walls when dismounting." That was a thing, it seems.




Going forward, expect a lot more Palworld updates. The developer says it's going to continue development, "placing top priority on fixing major problems and issues." Given the current state of the game, fans would probably expect nothing less than bug fixes. Oh, also the update for the Xbox version is expected soon.


Not enough people in Ecuador to play


Along with the recent patch, Pocketpair also gave the good word on Twitter/X that the game has experienced more than 19 million players. That's 12 million on PC and seven million on Xbox. That's about as much as...a very very large thing (I'm not good at analogies today, it seems).


A few days ago, Palworld smashed through the two million concurrent player mark, according to SteamDB. It's become one of – if not the – fastest-selling game in recent memory. Two weeks. It came out just two weeks ago.


We're still waiting to hear what Nintendo/The Pokémon Company will turn up in its investigation. For now, Palworld continues to be as huge as...you know what...you can take it from here.

The ver. 1.1.4.2 update is now available and while it is substantially smaller than the beefy one that came before, it continues to improve on the game's rocky start.

Straight off the production line are fixes to crashes, as well as enemy pals getting stuck in walls. And if you've been plagued by other players stealing your flock, then worry no longer, as pal spheres chucked at your low-HP pals won't capture them anymore. Breeding also becomes easier, with the removal of some annoying flourishes. There's a lot more and it gets progressively sillier.

Poor Switch Lite. Although Nintendo's smaller, budget-friendly handheld certainly has its audience, there's no doubt in our mind that it pales in comparison to the Switch - OLED Model thanks to the latter's far superior screen.
This could well be a thing of the past, though, as YouTuber and handheld specialist Taki Udon has created a prototype mod that replaces the standard LCD screen in the Switch Lite with an OLED screen. What's more, Udon has stated that the mod shouldn't cost too much to implement, with prices ranging from $25-$50 based on overall interest.

Because let's face it. Everything PlayStation comes to PC eventually. We just have a wait a couple of years for it. Just look at former exclusive Horizon Forbidden West, which is hitting PC on March 21st. That wasn't in tonight's showcase, of course, so let's take a look at everything that was. Start those PC countdown timers now, folks, because it's only a matter of time.

Set in 19th century Japan's Bakumatsu era, the game is a mixture of open-ended exploration, sneaking and agile traversal that puts me heavily in mind of Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series. Unlike most Assassin's Creeds, however, this one has a pretty in-depth, rigorous melee combat system, with bosses that look like they're going to grind my gears no end. Will it be as vicious as Nioh 2? I'd better start stocking up on comfort food.

        <updated>2024-02-01T00:00:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's announcement of Sonic x Shadow Generations brought all kinds of love for Sonic's dark doppelganger as longtime fans celebrate Shadow's return after being absent from recent projects like Sonic Superstars and Sonic Frontiers. However, players won't need to wait for the fall launch of Sonic x Shadow Generations to enjoy speeding around as Shadow, as Sega also announced it is celebrating today's announcement by releasing a free equippable DLC costume to Sonic Superstars on February 15.
Sonic Superstars already includes several other skins you can equip onto your characters, ranging from Lego costumes to a Santa costume for Sonic to even the original prototype rabbit design. No screenshots or photos have been released for the newly announced Shadow costume in Sonic Superstars.
In July 2023, I asked Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka why Shadow isn't in Sonic Superstars. "Shadow is from the Modern series of characters and gameplay that we have introduced," Iizuka says. "The Classic series exists before the Modern series, so they haven't met at that time. There's no relationship, so we won't be bringing Shadow into the Classic series. Unfortunately, Shadow was in a capsule at that time."
By adding Shadow as an equippable skin, Iizuka and the rest of Sonic Team are able to circumvent the lore reasoning for leaving Shadow on the sidelines for Superstars. This year is shaping up to be the Year of Shadow for the Sonic brand. Shadow is coming to Sonic Superstars as an equippable skin, he's co-headlining the aforementioned Sonic Generations remaster in the fall, and he figures to be one of the main attractions in the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film when that hits theaters in December.
Sonic Superstars launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 17, 2023. The free Shadow costume arrives in Sonic Superstars as free DLC on February 15. For more on that game, check out our review here.

Traversal is extremely dynamic and in addition to running, you can also glide and ride your trusty hose. Of course, you aren't there to enjoy the countryside, so a lot of time was given to illustrating the combat which features blades and even a flamethrower. 




Taking place during the final years of the 19th century, the game depicts the Boshin War. you'll be able to create your own character and engage in combat with various weapons. Though the premise is intriguing, RotR will have to work hard to not be just another Assassin's Creed set in Japan. 


The game launches on March 22 on PS5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[V Rising, the popular survival action RPG, is branching away from PC and making its way to PS5 sometime this year. The news was announced during today’s State of Play.
The game, which first entered Steam Early Access in May 2022, puts players in the immortal shoes of a weak vampire who awakens after slumbering for centuries. Players must regain their strength and rebuild their castle, which, among other things, involves enslaving humans to do their bidding. Whatever your method of rebuilding your might and fending off foes, you’ll have to plan around a day/night cycle since sunlight is a big no-no for your well being. V Rising can be played alone or alongside friends in multiplayer. 


Interestingly, since Sony doesn't have an Early Access style program, one has to wonder if V Rising’s arrival will coincide with an impending 1.0 launch on PC. V Rising was a big hit when it first arrived on Steam and has garnered positive reviews, so here's hoping the experience translates well on console.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot on the heels of the latest Death Stranding 2 trailer during Sony's most recent State of Play livestream, Hideo Kojima, the head of Kojima Productions, announced that alongside Sony, his company is making a brand new IP. Not only that, but it is, as Kojima put it, an "action espionage" game.
If that genre sounds vaguely familiar in relation to Kojima, that might be because the tagline of his global breakthrough, Metal Gear Solid, released in 1998, used the tagline "Tactical Espionage Action." In normal people's terms, that means a stealth game. 


Kojima's return to the stealth genre, one he pioneered decades ago with the Metal Gear series, is still quite a ways off. As he tells it, development will begin in earnest after Death Stranding 2 is released sometime in 2025. 
He then went on to say a bunch of stuff that didn't make a ton of sense, though maybe one day it will in retrospect. This new game will also apparently be a movie "in terms of look, story, theme, cast, acting, fashion, and sound," Kojima said, before adding that with this new game, Kojima Productions hopes to "transcend the barriers between film and video games."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's something comforting in not only Death Stranding getting a sequel, but its trailers not getting any less strange. In fact, today's State of Play trailer was maybe the most bizarre look yet, spotlighting an entire new region for Sam to connect, and a release window of 2025.


Now apparently dubbed Death Stranding 2 On The Beach, I'm not sure where to start with all this. Sam "Porter" Bridges, portrayed again by Norman Reedus, is back in the lead. Fragile is back too, with a hand-based neck apparatus that can act as both a mask and as just, uh, hands.




Sam and pals are back on a new journey to save humanity from extinction amidst the Death Stranding, where enemies are still around every corner. We see packages being delivered, people floating in the air, and plenty of familiar iconography. But there are plenty of twists and turns.


Higgs looks to be back, as a Joker-fied version of himself, shredding a guitar while fighting a robot samurai with a baby voice. Still processing that one. There's also a puppet companion, almost like a Jiminy Cricket-style character? Who can do vampire eyes? It's wild.


Honestly, bring it on. I'd always rather have something weird and outside my expectations run headfirst into walls than something that feels too safe. And while Death Stranding 2 certainly seems like it's iterating on the original, there's plenty of new and weird here to keep me interested.


Death Stranding 2 is planned for 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's PlayStation State of Play, developer Vertigo Games and publisher Deep Silver revealed the next entry in the post-apocalyptic Metro series is headed to VR. Metro Awakening serves as a prequel to the original Metro games that has been built from the ground up for VR as a story-driven first-person adventure.





"This origins story is so essential to me," said Dmitry Glukhovsky, who is also serving as a lore consultant for Metro Awakening. "It feels like returning to the foundations and roots of the series - now at the level that VR technology can bring."
- Dmitry Glukhovsy, Author and Creator of Metro and Lore Consultant on Metro Awakening



Survivors of Nuclear Armageddon cling to life in buried subways of the Moscow Metro where ghosts and spirits haunt the living. Players will quite literally—via VR—step into the role of Serdar, a doctor and rationalist. Players have to brave the darkness, crippling radiation, and deadly threats of Metro in search of Serdar's wife and the medication she desperately needs.


I'm still not 100% sold on VR but Metro is a pretty creepily immersive series, so I think this could turn out to be a good experience if done right. It's promising that rather than doing some sort of port, Vertigo Games is developing Metro Awakening with the features of the PlayStation 5 and PS VR2 in mind from the start.


Metro Awakening is set to release on PS VR2, Meta Quest 2 and 3, and PC VR in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and developer Team Ninja have released a new trailer for Rise of the Ronin, and it features plenty of bloody gameplay and new details about the Bakumatsu period in Japan. There wasn't much new in the trailer, but it does tease the action that awaits players when the full game launches this March. 
In combat, various weapons can be used, including Japanese swords and spears. As you develop a connection with the inventor Igashichi, you'll gain more access to devices like the Fire Pipe, which is basically a long-range flamethrower. There are also bayonets, which can provide quick melee hits when using ranged weapons. 
Rise of the Ronin takes place during the Bakumatsu period, and your connection with the people of Japan will greatly influence how your Ronin's story plays out. You can read more about that in Game Informer's Rise of the Ronin preview here. 
Check out all the new gameplay in the latest Rise of the Ronin trailer below: 


Rise of the Ronin hits PlayStation 5 exclusively on March 22, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the PlayStation State of Play stream, Sony has confirmed the rumors that Until Dawn is getting remastered for PS5 and PC. In addition, they’ve revealed that it will be coming in 2024.




We heard murmurs that the remaster was going to be revealed less than a week ago. This news comes not long after the announcement that the game is being adapted into a movie, which doesn’t seem that much of a departure from the game itself. The trailer shows off some familiar and reworked scenes with a new lick of polish. 


I’m going to be real with you; I didn’t play Until Dawn, so I don’t really know what I’m looking at. Still, cool for fans. Probably.


The remaster of Until Dawn will release for PS5 and PC sometime in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s PlayStation stream brought some great news for players on Sony consoles. Dave the Diver is headed to Playstation in April, meaning that players who weren’t able to catch the game on Switch or PC will now have a chance to join Dave on his adventures.
As we highlighted in the game’s review, Dave the Diver was one of the welcome surprises of last year, offering a novel and amusing mix of gameplay experiences. Part of the game focuses on scuba diving and fishing, while another section of the game is about managing and growing a sushi restaurant, using the ingredients you gathered from the ocean. The game has a whimsical, lighthearted vibe and consistently entertaining gameplay, which together has garnered a lot of praise.


Alongside the release on PlayStation consoles, we also got a tease of a new crossover coming to Dave the Diver, in which Godzilla shows up in the strange waters of the Blue Hole. If we get to make sushi from a kaiju, it will be an awesome day, indeed. That new expansion to Dave’s adventure is set to arrive in May.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For people who like dystopian settings and first-person shooting, Judas certainly looks to carry the torch. Ken Levine's Ghost Story Games showed off a new look at the game during today's Sony State of Play, and its got one messed-up world waiting to be explored.


As the trailer asks, Judas will task the player with fixing what's broken or leaving it all to burn. And hey, it wouldn't be a BioShock-style game without a futuristic city falling to pieces.




What's really impressive is some of the visuals they're putting together for Judas at Ghost Story Games. The section where the hand gets assembled in real-time? Creepy, in a good way.


It's hard to get too much of a feel for the gameplay here, outside general first-person shooting and some freaky powers. But all the style—glitter excess smashed against everything falling to pieces—certainly seems in place.


We'll have to wait and see on more, because we still don't have much of an idea on a release date. Judas is currently in development for PS5.

Notably, this PC release means more people will get to experience developer Supermassive Games' breakout narrative-driven horror. However, it's unclear if Supermassive is developing this or if a different team is handling it. 
PlayStation revealed this new version of Until Dawn, which it says has been "rebuilt" for PS5, during today's State of Play in a new cinematic trailer that highlights the improved fidelity. This new and improved version of Until Dawn comes hot on the heels of Sony announcing earlier this month that Shazam! director David F. Sandberg is directing a film adaptation of the game. 
Check out the Until Dawn remake trailer for yourself below:

Supermassive released a spiritual successor to Until Dawn in 2022 called The Quarry – read Game Informer's review here – but its next game is Little Nightmares III, which is due out sometime this year.

What we do get is a sneak peek at a possible collaboration with Godzilla which should spice things up in May. 




Though Dave The Diver has been acknowledged as an indie title in several awards ceremonies, this has also drawn controversy because the developer is owned by the billion-dollar corporation Nexon. 


How you view the game is ultimately up to your beliefs of what qualifies as an indie title.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's PlayStation State of Play delivered a new Death Stranding 2 trailer and, perhaps unsurprisingly, it is weird as hell. The trailer opens with Fragile and a friend, or someone very reminiscent of Fragile, performing surgery while a pair of additional hands cover her mouth. Later in the trailer she says, "These days I am Fragile in name only," before explaining her efforts to create Drawbridge, which apparently was started when Sam went off on his own after the events of the first game.


The trailer also showcases the return of villain Higgs, who was teased in the first trailer. He wears a mask but removes it to reveal a face that looks like it belongs in The Crow. He tells Sam that it looks like he traded in rope for a stick this go 'round, recalling a major element of the original game which discussed how early humanity was faced with two tools in the beginning – one to create connection, and one to create conflict. Also, Higgs attacks enemies with a guitar.

Other interesting elements of the trailer include discussions about the black goo from the universe of Death Stranding being a sort of primordial soup, the disappearance of Lou (the baby Sam carried with him in the first game), and a talking puppet that Sam carries on his hip. We also got a peak at Elle Fanning's character sneaking around and listening in on a surgery, but we know nothing else about her so far.
The trailer ended with the phrase, "Should we have connected?" and promised a 2025 release window, so we still have some time to wait. It also gave the PlayStation 5 exclusive game a proper subtitle: On The Beach.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during Sony's most recent State of Play, Konami unveiled a brand new Silent Hill project. Silent Hill: The Short Message is a new free experience that'll be available later today.
Check out the trailer below to see it for yourself. Though as a quick heads-up, there are brief scenes of self-harm.


The Short Message trailer looks conspicuously like the alleged leaked images for a new Silent Hill game we saw back in February 2022 that Konami DMCA'd. As Polygon detailed at the time, the leaker "Dusk Golem offered some hints at its narrative, naming two characters (Anita and Maya) and hinting that SMS messages would factor into the game somehow." This lines up with much of what's in the trailer.
Despite the previous leak, The Short Message was still a bit of a surprise, as it's yet another new Silent Hill project but wasn't one of the many annoucned back in 2022, which revealed the upcoming Silent Hill 2 remake, the maligned Silent Hill: Ascension, as well as Silent Hill f and Silent Hill: Townfall. It appears the future of Silent Hill is as bright as it is foggy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Konami announced as part of the Playstation State of Play Stream that a new entry of the Silent Hill series, Silent Hill: The Short Message, not only exists but also is available now for free.




Silent Hill: The Short Message has you play as Anita, a woman who finds herself in a desolate apartment block after following messages from her friend, Maya. The trailer appears to demonstrate themes of bullying and suicide, which sounds pretty Silent Hill to me.


The trailer shows everything from a first-person perspective and omits combat, which makes it seem like a walking sim. It might be worth a look anyway, as Konami has released the game for free, so you’re only playing with your time.


Silent Hill: The Short Message is available now exclusively on on PS5.

Revealed in a new trailer that aired during today's Sony State of Play, this look at Judas pulled back the curtains on what exactly is going on in this single-player, narrative-driven sci-fi game. Well, kinda. We got another look at the game's interesting world, which shows Judas stuck on a space station with various characters (perhaps enemies?) trying to fix something that she might have broken.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation is a getting a new action title this spring. We got a long look at Stellar Blade, the upcoming action RPG from SHIFT UP Corporation, and a release date of April 26, 2024.


We got a pretty long look at what's in store for this PlayStation title at today's Sony State of Play. As we had seen before, Stellar Blade has a lot of sci-fi and action in store. Following the protagonist's fight to reclaim Earth from a malevolent force, it certainly looks like it's got some spectacle in store.




Really, Stellar Blade seems to wear its inspirations on its sleeve, at least to me. There's a lot of NieR: Automata here, and maybe some light Xenoblade and other sci-fi too. But I like the blend. It's got some identity of its own too, with some gorgeous graphics and an almost Scarlet Nexus-style brand of cyberpunk around it.


I could certainly go for sci-fi action, and this looks like it could be a bit of a surprise in April. Stellar Blade is due out on April 26, 2024 for PlayStation 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2011, as the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise turned 20 years old, Sega and Sonic Team decided to celebrate with Sonic Generations, a game that remade various iconic and fan-favorite zones from Sonic's past in both 3D and modern 2D versions. The title was one of the more well-liked Sonic games of the era, alongside Sonic Colors and Sonic Unleashed. During today's PlayStation State of Play, Sega announced a new version of Sonic Generations called Sonic x Shadow Generations.


As the name implies, Sonic x Shadow Generations remasters the well-liked title for modern consoles but adds various enhancements. While 60 frames-per-second performance is already attainable by playing the Xbox 360 version on an Xbox Series X console, Sonic x Shadow Generations brings much more to the table. In addition to remastering the Sonic levels, this version adds Shadow as a playable character alongside new levels for him.
Sonic x Shadow Generations will be available this fall for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've seen little of Stellar Blade since its reveal way back in 2021, but during today's State of Play event, we got a new deep dive into the upcoming action game. Not only did we see plenty of gameplay in a new trailer, but PlayStation and developer ShiftUp revealed the game is coming to PlayStation 5 on April 26. 
Players will take control of Eve, a member of the 7th Airborne Squad. Her mission is simple: save the planet. She was supposed to do this with the rest of her squad, but most were lost in the descent to Earth. However, she finds two friends in Adam, who lives on Earth, and Lily, a member of the 5th Airborne Squad who provides Eve with engineering support. Lily will help Eve unlock new abilities like Double Jump. 
Check out that double jump and more in the Stellar Blade gameplay trailer below: 


In Xion, a city built under the wasteland of Earth by the planets' last survivors, Eve is called Angel by the survivors, and seen as an object of both awe and fear. However, they'll loosen up as Eve shows commitment to building the city. Survivors will ask Eve for help with things like rescuing sisters in need or finding lost cats. These requests will send her out into the dangerous desert wasteland, where Eve will run into dangerous robots and alien-like monsters called Naytibas. 
Stellar Blade hits PlayStation 5 on April 26, 2024. 
For more, check out this gameplay trailer from 2021 when Stellar Blade was still called Project Eve.

Previously your only option was the (superb) 5800X3D, which uses a 3D V-Cache to massively boost gaming performance, but now the cheaper 5700X3D is also available. 
Made from silicon that wasn't quite good enough to turn into the 5800X3D, these processors boost slightly lower but come with the same complement of extra L3 cache, making them still head and shoulders above models like the 5600X, 5800X, 5900X and even 5950X - not to mention older Ryzen 1000, 2000 and 3000 models.
Following its launch this month, the brand new Ryzen 7 5700X3D is now available from B&H Photo and Amazon in the US for $249 or Amazon UK for £233, a great price that undercuts the $308 5800X3D significantly. Here's some links:

The first game from the franchise launched almost a decade ago exclusively in Japan as a mobile and browser-based JRPG. Over 35 million people played this iteration of the game, but it never really made it to the West other than an English patch.


Granblue Fantasy: Relink is somewhat of a reimagination of the original game, but as a full-fledged action RPG. Instead of waiting out timers or saving up for gacha pulls, you'll progress through a series of missions unlocking new quests and characters along the way. More importantly, you'll engage in real-time action RPG as opposed to tapping buttons when it's your turn to attack.


The best way to describe how Granblue Fantasy: Relink plays is this: Fast-paced action combat …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kiss kiss, it's February  — or close enough, at least. That means Final Fantasy XIV is wrapping up January's festivities and moving on to the next big thing with its 2024 Valentine-themed celebrations, Valentione's Day. More importantly, did you see the new emote?


Starting on February 7, 2024, at 12 am PST (until February 21), you can begin the FFXIV Valentione's Day seasonal event and add the Love Heart emote to your collection. Dote, my once go-to emote for greeting friends, is now out. Love Heart is in. It probably doesn't need to be a competition, but it's too cute to miss or ignore.



There's also a chair, I guess. (Image via Square Enix)



The Symbol of Love quest begins with Astrid in Old Gridania (X:10.2, Y:9.4), and awaits locked behind the usual Level 15 requirement. My guess, barring any wild unforeseen surprises deviating from a decade of FFXIV events, is that Astrid's quest lands you the Love Heart emote, while the nearby House Valentione maid sells the Valentione's Heart Chair.


Can't tell you what I'll do with the chair yet, but I'll certainly buy dozens and forget them on a retainer  —  just in case I have need for a room of heart chairs. It's not the first gaudy, love-dovey furniture I've turned my nose up at, but all is forgiven for the emote that makes my miqo'te look as cute as a K-pop star.


For now, that's all we know of this year's Valentione celebrations, but you can watch the Lodestone explainer for updates. Until then, check out our handy FFXIV seasonal event calendar, and get your glamour goodies from The Maiden's Rhapsody.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We last got a look at the latest project from Onion Games, Stray Children, back in September during the Japanese Nintendo Direct. At the time it was set for winter 2024 in Japan, but those plans have changed and the RPG has now been moved to a general 2024 release window (via Gematsu). 


The official Onion Games Twitter account shared the news about the delay. They said the entire staff is working on Stray Children every day, and they would appreciate it if everyone could give them a little more time.




With the future of Stray Children in mind, the official website is also hosting a survey. It includes questions and answers in both English and Japanese, and asks everything from basic demographics to Switch game format preference, language options, merchandise, additional platforms, and crowdfunding. They also want to know your favorite RPG and which Onion Games you've played before, so if you're a fan who's looking forward to Stray Children you might want to take a moment to fire off some responses.


Onion Games has a handful of very interesting games to its name, including Million Onion Hotel, Moon: Remix RPG Adventure, and Black Bird. Stray Children is a new RPG from the studio that has some of the Moon staff on board, so there's a lot of promise there already. Here's the previous trailer for those who missed it:




Hopefully we'll find out a more concrete release date soon, but if it means a stronger showing, we don't mind the wait at all.

While that reveal included details about the survival aspects of the game, including multiplayer, crafting, and farming, viewers honed in on the idea of it being Pokémon but with guns. You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it's smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. 
Following various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely's Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…]]></summary>

The limited-time mode (LTM) dropped alongside Season 2's Iron Crown Collection Event. The rules are self-explanatory: drop into a Battle Royale match all by your lonesome, with 60 legends total competing for bragging rights as well as some cool character- or win-specific badges.
In some ways, playing alone was a great way to test one's might in duels without relying on teammate assistance. However, the experimental LTM was a double-edged sword, revealing that some ability kits were simply stronger than others in 1v1s. For instance, Lifeline's "D.O.C. Heal Drone" made her a near-unkillable force, but her "Combat Revive" passive was rendered useless since there were no allies to resurrect. You can already see some…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a string of wee teasers for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, Paradox have released an "extended gameplay reveal" trailer. This is the most we've seen of Bloodlines 2 since Paradox took the RPG from original developers Hardsuit Labs and handed it to The Chinese Room, the studio behind Dear Esther and Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs. The trailer shows 14 minutes of our vamp creeping about a warehouse with a pretty Dishonored-y combination of stealth and magical violence, showing very much why the sequel is now described as an "action RPG" rather than just "RPG".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you’ve been living under a rock, the monster-catching survival game Palworld is the hottest thing since sliced bread. As such, it’s only natural that players would want to take it anywhere they go; it’s currently only available on PC and Xbox Series X/S (via early access). However, mobile versions have recently been spotted, but you’ll want to think twice before downloading them.
An app posing as Palworld has appeared on Apple’s App Store and Google Play. In an X post, however, Palworld developer Pocketpair states that there is no official mobile version of Palworld. The app store version lists its developer as Oleksandra Kryvcun, which is the primary tip-off that something is amiss. Though not available, the app is available for pre-order and lists a February 11 launch date. 
[Warning]
January 31, 2024
Pocketpair warns that downloading this app may lead to your personal data being stolen. It states that it has reported these apps to Apple/Google. We couldn't find the fake Palworld on Google Play, so it may already be gone. Hopefully, the App Store fake is dealt with soon to protect eager players from installing something potentially nasty. 
Palworld has become the hottest (and most controversial) game of the year, and it remains to be seen if and when it will be brought to other platforms. Until then, you can catch up on all the excitement and discourse by reading our in-depth overview of what Palworld entails and our studio profile on developer Pocketpair from last year. You can also watch us play Palworld from the beginning in this episode of Game Informer Live.]]></summary>

Alas, I have no review to lay at your feet, because the game booted once as soon as I got it, then didn't work for about five days, and for the rest of this week has booted at a ratio of about 1:8 of successful boot to attempts to boot. It has also crashed twice during cutscenes. It's a shame, because I've quite enjoyed the bits that I have played (which amount to about half of the campaign, in single player). As a cross section of the three of us who have the game, one hasn't been able to boot it at all, and it works apparently perfectly for the other - and we tested both the retail build and the review build. I can't speak to what your odds will be if you get it, but sure, if it works, you'll have a fun enough time, probably?

The thrill of adventure in a boundless playground tickles the imagination, something intimately familiar to players of Granblue Fantasy, a mobile/browser-based title that has been a hit internationally for over a decade. The original title resembles 16-bit turn-based RPGs like the Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest games of old, leaving daydreams of grander scale and exploits a hopeful wish rather than an inevitable reality. With Granblue Fantasy: Relink, developer CyGames has an opportunity to explore a fantasy world of open skies and magic while…]]></summary>

Developer Rocksteady Studios' new live-service multiplayer shooter, Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, went live for Deluxe Edition players on January 30. For those playing in regions like New Zealand, the game went live on January 29 here in the states (but it was January 30 for that region). Those first players were met with an unfortunate "story completion" bug that caused Rocksteady to take the game offline to fix. That fix took hours, leaving those who paid for the Deluxe Edition, which is $30 more than the standard edition, unable to play the game at all as Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice Leauge is an always-online game. 
To make up for that issue, Rocksteady has gifted Deluxe Edition players 2000 LuthorCoins, which is roughly $20 of in-game currency that can be…]]></summary>

Or at least, that was the idea.
Like many an online-required live service game before, Suicide Squad's premium access release has been marred by technical bugs and glitches, the most severe of which saw players logging in to discover the main storyline already completed. I guess Rocksteady were serious about not wanting people to treat it like a "life commitment".

It taps into the same checklist clearing compulsion that saw me spend over 100 hours in both Odyssey's Ancient Greek archipelago and the Viking open world of Valhalla - only instead of chasing map icons that take you down weird sidequest rabbit holes that riff on Fenton the (sheep)dog, or gobbling up story events just so you can make googly eyes at every warm-blooded human in a ten mile radius, Palworld hooks you in with its enormous catalogue of base building tasks. Not catching the 100+ Pal monsters roaming around its mysterious islands, but crafting the perfect sweatshop to put them to work in. It's one of those, "I'll just add this furnace so I can craft some ingots that will let me make a cooking pot to level up my base, but wait, now I need some ore to make those ingots, and oh god, I've just spent seven hours doing not very much at all, have I?"

For too long had PC folks had to 'make do' with the quite nasty mobile ports of these games, and the Pixel Remasters looked set to finally rectify that with proper versions replete with their original artwork. But one thing was missing. Well, several things were missing it turns out, but chief among them were, of course, its damn fonts - a point of contention that's plagued many a Square Enix PC port in recent years, and one that fans quickly set about trying to fix with mods. Extra salt was then added to the wound when Square Enix said that last year's Switch and PS4 versions of the Pixel Remaster series would have two different font options straight out of the box - and it's only now that the PC versions have finally caught up.

The game is bad for my blood pressure and for the solidity of my friendships. So, I am terrified by the prospect of Speed Crew, an Overcooked-like set in racing pit stops as opposed to kitchens. I gave it a whirl and it has promise! Even if I now need a big lie down. I am not cut out for jobs involving manual labour, nor games where I play as someone who needs to perform manual labour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reddit is refusing to share the IP addresses of users who posted piracy-related comments, as that would violate their First Amendment right to anonymous speech. Responding to this argument, film companies now use a line of reasoning that's traditionally been used as a defense by accused pirates. "An IP address is not a person," they inform the court.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Asus Prime AP201 Micro ATX case is down to $65 on Amazon US, a great price for a SFF case that's attracted warm reviews since launching in 2022. 
The AP201 offers excellent compatibility with a wide range of cooling hardware and graphics cards, plus excellent thermals and easy buildability. It even has a classy, understated look that's the polar opposite of Asus' ROG designs. That's pretty much the full set when it comes to small form factor PC cases, so consider jumping on this one while you can!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apex Legends, like all live-service titles, is no stranger to balancing updates. Weapons and playable characters alike undergo acute surges and declines based on several factors, with the most prevalent being player behavior. Years ago, Pathfinder reigned supreme across casual and competitive matches; his grapple hook-centric mobility and inconsistent hitbox made him an unrivaled duelist until his ability cooldowns and physique were tweaked. Similarly, the Prowler SMG once rivaled its light ammo counterparts before the Selectfire Receiver – a legendary hop-up that converted the weapon's burstfire to automatic – was removed from the loot pool. These changes, in addition to many others, morphed the meta in significant ways, but one particular update trumped the rest: Revenant's rework.

As mentioned in the X post above, the Alliance Requisition Bundle includes armor sets based on Garrus, Liara, and the protagonist, Commander Shepard. In addition to the bundle, which players will presumably have to purchase, three items will be available for free – the Enhanced Defense Ghost Shell, Alliance Scout Frigate Ship, and Alliance Drop Ship Sparrow.
Destiny 2 is currently gearing up for its next expansion, The Final Shape, which is set to launch later this year on June 4. It's supposed to usher in the conclusion of Destiny's story so far, so now's a good time to get caught up if you aren't already. Here's what we thought of their most recent expansions, The Witch Queen and Lightfall.  If you start in two weeks, you can do it while roleplaying as Garrus!

The upcoming "Kafkaesque" immersive sim gives you the simple goal of escaping a town within a few days, a task which is somewhat complicated by the fact that a Leviathan-sized Russian cop towers over the city, watching you. In a new dev blog, developers TallBoys explain more of how you might court the giant's approval (the term "fully fleshed dating-sim mechanic" features) or avoid it by sneaking about while he sleeps. You might even—gasp!—do crimes. This also drew my attention to a ten-minute gameplay video they released last month and oh, yes, please.

Later in our Call Of Duty sessions we'd hit matchmaking with reverse psychological techniques, saying stuff like "I bet we WON'T find a match", to in fact, find a match. Well, thanks to an official COD blog post, my heady beliefs have been hit with the equivalent of a precision air strike. Matchmaking cannot be gamed. It is all-seeing and all, sadly, science.

Then you'll love 20 Small Mazes, a game that is just 20 small mazes. As the Steam store page says, they're good mazes, though. It's out on February the 16th from FLEB, which seems to be just one guy who really likes puzzles and making puzzles. I wholly support him.

You know - when you get down all fours and offer to give the kid a ride around the sitting room. It's murder on the old kneecaps, but as any shrewd parental tactician knows, Horsey is a game with a sting in its tail (making this a kind of scorpion Horsey, I guess). The horse in the game of Horsey is free to choose the direction of travel, even if it's somewhere the rider would rather not go. Towards the bath or dinner table, for instance. Towards the dentist, if needed.

Even though Mario is now known as the most iconic face in gaming, in his first appearance, 1981's Donkey Kong, he couldn't even get his name in the title. That was corrected in 2004 with the release of Mario vs. Donkey Kong, a side-scrolling puzzle game designed to carry on the legacy of the classic arcade cabinet. Twenty years later, that outing has been reimagined for the Nintendo Switch, and Mario's rivalry with Donkey Kong – as well as the gameplay – holds up surprisingly well.
After the local toy store runs out of Mario toys, Donkey Kong goes on a rampage at the toy factory, leaving with a sack full of toys and Mario in hot pursuit. As Mario, you'll go through a series of levels w…]]></summary>

Not only had we cleared out the 42nd floor of the cursed extra-dimensional horror house that was our school’s midnight alter-ego, I’d also just aced my midterms. I spent the afternoon helping my french foreign exchange friend sew a kimono for his estranged uncle, then killed some time before bed by consoling the small child I’d been hanging out with lately about her parent’s divorce.


So goes an average day in one of the very, very many days stuffed into Persona 3 Reload’s year long taste of demon-slaying high school life. A charming fantasy? Perhaps! There's plenty here for fans who don’t mind an old-school approach to grinding while exploring heartfelt, albeit cheesy, friendships. Those who don't get on with anime tropes, though, might find it exhaustingly written and repetitive.

Persona 3 is perhaps the most important entry in the Shin Megami Tensei spin-off franchise. By establishing several series mainstays, including the popular Social Links system, Persona 3 laid the foundation upon which the next two mainline entries would be built. Unfortunately, by today’s standards, that 18-year-old title is unapproachable in many ways. Persona 3 Reload remedies that, bringing forward the outstanding cast, story, and turn-based battles in a faithful remake with the modern amenities of Persona 5 Roya…]]></summary>

She started as the head of Call of Duty esports before eventually working as a Call of Duty franchise manager at the company Microsoft acquired last year for $69 billion. 
In Faries' introductory email to Blizzard employees today, she addressed the layoffs that occurred at the company last week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer Group has canceled a new Deus Ex game in development at Eidos-Montréal, according to a new Bloomberg report. Alongside this cancelation, Eidos-Montréal, which is the studio behind 2021's Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy and both Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, has revealed it is laying off 97 employees. 
Bloomberg reports that Eidos-Montréal had been working on this new unannounced Deus Ex game for two years, and it was set to enter production later this year, according to sources familiar with the studio. It seems the studio's canceled game and subsequent layoffs are another casualty of Embracer, which has been purging studios after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion in the Scarlet & Violet series is Paldean Fates, which brings new Shinies into the mix, plus various type-shifted Tera Pokémon and new special-illustration cards. Unfortunately, you can't buy these booster packs individually; instead, you must purchase special collections like the Elite Trainer Box or the Tech Sticker Collection. 
Despite this unconventional release method, Paldean Fates adds an absolutely massive number of cards to the Pokémon Trading Card Game. Those trying to collect them all have more than 240 cards to look for, including more than 135 etched-foil cards and several Trainer cards.
The Pokémon Company sent along a few of the collections and products that contain Paldean Fates booster packs so we could crack them open to see what we could pull. While I'm usually most excited about the Pokémon themselves, one of my favorite pulls this time was a Trainer card: the Nemona full-art Ultra Rare. But that's not to say I didn't pull my fair share of great cards starring some of my favorite Pokémon. I'm always a sucker for a cool Charizard card, and I love the Shiny Toedscruel ex that I found in one of the packs.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Paldean Fates is available now. For more Pokémon TCG content, including galleries of past expansions, interviews, and the latest news, head to our hub by clicking the banner below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between Tekken 8, Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, and the impending release of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, 2024 is off to an explosive start, but the rest of the year is still up in the air. Luckily for PlayStation fans, Sony is pulling the curtain back on some games coming soon to its platforms this Wednesday, January 31, at 2 P.M. Pacific/5 P.M. Eastern. Check out the X announcement below.
Get ready for a new State of Play! https://t.co/KDyuY2Uvfq

Tune in on YouTube, Twitch, or TikTok this Wednesday at 2pm PT / 10pm GMT for 40 minutes covering 15+ games, including extended looks at Stellar Blade and Rise of the Ronin, plus more from talented game developers from… pic.twitter.com/MQg76iv8Tt
January 29, 2024
The showcase will specifically show off extended looks at Stellar Blade and Rise of the Rōnin. The former title, previously known as Project Eve, is a stylish action-adventure game that's been teased since 2019. The last we heard, it was delayed into this year, so we're due for a proper look. The latter game is the next project from Team Ninja, the developers behind the Nioh series. It's the studio's most ambitious project to date – check out our December preview here.
As for the other 13+ games, we don't have much of an idea. We know it won't include Naughty Dog's recently canceled Last of Us multiplayer spin-off, and we've gone a while without big reveals for a lot of Sony's first-party studios, so hopefully, it can shed some light on the rest of the company's 2024.
What are you hoping to see at Wednesday's State of Play? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I bought Baldur's Gate 3 shortly after its release as a need than a want, when I was a year-and-half into my gender transition and hormone replacement therapy. Gender transition is not just an arduous journey of self-discovery, but also a profound and constant engagement with one’s own reality. I was desperate for some escapism, and Larian Studios’ much-anticipated new entry into the Baldur’s Gate fantasy RPG franchise offered the perfect rabbit hole to fall down.
As a child, my gaming habits were relatively stereotypical for a closeted girl: select female characters wherever possible, especially in RPGs. But the immersion almost always wears off. The trans inclusion in games like Dungeon Siege, Sacred 2: Fallen Angel, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and others is effectively non-existent, and the result for transgender and transsexual players is a feeling that, even in fantasy worlds, we are invisible at best. Nocturne, a trans supporting character in Baldur's Gate III played by Abigail Thorn, has changed that experience for me. In an interview, Thorn shared some of her thoughts and experiences regarding Nocturne and trans representation in games.

Alas, the prospect of such a project has had fresh water poured over it this weekend, with Kitase explaining that, given it's already taken them ten years to make Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (with a third entry to complete the trilogy yet to come), a Final Fantasy 6 remake would likely take twice as long as that to actually make. And you know what? I'm good, actually. The Final Fantasy 6 Pixel Remaster is good enough for me in this lifetime.

Given how everything new and exciting ultimately becomes normal and mundane, this is perhaps an unfair expectation of technology that is now a decade old. Nonetheless, if you want me to sit with a shoebox pressed uncomfortably against my eyes for two hours like an ocular gom jabbar, then what's inside the shoebox better be pretty darned transformative.
Which is to say that LEGO Bricktales provided one of those moments. I was sat in my living room, with all its clutter visible through the Quest 3's coloured passthrough, and hovering above my table was a great big LEGO diorama of a jungle. All of it was rendered perfectly to scale, as if I could pick up the minifigs between my thumb and forefinger. Yet all of it was moving of its own accord, as if I'd somehow stumbled into a child's dream.

This entry in the series is from far from the first Prince of Persia game, but it represented a reboot of sorts and has become the game most identified with the franchise. It also is undeniably important to what would eventually become Assassin's Creed.
Join superfan Kyle Hilliard and Prince of Persia newcomer Wesley LeBlanc for a look at the 2003 classic. This isn't the first time we've revisited Ubisoft's classic platformer. You can watch our original Replay episode on Sands of Time from 2015 here.

Let us consider the welcome arrival of fresh white snowbells a prompt to scrub hard. When spring starts, I'll want to be outside, instantly outside, not cleaning. Anyway!

I am already concerned the same might be true of Arco's demo, which is now available on Steam. You've hopefully read Katharine's breakdown of this "triptych of revenge stories set across the deserts, plains and forests of a fantastical, South American-style landscape". Well, now's your chance to get to grips with its nifty combat system, which is broken into turns with each turn's actions unfolding in real time.

Honestly, did no one remember that February's Next Fest starts in, you know, February, in a week a bit's time this year? I'm all for getting a few things early to make the deluge of demos a bit more manageable to cover, but this year has just been a teensy bit insane. Now there's too many things to look at in advance, but hey, I'm making steady progress, and you've probably seen the fruits of a couple of these this week already. Next on the list is Dystopika, a toy-like sandbox citybuilder that's sort of in the same vein as the lovely Summerhouse I played earlier this week, but also lives at the exact opposite end of the mood and vibes scale. Whereas Summerhouse is about creating diddly little cute streets with sunny Mediterranean vibes, Dystopika is effectively: Build Your Own Blade Runner.

You have to supervise them constantly, not relax and watch them grow organically while eating a sandwich and only occasionally intervening like a neglectful goddess.
Writer's Rush is sort of, sort of an idle game, I'd argue. It's a low pressure, low stakes, super light sim that takes the barest hint of the clicker and crosses it with sort of-sort of-sort of score attack, and somehow works without quite feeling like either. Because, I think, of its charmingly, intentionally daft representation of what being a novelist is like.

Alongside this news, Blizzard president Mike Ybarra also announced he was departing from the company, and we learned the aforementioned survival game had been canceled. 
However, Blizzard didn't really touch on why the game it had just announced exactly two years prior was canceled. Bloomberg's new report details development struggles around the game's engine, which was prototyped using Epic Games' Unreal Engine before "Blizzard executives decided to switch…]]></summary>

I was innocently carving myself a nice stone foundation last night when the Devil jogged my elbow and I dug a massive, raggedy trench straight through it. I've spent an hour now trying to fill in the trench and flatten it out, to no avail. There's always a jaggedy bit right in the middle, and I'm getting displaced trypophobia from the awareness that my efforts have seeded the terrain beneath with random cavities.
What's worse, there is no mention of enhancing the floor-levelling functionality in this Keen Games forum post on Enshrouded's various launch issues, which they are even now racing to fix. Instead, it's all talk of frame rates, multiplayer stability and dedicated servers not appearing. Somebody rush me a cement mixer, stat, or I'm moving back to Valheim.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth isn’t exactly spawned from the most hardware-bothering of game series. Most previous LADs, be they Kiryu’s Adventures in Punching or the more turn-based reboot have all been technically gentle affairs, and Infinite Wealth is ultimately another one. At the same time, it shares with Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name a newfound interest in PC-specific tricks. That means a full selection of DLSS, FSR and XeSS upscalers, plus DLSS 3 frame generation. Real yakuza might use a gamepad, but it seems real fuzz-haired RPG fantasists use graphics cards.
Let’s take a closer look, then, at how RGG’s latest crime caper performs on PC. We’ll also work out its best settings, to keep it running smoother than a legally distinct Segway.

I'm excited, therefore, that Adventure mode is coming soon to the Steam version of the game, and excited even more so that it's aiming to make it even more accessible.

A new update on development which outlines exactly how the new premium version of Adventure mode differs from the original, including its plan for tutorials to guide new players.

Cut to several hours later and I've had to forcibly shut the game down and wrench myself away from it just to write this post, because listen, you need to go and play Balatro's demo right now, because hot damn this is the good stuff if you're into roguelike deckbuilders. I also say this as someone who's never played or understood a game of poker in her life, because let's face it, regular poker is quite boring. Balatro, on the other hand, is poker that's turbo-charged with magic Joker cards, tarot card multipliers, and blind conditions that make a successful hand increasingly tricky to pull off. And it's coming out in full real soon, too.

Despite what various delays had me believing, Skull and Bones is actually shaping up to be, at the very least, a fun and competent experience. Because I've played so many of its disparate parts rather than the whole, I believe there's something really good in the game.

This news comes from Kotaku, which learned from a source with knowledge of the situation that these layoffs were announced yesterday, January 24, and that more information about them would be provided next week. 
Game Informer has reached out to Black Forest Games and will update this story if it learns more. 


Kotaku writes that its source says creative directors and most, "if not all," of the managers at Black Forest Games will keep their jobs following the layoffs. At approximately 110 employees as of last year, 50 job cuts would equate to a roughly 50 percent reduction in staff at the studio.

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for Orion Burger, the classic game by Sanctuary Woods. The engine also adds a few niceties that the original didn't have, such as mouse wheel handling, and using the spacebar to skip walk animations - something the original didn't do properly.
Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game's logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation. And please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, luck be with you. And remember, with the aliens cheating on the tests they set up for you, this will be no easy task.
