        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Sonic the Hedgehog 2 launched on Sega Genesis in 1992, it took the foundation laid with the Blue Blur's debut entry and expanded it in myriad ways. In the 16-bit sequel, Sonic had new moves and a two-tailed fox friend to aid him, but with those upgrades came more significant threats from the evil Dr. Robotnik. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 on Genesis was immediately regarded as a definite upgrade over the already strong first entry in the series. Similarly, Paramount's Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie expands the universe established by its predecessor and delivers a better overall film thanks to bigger action setpieces, laugh-out-loud gags, and some terrific fanservice moments.

Its challenge is simple: pull a sword out of a stone by left-click grabbing it and pulling your mouse upwards. Its catch is devious: with each new player crowned king, the sword gets longer and heavier. Do you have the perseverence to be royal? It's free to find out.

If you’ve been hitting the links online in Everybody’s Golf, your days on the green are now numbered. Sony has announced that the online servers for the 2017 title are shutting down later this year.
The shutdown occurs on September 30, as per a message that appears when you visit the game’s PlayStation Store page. It also states that “all online features (including online multiplayer modes) will cease on that date. You will still be able to play and enjoy the game in single-player offline modes.” 
That means Everybody Golf will lose its online open-course exploration, where players could freely roam courses and communicate with other players. It also lets players indulge in non-golfing activities such as fishing and swimming. Competitive options such as the game’s Turf Mode and international tournaments will also fall to the wayside. 
Furthermore, this also means that the following online-dependent trophies will no longer be attainable:
Platinum Trophy – “Push it to the Limit!”
Gold Trophy – “Walking Encyclopaedia”
Bronze Trophy – “Online Debut”
Everybody Golf launched in August 2017 and was the first entry to drop the North American Hot Shots Golf branding (it was always Everybody’s Golf in Japan). Though it wasn’t exactly a hole-in-one in terms of features or depth out of the box, it’s always sad to see another online mode fall to server cuts. There’s no official explanation for the shutdown, but maintaining servers costs money. One must assume the online community isn’t active enough to justify keeping the lights on at this point.

After weeks of Forspoken fun, the video portion of our coverage is coming to an end. But we're not going quietly into that good night. We have one last 4K episode of New Gameplay Today with developer Luminous Productions' exciting followup to Final Fantasy XV, including even more exclusive looks at the game. 
Click here to watch embedded media
Join Alex Stadnik as he assembles the dream team to go into the nitty-gritty of Forspoken with industry powerhouses Kim Wallace and Jill Grodt. The three of them kick things off with a look at an area of the game that has been ravaged by The Break, a storm that's causing inhabitants of Athia to mutate into fantastical and disturbing creatures. Just like our previous coverage, protagonist Frey Holland's powers are on full display, showing off her vast array of spells she can wield and all the gorgeous particle effects to compliment them. We also jump into our hands-off thoughts on the game's traversal and discuss why we hope it will be one of the highlights of our experience. 
Finally, we wrap up this fun 10-minute look at the game with our closing thoughts on Square Enix's next action RPG, and what we're thinking of our time seeing the game ahead of its October 11 release date for PlayStation 5 and PC.
We know you're sad our coverage of Forspoken is wrapping up shortly, but fear not. We still have one more written piece coming to the website. If that's just not enough, you can enjoy plenty of Forspoken content, including our written and video looks at the numerous spells in the game, our preview impressions on an episode of The Game Informer Show, and so much more. Be sure to click on the image below to head over to our coverage hub as well. Thank you so much for watching, and we hope you enjoy this beautiful 4K episode of New Gameplay Today!]]></summary>

It removed building entirely, and that was around nine days ago. Now there's a new update which renames Fortnite's main mode to "Zero Build", suggesting the change might stick around for a while.

Publisher Bandai Namco has announced that it will be delisting Fast & Furious Crossroads on April 29, effectively ending all sales of it. 
This news comes by way of a small update on the game’s official website that says “all product sales will end on” April 28, 2022 at 7 p.m. PT/10 p.m. ET/4 a.m. CEST (on April 29), as reported by Video Games Chronicle. What this means is that if you don’t own Fast & Furious Crossroads come April 29, you won’t be able to buy it digitally at any point after that. However, because it was released physically, you could always track down a hard copy of the game. 
Bandai Namco says that “if you bought the game digitally, it will remain in your library and can be redownloaded in the future.” DLC for it will be delisted on April 29 as well, so if you’re interested in owning that, you’ll need to purchase it soon. The DLC is completely digital so don’t rely on physical copies of Fast & Furious Crossroads to add it to your library, because that won’t be possible. Despite all of this, its online functionality will remain active. 
For more about Fast & Furious Crossroads, watch its zany reveal at The Game Awards 2019, which saw stars Vin Diesel (Dominic Toretto) and Michelle Rodriguez (Letty Ortiz) take to the stage to talk about the game. Read Game Informer’s Fast & Furious Crossroads review after that.

We know surprisingly little about the game currently titled The Sequel To The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild. But that won't stop me from furiously speculating about it all the same, based on all the trailers we've got so far, and all the things I know about the Zelda games!
Presumably, you've clicked on this feature because you also love wild theories, so welcome to my equivalent of a shed covered in newspaper clippings and red strings. Today, I'm focusing particularly on the new feature I'm going to call "Link's Weird Arm", which could be the main new mechanic in BOTW2. We just don't know!

Bungie tweeted that they weren't responsible, but that they were "aware of a series of copyright takedowns" and were actively investigating. Some of their own videos had also been taken offline.

Now Bungie have filed a lawsuit in Washington against ten John Does, hoping to make an example of those who filed the "fraudulent" takedown notices.

Crystar is an intriguing RPG from recent years, as it has battle mechanics centred around crying - apparently. Originally a PS4 exclusive, NIS America has stepped in to bring it to Switch.
Ahead of its release later this week we have the official launch trailer, at the top of the page. It follows the usual playbook, in some respects, with dramatic piano-led music and lots of dramatic voiceover clips that doesn't necessarily make much sense. It looks darn interesting, though.

Seemingly alluding to the fact that Xbox Game Studios titles launch day-one on Xbox Game Pass, Ryan said if PlayStation were to do this, it would break the company’s “virtuous” release cycle. This news comes by way of a new interview with Ryan over at GamesIndustry.biz, who spoke to the CEO about today’s PS Plus news. 
“We feel like we are in a good virtuous cycle with the studios where the investment delivers success, which enables yet more investment, which del…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Zero Build is a pure test of weapon, item, and traversal ability".
When the latest Season kicked off in Fortnite it made the bold move of stopping building for 9 days, making it play more like a standard Battle Royale. It was pitched as a temporary move that combined with new traversal abilities to shake up gameplay, but there was plenty of chatter online to suggest that it'd become a permanent mode.
That has now happened, with Epic Games releasing the Zero Build update. It adds no building as an alternative mode, with the same flexibility in terms of playing in Solo, Duos, Trios, and Squads playlists. The standard mode with all of the building is back too, so evidently Epic is confident that the game's enormous player base can sustain more playlists while catering to those that want a slightly purer Battle Royale experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After months of rumours, Sony have finally unveiled their answer to Xbox Game Pass today. Starting this June, their new subscription service will unite PlayStation Plus and their cloud streaming platform PlayStation Now under one roof, offering three different tiers of membership. Most of it isn't that relevant to us on PC, but the final, most expensive tier, PlayStation Plus Premium, will include that aforementioned cloud streaming to PC, letting us play hundreds of PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4 and PSP games without having to own an actual PlayStation.
It's not yet clear how that library of games will differ from the current PlayStation Now library, but one thing is certain: this is a move that definitely benefits people with a PlayStation and a PC more than it does standalone PC peeps. And yet, even as someone who falls into the former camp of PlayStation and PC owners, I'm still not sure this new PS+ is something I actually want. Sure, there's that massive retro collection on offer, but no Day One games I can either play on my console or stream to PC? On your bike, Sony. Personally, I see this as more of a dip-in and dip-out kinda deal to indulge my occasional retro cravings, but I'm keen to know what you, RPS readers, think of this new PS Plus offering as well. Does it appeal in any shape or form? And how does it compare to Game Pass for you? Let's chat about it below.

Guilty Gear Strive launched last summer and is still going strong with DLC characters and Evo fighting tournaments. I bet you never expected a former president to make an appearance in the game. That’s right, Bill Clinton is a prop in the background of one of Guilty Gear Strive’s various arenas. Sure he’s not a playable fighter, but he is a gracious spectator.
Gamespot provided the details of why his inclusion is so cheeky and ironic. Clinton condemned a 1999 ad for the game: “kill your friends, guilt free.” Guilty Gear wasn’t the only title mentioned. Still, in a video I’ll link here, Clinton does state that the violence apparent in the slogan mentioned above is “the most unbelievable [example]” of all the games he criticized. While this speech has seemingly been lost to time, Guilty Gear fans have taken pride in their favorite fighter’s beratement. Now, Clinton is the latest addition to the game all these years later. Things always come full circle, don’t they?
I booted up figure mode in Strive and I am happy to say we have come full circle. pic.twitter.com/hn0v3RFEu8

The picture of Clinton (seen above) is pretty blurry, but that’s undoubtedly him. The update dropped yesterday with the White House Reborn map that features the 42nd president of the United States, the addition of fan-favorite fighter Testament, and the Digital Figure mode which was used to discover the Clinton photo in the first place. Guilty Gear Strive’s second season is off to a hilariously good start.

Polishing off the last few shrines and giving Calamity Ganon what-for in the final battle of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was a bittersweet act. After such a wonderful, rich journey it was time to bid farewell to Link, Zelda and the largest, most expansive iteration of Hyrule we’d ever visited - what were we going to do with ourselves?
Of course, we returned to devour the DLC and burn across the kingdom on our motorcycle while vacuuming up several hundred Korok seeds, but then began the wait for the next 'proper' Zelda game. Sure, in the intervening time we've had Cadence of Hyrule, the Link’s Awakening remake, and Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Calamity, and there are plenty of Zelda-like games available for Switch, but there’s nothing quite like a full-fat Zelda experience.

General Mills will be releasing two Sonic branded food products, with the obligatory breakfast cereal taking center stage. Featuring honey-flavored rings with spin dash and chaos emerald marshmallows, this cereal is going all out on representing Sega's mascot. There's also a "fun back-of-the-box activity for a speedy way to start the day." Neat!
Michael Cisneros, Senior Manager of Licensing at SEGA of America has this to say about the partnership:
“General Mills is one of the foremost brands in the food industry — especially when it comes to youth-focused products, so we’re thrilled to partner up with them. This partnership is a really fun and creative way to integrate some iconic aspects of the Sonic games into a whole new product line, and we’re excited to introduce it to Sonic fans.”
Also getting the Sonic treatment is a box of fruit snacks which we don't have any details about yet, other than its existence. Both products are considered "special editions," so don't expect these to last on grocery store shelves for long. They're going to go fast!

Most of the snippets in the video above were from the previous teaser trailer, but at the 53 second mark we get a new look at Link in the sky area. As you can see we get a look at his tattoos / markings on his right arm, his tattered yet Triforce-themed clothes, and the Master Sword in a gnarly / corrupted form.

Nintendo has shared an update regarding The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2: it's being delayed until 2023.
Originally scheduled for a 2022 release — and reconfirmed for that launch window last month (albeit with 'temp.' appended) — series boss Eiji Aonuma presented the short update and apologised to fans who had been expecting to play the game some time this year.

Multimedia projects can be tremendous accomplishments when pulled off right, drawing upon the unique strengths of different mediums to tell an all-encompassing tale. In the early 2000s, Bandai took a shot at one with Project .hack, which began with an anime and spun out to include a manga, a series of novels, and a four-part collection of video games for the PlayStation 2. This was then repeated with a follow up called .hack Conglomerate that moved forward a bit in the in-universe timeline to establish a new era of stories and characters. The main games to come out of this second wave were the .hack//G.U. trilogy, which saw a re-release on modern consoles in 2017 as .hack//G.U. Last Recode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dedicated tabletop gaming tables have been gaining steam for some time now, offering custom solutions for players who want a more nuanced solution for where to play out RPG or board game nights. Game Theory Tables is one of the recognized players in the category, thanks largely to the success of its customizable Origins table. Today, the team is launching a new crowdfunding drive for that table and a recently announced new coffee table format of a similar design, alongside a substantial discount on their standard pricing.
The original Origins table was most notable for its customizability, including a choice of wood color, playmats, cupholders, and optional accessories like USB chargers and dice-rolling towers. But its chief success lies in its recessed design, which offered a 4-inch recessed play area, which a dining top could cover, keeping in-process games in stasis while the family enjoys dinner, and allowing the game to pick back up when the group is ready to get back to the action.
The new coffee table variation of the Origins table seems to recognize that many players have switched to a more relaxed approach to game night get-togethers. The idea seems to be that the crowd is gathered in easy chairs and couches, leaning in to take a turn when the time is right, but you still want a suitable play space.
Alongside the new coffee table twist, Game Theory is also updating the original Origins table for its latest run in 2022.
The two options are headed into a new crowdfunding drive, with a planned slate of 650 units of each table available for purchase, and with pricing marked to 30 percent below Game Theory’s standard website pricing. If you’ve been waiting and considering springing for a new play surface to enjoy with your gaming group, the Kickstarter goes live today.]]></summary>

The April 2022 PlayStation Plus lineup has reportedly leaked. It includes Hood: Outlaws & Legends as its main PlayStation 5 title alongside two PlayStation 4 games: Slay The Spire and SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle For Bikini Bottom Rehydrated. 
This news comes by way of French forum Dealabs user billbil-kun, who has leaked the PS Plus lineup almost every month for the past seven months, as reported by Eurogamer. Now, while billbil-kun has been accurate in the past, it's important to note that this is still a potential leak and not official wording, so there's alwa…]]></summary>

They're merging it with their PlayStation Plus service and adding a giant library of games as some sort of multi-tiered mega-Game Pass doodad. It's not clear how exactly this will change things for people who are already using PS Now to play PlayStation games on PC, but it sounds like maaaybe they'll add Marvel's Spider-Man, at least? For now, they're vague about the whole thing.

Just two weeks after AMD confirmed a date and price for their own champion, the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, Intel have formally unveiled the Core i9-12900KS: a new addition to the 12th Gen Alder Lake lineup that promises superlative performance and up to 5.5GHz clock speeds.


That’s all less than five months since the launch of the original Intel Core i9-12900K, which as far as I can tell actually is the best CPU for gaming right now in pure performance terms. And the Core i9-12900KS is even set to beat the Ryzen 7 5800X3D to shelves, releasing on April 5th to the Ryzen’s April 20th street date. No brakes on the top-tier processor train, it seems.

Apex Legends is still one of the most bombastic and frenetic battle royales on the market. I've been covering its growth for a while, but The Warriors Collection event, dropping today, might bring the most notable and highly-anticipated change to Respawn's Titanfall-adjacent shooter in years: a next-gen update. This upgrade launches with 4K resolution and 60fps, among other exciting features. However, further additions are in the works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russia openly attacked and invaded Ukraine on February 24 after weeks of mounting tensions between the two countries, with hundreds of Ukrainian citizens reportedly killed by bombings and Russian militia as a result. As the world watches this historical and terrifying event unfold, efforts have begun to aid civilians and organizations on the ground floor and those displaced, like the Ukrainian Red Cross. Many of these efforts have come from studios within the video game industry, some in the form of charity drives, others with public displays of support for Ukraine.

Bandai Namco has just revealed its grand vision for the Gundam metaverse project during the Third Gundam Conference, which was held on March 29th.
The company plans to "develop a metaverse for each IP as a new framework for connecting with fans" with work starting in April. Mobile Suit Gundam is the first IP, and its metaverse will be set in space colonies packed with all sorts of Gundam content – which will include video games, anime, model kits ("Gunpla") and much more. Users will be able to access these colonies through their virtual avatars and interact with others. Bandai Namco is calling the Gundam metaverse "SIDE-G".

The Switch has an impressive range of shoot 'em ups, and we're still getting regular new releases to check out. One lower profile entry that arrived recently on the eShop is Andro Dunos 2, but if you're a fan of the genre you shouldn't sleep on it. We gave this one a hearty recommendation in our recent review.

Best Nintendo Switch Shmups

If you're a physical collector, though, you're in luck. Publisher VGNYsoft is carrying the baton in this case for developer PixelHeart. Pre-orders are now open for Q2 shipping of physical editions for both Switch and 3DS, as this is a title that is also on Nintendo's last-gen portable (and it supports stereoscropic 3D!).

Whew, that's a lot of parts smushed together, but think of it like a baby's first Hunt: Showdown. You're a Prospector, tasked with descending into Fortuna 3, an alien planet filled with minerals and plant matter and dinosaurs. Corpos hire you to get these goods and bring them back safely. The catch is other players and inconvenient helicopter schedules. Other Prospectors will murder you for your precious rocks and weeds, so your aim is to get a helicopter out of Fortuna before this happens. It's a setup where success breeds success in its current closed beta form, but failure also begets frustration. In the end, you might wish Fortuna was yours and yours alone.

Still, for seasoned fans of the loot shooter series, this does make the search for Wonderlands’ best settings a treading of comfortably familiar ground. Even if there are wizards this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It all started going wrong when I died taking on the old McDuckitt job. In Abermore, you play as a thief making a name for themselves in its titular city. Every day you wake up, leave your apartment and hit the streets, chatting to the locals, picking up a bit of info, even gambling a bit. The folks you meet are from the shadier side of society and they'll hire you for jobs. Sometimes it’s simple burglary, sometimes it's breaking a vase, or snatching a specific bit of loot. There’s even a guy who keeps trying to offer me wet work! It all boils down to the same thing though: sneaking around some rich guy’s place, disabling the security, avoiding or taking down the occupants, and getting out without being caught. Afterwards, I fence the loot and head to bed.
It's all building up to Abermore's central heist: The Feast of the Lucky Few. It's also my only chance to rescue the famous Hanged Man, a dame I met on the boat over here. They're the thief of thieves! A living legend! But the tyrant king grabbed her before we got ashore and she’ll be executed in eighteen days if I don’t break her out. That’s eighteen nights to prepare, eighteen jobs to build the resources, the connections I need for the heist of a life time. A terrible shame, then, that alarm bells started ringing almost as soon as I started playing.

We've heard how there are already mods for the unofficial PC port of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and we've seen some in action.

The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil In Me is the upcoming installment in Supermassive Games’ collection of horror games and the season finale. So far, a cinematic trailer has established the atmosphere for the scares to come, and now we know that Academy Award-nominated actress Jessie Buckley will star in the game.
Buckley will lend her voice and likeness to the game’s protagonist, Kate Wilder. The actress’ film credits include The Lost Daughter (which earned her an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actress at the 2022 Academy Awards), Wild Rose, and Judy. She’s also had notable TV roles on series such as Fargo and Chernobyl. 
Get ready for an unforgettable stay…

The Devil In Me follows a documentary film crew that gets invited to explore a replica of the home of America’s first serial killer, H.H. Holmes. While exploring the ominously named “Murder Castle,” things quickly take a turn for the worse as the crew is stalked by a dangerous figure. 
The Devil In Me ostensibly launches this year given the yearly release cadence of previous Dark Pictures games but Supermassive has not confirmed a release window.  It will serve as the finale of the first season of the Anthology. It was assumed that the final four entries in the planned eight-game series would make up Season 2; however, Supermassive recently trademarked the titles of five more games, bringing the total number to 10. 
Supermassive has a busy 2022 ahead because it also has the summer camp slasher horror game The Quarry hitting this June. The studio deems this star-studded title as a spiritual successor to Until Dawn. You can learn more about what that The Quarry entails here.]]></summary>

So you got your hands on an Xbox Series X? Congratulations! As you've probably noticed by now, the hardware allows for lightning fast gaming when compared to previous generations, and the Quick Resume feature that allows you to seamlessly change games is, well, a game-changer. While the feature set of the Xbox Series X is impressive (not to mention its stellar backward compatibility library), you probably want some games to play on that beast of a console.

Far From Home has released a new trailer for its upcoming first-person survival sci-fi game, Forever Skies, and it showcases the impressive verticality players will be scaling on an abandoned, decrepit Earth. 
Forever Skies was revealed back in January. Far From Home showed then that players will control a scientist who returns to a devastated Earth to scavenge for remains while discovering what’s changed on their former home planet. Following an ecological disaster, Earth has been left heavily coated in a thick layer of toxic dust, and you’ll need to discover why this happened and how to survive it while you’re there. At the heart of the game’s survival exploration is your air…]]></summary>

Despite its acclaim and popularity, One Piece continues to be a harrowing viewing experience because of its unprecedented number of episodes. Good thing games like the Pirate Warriors series and World Seeker are around to quickly help fill in any story gaps or side content that players haven't seen yet. And now, a new RPG called One Piece Odyssey is joining that ever-growing catalog. The team behind last year's Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are helming the game's development.

Fahmi, the creator and writer of the acclaimed indie visual novel game Coffee Talk, has passed away.
Fahmi’s sister as well as the official Coffee Talk Twitter account broke the sad news of the Indonesian developer’s sudden passing yesterday. Fahmi, whose full name was Mohammad Fahmi, was 32 years old. No cause of death has been given. At the time of his passing, Fahmi was working on the upcoming slice-of-life adventure game, Afterlove EP.
Today we received a devastating news that Fahmi, the creator & writer of Coffee Talk, has passed away. May his soul rest in peace, and our hearts are with his family and loved ones.
March 28, 2022
According to IGN, Fahmi was born in 1990 and began his career at Gameloft as a programmer and designer. He joined Tangerang-based Toge Productions as a marketing and PR manager where he wrote and developed Coffee Talk, which released in 2020. The game became a critical hit and has since become Toge Productions most successful title; a sequel is currently in the works. Prior to working at Toge Productions, Fahmi was also the former Editor-in-Chief of the Games Department for the Jakarta technology outlet Tech in Asia. Following Coffee Talk’s success, Fahmi went on to open his own studio, Pikslenesia, where he created the side-scrolling narrative adventure game What Comes After. 
Today we received the sad news that Fahmi, lead developer of Afterlove EP, has passed away.
March 28, 2022
Fahmi was a supremely talented creator and his passing is a major blow to the Southeast Asian game development community as well as the indie gaming scene at large. Game Informer extends its deepest condolences to Fahmi’s family and friends.]]></summary>

Elden Ring is a massive game, both in terms of the actual world and the scale/scope of the action RPG. Having been out for just a month, players are still discovering all kinds of secrets, and something tells us that will continue to happen for months, if not years. 
One player, JesterPatches, who is well-known for digging deep into From Software games, posted on Twitter yesterday that they had discovered icons not used in Elden Ring (but still in the files of the game) that point toward what might have once been a bestiary, as reported by Eurogamer.

A new trailer for Arc System Works and Eighting's latest fighting game DNF Duel has dropped, once again highlighting the Ghost Blade's combat style, but this time with a new beta announcement attached at the end. 
PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 owners (sorry, PC players) will get to grind out rounds of DNF Duel starting on April 1 at 7 p.m. Pacific and lasting until April 4 at 7 a.m. Pacific. The testing period's roster isn't confirmed, but every character is present in the trailer, just like in the previous beta announcement, leading me to believe all 11 characters will be playable this weekend.

The previous open beta allowed players to battle in online lobbies to test out the game's rollback netcode and the 10 characters available at the time. There's no word on whether other modes like training or offline multiplayer will be available for this beta. 
DNF Duel will be launching on June 28 for PS5, PS4, and PC.]]></summary>

Kirby and the Forgotten Land had a big launch in the U.K. and that’s usually a great sign for a game, as we wait for U.S. numbers (and others) to be released. 
Sometimes, a week or so after a game’s launch, Nintendo will publicly reveal how much a game has sold like it did with Pokemon Legends: Arceus in February. While Nintendo hasn’t yet done that for Kirby’s first full-featured 3D debut, GamesIndustry.biz reports that it landed at the top of the “U.K. Boxed Charts in its first week,” beating out what likely is its biggest release-week competitor, Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, which came in second.

In fact, GamesIndustry.biz reports that Kirby and the Forgotten Land had the biggest launch ever for a Kirby game in the U.K., selling 2.5 times the number of copies in its first week as the previous best, 2018’s Kirby Star Allies. This is actually Kirby’s first top-spot debut, too. 
With less than a full week on the market, Kirby and the Forgotten Land is already the fifth best-selling Kirby game in the U.K. Elsewhere in U.K. video game sales, GhostWire: Tokyo, which also launched the same week as Kirby and Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, debuted in the eleventh spot. 
For more, read Game Informer’s reviews of last week’s new games: Kirby and the Forgotten Land review, Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands review, and GhostWire: Tokyo review.

BioShock Infinite just had its nine-year anniversary on Saturday, having first released on March 26, 2013, and now, fans are noticing something odd about the PC version of the game: it has quietly received 13 updates this month. 
That’s quite a lot of updates, but it’s more than a dozen on top of multiple that have consistently gone live in BioShock Infinite since roughly September 2021, as reported by TheGamer. What’s odd is that 2K, the publisher behind BioShock Infinite, hasn’t really publicly acknowledged these updates. On top of that, there’s no confirmed reasoning behind them either as BioShock Infinite remains the same game it was before the updates started happening. 
According to TheGamer, it received seven updates in 2021 and now, in March alone, it’s had 13. Players have begun speculating about what these updates mean, and why they’re happening, and some have arrived at a possible remaster of BioShock Infinite, or a new-gen update (which could theoretically affect the PC version). Others think that perhaps 2K is working on some back-end stuff to make BioShock Infinite a Steam Deck-ready game. 
However, what seems most likely is some behind-the-scenes work on 2K launch integration, as pointed out by LitheBeep on Reddit. Zorklis on Reddit, in response, said one of the updates features “2K Launcher Development Branch” in it, seemingly confirming that the updates have to do with this launcher and not anything more exciting like a remaster or new-gen update. Perhaps 2K will end the speculation by letting everyone know what’s going on with BioShock Infinite. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer’s BioShock Infinite review and then listen to Game Informer’s Video Gameography crew dive deep into the history of BioShock. After that, read about what we want from BioShock 4.

Endnight Games has announced that its upcoming survival game, Sons Of The Forest, has been delayed from its original May release window to October. 
This news comes by way of Endnight Games’ own Twitter, where the studio announced that its vision of the game is too ambitious for it to hit its May 2022 release date. The team needs more time to bring its vision to life, and it’s taking an additional five months to do just that. 
Hey Everyone,

March 25, 2022
As you can see in the tweet above, Endnight Games included a quick snippet of video showcasing some things in Sons Of The Forest, including what appears to be a dazed NPC, the protagonist eating a raw fish, a log shelter being built, a target being unfolded, and more. 
The last we saws of Sons Of The Forest was in a December trailer that showcased how terrifyingly brutal the survival game is, with some sequences appearing to be straight-up horror. Sons Of The Forest builds upon The Forest’s survival mechanics, which included collecting materials to craft shelters and build hunting tools, finding and foraging food to keep you alive, and more. Endnight Games’ latest looks like a treat for fans of the genre. We’ll all find out this October. 
For more, watch this release date trailer for Sons Of The Forest and then read about 30 gross things you can do in The Forest. Find out why it’s one of our most anticipated horror games this year after that.

It usually works very well, with the added benefit that I don't have to get on a plane anywhere. I had one of these for Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong last week, an upcoming thrillery-puzzley-investigation-RPG set in The World Of Darkness universe (aka all them vampy games), by Big Bad Wolf, who did The Council. For various reasons, however, my preview went terribly. But if it had gone well, I probably wouldn't be as excited for Swansong as I now am.

The hideous hounds of Dark Souls and Bloodborne were bad enough, but Elden Ring takes canine combat to a whole other level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The four-sided heroes of Patrick's Parabox and Wilmot's Warehouse would be great friends, I think. They both specialise in the placement and movement of boxes, and they both share the same cheery disposition. Sure, Patrick may not have the same pointy nose or cheeky smile of his mate Wilmot, but the way his eyes rove from side to side as he wiggles to the beat of Priscilla Snow's meditative and upbeat electronic soundtrack is surely a sign of someone who is truly in love with what they do. 
If anything, I reckon Wilmot would be a wee bit jealous of Patrick. You see, in Patrick's line of work, his cubes contain multitudes, to misquote that famous Walt Whitman line. As long as they're resting against a hard surface, cubes can be packed into other cubes in Patrick's Parabox like a stack of matryoshka dolls. They can also be unpacked in the same way, allowing him to navigate the tight constraints of his respective puzzle arenas with surprising dexterity. It's like he's discovered the TARDIS of sokoban-style cube-pushing, if you will, and cor, just imagine what Wilmot could do with such technology. That warehouse would be immaculate.

The employee, named as "Jane Doe" in the lawsuit, also alleges that she had to accept a lower paid job within the company to escape the sexism, and that she was passed over for better roles after she complained.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that season 4 of Video Gameography is complete, and the Uncharted series has been, well...charted, it's off to new frontiers and fresh faces. After saying farewell to co-host Ben Reeves in the last episode, we welcome GI Associate Editor John Carson to the podcast as the new co-host alongside the ever-present Marcus Stewart. Along with a series of guests, season 5 of Video Gameography will be an exploration and examination of 2K's Bioshock franchise.
So, we cordially ask, would you kindly follow us into the depths of the sea? We're headed to the city of Rapture, made by and for movers and shakers, unbound by the expectations and judgments of the surface world.
Developed by Irrational Games (AKA 2K Boston) and released in 2007, Bioshock reimagined and redefined what a modern shooter could be. In this episode, we explore the origins of the series stemming from the commercial failures of the well-loved PC franchise System Shock and the turbulent development cycle in which Bioshock triumphantly succeeded in spite of. We discuss director Ken Levine's inspirations of Rapture and its inhabitants like the industrial mastermind Andrew Ryan, the Big Daddies, Little Sisters, and much more.
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), and Game Informer Associate Editor Wesley LeBlanc (@LeBlancWes) as we unpack the history and narrative of the first Bioshock! 
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

Kirby’s inaugural 3D adventure is finally here with Nintendo and Hal Laboratory’s Switch exclusive Kirby and the Forgotten Land. It’s a wonderful trek (read our review) through an abandoned land that looks awfully like our own, where the cute, yet dastardly Beast Pack have taken over the various cities, factories, malls, and theme parks. Here are some tantalizing suggestions to keep in mind while you venture into the worlds set in the Forgotten Land.

How old should your children be when introducing them to video games? What are the best titles to teach them how to use a controller? Are there games that both a youngster and adult will find equally enjoyable?
As a father of a nine-year-old daughter, I get asked these questions frequently by people with children of their own, and I always stumble with my response as I try to recall the route I took to acclimate her to games. Most kids want to play games at an early age, yet there aren’t many resources out there that help parents and guardians find a safe and re…]]></summary>

Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga may let you relieve all nine films from the eyes of its greatest heroes, but where would they be without their foils? A new trailer runs down all of the baddies sworn to the Dark Side or otherwise that you'll be crossing plastic lightsabers with or play yourself.
The trailer gives us shots at humorous takes on Kylo Ren (with TT Games leaning into the shirtless Kylo memes), an organ-playing Palpatine, General Grievous, Boba Fett, and, of course, Darth Vader. The video also gives us an unexpectedly fun twist on Order 66.

Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is fast approaching, which is good news given how long it's been in the development pipeline. Billed as the ultimate Lego Star Wars experience, the ambitious title lets players relive the nine mainline films, which you can play in any order, completely rebuilt in a new engine from the ground-up (as well as the first Lego iterations on The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker). That means even fans who played previous Lego Star Wars titles won't be getting the same games they finished years ago. Although the development wasn't without significant bumps in the road, we look forward to seeing how it all comes together when Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga launches on April 5.
For more on the game, you can read TT Games explain how The Skywalker Saga feels like one cohesive galaxy and how it will receive post-launch DLC based on The Mandalorian.]]></summary>

After flinging herself up a sheer cliff face with the help of some high-flying parkour magic, Forspoken’s protagonist, Frey, approaches a rotunda made of stone and metal. Blazing in the center of the structure is a pool erupting with a glowing, flame-like aura.

Overcoming its challenges will be tough, and monsters lurk within which players won’t find outside the complex.

Rocket League’s blend of soccer and car combat proved to be a massively successful example of an idea “just silly enough to work.” Turbo Golf Racing borrows from a similar playbook by combining over-the-top arcade-style racing with, you guessed it, golf. 
The upcoming title pits players in a chaotic race to guide their respective giant balls into a big hole. You can jump, dash, glide, and flip your vehicles to knock balls through boost rings and past obstacles like sand traps and trees to get it in the hole before your opponents. Courses sport speed boost ramps, and barreling off hills deploys glider wings on the cars. Up to eight competitors can compete online, and you can get a taste of how races play out in the trailer below.

Equipping super cores to cars grants perks such as the ability to smack the ball greater distances or powers like a ground stomp. You can also gussy up your vehicle thanks to a range of unlockable cosmetics such as paint jobs, body types, spoilers, and tires. Free updates will add additional courses, power cords, and customization pieces.  
Turbo Golf Racing is getting a beta in the near future (which you can sign up for here) and will launch in Steam Early Access before going 1.0 later this year. When it does, the game is slated to hit Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S and will be available on Game Pass.]]></summary>

Today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central, we’ll be diving headfirst into Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands! Editors Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and Brian Shea will be blasting through the newly-launched Borderlands spin-off in co-op and showing off the game's first two hours. 
Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands retains the looter shooter template of Borderlands but injects it with a heavy dose of Dungeons & Dragons-inspired fantasy. Fan-favorite character Tiny Tina serves as a dungeon master of sorts, dictating the adventure your band of gun-toting heroes embark on. The star-studded cast boasts the voice talents of Andy Samberg, Wanda Sykes, and Will Arnett with Ashly Burch reprising her role as Tina.

After spending far, far too long trying to obsessively control every detail of Distant Worlds 2, I've accepted that I need to take my own advice and work with its macromanagement systems instead. They are, after all, the reason its ludicrous scale is workable at all beyond the opening hours, and a major reason its predecessor was so interesting and forward-thinking to begin with. But they are also a source of great friction and confusion, especially if you don't take the time to learn how they actually work.
Distant Worlds 2 is, ultimately, a game that you need to meet in the middle. Consequently, it's one that I can only partially recommend. But I really do recommend it for that part.

Tango Gameworks is currently celebrating the release of GhostWire: Tokyo, which is out on PlayStation 5 and PC today, but the studio is already preparing for future titles. Namely, ones that will showcase the studio’s strengths in genres other than horror. 
In a new interview with Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, former Resident Evil director and now Tango founder, Shinji Mikami, said he wants to change the image of Tango, as translated by Video Games Chronicle. He said that right now, he recognizes that Tango is seen as a studio that “specializes only in survival horror,” but that…]]></summary>

I'm always up for a good Zelda-like, and everything I saw of Tunic back then seemed to confirm that this was 100% a game I would like and enjoy. 
You can probably imagine my excitement, then, when Microsoft announced there would finally be a playable demo to people download during last year's E3. However, as I briefly mentioned in my post about Tunic's brilliant in-game instruction manual yesterday, I actually came away from that demo a bit disheartened. With just a single (and quite unforgiving) dungeon to explore, I was left thinking it hewed a bit too close to the Soulsian school of combat difficulty than I'd like. Upon playing the final game, however... Delight! Magic! Joy! I actually can't get enough of it. To think I almost dismissed what's now one of my early game of the year contenders on the basis of that one 20 minute demo now seems incredibly hasty on my part, but with so many games now being shoved down our throats on a daily basis, those first impressions can be devastatingly powerful.

There's very little stress and no need for detailed schemes, reflexes, or micromanaged tactics. As long as there is food, more buggos will come, and as long as there are buggos, they will loosely move in the direction you command, dying in droves but succeeding in aggregate. It's a good time that asks for little but a point to attack and a desire to consume everything in your path. I'm actually surprised at how much I want to keep playing it.

Deliver Us Mars is the newly announced sequel to 2019’s sci-fi adventure game, Deliver Us The Moon. Per the title, this time you're flung to the Red Planet on a mission to save the human race from extinction.
Set 10 years after the events of Deliver Us The Moon, humanity is on its last legs. A distress signal from Mars draws the astronaut protagonist and the Zephyr crew to investigate, where they find human colony ships in the hands of a mysterious faction called the Outward. They'll need to recover these ships while also finding answers to what's going down on the planet.

Gameplay details are scarce, but surviving Mars’ unforgiving landscape requires a blend of puzzle-solving and combat, much like the first game. The atmosphere and a powerful sense of isolation and intrigue defined Deliver Us The Moon, and Deliver Us Mars looks to have no shortage of either element. 
Deliver Us The Moon was something of a hidden gem, and we look forward to seeing how Deliver Us Mars builds upon that strong foundation. The game is “coming soon” according to developer Keoken Interactive, but we do know it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

Lego games are much more few and far between these days than they used to be last generation and the one prior to that, but there are still some releasing this year. Namely, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, which looks great. 
However, a new Lego game has been announced for 2022 and it’s called Lego Bricktales. Set in an original world, Lego Bricktales is a game more focused on the creativity of playing with Legos and ultimately, building beautiful dioramas. Announced in a trailer, it’s being developed by Clockstone, the team behind Bridge Constructor, and published by Thunderful Publishing.

Gran Turismo 7 has been heavily criticized by its player base as of late due to the game’s live-service economy. The latest simulation racer from Polyphony Digital reviewed quite well – Game Informer gave it an 8.75 out of 10 – but since its launch, the game’s credit system has been heavily scrutinized, with players citing that it’s built around encouraging microtransactions.
Things got worse for Gran Turismo 7 after scheduled maintenance expected to last two hours last week lasted for more than 24 hours, leaving the game largely unplayable due to its always-online nature. On top of that, the up…]]></summary>

Despite a possible fix being available, this has yet to work for me either, and now that the game has fully released it seems I’m not alone in my suffering.

Probably not, I'd wager. Thankfully the Box Office Game, a new browser-based Wordle-like, lets you trade points for further clues: the first billed actor, the director, the tagline, and so on. 

In doing so, it becomes a more broadly accessible movie guessing game than Framed, and I'm enjoying it a lot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Master Chief makes his official television debut today, but you won't find Microsoft's iconic green Spartan soldier on traditional TV stations. Despite being produced by Showtime, the live-action adaptation of Halo can only be found on the Paramount+ streaming service.
If you're new to Paramount+ and haven't had a subscription on file, you can sign up for a free seven-day trial and squeeze in the first episode, and maybe the second if you're quick enough when it releases next Thursday. Otherwise, a full-blown membership will run as low as $4.99 a month for an ad-supported plan or $49.99 for an entire year which saves $10 if you're okay with paying for the subscription upfront. You can sign up for the trial or subscription on the Paramount+ website. The app can be downloaded on a variety of smart devices, including the most brand synergistic way to watch Halo, on your Xbox. If you're a Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, you can snag a 30-day trial for Paramount+ thanks to membership perks available right now.
If this week's premiere episode is any indication, new episodes of Halo will go live on Paramount+ every Thursday at 2 a.m. Central. The series is scheduled to run for nine episodes; however, a second season has already been greenlit and will likely enter production sometime in the future.
Halo stars Pablo Schreiber as John–117, AKA Master Chief, Jen Taylor as Cortana, and Natascha McElhone as Dr. Catherine Halsey.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has announced its acquisition of a third video game studio in mobile developer Boss Fight Entertainment, according to The New York Times. 
Boss Fight Entertainment is based in Allen, Texas, but boasts 130 employees across studios in Austin and Seattle. One of its biggest titles is the strategy RPG Dungeon Boss, and the talent there consists of veterans that worked on games such as Halo Wars, Age of Empires, and Star Wars: The Old Republic. Netflix has not revealed how much it paid for the studio.
Since last September, Netflix has been gradually scooping up game developers to bolster its presence in the video game market. Earlier this month, it purchased Finnish mobile developer Next Games for $72 million. Netflix’s acquisition of Oxenfree developer Night School stands as its most noteworthy purchase so far. The team behind Afterparty is currently developing Oxenfree II: Lost Signals. You can read more about what the future holds for Night School in our interview with the studio’s director. 
In addition to spreading its IP into the game industry, Netflix has a plethora of video game adaptations in the pipeline. The company recently announced plans to create a Bioshock movie and a new Resident Evil series. It also renewed The Cuphead Show for a second season.

April is shaping up to be all about brick building in a galaxy far, far away. At the start of the month, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is releasing on almost every video game platform, and shortly after that, Lego is releasing three awesome new dioramas inspired by scenes from the original trilogy.
For decades, Star Wars fans have been buying Lego vehicles and location sets that sometimes allow for specific moments to be set up. This new series is all about those moments, recreating the trash compactor scene, Luke Skywalker's training on Dagobah, and the Death Star trench run. These sets focus on the little visual details to make those moments pop, and are less about play, yet still allows for a degree of interaction, such as the trash compactor closing in on the heroes.
All three sets release on April 26. The Dagobah Jedi Training Diorama retails for $79.99 and comes with exactly 1,000 pieces. The Death Star Run Diorama is $59.99 and consists of 665 pieces. The Death Star Trash Compactor Diorama is $89.99 and delivers 802 pieces. Dianoga’s head is included in this set along with six minifigures. 
You can see all three sets in the gallery below. What moment should Lego recreate next?

No update on Henry Cavill this week, but we talk a bit about Matthew's cursed trip to DisneyLand Paris, ways that Ghostbusters could take on a very different tone, and, once again, inject some serial killer energy into the podcast. Nate delivers a fun Cavern Of Lies where we have to guess which of the plots of terrible ghost games are made up. And for some reason I've written 'The Count of Monster Disco' in my notes. The reason escapes me. But it was probably funny.

There's already several creative ways to bother people online while playing Elden Ring, but as Ed points out, cosplaying Thanos was one of the more destructive ways. There was an exploit that hackers could use where they could teleport you to a void, trap you in an infinite death loop, and completely torpedo your save.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As several members of the RPS Treehouse can attest, I have not been able to stop playing Tunic this week. I was a little cautious going in, having not particularly gelled with the E3 demo from last year, but in hindsight, that early glimpse was nothing but the tip of a tiny fox nose peeking out of its burrow. In its full, regal splendour, Tunic has become an early game of the contender for me, and a large part of that is down to its wonderfully clever in-game instruction manual.
When Imogen (RPS in peace) interviewed Tunic dev Andrew Shouldice last September, they talked about how instruction manuals were a fundamental part of a game's design back in the days of the NES, and at one point he even pulled out his old instruction booklet for Zelda II: The Adventure Of Link to demonstrate some of the "tantalising hints" they'd offer to curious players. As Brendan (also RPS in peace) noted in our Tunic review, the in-game manual is indeed a critical part of what makes Tunic special, and the act of piecing it together page by page really does capture that feeling of discovering some great secret that only you and the dev team know about. But here's a secret between you and me: it's not by chance Shouldice pulled out that old Zelda II manual during our interview last year. His fox hero may be cut from the same cloth as Nintendo's green sword-swinger, but the art inside Tunic's instruction manual also pays a wonderful tribute to those Zelda booklets of yore, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve spent over 40 hours with Elden Ring and I’m still not very good at it. At this stage I’m less of a worthy Tarnished warrior on their way to be crowned the Elden Lord and instead more of a Mr. Bean type, accidentally succeeding through sheer incompetence alone. I can’t explain it, but my method of defeating Godrick had the same energy as Bean making a sandwich, in that I think the game eventually just took pity on me and let me win the fight to save me any further embarrasment.


I’m coming to terms with the fact I may never finish Elden Ring. I'm only in the second proper area, but I'm finding encounters to require a level of patience I simply don't possess. Its boss fights are simply too hard. But if I’m struggling this much at such an early stage, what else could Elden Ring possibly have to offer? What types of monstrosities lurk in the farthest reaches of the Lands Between, and how difficult are they to defeat? Spoilers, naturally, below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think "platformer" and my next thought is "slick". Hollow Knight springs to mind, as does Ori, as does Celeste. They all have precise and snappy movement, with upgrades and new abilities that add complexity without stodge. As for 3D platformers, Super Mario 64 remains a glowing example of how movement makes exploration joyful. String together rolls and jumps and you're not just navigating a world, but bounding through it like a gymnast (who's also a part time plumber to help pay the costs of serious competition).
Elden Ring is a terrible platformer. It's stiff and awkward and less gymnast, more Gimli on the Buckfast. But this is what makes its platforming sections good. They force you to embrace your limited toolset and channel your amateur longjumping, golfing, and climbing skills you definitely don't have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD have revealed more about FSR 2.0, the major overhaul of its FidelityFX Super Resolution upscaling tech, after a detail-light announcement last week. FSR 2.0 will represent a switch from simple spatial upscaling to more closely match the advanced temporal upscaling techniques of its rival, Nvidia DLSS – and while it won’t use DLSS-style machine learning, AMD say the trick to FSR 2.0’s improved performance is down to some good-old-fashioned human brainpower.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About a week ago, Humble Bundle put together the Stand With Ukraine Bundle to raise money for humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine. For £30.58, you can get almost a hundred games, and some books and software too. It's great value, but there's only one day left to buy it, so you should probably get a move on.

  As of today, the bundle's raised over £12 million pounds to help victims and refugees from the war in Ukraine, which is an amazing achievement. All of the proceeds are being split between four organisations providing relief efforts: Razom for Ukraine, International Rescue Committee, International Medical Corps, and Direct Relief.

From the hyper-detailed backstreets to giant blazing billboards bouncing off fresh rain puddles, this take on Tokyo is eye-catching enough to ditch the sidequests and simply spend some time strolling around. Even if that stroll is sometimes interrupted by rowdy gangs of yokai. 


In Matthew’s earlier preview, he noted a similarly evocative atmosphere to that of the YouTube channel Virtual Japan, which has featured one particularly calming walking tour through a rain-soaked Tokyo. Ghostwire has walking, and rain, and Tokyo, so when review code came in we thought we’d have a crack at making our own. And here it is, in 4K with maxed-out ray tracing:

I always thought it was a story from a war, but it turns out it’s actually an open world RPG where you control mercenaries as they explore abandoned terrain. Wartales’ most recent update, Harag’s Marshlands, is one of the most substantial additions to the game so far, and it’s out now.
If the name of the update didn’t give it away, it’s about swamps. It includes a new region called Ludern that’s been “inspired by Scottish landscapes.” There are also patch notes for an update that'll expand crafting, add some new additions to the combat, and bring some more general balancing changes too.

Jim, Dave, and Sally all have their map markers in Vice City for a portion of the game, then they'll shift over to Tilted Towers after a few hours. Perhaps the bridge to Shrek's Swamp won't open unless you rescue the princess from Bowser's Castle later down the line.
And there's nothing wrong with an open world that gently steers you in the right direction. Elden Ring does this with its checkpoints that blow the equivalent of directional arrows in the breeze, helping you feel in control of your progress. But I'd argue it's even better at the opposite: wresting that control away in a split-second.

The lumbering forms of Elden Ring’s trolls disguise an ancient melancholy. Turned traitors in the war between demigods and giants, their reward for loyalty to the Golden Lineage was an eternity in shackles, used as frontline fodder in bloody conflicts or beasts of burden hauling funereal carriages around the Lands Between. Since learning their history, I often muse sadly upon it, as I weave between their horribly gnarled legs in my freshly tarnished underwear and hoover up the shiny objects scattered underneath their feet. 


I’m on my second run of Elden Ring now, progressing slowly and methodically, examining every statue and reading every spell description. But the first time through, the need to cram the whole content buffet in my face at once got the better of me. Underleveled and underprepared for most areas, I developed the winning strategy of stripping down to my burial rags for a speed boost and streaking through the wilds, shoving everything valuable down my pants.

This story trailer is a bit of a tease, in that it doesn't really de-mystify any of the elements of the game that I found most mystifying in my earlier preview, but it definitely does give you a flavour of the kind of adventures and quick-fixes you get into as Vix the space mechanic. Plus it shows off some of the cooler visual flair FixFox has (especially in its loading screens). Give it a watch after the cut.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been having a grand old time in Ghostwire: Tokyo, rescuing lost spirits and finger-gunning umbrella men. As Matthew's review notes, there’s a lot of busywork, but Tango Gamework’s rain-slicked rendition of the Japanese capital is quite the place to explore. And to gawp at, even if you don’t have the hardware for its fanciest ray tracing capabilities. 


Indeed, despite some spooky-looking system requirements, Ghostwire: Tokyo can run well on older or lower-spec builds, just as surely as it gets the most out of the very best graphics cards. Within these paragraphs we’ll take a close inspection of how it handles different hardware and display resolutions, as well as which are the best settings to change for optimal PC performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cantata, the upcoming game from Afterschool Studio, is releasing in early access on the 12th of May. It's a turn-based strategy game set during a surreal and futuristic war, where, shocker, the aim is to kill your opponent. The twist is that while you’re building your base in each encounter, you’ll also need to manage logistics. The maps in Cantata are bigger than most other strategy games, so you’ll have to construct a supply chain alongside your army to keep your base expanding. And it’s all wrapped up in a unique and colourful aesthetic too.

All we've got to go on is a cryptic image of a lynx-like Witcher medallion sitting in a bed of snow. Some of us from the Treehouse ran through what we'd like to see from The Witcher 4, including some truly insightful quotes about leg muscles from myself. One thing I failed to mention, though, was Roach, Geralt's horse.
I'm sure Roach has a great personality, I'm sure he's very kind. But from a purely professional standpoint, I can't stand him. He's hardly smooth in the stirrups, nor can he really climb anything substantial. That's why I'd like Roach swapped out for Elden Ring's Torrent, a horse-goat that corners like Colin McCrae and double jumps like Super Mario. The Witcher 4 deserves a super horse like Torrent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the comments under my interview with the Paradise Killer devs last week, someone suggested posting more of the answers as like a B-side. I thought this was an excellent suggestion, for three reasons: 1) it's a much easier post to write on my part compared to doing the full interview; b) Oli Clarke Smith and Phil Crabtree said a bunch of interesting things that I wasn't able to cram into the article; iii) it might give you a sense of how weird interviews actually are. 
This transcript is just two questions and a follow-up, but runs to over 1500 words. The whole conversation I had with these two dudes was over 40 minutes long. So much of interviews gets discarded (like tears in rain etc) and the process of distilling it all down to a few quotes can be, to put it succinctly, a pain in the hole. Especially if your interview subject talks quickly. Top tip to people who don't like interviews: talk slowly. It'll be over faster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last night, CD Projekt announced they were working on a brand-new Witcher game. Details are thin on the ground at the moment. All we have to go on is a cryptic piece of artwork showing what appears to be a lynx-like medallion peeking through some snow, and a declaration that it's going to represent a "new saga" of The Witcher series. Heck, we don't even know if it's technically going to be called The Witcher 4 yet (it probably isn't, in fairness), but for sake of ease that's how I'm going to refer to it for the time being. 
Still, talk of a new saga has got me thinking. Does that mean we'll simply see a new protagonist in the existing Witcher timeline we know and love? (Ciri, perhaps, or young hot Vesemir?) Or will it go earlier, maybe tying into the upcoming Netflix prequel The Witcher: Blood Origin that's set 1200 years before the events of the books? Or something else entirely? We probably won't know the answers for some time, but until CD Projekt have more beans to spill, RPS asks: what would you like to see from a new game in The Witcher series?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Taiwanese studio Red Candle Games have put up a crowdfunding page for their latest project Nine Sols, and it looks promising. It’s an action platformer with gorgeous hand-drawn animation work, and as Red Candle put it, it’s “a journey of Asian fantasy inspired by Sekiro, Hollow Knight and Katana Zero.” That’s me sold. And clearly a lot of other people agree too, because Nine Sols broke its goal of three million Taiwanese dollars (that’s roughly £80,000) within 24 hours.

It will also be kicking off a new venture into Unreal Engine 5, as the developer announced they were leaving their own REDengine behind as they embark on a new, multi-year strategic partnership with Epic Games.

Real love letters are written by people so ruined by an oxytocin-soaked brain that they’re compelled to pick up a quill and rattle off paragraph after paragraph of rambling, horny nonsense, a hot stream of unalloyed adoration that is destined to one day be read aloud in a grave voice by the host of a mid-tier crime podcast.


Shredders is an actual love letter to snowboarding. It might have been coded using cut up letters from magazines. It is a pure, geeky, effusive veneration of the sport and its players, and so sincere about its passion for going down the side of a mountain on a long bit of wood that it occasionally verges on embarrassing. You’ve heard of dancing like nobody's watching, now get ready for a game about snowboarding made as though nobody will ever play it.

You'll be able to play as Glover in a brand new PC port coming to both Steam and GOG, and rather than restoring the old PC port that already exists, it's been "completely redone" using the original source code from the N64 version of the game.

Piko Interactive are the developers behind this release. Buying old games and rereleasing them seems to be most of Piko's wheelhouse, as they've bought a bunch of old IPs and stuck the games onto digital storefronts. Piko Interactive were, for example, behind the Steam releases of Super 3D Noah's Ark, First Samurai, and something called Bubble Ghost which sounds cuter than it probably is. Piko's previous releases typically also include the original file for the game, so hopefully Glover purists will also be satisfied by this version. And game preservation is always a good thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft recently announced that they’d cracked how to get Game Pass games running on the handheld Steam Deck. Great! It involves installing a beta version of Microsoft Edge (less great!) and, by way of a Game Pass Ultimate subscription, streaming those games to the Deck in a browser. Not running Game Pass games locally, in other words, but running them well enough to be playable, and with seamless compatibility for the Steam Deck’s controls.


After having gone through the lengthy setup process (explained below, if you want to try streaming Game Pass games on the Steam Deck yourself) and playing for a while, I can say it’s a good enough start in bringing Microsoft’s library to Valve’s handheld. Between this and the Epic Games Launcher, it’s a relief that the Deck’s default SteamOS won’t be limited to Steam games after all. Still, a beta is a beta, and there are very much some kinks to work out.

There’s no official date set for the update yet, but you can read Platinum's full plans in a blog post. The update's split into two halves, with one focused on providing new content, and the other full of changes to try to improve the game based on player feedback. And I would imagine there's a lot of that to go through, based on how critical the reviews for Babylon's Fall were.

For whatever reason, the other two films never got their own games - I just assumed that was because nobody liked the films that much. The truth is, developers TT Games have been working on them all along, albeit as part of Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, a mega-game including all nine mainline films in the franchise. 
It's been in development for a while, and has been delayed several times, allegedly resulting in extensive crunch. It's finally coming out on April 5th, but having played about an hour of Episode IV, this is not the Lego Star Wars-ing I remember. The plots are the same, of course, but much of its mindless minifig bashing has now been swapped for... over-the-shoulder third-person shooting? I feel a great disturbance in the Force.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many creators leave fingerprints on their games, but few apply their digits as physically as Shinji Mikami in Ghostwire: Tokyo. One sidequest in Tango’s open world spook-busting adventure sees a neighbourhood disturbed by piano music, eerily plonking away at ungodly hours. Roaming the streets you soon catch the haunting strains of Moonlight Sonata, a piece famously played in Mikami’s Resident Evil to unlock a secret passage. But it’s more than a cute nod. Ghostwire’s credits reveal the player to be Mikami himself - showing off talents usually reserved for fellow Bethesda creators behind closed doors. 
While I’m sure he contributed more than tinkling mood music for an optional quest, Ghostwire has been framed as a debutante ball for the next generation of Tango talent. In Archipel’s ace interview series Mikami spoke about fostering new creative leads and taking more of a backseat compared to his work on The Evil Within, which was more clearly made in the Resi mold. The result is, by design, the studio’s least Mikami-ish romp to date: a sprawling tale of a metropolis turned ghost town that is one part love letter to the city and its urban legends, and an opportunity to zap headless school girls and floating puppets with electrifying particle effects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I loved Long Live The Queen and Black Closet, two games with heavily branching and systemic narratives and a lot of juicy melodrama, mystery and romance. Now developers Hanako Games have released something new. Night Cascades is a lesbian romance about two women investigating a supernatural mystery in an alternate 1980s, and it looks great.

Maybe it's the new film, or maybe it's just the perfect game to add Keanu Reeves to, but recent kung fu brawler Sifu now has a cracking pack of Matrix mods that add Neo, Agent Smith, new fight sound effects, and recolour the world green.

Usual winter activities crowding into hot rooms with steam rising off people's soaking wool jumpers, the smell of wet dog in the air, and just so much closeness and breath has been as appealing. But now, spring! Soon, maybe even warmth? For now, what are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on.

I would like to meet a big bear. I'm willing to do a lot to meet a really big bear. But many players have felt that this 'Souls race' forces the game into an unpleasant and uninteresting shape. Thankfully, the devs have plans for the next patch which they say should "make the Souls race less urgent".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week I took a bit of holiday to, you know, catch up on some housework, have a bit of a rest and, to change the habit of a lifetime, play some video games. I knew straight away what would be first up on my video game playlist: FAR: Changing Tides, the sequel to Okomotive's beautifully melancholy roadtrip adventure, FAR: Lone Sails. While Changing Tides tells a separate story to its predecessor, putting you in the shoes of a new protagonist and swapping its desolate wastelands for a watery seascape, the hot, beating core powering the game remains very much the same. With nothing left for you at home in the wake of an unknown disaster, it's time to pack up and head on out for a new beginning, with only your hulking great boat/steamtrain contraption for company. 
If you still haven't played FAR: Changing Tides, I'd urge you to stop reading now and come back later. There are big spoilers about the game's ending coming up in this article, and I really don't want to ruin that for you. So, fair warning, okay? If you're still here I'm assuming you've played and finished Changing Tides, because holy moly, isn't it just the most perfect thing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thy Creature is an odd one. I want to make several comparisons to other games that probably aren't very accurate or fair. I think that's because it's one of those that's made up of the gaps in between other genres. Right from the start of its anime goth girl intro I knew this wasn't really my kind of thing, and yet its striking art and sense of sincerity felt compelling. 
And it was a bit weird, which is sometimes enough. It depicts a frankenstein cast out by villagers, left to wander the wilderness, across forests and mountains, still peppered with arrows, turning up at a sinister tower that seems to welcome them. And just a few minutes in, it reveals itself as a mystery puzzle game with bullet hell parts. Almost none of this is my thing at all, but here I am playing it. Hmm.

In that time I’ve taken it on day trips, chatted to Gabe Newell and the Valve dev team about it, and been laughed at in a pub for inverting the Y axis on it. And all the while, the Steam Deck itself has been getting better - considerably so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before we get stuck in, here's the sitch. PC code for FF Origin went out a bit late, so the thoughts below are my initial impressions of the game based on the chunk I've played so far, which is about half the game. This isn't a full review, but I also can't see my thoughts changing. Anyway. Let's embrace Chaos.
Stranger Of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is a Soulslike Final Fantasy spin-off that swings so much it misses. Your sole focus is to kill a bad guy called Chaos and the game provides fights and loot in their hundreds, possibly thousands, to ensure you're beefy enough when the time comes. But cut away the combat and you're left with little, really. Search for anything other than Chaos and you'll find there's nothing else driving you forwards. You'll finish the game and part as strangers still, probably.

Every frame looks gorgeous, capturing feudal Japan through a grainy black and white lens that evokes classic samurai flicks. Thankfully, there's some substance to match this style too. Combat is elegant and the story seems refined, not bloated, which makes this a ronin romp worth watching out for.
