The latest UK boxed charts are in and they paint a healthy picture for EA's Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, with the action-adventure sequel coming out on top. According to Chris Dring from GamesIndustry.biz, the game is the second-biggest launch of the year so far, coming in ahead of Capcom's Resident Evil 4, but behind Hogwarts Legacy.
Over on the Switch, the heavily delayed Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp fell out of the top ten to come in 17th place this week, after debuting in 3rd following its launch on April 21st, 2023. Considering the franchise's relatively niche appeal compared to other Nintendo IPs, we're not surprised to see such a drop, but we're nevertheless pleased that the game is finally out in the wild.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't want to set the world on fire.
In April of 2021, the beloved Ludum Dare game jam took place with the theme of 'Deeper and Deeper'. Participants had 48 hours to throw together a game, and Sébastien Benard—known for working on Dead Cells—decided to give it a shot by making a firefighting game called Nuclear Blaze. After the competition was over, Benard wanted to expand on the idea and give it a proper release, which led to the Nuclear Blaze that we have today. Though it still feels a little simplistic, this is a great bite-sized take on the action-platforming genre.
Nuclear Blaze places you in the role of a firefighter deployed with your crew to put out a wildfire that’s gotten out of control. After putting out the worst of it, you stumble upon a secret research black site in the forest which is also on fire and go inside to investigate before getting trapped within and cut off from communication with your team. Left with no other choice, you delve deeper into the facility to put out the fires you can and to collect dossiers that can tell you more about what happened to the numerous dead researchers there.

Welcome, one and all, to another week's Box Art Brawl (rhyming unintentionally, we promise).
Before we head into this week's super picks, let's first take a look at how the previous battle went down. Last week, we took a look at the covers for Final Fantasy IV on the DS and it wasn't a remotely close race. The colourful European art walked away with the win after getting 57% of the vote, while Japan came in second with 26% and NA rounded it out with 14%.

As of this week, both it and its sequel are permanently cheaper.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take 2 on an all-time classic
This week's Arcade Archives entry sees us take a look at one of the very earliest instances of a remaster in the gaming sphere — As publisher Hamster offers up Namco's Galaga '88 on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to Japanese arcades in 1987, before making its way west at the start of the new year, Galaga '88 is a revamped edition of the legendary Galaxian spin-off, released at the dawn of the golden age of arcade gaming. Galaga '88, operating as both a remaster of the original Galaga and a sequel to 1984's Gaplus, players take control of the iconic Blast Fighter vessel for more space-based warfare against the forces of the titular enemy. As one would expect, Galaga '88 features much-improved audio/visual elements, including more detailed character sprites and a variety of background images.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62h9LUt3OQg&ab_channel=WorldofLongplays
Despite receiving much acclaim from critics and Japanese arcade goers, Galaga '88 would receive slight home ports, appearing via the PC Engine as the confusingly renamed Galaga '90, as well as on the Sharp X68000 home computer. In later years, the shmup would find itself packaged as part of numerous Namco compendiums, while also appearing on the Wii Virtual Console and even Japanese mobile platforms.
Galaga '88 is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

Look, I'm all for originality. The video game industry is lousy with sequels and remasters and reboots and rejigs, and despite its 'surprise and delight' MO, Nintendo is just as guilty of re-releasing past works as any other publisher. There's little that's less imaginative than giving an old classic a fresh lick of paint and some mod-cons.

Last time at the Destructoid Institute of Critiquing Kusoge, I looked at Castlevania for the N64. We’ve established that the Castlevania series has never been very good when it comes to its 3D titles, but the N64 games are likely the most worthwhile.
The second title on the N64, Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness, is easily the worthwhile-est. That’s mostly because it’s essentially an apology for Castlevania 64. Love it or hate it, it’s hard to deny that Castlevania 64 had the signs of rushed development. This wasn’t anything overly major – most of its glaring problems today aren’t atypical for the time period it was released – but it comes down to a lack of polish. More notably, but less noticeably, Konami cut two characters of the planned four.

When the original Teslagrad released in 2013, the indie game scene was in a very different place. Long before modern Indie Worlds and Nindie Showcases and games from small developers put out by billion-dollar publishers, indie games still felt very much independent. The original game — recently re-released in Remastered form — always stood out as one of the more notable titles from a small dev, especially on the Wii U eShop. Now, a decade later, we’re in a different landscape. With the surprise release of Teslagrad 2, the question then is whether Norwegian studio Rain Games is able to capture lightning in a bottle once more.
Teslagrad 2 follows Lumina, a young girl who gets attacked by Vikings on her travels. She becomes stranded on Wyrmheim, a world heavily inspired by Scandinavia. Here she is tasked with harnessing and upgrading her electromagnetic powers to explore the world and find a way back home to her family.

Welcome back to another edition of What are you Playing, where we give you a brief rundown of the week in Nintendo before discussing what gaming we're all up to this weekend.
The big news this time around is (deep breath) there are less than two weeks to go until Tears of the Kingdom!! This week, we shared our thoughts on the upcoming game after getting a hands-on preview, and we broke down all of the performance and resolution details from what we've seen so far. We also tackled the big question as we asked what is a 'traditional' Zelda game anyway? ahead of TOTK's release.

The world of Honkai: Star Rail is communicated through interfaces. Menus and trackers keep you abreast of what tasks you can accomplish to keep resources moving in, characters levelling up, and passes built up for the next Warp.

You pretty much start with a cell phone in your pocket in the latest HoYoverse game. It's an effective means of giving you a home for a map, mission log, and many other pieces of information. In other words, it's like a journal in a fantasy game.

I mentioned in my look at Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness that its developer, Konami Computer Entertainment Kobe, got a bit of a bad rap from their work. However, even in those sometimes maligned Castlevania efforts, there’s a spark of life that was lost in future 3D entries in the series.
It made me curious about the developer's other efforts, but it wasn’t my intention to move directly onto another one of their titles. However, when the credits rolled on Rakugakids, I realized I must have subconsciously picked up the cue since this Japan-only N64 title was developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Kobe.
Rakugakids has always fascinated me. The N64 was kind of a horrible console when it came to fighting games. There were some decent titles, but piled on top of that was a hea…]]></summary>

The early 3D era of video games was a time when developers were lobbed an entirely new axis and had no idea what to do with it. On top of that, the Nintendo 64 was a strange console. Conservative in its insistence to stick to the cartridge format while everyone else was moving to disc, yet unique enough to create a controller that was innovative and incomprehensible in equal measures. The N64 was an over-engineered mess that alienated developers and publishers.
I love it.
It’s not even because of the many great games that came out for it (the PlayStation admittedly had more), it’s just because it was so strange. It’s a console perpetually trapped in awkward adolescence. It is the cracking, pubescent voice of video games.

Street Fighter 6's Parry mechanic allows players to perform essentially Perfect Defense against any incoming attacks, by holding MP + MK together. However, once in Parry state, the player can then instigate a dash cancel ("Drive Rush") by tapping forward twice while in the Parry state. This allows for a fast turnaround and advance after blocking long-distance moves such as projectiles and supers.

Use Annihilape. That’s it. That’s the guide.
The meta monkey cannot, will not, and must not be stopped. After seeing this monster annihilate two raids in a row, I surely thought Game Freak would stop it this time. After all, Inteleon has killer synergy with the Snipe ability and the move Air Cutter, which would finally put an end to the almighty Rage Fist. But Game Freak said no, not only will we not stop Annihilape, but we will also go out of our way to make sure Annihilape is an absolutely perfect counter.
Annihilape is the protagonist of Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, and we’re just all here to cheer it on. Well, I guess players do need more context than this, so perhaps a guide is in order. Let’s get the usual details out of the way.

Each and every one of us walks through life without knowing exactly our purpose and then dies no closer to the truth. We struggle every day to find the things and people that make our existence feel even momentarily worthwhile. No matter what happens, how much wealth we acquire, or who we share our lives with, death is a solitary experience that we face alone.
But at least we’re not turnips.

Minabo: A Walk Through Life attempts to frame the endless trials of existence in a cute game about turnips. You follow your lumpy blob of emotions from birth until the merciful release of death.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Those are some gritty buildings
I’m pumped for Front Mission 2: Remake. Are you pumped? If you’re not, maybe this trailer will give you some extra pump. Dropped earlier today by Forever Entertainment, it outlines the plot of the second game and shows off some of its locations.
Set 12 years after the events of the first game, Front Mission 2 is set against the backdrop of a coup d’etat in one of the OCU’s nations. The trailer has this really intense-sounding dude reading some really dull lines. “Monitor the situation in this country torn apart by civil war.” Monitor? That’s the best word you could use? Not something like “get embroiled?” Like, at least use a word that makes it sound like you’re participating in some way.
https://youtu.be/nLaoh8SWCMc
Dire need for a thesaurus aside, I love the style of Front Mission 2. Its gritty urban settings remind me simultaneously of Japanese PS2 war games and Sega Genesis titles. They’re grey, sure, but I could stare at them all day. I really don’t know how to explain it, I just love the aesthetic.
The Front Mission 2 remake is particularly exciting, as no version of it has previously been released in North America. It initially released in 1997 for the PlayStation, but it stayed exclusive to Japan. The first Front Mission remake was pretty exciting for me, so I’m looking forward to moving onto this one.
Front Mission 2: Remake will launch on Switch June 12, 2023. Currently, it's exclusive to the platform

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's about to get garlicky
Video game adaptations are all the rage, and Vampire Survivors is now joining the trend. Developer poncle's ever-evolving auto-fighting survival game has an animated series in the works.
Via Deadline, poncle's founder Luca Galante is partnering with Story Kitchen, the company working on other game adaptations like Sifu, Streets of Rage, and more. Founded by John Wick writer and creator Derek Kolstad, Sonic the Hedgehog film and TV producer Dmitri M. Johnson, and former APA agent and partner Mike Goldberg, Story Kitchen is certainly tackling a decent amount of video game adaptations. Games consulting agency Robot Teddy will also be supporting the show.
As for what the show will be about? Well, that's still a bit unclear.
"The most important thing in Vampire Survivors is the story, so it's a dream come true to see what started as a little indie game I made on my weekends come to life as an animated TV show!" Gallante said in a press release. "It’s also great to be partnering up with such experienced and talented people to make the show. I do wonder if they've realised that there isn't a single vampire in Vampire Survivors, though."
The release confirms that, just like the game, the actual existence of vampires has not been confirmed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvMkS6GcxFU
Adapting the Survivors
Normally I'd be wary, but it seems like poncle and Gallante are keeping a bit of fun mixed in with the whole project. Seeing as Vampire Survivors draws heavily on past works like Castlevania, it's hard not to see the potential; but I'm also curious to see how those ideas play out, and look any different, in a Survivors series.
As long as there's some solid garlic jokes, though, I'll probably be along for the ride. Vampire Survivors was a surprise hit that's kept growing with time, and I can't say I'm not curious to see what this team does with their very own series adaptation.

CyGames Inc, the Japanese developer behind the Granblue Fantasy and Shadowverse franchises, has announced it is expanding into the west, establishing two new studios in Europe and the United States.
"Following the worldwide launch of Cygames’ strategic card game Shadowverse in June 2016, a Global Business Development team was established alongside branches in Korea and Taiwan to further promote the company’s titles outside of Japan," said the company in a statement."
"Cygames America and Cygames Europe are the latest additions to Cygames' ongoing push to promote and market their titles in North America and Europe, which together account for roughly half of the world’s video game marketplace. In keeping with the company’s vision to be the best in entertainment, Cygames strives to continue providing high-quality content for fans all around the globe."
The CyGames America office is located in Los Angeles, where it is overseen by CEO Motohiro Okubo. The European office is situated in London, UK, and is run by Managing Director Hiroaki Ochiai. It appears that both studios will focus mostly on marketing, distribution, and the localization of products. Currently, it seems that neither team will feature in-house game development.
The next major release from the studio will be the revamped fighter Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising, which is currently in development at Arc System Works with an eye to launch in later in 2023.

Rightsholders believe that cooperation is directly linked to a credible threat of liability.

Koei Tecmo has proudly announced that its period piece action-adventure Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty has surpassed one million shipments and sales since its initial release. The Team Ninja-developed adventure hit PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms on March 3.
According to the publisher Wo Long, which sees a mysterious protagonist battling demons against a stylized take on the Han Dynasty, has been played by 3.8 million players so far, taking into account its availability on the Xbox Game Pass service. For all you maths majors out there, this means that somewhere in the region of 2.8 million players checked the title out via the subscription-based service.
https://twitter.com/WoLongOfficial/status/1651784272792133632?s=20
Koei Tecmo released a delightful image to celebrate the milestone, which sees a trio of impossibly adorable Panda Shitieshou demons lolling about. In the game itself, these are benign, friendly demons that offer the player random gear in return for unwanted items. Accompanying the image, the publisher notes that Team Ninja is currently at work developing updates for the title, as well as no less than three DLC expansions. A date for these add-ons is yet to be revealed.
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Game Pass.

Nine months on from the release of the stunning Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and, true to form, Monolith Soft has once again delivered a hefty chunk of story-based DLC for fans to sink their teeth into, this time in the shape of Xenoblade Chronicles 3: Future Redeemed. We’ve already had a bunch of fun new heroes and an all-new challenge mode added through the first three waves of add-on content, and now it’s time to tuck into the real meat of your Expansion Pass.

Developer poncle has confirmed that it's working with gaming consulting company Robot Teddy and media company Story Kitchen to bring the hit arcade bullet hell game to the small screen. Story Kitchen is helmed by names such as Dmitri Johnson (co-producer of the Sonic the Hedgehog films), John Wick creator/writer Derek Kolstad, and APA agent Mike Goldberg. There’s currently no other details about what the series will entail, such as the cast or a premiere date. 
“The most important thing in Vampire Survivors is the story, so it's a dream come true to see what started as a little indie game I made on my weekends come to life as an animated TV show! It’s also great to be partnering up with such experienced and talented people to make the show. I do wonder if they've realised that there isn't a single vampire in Vampire Survivors, though,” says Luca Galante, founder of poncle in a press release.
If you're tilting your head wondering how a pixelated arcade game can be translated into a show, it's worth nothing that Vampire Survivors has been brought to life in animated form before. Its two expansions – Legacy of the Moonspell and the recently launched Tides of the Foscari – both featured slick animated trailers, so those could be reference points for how this series may potentially appear. 
Vampire Survivors has been on quite a roll since it launched to widespread acclaim last year, scooping up several end-of-year awards and walking away with a couple of BAFTA trophies this year, including winning Best Game. You can read our review of Vampire Survivors here.]]></summary>

Peacock has announced a premiere date for its long-time-coming TV adaptation of PlayStation's apocalyptic, vehicular franchise Twisted Metal — The series is now scheduled to premiere on the Peacock streaming service on July 27.
A new teaser dropped on April 28, showing Anthony Mackie's character gearing up for a drive into the battlefield. While we don't see too much other than cars and destruction, the teaser does end with a brief tease of the Twisted Metal mainstay Sweet Tooth.

Twisted Metal, as previously reported, will star Mackie (Marvel's Falcon) as a slick, smart-mouthed courier who, down on his luck, accepts a shady offer to carry a mysterious package across the dystopian wastelands that surround the city — packed with marauding gangs and hazardous terrain, and haunted by the disturbing, ice-cream-truck-driving serial killer known as Sweet Tooth.
Joining Mackie on this death-laden voyage will be Stephanie Beatriz (Brooklyn Nine-Nine), Thomas Haden Church (Spider-Man 3), and Neve Campbell (Scream) in currently undisclosed roles. Will Arnett will provide the voice of Sweet Tooth, while the notorious murderer's physical presence will be that of legendary pro-wrestling star Samoa Joe. Cobra Kai's Michael Jonathan Smith served as writer and showrunner for the series, which wrapped filming last summer and is now in post-production.
Twisted Metal is one of a number of PlayStation film and TV adaptations currently in development. Via its PlayStation Productions arm, Sony has also commissioned projects based on popular franchises such as Uncharted, God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, Gran Turismo, and Ghost of Tsushima.
Twisted Metal will premiere on Peacock July 27.
This post has been updated to add the teaser trailer, following its premiere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lego and Nintendo have announced four new Donkey Kong sets joining the Super Mario lineup. 
Lego has continued to build out its Nintendo universe of sets with Super Mario and now, hot on the heels of The Super Mario Bros. Movie's release in theaters earlier this month, Donkey Kong (a major character in the movie) is joining the lineup. More specifically, four new sets, each available for purchase starting August 1, are coming and they feature Donkey Kong and some of his family members like Cranky, Diddy, Dixie, and Funky. 
Those four sets are Donkey Kong's Tree House Expansion Set, Diddy Kong's Mine Cart Ride Expansion Set, Dixie Kong's Jungle Jam Expansion Set, and Rambi the Rhino Expansion set. 
"The excitement continues to grow for the Lego Super Mario franchise with yet another playful update," Lego Group design director Simon Kent writes in a press release. "We're welcoming the iconic Donkey Kong into the LEGO Super Mario product line. We can't wait to see how the four Expansion Sets inspire kids to discover the new wild and colorful jungle from the Donkey Kong universe, whether that's hanging out in the tree house, riding a mine cart, jamming out with Dixie Kong, or exploring with Rambi." 
Let's break each of these sets down:
Donkey Kong's Tree House Expansion Set
$59.99
555 pieces

Diddy Kong's Mine Cart Ride Expansion Set
$109.99
1157 pieces

Dixie Kong's Jungle Jam Expansion Set
$26.99
174 pieces

Rambi the Rhino Expansion Set
$10.99
106 pieces

All four of these sets will be available from Lego and select retailers on August 1, 2023.

The turn-based anime RPG did exactly that earlier this week, and it's already been downloaded over 20 million times in just a single day, according to a tweet from analyst Daniel Ahmad. Perhaps not surprising for a free-to-play game, but still. That's a lot of people. I must admit, I could never quite gel with Genshin Impact, another very anime RPG made by the same developers, but Honkai's turn-based battles look a lot more up my street. So I downloaded yesterday, which I guess makes me part of that enormous 20 million number. Are you planning on giving it a go as well?

Shardpunk Verminfall is, as Graham reported, an excellent mash-up of several familiar games and concepts, yet doesn't feel like a knockoff of any, or lack its own identity. I would resent it a lot less if it wasn't also a roguelike. Even with its standard mono-save system and unlocking things and "repeating the whole thing from scratch ad infinitum" though, I can't pretend I don't enjoy it anyway.

They're overhauling things like the in-game overlay, creating a new toolbar to house achievements, friends chat and discussions, and creating a new hub that shows you everything that's happened in the game's community since you last played it. It also introduces a cool pin feature that lets you stick overlay windows on top of your game - handy if you're following a guide, say, and don't want to keep alt-tabbing out. But there's one thing I'm quite upset about, and that's the new Notes app. I love a good notebook game, you know? Fiddling out puzzles in Tunic, remembering patterns in The Witness... Notebook games are great. But I fear this new Notes app will kill that kind of note-taking dead. And that makes me sad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The pins are back
Right ahead of the weekend, Nintendo notified My Nintendo users that there was a Mario celebration going on, which has a few different initiatives in tow. In addition to highlighting the Gold Point bonus promo, there's also a digital Mario and Luigi wallpaper set, as well as a restock of some Mario My Nintendo physical rewards.
Here's a full list of what's available now, at the end of April 2023:
Mario & Me Journal - 800 Platinum Points
My Nintendo Platinum and Gold Pin set - 800 Platinum Points
Mario Strikers: Battle League drawstring bag - 600 Platinum Points
Mario Golf: Super Rush ID Tag - 600 Platinum Points
Out of all of these, I picked up the journal as well as the pin set: the rest was kind of take it or leave it. I don't play golf and I have way too many bags as it is!
There are a few "print them yourself" bonuses too:
Printable Mario Bingo cards - 100 Platinum Points
Printable eShop gift card envelopes - 30 Platinum Points
Need Platinum Points?
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

Despite Aloy’s commitment to her planet, her time on it has been anything but utopian. She has watched loved ones like Varl and Rost perish, discovered the fatal selfishness of the Old Ones, and at times it seems impossible that the quarreling between tribes will ever cease.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And it's all documented
The "oops all Malenia" mod in Elden Ring has been popular for a while now, as an offshoot of the "Elden Ring Item and Enemy Randomizer." Yeah, you heard me correctly! To be clear, this particular challenge run involves swapping every enemy into Malenia: one of the toughest bosses in the game. Hilariously, the mod even titles bosses appropriately, like "Malenia, the First Elden Lord" or "Eden Malenia" for the final encounter. Who else to better handle this bizarre task than Let Me Solo Her: the legendary hero of the community that was even recognized by the developers.
Let Me Solo Her has been documenting their journey through an all Malenia run for about a month, and just finished this week. They even went in with self-imposed parameters:
Don't level vigor (the stat that grants players HP)
Get the Jar Helm (and wear no other armor)
Beat the game
It sounds "simple," right? Well, it took them roughly 10 hours! While they were a bit hard on themselves with recounting their clear time, I'm sure a lot of folks spent 10 hours in a single area, so they probably shouldn't sweat it too much. I mean, the lack of HP and defensive gear essentially amounts to a "no hit" run with an infamous boss subbed in for hundreds of potential enemies. Fair trade!
Where to watch Let Me Solo Her run through Elden Ring with the Malendia mod
You can check out their journey on their official YouTube channel, and the finale is embedded below

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Colour us impressed.
As soon as we booted up Strayed Lights, we were rooting for it. The sights and sounds were beautiful and haunting, making this freshman offering from developer Embers one of the most enchanting games we’ve played all year. Unfortunately, a string of visual bugs and long loading times marred what was otherwise a glorious experience.
The first moments of Strayed Lights mark the first moments in your character’s life. They start out as a flickering ember of energy and slowly bloom into a mature and powerful version of themselves. The game uses the initial shadowy version of the protagonist to introduce the unique combat mechanics that you’ll need to get a handle on if you’re going to survive in this strange alien world.

We are still a couple of months away from Front Mission 2: Remake's Western debut on 12th June, but we now have a brand new trailer to keep us interested in the meantime.
This latest promo from publisher Forever Entertainment is all about explaining the story of the upcoming sequel and unpacking the origins of the in-game civil war. Most of this takes place through what looks like gameplay footage, so we can begin to get an idea of how much the visuals have changed from last year's first remake (answer: not all that much).

Fortunately, all that is about to change in Tears of the Kingdom.
Yes, it looks like recipes actually exist this time around! This was revealed on the official Zelda Twitter account, @ZeldaOfficialJP, which (via the built-in Google Translate function), stated that you will be able to "look back on the dishes you made in 'Cooking Notes'", where you will be able to find each recipe's ingredients and effect properties.

Despite the odd glimmer of joy, like better-than-expected performance on its lowest system requirements, much about playing Jedi: Survivor on Windows suggests it could have used a little more time in the bacta tank. Sluggishness and stuttering are problems on higher-end graphics cards, even before adding the strain of ray tracing effects, and FSR upscaling often fails to deliver a significant performance boost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most successful Q1 in hardware history
Sony has released its financial results for the latest fiscal quarter, revealing that princely PlayStation 5 (PS5) hardware has surpassed 38 million sales since its launch back in the fall of 2020.
The first quarter of 2023 has been especially impressive for the PS5 platform, and has seen a total of around 6.3 million consoles shipped since the start of the year. This represents the most successful Q1 shipping totals for any console in gaming history, and is up a mammoth four million units over the same period in 2022. When compared to its predecessor, PS4, PlayStation 5 is tracking just behind that platform's sales to the same point, suggesting that the coming years will see PS5 meet — and likely surpass — PS4's total sales.
Sony also revealed that it currently counts 47.4 million PlayStation Plus subscribers, which is equal to the amount of subscribers counted for the same period in 2022. This sees the PlayStation brand recover from the dip it suffered over the course of 2022's latter half. Game sales, however, continue to slide, as PS4 and PS5 software sales sold 68 million units in the first quarter of 2023, which is down 2.5 million from the 70.5 million titles sold in the same period 2022.
There are several possible reasons for this, including both the increase in PlayStation Plus subscribers utilizing the catalog of titles offered online as part of the service, as well as the staggeringly top-tier Q1 that was enjoyed in 2022, with releases including Elden Ring, Sifu, The King of Fighters XV, Horizon Forbidden West, and Gran Turismo 7.
Off the back of today's figures, Sony is confident that it will ship 25 million consoles in the financial year ending March 2024 which, if secured, will represent a record in PlayStation hardware sales history.

Pokemon Scarlet & Violet are at it again, throwing another 5-Star Tera Raid event in our laps to entertain us over the weekend. It's Inteleon, it's Tera Ice Type, and honestly, I got nothing. I can't even say anything special about the game Inteleon comes from, since Cinderace stole its thunder on that front.
That said, there's never a bad time to jump on the Tera Raid bandwagon, and we're here to help as always. To that end, here's how you'll unlock and subsequently find Inteleon.
Here are when the Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Inteleon events start
April 28 - April 30, 2023
May 5 - May 7, 2023
Inteleon will only appear during these two weekends.

The Bat-Family has a new outing scheduled. A new Heroic Assault dubbed "The Kelvin Incident" is being added to Gotham Knights today, adding a 15-floor raid for endgame Knights.
The Kelvin Incident is a new Heroic Assault, which is WB Games Montreal's label for four-player co-op raids. Separate from the main story campaign, this standalone mode lets up to four players join up in online c-op and run through floors of challenges, eventually taking on big Bat-villains.

Taking on The Kelvin Incident will require you to make a dent in the Gotham Knights campaign, however. For normal game players, you'll need to complete the Villain Crimes and unlock Heroic Assault. Those on New Game Plus will have the incident…]]></summary>

When Xenoblade Chronicles 3 really hit the meat and potatoes of the story and went into spoilerific territory, it kicked into high gear. For Xenoblade fans it was both a blessing and a curse; we all knew it would be hard to unring that bell, and by the time the credits hit, not everything was explained.
Future Redeemed attempts to not only tie up a few loose ends from that adventure; but from the series as a whole. Thankfully it comes with some really rad quality of life bonuses that help showcase where it could go next: not just from a narrative standpoint, but design-wise, too.

But even so, this bloodbath of a sequel approaches co-op differently in a few important ways.

Happily, developers Color Gray Games have announced a new DLC pack is coming for The Golden Idol next week called The Spider Of Lanka. Set in 1741, a year before the first scenario of The Golden Idol proper, this trio of new cases looks set to shed extra light on the titular idol whose mysterious powers set the original game in motion. I'm afraid I can't tell you much more than that, as most of the announcement details have been slapped with big black REDACTED marks. Have a watch of the reveal trailer below instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update 4/28: The Twisted Metal teaser trailer is now live, giving us our first look at Anthony Mackie's gun-toting vehicle as well as a shot of Sweet Tooth. Check it out below. 



Original Story: The live-action Twisted Metal TV series got its first poster today, courtesy of IGN, ahead of a teaser trailer scheduled to drop later today. The upcoming adaptation of the classic PlayStation car combat series is set to premiere this July. 
Twisted Metal is being developed by Peacock and stars Anthony Mackie as protagonist John Doe, a “smart ass” delivery driver who transports supplies between settlements in a post-apocalyptic America. He has no memory of his past but gets a chance at a better life by making one special delivery across the dangerous landscape. 
We have the exclusive new poster for @Peacock’s #TwistedMetal show starring Anthony Mackie.

Tonally, the series is billed as an action comedy. Other characters include Sweet Tooth, who will be voiced by Will Arnett and physically performed by pro wrestler Samoa Joe. The cast also includes Stephanie Beatriz, Thomas Haden Church, Richard Cabral, Tahj Vaughans, and Neve Campbell. The show is being produced by Sony Pictures Television and PlayStation Productions, and it's the second TV adaptation of a first-party PlayStation game to arrive this year following The Last of Us. 
Twisted Metal premieres on July 27 exclusively on Peacock and consists of 10 half-hour-long episodes. We'll update this story with the teaser trailer when it becomes available.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloober Team and Anshar Studios have released a new Layers of Fear gameplay trailer to demonstrate the game's performance in Unreal Engine 5. 
Layers of Fear combines the experience of the first two Layers of Fear games, as well as both games' DLC, into one single game. It will also feature a new chapter called "The Final Note" that gives players an alternate perspective on the first game's story. Layers of Fear is being developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. You can check out the game's performance, as well as its new mechanics and visual enhancements, in the gameplay trailer below: 


Layers of Fear will support Ray-Tracing, HDR, and 4K resolution. Plus, it uses Lumen global illumination (you might recognize the word "Lumen" from Epic Games' Unreal Engine showcase back in 2021), Niagara visual effects "to create particle effects in real time" and Action System Controls "to improve the development process and optimization of all gameplay mechanics," according to a press release. 
"Creating games with Unreal Engine 5 is a great opportunity for the whole team, as it means our game development process can skyrocket in quality," Anshar Studios lead programmer Tomasz Bilnicki writes in the press release. "It has an incredible power when it comes to the implementation of dynamic lighting, shadows, and potentially beautiful worlds for players to explore. We hope that – thanks to the engine – we'll provide players with the unique, immersive, visually stunning, and atmospheric experience in graphical fidelity." 
Layers of Fear will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in June.

That's because Armored Core VI hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 25, 2023. From Software announced this out of nowhere with a surprise trailer today that runs more than three minutes long. It features plenty of flashy mech action and some teases about what might be going on in this beautiful (but distraught) sci-fi world. 
Check out the new Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is a drastic departure from the fantasy worlds of late that From Software has been creating, but this still looks decidedly From Software. And we can't wait to check it out in just a few months. 
The trailer also reveals what you can expect from the game's various digital editions and the special Collector's Edition – check them both out below: 

Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25, 2023. While waiting to learn more, check out the reveal trailer from last December. Read about From Software's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion for Elden Ring after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redfall, the vampire FPS from Deathloop developer Arkane Studios, is out in less than a week and to prepare players for what awaits, the team has released a new launch trailer aptly set to a cover of Soundgarden's "Black Hole Sun." 
It's a nice cover, and it goes quite well with what's happening in Redfall, Massachusetts, as a total eclipse has made it a haven for the game's enemy vampires. The launch trailer itself is more of what you'd expect from a Redfall trailer – vampires, cooperative action, special abilities, and plenty of FPS gunplay. Check it out for yourself below: 


For more about Redfall, read about how the game will only launch with a Quality Mode (although a 60 FPS Performance Mode is planned for post-launch), and then read about how Microsoft canceled a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall after it acquired Arkane parent company Bethesda. Listen to our thoughts on the game after going hands-on with Redfall after that. 
Redfall launches on Xbox Series X/S and PC next Tuesday on May 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Firaxis first unveiled their new tactical superhero RPG Marvel's Midnight Suns in August of 2021, its card-based battle system proved to be a point of contention among its audience, so much so that when the game was delayed a short while later, rumours started flying that the studio was going back to the drawing board on the game's combat and dropping the cards entirely. 
"Hah, that was wishful thinking for some people!" laughs director Jake Solomon when I ask him at GDC how he felt about those rumours at the time. It's well-known now that the delay was simply about polishing the game rather than anything more drastic, but to Solomon's credit he does also concede that he was perhaps "a little naïve" at the time for thinking it would go down without question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't feel very strongly about Age Of Wonders 4. But I’ll be fair; it's definitely good.
I've enjoyed most of my time with it, and the parts I didn't were probably down to caning it too hard in too short a time. Such is that reviewz lyf. Played less intensely over a longer period, I imagine more of its intricacies becoming clear, and more custom playstyles emerging to encourage more replays and challenges. As it stands though, its generally high quality and interesting systems just haven't captured my imagination.
It is not unimaginative, though. Some of its playable races are the usual elves and goblins, but most have a twist, like the cannibalistic dwarves, gold-obsessed necromancers, or the "cursed toadlings" I picked almost reflexively: a people transformed along with their warrior Queen Charming. Each comes with a starting hero and traits for their cities units, plus a set of spellbooks that determine what research you'll have access to upfront.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Why am I so slow”, complains my partner, minutes into being cajoled into playing Dota 2 for the very first time. “Ah, you’ll need to buy boots,” I say, with the hard earned wisdom of someone who’s spent over 4,000 hours clicking on wizards. “I have boots,” she says, somewhat indignantly. “Those are slippers,” I reply. “What?” she asks, somewhat more indignantly. “They don’t give you move speed,” I respond. I see a flicker of anger in her eyes, as well as maybe, just maybe, a spark of interest.


A new Dota patch came out last week, and it’s a biggun. Is it a good time for lapsed players to jump back in? Yes! Is it a good time for entirely new players to dip their toes in, while experienced players are still befuddled by a map that’s 40% bigger, featuring dual Roshan pits, new minibosses and a host of other changes? Perhaps! It’s certainly a good opportunity to test your relationship.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I meet Jake Solomon at GDC, it's his third day of unemployment. The XCOM and Marvel's Midnight Suns director and designer announced he was leaving Firaxis back in February, but his final day at the studio where he made his name and worked for more than twenty years was still very fresh in his memory. "It's surreal," he says. "For probably the next ten years, I'll refer to it as 'we' when we talk about Firaxis, and it's sad to think it's not the right pronoun anymore. It's exciting, but a little terrifying."
On the face of it, that panic might seem unfounded. Over the last decade, Solomon has become one of the most revered names in turn-based strategy games. Having cut his teeth on many of Sid Meier's Civilization games in his early years at Firaxis, he went on to become the designer who spearheaded the revival of XCOM with Enemy Unknown in 2012, before going on to direct its even more beloved sequel XCOM 2 and its War Of The Chosen expansion a few years later. Most recently, he was creative director on Marvel's Midnight Suns, which allowed him to marry his life-long love of Marvel comic books with the thrilling tactical combat he's so well known for. 
Solomon's next adventure, though, won't have the certainty of Midnight Suns' supercharged attack cards, or even the tease of an XCOM hit percentage backing him up. For not only is it Solomon's third day of unemployment when we speak; it's also the day after he revealed his plans to leave turn-based tactics games behind altogether. Instead, his sights are now set on the life simulation genre, a move that, at first glance, seems at odds with his career as a strategy designer. But over the course of our hour-long chat, it becomes increasingly clear that life sims have been a life-long obsession for Solomon, and he might have even made one by now had the development of XCOM 2 gone a little differently.

In other words, this is a new experience within Warframe that’s immediately available to newcomers, while also adding weird cool stuff for old-timers.

Anyway, I've come to realise that Vampire Survivors might be a game about running away, but actually peaks when you come to a standstill. There's a special kind of joy to be had when you're able to stop and idle.

Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores serves fans a substantial dessert that brings the main course of the campaign to a satisfying close. A dangerous new sandbox and a compelling story await Aloy, offering a nice wrap-up that also provides some tantalizing glimpses into the future. 
Unlike Zero Dawn’s Frozen Wilds DLC, which was a good but skippable side story, Burning Shores has enough relevant plot advancement to make it closer to required playing. Taking place immediately after the sequel’s conclusion, this abbreviated tale sees Aloy travel to the volcanically fra…]]></summary>

Somehow, despite being primed by the excellent time I had with its demo five years ago, I just bounced off this one. I very quickly got stuck in a frustrating loop of fatally ballsing up no matter what I did - presumably I badly biffed my stats right out the gate to get soft-locked in the first area - and despite deciding I'd restart in a day or two, several years later my play-time hasn't extended past that first session. Sad times all round, I'm sure you'll agree, but what's it got to do with Betrayal At Club Low?
Well, when I picked up Betrayal At Club Low for the RPS Game Club this month, I was transported back to my abortive run at Disco Elysium. It's not that I've never played a stat-check-heavy RPG before. Far from it. But somehow, each game's presentation resonated together in my weird brain mush. It must have been something to do with the combination of a surreal, seedy, not-quite-our-world-but-still-very-recognisable setting, and the constant presence of numbers reminding me of my character's strengths stacked up against their many, many weaknesses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Humanity is a new puzzle game from the same publisher as Tetris Effect. In the game you, as a dog, must direct an endless stream of humans as they mindlessly walk forward. It's up to you to make sure they reach safety. Join Charles Harte and me as we play a few puzzles (without revealing the final solutions) and make sure Humanity can live on. At least, I think that's what the game is about.
As a bonus, the game is also fully playable in VR using PlayStation VR2, so we took the time to show off that version of the game, as well. It is functionally the same, but it's nice to have an alternate, encompassing way to play.

Playing the full thing reveals I was correct, both for better and for worse, which is why you should never doubt me. Are we done here?
Oh alright. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a third-person action game where you play Cal Kestis in his second rip-roaring adventure across a localised part of the galaxy, fighting both the Empire and a very naughty little Sith, with a flanking attack from Cal's own regrets about getting people killed all the time. Crucially though, at least for the purposes of having fun, Cal has one of those hot glowsticks that goes *whummmmm* and cute robot friend BD-1 - but you will often be deploying both in the effort to get a new pair of trousers.

If the only thought in your mind upon completing 2019’s Jedi: Fallen Order was that you wanted more, then I have excellent news. Picking up where its predecessor left off, Jedi: Survivor isn’t just more of the same but more of virtually everything, with meaningful advances and improvements across the board. It’s a longer game with greater levels of customization, more enemies, more diverse approaches to combat and puzzles, and more storytelling and character development for its compelling cast of characters.

The sequel to the influential 1992 adventure game was first announced in 2021, but we haven’t seen much of it since its last teaser at Summer Game Fest last year. Today’s video provides a look at how hero Conrad B. Hart (and his A.I.-powered weapon A.I.S.H.A.) faces off against the shapeshifting aliens known as the Morph once more. Though the action largely retains its 2D roots, the game now sports 3D levels for more depth of movement, especially during firefights. Flashback 2 is helmed by original creator Paul Cuisset alongside the development team at Microids Studio Lyon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has released its financial results for Q3 of its 2023 Fiscal Year, which consists of roughly January through March of this year. In it, the company revealed that Xbox hardware revenue is down but its Xbox content and services revenue is slightly up thanks to Xbox Game Pass subscription growth. 
More specifically, Xbox hardware is down 30% and Xbox content and services is up 3%. Overall, Xbox's gaming revenue is down 4%, though. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that the company set third-quarter records for monthly active users and devices, and that Xbox's gaming subscriptions (see: Game Pass) reached almost $1 billion this quarter. Despite this growth and revenue, though, Microsoft did not release new numbers regarding Game Pass subscription count – the latest count was 25 million in January 2022. 
As for the dip in hardware revenue, Microsoft says the decline comes from the comparison of this quarter this year to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, which gained a boost thanks to increased console supply. 
Here are some other numbers from Microsoft's financial results: 
Revenue was $52.9 billion, an increase of 7% (or 10% in constant currency)
Operating income was $22.4 billion, an increase of 10% (or 15% in constant currency)
Net income was $18.3 billion, an increase of 9% (or 14% in constant currency)
Xbox hardware revenue is down 30%
Xbox content and services revenue is up 3%
Overall, Xbox gaming revenue is down 4%
These results arrived yesterday, shortly before the Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same purpose as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., blocked Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard today. You can read more about that here.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has the unenviable task of following what many consider to be one of the greatest games in recent memory. When it launched in 2017, Breath of the Wild revolutionized the longstanding franchise formula in innumerable ways, giving players the biggest world the series has ever featured and mechanics that allowed them to experiment with the game's physics. After spending more than an hour playing some early moments of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the answer to how this game plans on following such a tough act is a bit clearer.

The Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same function as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., has blocked Microsoft's pending $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard over cloud gaming concerns. 
This news is somewhat shocking, as quite a few experts predicted the CMA would allow the deal to go through, and while this block presents a large barrier to Microsoft's progress forward toward this acquisition, it's not a be-all, end-all for the purchase. Microsoft says it remains dedicated to this acquisition and will appeal the CMA's ruling.

Microsoft were allowed to respond to the CMA’s findings, but it seems they weren’t able to quell the regulator’s concerns, as the CMA have now vetoed the merger.

It’s a colourful, dodgeball, tactics game from ustwo, the developers behind the perspective puzzler series Monument Valley and the environmental cleaning of Alba: A Wildlife Adventure - both very cool games. Ed enjoyed his two minutes of hands-on time last year, and with a pedigree this good, it’s probably worth checking out for fans of sleepy sports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A big new update to unofficial mod tools for Alien: Isolation has greatly expanded the range of mods people can make. Modders can now add custom models, materials, textures, and more to Creative Assembly's horror shooter. To quickly demonstrate the new capabilities, the toolmaker has whipped up a small example: importing classic Counter-Strike map de_dust2 into Isolation. You can see the xenomorph stalking Dust2's sandy corridors in a fun little video below. I imagine modders are already planning bigger, more complex, and less silly uses for these new capababilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Honkai: Star Rail throws you into the body of an amnesiac protagonist with unknowable hidden powers who has been awakened from a deep slumber by someone called Kafka. This woman is something of a mystery and seems to have a flair for the dramatic as she kicks off the whole game by playing an invisible violin along to the classic Baroque epic Pachelbel’s Canon as massive, intergalactic monsters invade a spaceship.
It’s an incredibly cool opening, the kind of thing that John Wick would watch to get pumped up before, well, John Wick-ing all over the place. It’s pretty clear that Kafka isn’t a hero, but they’ve woken you up, and since you’ve got no memories, you must be one of the good guys. This setup feels familiar, but there are enough changes to make it feel new and get the blood thoroughly pumping.

My favourite detail is that you can become a werewolf and “do werewolf things”. Although getting to that stage may take a while, as associate game director Joseph Piepora recently said it would take around 150+ hours for an average player to hit the Level 100 cap. Sounds like a week’s worth of content then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funko Fusion, the mash-up co-op action game featuring a bizarre assortment of disparate properties, is the first game from 10:10 Studios. The studio was founded by TT Games veterans like Arthur Parsons, who worked as lead designer on about a dozen of TT Games' Lego games.
The game features Funko characters and worlds from Jurassic World, Back to the Future, The Umbrella Academy, The Thing, Child’s Play 2, Masters of the Universe, and other NBCUniversal properties.


Many of the properties featured in the trailer above are R-rated, and characters lose limbs and heads, use flame throwers, and get eaten by monsters. It never veers into full, non-cartoon violence, but compared to the Lego games the team worked on in the past, Funko Fusion seems like it is going for a more mature audience.

Funko Fusion is coming to consoles and PC next year.]]></summary>

The Witcher: Season 3 still features Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia but it will be his last season in the role as Netflix announced last year that Liam Hemsworth would be replacing him as the titular Witcher in Season 4. If this new Season 3 teaser is anything to go off of, Cavill's final season as Geralt looks like a great one to go out on. We get a new look at Geralt and what might be his biggest fear, Yennefer and other mainstay characters, and most interestingly, Ciri, who appears to be running from the Wild Hunt, which were the main antagonist of the last mainline Witcher game, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. 
Check it out for yourself below in the Season 3 teaser for Netflix's The Witcher: 


As you can see, this teaser features plenty of teases for what's in store in Volumes 1 and 2 of the series. And speaking of volumes, this season will be the first split season for The Witcher, taking a page out of other Netflix mainstays like Stranger Things. Volume 1 will drop June 29 and Volume 2 will drop roughly a month later on July 27.

As we've seen in games such as Tiny Echo and Lake, it can be a relaxing and enjoyable job delivering mail in a small community, and that's the pitch-perfect tone that solo developer Kela van der Deijl has managed to capture in their cutesy mail-delivery game Mail Time. After playing the Steam demo, I can tell you that it's one of the most charming games I've played all year, and it looks like I'll be able to play the rest soon because Mail Time is out this week on Thursday April 27th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Owners of AMD Ryzen 7000 processors, you may wish to reconsider any overclocking plans. This hardware family may include some good gaming CPUs but several users have recently reported cases of fatal overheating, sometimes even with their processors burning the motherboard socket in the process.


Investigations by Tom’s Hardware and YouTuber der8auer suggest the culprit is SoC (system on chip) voltages being pushed beyond safe levels during memory overclocking attempts. AMD haven’t confirmed this directly, but are supposedly working on a fix that would prevent this accidental overvolting from happening again.

Introducing something new to me in action combat is rare. In games that feature it, you’re likely using either guns to kill enemies or melee action to take them down, and I’m not often surprised by how this can work. I can, of course, fall in love with familiar combat despite that, but it’s always exciting to experience something I haven’t before, which is what Strayed Lights manages to do.

This means Sega management can now voluntarily recognise the union, or wait for the union election to take place. The newly announced Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega (AEGIS for short) is composed of around 144 employees working across several departments, including QA, marketing, localisation, product development, and live service. 


AEGIS have also teamed up with the CWA, the labour union that assisted other studio’s unionisation efforts and who previously filed unfair labour charges against Activision Blizzard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam Puzzle Fest kicks off today, offering tons of discounts on all of your favourite puzzle games. Really, though, one of the best experiences you can have this Steam Puzzle Fest week is by downloading the free demo for upcoming puzzler Viewfinder. Developed by Sad Owl Studios, I had a sneaky peek at this at GDC last month and was properly blown away by it. It might look like just another Witness-like, but don't be fooled. There are some real smart ideas in here, and I dare you not to go 'OooOOOooooOOOooooh' when you see the in-game photos you take come to life in all their full, 3D explorable glory.

It's still very early in development (like there isn't even a Steam page for it yet), but it's still an incredible-sounding concept, as every time you start a new game, a random NPC will be selected to become a serial killer. You can grow crops, fish, raise cattle, and also help save your fellow townsfolk from a rampaging murderer. Cute!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For all its flamingo thigh stews, misshapen clothes model characters and pizza-themed DJ-ing, Betrayal At Club Low is an old-school, dice-throwing RPG through and through. Every interaction you have at Club Low is determined by the rolling of dice, whether it's simply attempting to spark a conversation with a hard-of-hearing bartender, or bluffing your way into VIP backrooms where your blown fellow agent Gemini Jay is currently being grilled by the intimidating Big Mo. 
Whether you're successful in your endeavours depends on whether you can roll higher or equal to whatever value is thrown by your opponent, with each face corresponding to a particular Skill Dice you're trying to deploy to win that scenario. A lot of the time, your skill numbers aren't nearly good enough to beat your fellow clubber outright, but for me, the thrill of Club Low comes from clinching a very plain, and highly unremarkable draw, earning you the accolade of 'Success. Barely' in the ensuing results breakdown. It may not sound very sexy, but in a world where the odds are fully stacked against you, barely succeeding will do me just fine here, thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As our shuttle hits the ground, the world erupts into smoke, chaos, and confusion. Samantha, one among my ragged band of survivors, breaks down sobbing on the ground and I direct Maki, a veterinarian, to do something about it. She punches Samantha full-on in the face, knocking her unconscious (“Oh, I guess that’s what ‘knock out’ means,” I realize a moment too late). Well, at least I don’t have to worry about her running off into the woods or something. It’s a rough start, but they have no choice but to work together from here on out.
For fans of the survival simulation genre, crashlanding on an alien planet is a familiar premise, but it's one Stranded: Alien Dawn absolutely smashes. This game has been at the top of my to-be-played list for a while and now that it’s exiting early access for a full release, it’s safe to say that Stranded is the closest thing to my dream human vs nature survival game I’ve seen yet.

        <updated>2023-04-24T12:18:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a few days away from the launch of Horizon Forbidden West's Burning Shores DLC last week, Guerrilla Games has teased more adventures with Aloy. 
This news comes from a statement released by the studio to announce that studio director and executive producer Angie Smets is leaving Guerrilla to serve as the head of development strategy for PlayStation Studios. It's a move similar to the one the team's former managing director, Hermen Hulst, made in 2019, transitioning from that director position to head of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios. 


Within that statement, Guerrilla teases what could be Horizon 3 or at least, a third game in Aloy's world, as reported by PlayStation Lifestyle. 
"We have full confidence in our new leadership as they steer Guerrilla towards a bright future, expanding the world of Horizon with Aloy's next adventure and our exciting online project," the statement reads. 
As you can see, Guerrilla isn't trying to hide it – the studio has plans for another adventure with Aloy. And while rumors and speculation point to the "exciting online project" being some kind of multiplayer game within the Horizon world, this statement made sure to separate Aloy's next adventure and that online project. 
In terms of the studio's new makeup, the management team now consists of studio and production director Joel Eschler, studio director and general manager Hella Schmidt, and studio and art director Jan-Bart van Beek. Technical director Michiel van der Lee will "be focusing on the future technology and strategy for the Decima engine." 
This statement also includes some words from Smets, who leaves Guerrilla after "an incredible 20 years" there:

This knowledge comes in handy for understanding the game Hardhat Wombat, coming from George Fan (of Plants Vs. Zombies fame), with Andy Hull (of programmer on Spelunky fame). Out later this year, it's a combination puzzle-platformer and conscruction game in which you play a wombat, wearing a hard hat, who constructs increasingly complex things out of his own feces. That is no way to make a skyscraper, wombat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Replay returns, and we're checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts! Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel. 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Come on in. Please, take a seat. Welcome to the inaugural episode of our brand new (and currently untitled) supporter-first indie video show! Every month*, I'm going to be spending some time highlighting a cool indie game that deserves your attention. Think of this series as a supplement to Sin's Scout Report or our Indiescovery podcast. A brand new method for delivering piping hot recs from my desktop to yours.
My aim is to use this series as a springboard to dive deep into specific elements of a game I find particularly fascinating, sharing my discoveries with you lot behind the paywall first (and don't worry, regular readers, I'll also be making each of these videos public for all to see after a month, which should roughly coincide with the the next one going live for supporters). In it, I'll be discussing some common themes between multiple games, digging into underappreciated gems from years gone by... The remit is broad and nebulous, to the point where it's clearly obvious why I haven't been able to come up with a name for it yet.

(If you end up thinking of something, please do let me know in the comments. More than anything it'll stop me messaging Katharine a list of awful possibilites every other week, which I can only imagine is negatively effecting her feelings about me, the site and the endeavour of games journalism in general. They really have been that bad, folks. Proper rancid stuff).

Total Tank Generals is possibly the best introduction to wargames I've ever played, but to call it a light strategy game would feel like a disservice. If you're used to heavier fare this may still scratch the itch.
It's not that it's particularly simple, but it feels so damn clean and effortless to play. You'll know what you're doing in minutes, but still find a decent challenge, with lots of options but minimal analysis paralysis. I'm honestly finding it hard to fault.

Last week Total War: Warhammer III's new DLC Forge Of The Chaos Dwarfs arrived, and it highlights the setting’s greatest rivalry to comical effect.

In total, 31 sites were shut down and another five threw in the towel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most exciting and mysterious elements of Street Fighter 6 has been a World Tour, a single-player open-world exploration mode Capcom had previously only shown glimpses of. Thankfully, today’s Street Fighter 6 Showcase finally pulled the curtain back on what World Tour entails and it looks delightfully bonkers.
World Tour begins with players creation a custom fighter that serves as the mode’s protagonist. Upon creating your avatar (which can be used outside of World Tour in the online Battle Hub), you’re dropped into Metro City from the Final Fight series, one of the World Tour’s many explorable city hubs. Other destinations include the developing Asian city, Nayshall. 
As a fledgling fighter, you’ll embark on a quest to become a world warrior. You’ll accomplish this completing qu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much like its predecessor, Street Fighter 6 will have an ambitious post-release content plan. While we knew there would be downloadable content, we now have a much better idea about the cadence with which the new characters will arrive.
"A big part of Street Fighter's charm is the cast of characters from around the world that appear in each game," executive producer Shuhei Matsumoto said during today's Street Fighter 6 Showcase livestream. "We believe that Street Fighter is where players can take control of unique characters with their own awesome fighting styles. For the players – and for us as well – the appeal of the characters themselves is the most important element of the series. With Street Fighter 6, we're continuing development to deliver new characters to you every year."
During Year 1, which kicks off when the game launches, we will receive four new characters to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Rashid, A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma are the characters who will be made available during this first year of content. Rashid, who debuted in the base version of Street Fighter V, arrives in summer 2023. A.K.I., an all-new character, will arrive in fall 2023. Ed, who debuted in Street Fighter IV but was first playable in Street Fighter V, arrives in the early parts of 2024. Akuma, the Great Demon who first appeared in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, joins Street Fighter 6 in spring 2024. These characters will also appear in World Tour, the single-player RPG-inspired story mode, giving players some insight into their backgrounds.
If you buy either the Deluxe ot Ultimate Editions, you get the Year 1 characters included in that version. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2. For more on the game, check out our exclusive coverage hub here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo IV may have gone gold, but Blizzard wants to ensure the servers are durable one more time before launch. Thus, it's opening the gates of Sanctuary to players one more time in a third open beta next month. 
This next test weekend, dubbed Server Slam weekend, begins May 12 at 12 p.m. Pacific and ends May 14 at the same time. As the name suggests, Blizzard is running this beta to stress test the servers to make sure they're as sturdy as possible come June. This slice of the game is similar to the March betas in terms of content, but it will include updates and bug fixes garnered from feedback to the previous betas.
Server Slam weekend will be a clean slate as progression from the previous betas does not carry over. Additionally, the beta supports couch co-op, cross-play, and cross-progression. Players can explore Fractured Peaks in its entirety through the Prologue and Act 1, complete World Events, and face Ashava, the toughest available World Boss. Completing challenges can earn the following new rewards:
The Initial Casualty title (earned by reaching Kyovashad with one character)
The Early Voyager title (earned by reaching Level 20 on one character)
The Beta Wolf Pack Cosmetic (earned by reaching Level 20 with one character)
A new reward: the Cry of Ashava Mount Trophy (earned by defeating Ashava with one Level 20 character).
Diablo IV launches on June 6 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. It’s also Game Informer’s cover story for this month, and you can subscribe to the digital version of the magazine to read the issue or subscribe to the print edition hitting mailboxes this month.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After teasing the game during the 2022 Game Awards and giving the game a proper trailer last week, Ascendent Studios is back with a new showcase for the title, this time focused on gameplay. The footage showcases the protagonist, Jak, switching between his red, green, and blue magic for various attacks while also executing a number of powerful Furies, and using his Lash ability to pull enemies toward him and pull himself toward grapple points. You also get to see a little bit of puzzle-solving, which will also play a major role in the game.


Along with the gameplay footage, Ascendant also shared a video, seen below, highlighting some of the game's environments, which will be one of the first commercial games to use Unreal 5.1.


For a whole lot more on Immortals of Aveum, you can check out some hands-on impressions of the game resulting from a recent visit to Ascendant Studios here. You can also expect even more from our trip in an upcoming issue of Game Informer magazine.]]></summary>

Last year’s Stray meowed its way into every cat lover’s heart, Little Kitty, Big City is taking things a chaotic step further later this year, and A Space For The Unbound had an abundance of cats just lying about. Just last night, we received a release date for Mineko’s Night Market, a slice-of-life adventure that’s set on a Japanese island bursting with kittens, cats, cat gods, and other furry feline variations.


Alice0 first wrote about Mineko’s Night Market six years ago, and it’ll finally open its doors on September 26th. Slowly blink at the newest trailer below:

That's right: video game tie-ins to films! There used to be loads of them, and now there aren't. Except there are again, culminating in Renfield (of all movies) having a Vampire Survivorslike you can actually buy on actual Steam. What's going on? Is this marking the start of something new? What are some of our favourite game tie ins?

In all seriousness, though, Crime O'Clock looks to be its own distinctive beast (and not just because you seem to play as a rabbit). It has shades of Where’s Wally? (or Waldo, Wanda, Willy, Valli, and my favourite, Ali for international readers) as you’re given densely illustrated maps to navigate, and pick out key details in order to stitch together clues to solve cases. It could be very cool if all the right cogs click together.

Sometimes you're presented with a skill check and if one of your stats isn't an arbitrary number like, I dunno, seven, then whoever it is you spoke with (a king, a bard, an elf) might shutter their mouths forever.
Betrayal At Club Low is a CRPG that we're playing for our Game Club this month, and which understands the unpredictability of a face-to-face wobble of the lips, and how befriending or swindling or aggravating someone is determined by so much more than a single seven. And when all seems lost, how visiting a puddle can turn your entire evening around.

Its success validated Bethesda’s decision to buy Arkane a couple of years earlier, and left the publisher with a promising new series. But despite critical acclaim, Dishonored 2 failed to bring the series to a wider audience. And after 2017’s standalone expansion, Death Of The Outsider, Bethesda decided to put the series on pause in favour of a shorter, more experimental project - according to Arkane founder Raphaël Colantonio, who spoke to me in an interview about their cancelled project The Crossing.

That's because four of them are available later today: Teslagrad Remastered, its sequel Teslagrad 2, Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach, and a new game in the West of Loathing series called Shadows Over Loathing. 
Teslagrad 2 and Teslagrad Remastered
Tesldagrad 2 was announced last August, and it's out today. Like the first game, you'll need to harness electromagnetic powers to solve physics-based puzzles throughout Scandinavian environments. Doing so will ultimately require players to master the art of Teslamency. The art style looks great, and you can check that out and more in the new Tesldagrad 2 trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The wait has been long but it's almost over because Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is out in just a few months. 
Developer Night School Studio revealed today during a Nintendo Indie World Showcase that Oxenfree II is out July 12. It will release on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC. Alongside this release date, Night School Studio also released a new trailer showcasing more of what to expect in this spooky paranormal thriller and there's a lot going on. 


Set five years after the first Oxenfree, which was released in 2016, Oxenfree II follows Riley as she returns to her hometown of Camena to investigate some strange electromagnetic waves. Just four hours ago, a mysterious cult opened a portal above Edwards Island, and Riley and her friends aren't sure they're the ones that need to save the island but they know they have to. The trailer seems to indicate we'll be playing with different timelines, spooky ghosts from other side, and more, and we'll be doing so using a special radio. 
This time, though, we'll also have a walkie talkie to interact with locals and learn more about what might be going on. Oxenfree II: Lost Signals looks great and it hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on July 12, 2023. 
Oxenfree II: Lost Signals was originally due out in 2022 but it was delayed to 2023 last September. About a year before that delay, the game's developer was acquired by Netflix and you can read more about what that means for the studio here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mineko's Night Market, the upcoming delightfully charming social simulation adventure from Meowza Games, finally has a release date and it's out in just a few months. 
More specifically, Mineko's Night Market hits Switch and PC on September 26. Publisher Humble Games announced this during today's Nintendo Indie World Showcase alongside a new trailer showcasing more of the game's titular night market. Unsurprisingly, Mineko's Night Market continues to look great and we can't wait to learn more about this special village later this year. 


In Mineko's Night Market, an old Japanese-inspired village at the center of Mt. Fugu is visited long ago by Miko, a cat-like god. Miko visits the farms of this village each year to grant good fortune and prosperity to the farmers. However, some farmers grow impatient with their blessings and drive Miko out. With Miko banished from the land, this village works hard to create its own success and as time goes on, fewer and fewer people believe in the myth of Miko. 
But some still do, and it sounds like we'll learn more about what that means for some characters throughout our journey in the game. 
In the game, you'll befriend townsfolk, craft doodads, and ultimately prepare for the weekly night market. The quiet village becomes a bustling hub of commerce, parades, cat races, and stage performances. And when you're exploring the island, everything you find can be brought back and sold on the market. 
Mineko's Night Market hits Switch and PC on September 26, 2023. It then comes to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on October 26.

Before Dishonored, the developer was looking down the wrong end of a bad publishing deal which, in the estimation of founder Raphaël Colantonio, would have ended in either The Crossing’s cancellation or a deeply underwhelming end product. In that timeline, there’s no telling whether the studio would even exist today.


Nevertheless, for fans of Arkane’s sophisticated and immersive first-person adventures, this lost project remains tantalisingly forbidden fruit: a foolhardy mashup of single and multiplayer in which teams of invading players would attack the protagonist of a solo campaign, against the backdrop of a multiversal Paris co-designed by Half-Life 2’s Viktor Antonov.

It's a genuine marvel how I'm able to lay on the couch and play Like A Dragon: Ishin, or stream Resident Evil 4 - with admittedly, a ropey success rate - to it from my PC in the other room. I've even been reunited with some old friends, too. Welcome back to the fold, Rogue Legacy 2.
But my time spent with the Deck has me thinking that my gaming priorities have changed. I'm no longer excited by consoles that promise better graphics or blazing fast loading speeds. At least, not for big boxes designed for living rooms. Right now, I'm far more excited by the practicality of handhelds and how they'll evolve. The Deck might be the future, but it's also brought me back to my past.

The top-down action RPG The Mageseeker: A League Of Legends Story is looking to fix that, though, letting you play as the ex-convict and buff mage Sylas while he’s busy running a revolution. It comes from the developers behind the Zelda-like shop roguelite Moonlighter, and it's out now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m too prejudiced against first-person melee games to enjoy Dead Island 2 as much our reviewer Rick Lane did, but even a mind as narrowed as mine can appreciate its slick performance on PC. I wanted to see how well that smoothness and stability would carry over to the Steam Deck, and although the long-delayed zombie mulcher needs some cuts to quality settings, finding the right balance will have Dead Island 2 running almost as comfortably as the very best Steam Deck games.
Alas, it’s still not the ideal handheld game, thanks both to the odd crash (lowering settings helps with this) and the fact that it needs some tinkering with the Epic Games Launcher to get it playable in the first place. Still, playable it very much is.
Let’s start by addressing Dead Island 2’s lack of a Steam version; it launches on February 21st as an Epic Games exclusive, and since DI2 isn’t even listed on Steam right now, that’s unlikely to change any time soon. Luckily, there are workarounds: you can either install the Heroic Launcher, or follow our handy guide on how to install the Epic Games Launcher on the Steam Deck. Both of these should allow you to get Dead Island 2 downloaded onto the handheld, still using your regular Epic account.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the mists of time (January 2020), I was absolutely transfixed by a Japanese novel called Before The Coffee Gets Cold. It's about a small, cosy café where customers can travel back in time by sitting in a very particular chair, for the length of time it takes for a cup of coffee to go cold. It's not long by any means, but it affords its cast of regulars the chance to get some closure on an issue that's often been plaguing them throughout their lives. It's heart-warming, soppy stuff, but very feel-good. That January was also about the same time I slurped up every last episode of Midnight Diner on Netflix, where a chill Japanese man known only as The Master serves up delicious looking dishes in a tiny, 10-person izakaya from midnight onwards. Put these two things together, and it's probably no surprise that I liked the original Coffee Talk more than most.
Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly is a continuation of that story, set three years later in the same, alternate version of Seattle where elves, werewolves, orcs, mermaids and other fantastical creatures all rub shoulders as city-dwelling citizens in need of a good cuppa. Once again, you play as the owner of the titular late-night coffee shop, brewing up a multitude of exotic hot drinks that you'll need to match to each customer's request that night as they tell you their woes.

Nintendo and WayForward took a risk in bringing Advance Wars back from the scrap heap with Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp, releasing a set of tactics-heavy games in a genre now defined by character relationships. The remakes change little from the original releases and don’t deepen the story or cast, but they don’t have to change anything. Advance Wars’ unique features are as apparent as ever. If anything, they’re made even stronger by the series’ extended absence.
Advance Wars is light on story compared to other tactical RPGs. The nations of…]]></summary>

Taking established fictional universes in new directions is an idea we should all be behind. Too often, licensed games hew too close to established characters or scenarios, and those beloved fictional frameworks are never given a chance to grow. With Tron: Identity, Bithell Games takes the venerable Tron franchise and tries something entirely different – a visual novel with a light touch of puzzle gameplay. The novelty alone is worth some enthusiasm. However, despite a valiant attempt at a fresh take, this bite-sized release falls short in some key areas.

Unlike traditional Nintendo Directs, Indie World showcases only show third-party indie titles coming to the Switch, so don't go in expecting to hear news about Mario or Zelda. Still, there are plenty of games to be excited about. Like clockwork, every time an Indie World showcase is announced, "Silksong" starts trending on Twitter as fans of Hollow Knight eagerly await the follow-up to the 2017 Metroidvania. For a general idea of what to expect, here's a recap from the last Indie World event, shown in November 2022.

Dead Island 2 was announced just a few years after its 2011 predecessor, but the sequel has taken nearly a decade to come to life. Developer Dambuster Studios is the third studio to work on the game, using this opportunity to create its own Dead Island 2 from the ground up. While assumptions might be made about a game that’s spent this long in development, jumping from multiple teams, the final game is a worthwhile follow-up, especially for fans of the original.

The game is set to arrive on PlayStation and Xbox consoles plus PC, and while it's good to go for launch, Blizzard plans to continually update the always-online game with various content updates over the next several years. Fans recently got to explore the game's revamped take on Sanctuary for themselves in two back-to-back weekend open betas in March, letting them taste a big slice of the now-finished pie.
“Going gold is a landmark milestone for the incredible Diablo IV team, who have all worked so hard crafting the next-generation installment of this iconic franchise. This is a concrete, meaningful step toward our June 6 launch,” said Rod Fergusson, general manager of Diablo. “Whether players are veterans of the franchise or jumping in for the first time, we can’t wait for everyone to experience the full game: taking part in the incredible storytelling, experimenting with character classes and builds, and exploring what the endgame and the dark world of Sanctuary has to offer.”
Diablo IV is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and you can subscribe to the digital issue to read it right now. The print edition will start hitting subscribers’ mailboxes within the month.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joseph Staten, known for his work on the Halo series, has been hired as a Creative Director on an unannounced Netflix Games project. In his announcement tweet, Staten confirms that the game is a brand-new IP and referred to the project as a "AAA multiplatform" experience. You can read the full tweets below.
So today, I'm thrilled to announce that I've joined @Netflix Games as Creative Director for a brand-new AAA multiplatform game and original IP. Let's go! 2/2
April 17, 2023
Staten is best known for his work as a writer and cinematic director at Bungie and Microsoft, mainly working on the Halo series. While he spent a few years working at the publishing side of Microsoft, in 2020, he returned to the Halo series to work on Halo Infinite, where he worked as the game's creative director. This continued until earlier this year when he returned to the publishing side of the company amidst widespread layoffs. Now, he's left the company entirely to work on this new project with Netflix.
This is only the latest news in Netflix's spree of expansion into the gaming industry. It recently released a sequel to Valiant Hearts as part of a collaboration with Ubisoft. Last year, it acquired the developers behind Cozy Grove, bringing its total number of internal development teams to five if you include the in-house studio that Staten just joined. On top of that, the film and tv side of Netflix has been working on loads of game adaptations, including Gears of War, Pokémon Concierge, and a new patch of episodes of Sonic Prime.

Video games often rely on the trope of saving the world from an impending apocalypse. Those world-ending events usually come via megalomaniacal supervillains or extraterrestrial invaders, but what happens when the threat to our planet is us? Terra Nil poses that question, placing you in charge of restoring a world ravaged by the effects of climate change and human civilization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Months before the premiere of the very successful Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Paramount announced plans to create a live-action spin-off TV show starring Knuckles. After over a year of silence, we now know the project is officially underway, as well as the cast that will bring the series to life. 
Sonic the Hedgehog director Jeff Fowler also sits at the helm of this series, and he tweeted the above image of the Knuckles clapperboard complete with the character’s cowboy hat that he donned in the ‘90s animated film Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie. Production is currently taking place in London, with Sonic the Hedgehog 2 screenwriter John Whittington serving as head writer and executive producer.

The show is expected to premiere on Paramount+ later this year, with Idris Elba reprising his role as Knuckles. Variety reports that other returning stars from the films include Adam Pally as Wade Whipple and Tika Sumpter as Maddie. The cast also includes Edi Patterson (The Righteous Gemstones), Julian Barratt (Mindhorn), Scott Mescudi (AKA Kid Cudi), Ellie Taylor (Ted Lasso), and Rory McCann (Game of Thrones).
Plot details remain scant, but Knuckles is set after the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and before the upcoming third film, set to hit theaters on December 20, 2024. The story centers on Knuckles taking on Wade as his student, training him to become an Echidna warrior.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firmament, the upcoming puzzle adventure game by the studio behind Myst, Riven, and Obduction, finally has a release date, and it’s just a month away.
The game launches on PC and Mac on May 18 and will come to PlayStation consoles and PS VR2 at a later date. Firmament was initially funded via Kickstarter and was first teased way back in March 2018. It drops players into a mysterious steampunk world consisting of three abandoned realms full of secrets to uncover, such as strange giant machines. Helping you along the way is The Adjunct, a silent clockwork companion, as well as a strange spirit who has her own story to unravel. Firmament also supports VR play on PC, so players can use a variety of headsets, including Valve’s Index, HTC Vive, as well as Oculus headsets such as the Rift and Quest 2.

The Vampire Diaries follows Elena Gilbert, a high school student who discovers vampires are living in her hometown after one of them attacks her younger sister. The game is loosely based on the book series of the same name by author L. J. Smith, which later got adapted into a hit TV series.
Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill is the first installment of the long-running Nancy Drew game series, also based on a book series of the same name. In her first adventure, Nancy seeks to uncover the killer of a high school student who seems to have been disliked by all of his classmates.
You will need the data files from the games’ original install CDs, and a fresh daily build of ScummVM. Apart from the original release, Secrets Can Kill’s Russian translation is also supported. The ScummVM wiki pages for The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill contain information on which datafiles are needed. Please, report any problems you encounter in our issue tracker.

The game no longer crashes when a spectator in a network game tries to interact with a town’s local authority. For NewGRF authors using the new engine variant feature introduced in 13.0, we’ve added a callback to select how the engine’s name is displayed in the buy menu.

Anyone who has a copy of Backyard Football, Backyard Baseball 2001, and even Backyard Football 2002 (which was originally a LAN-only title) can download the latest daily build* of ScummVM and play online games against real people!
This all became possible because the three developers from the Backyard Sports Online fork had joined the team and brought their services with them to the ScummVM. These are LittleToonCat, Jim “jibbodahibbo” Westerkamp and Sam “QuestionMonkey” Kupfer.
Please note that Backyard Football and Backyard Baseball 2001 require online accounts for the complete online experience, so you need to register to Backyard Sports Online, which is our fantastic online-play service and a thriving community of fellow Backyard Sports players, they even have a couple of competitive online Baseball and Football leagues, if that's your style, you can find more information in their Discord server! People who already have a Backyard Sports Online account can log in using the latest daily build and play, but if you do not, you can register right here! This is not required to play Backyard Football 2002 online.
If you encounter any issues playing online, please let us know via the issue tracker.
This fantastic art is done by a fellow BSO community member Peppyrus.
* only the Windows, macOS, Debian, Raspberry Pi, and Android builds are compatible with network play at the moment. And only the 2.8.x branch of ScummVM has this functionality.
