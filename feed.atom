        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gruigi time?
The box office for The Super Mario Bros. Movie is huge. Like, record-breaking huge. It feels like yesterday that cries of "the video game movie curse" filled the air whenever a new take on a game hit cinemas, but now we know that these adaptations can be both good and big. Really big.
The Mario Movie's success at the box office will undoubtedly spawn at least one sequel and we'd be surprised if the spin-offs end there (might we be looking at the start of the NCU?). In the past, we thought about the potential for other animation studios to take the reins on some of Nintendo's much-loved franchises — we still stay awake at night thinking of a Metroid film in the style of Into the Spiderverse — but it looks like, for the time being at least, future Nintendo movies will be firmly in the hands of Illumination.

It's time for another edition of Box Art Brawl, are you ready to rumblllllllle?
Before we introduce today's competitors, let's have a little look at what went down last week. Capcom's Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles was the game on the table for the last brawl, with a tasty three different covers up for discussion and a whole lotta differences between them. Now this was a difficult one to call, but it was Europe's grizzly zombie cover that came out on top with 47% of the vote. North America landed in second place with 27% and the Japanese box art closely followed with 26%.

I think I'm getting better, but some dogged symptoms still have the better of me. Here's hoping that I can mop it up this weekend.
Aside from that, little else to report, I hope that you all enjoyed this week's Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom trailer. That is not a game for me, but I'm very happy to see all y'all happy. We actually look to be heading into something of a very special summer, with Zelda, Str…]]></summary>

It's got turn-based tactical combat against rats with magic rifles in a steampunk world already in ruins. It's got the need to keep on moving, lest an approaching rat horde overwhelm you. It's got bunkers in which your party rests, de-stresses, and tools up before moving on.

Kind of a Fallouty, XCOMy, FTLy, Vermintidey mix, then - which together seems very cool. It's out now, and there's a demo.

There are few moments as blood-pumpingly dramatic in a Yakuza/Like a Dragon game as when someone rips their shirt off and unveils their tattoos. It is the peak of a fight, often reserved for special showdowns or the height of the story's arc.
Sega—for a reason I can't really discern at this moment—recently posted a compilation celebrating just that: the epic back tattoo reveal moments of Ryu Ga Gotoku's Like a Dragon series. From the original Yakuza games up through Like a Dragon, there are many. And they're all spectacular.

This week's trip back to the golden age of gaming, guided by the retro-lovers over at Hamster Corporation, sees us take a look at the much lesser-known sequel to one of the most beloved coin-op classics of all time — Now available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, its Namco's Dig Dug II!
Released to the arcade market in 1985, before later being ported to the Famicom platform, Dig Dug II features all of the sounds and visuals of the seminal 1982 original, but chooses to set the action on the surface, forgoing the mine-based gameplay of the original and somewhat removing both the "Dig" and the "Dug". Hero Taizo returns, once again armed with his trusty harpoon pump with which he must fend off iconic enemies including Pookas, and Fygars.
In addition, Taizo is now equipped with a jackhammer, and is able to partition areas of each stage to sink into the ocean, destroying all nearby enemies, and perhaps Taizo himself if the player is careless with their jackhammering activities. You can check out the cutesy action for yourself in the gameplay video below, courtesy of YouTuber Replay Burners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvPB1HOVXrA&ab_channel=ReplayBurners
While Namco should be congratulated for at least trying something a little different, Dig Dug II just doesn't have quite the same compelling nature of the original, with the top-down maze style a poor replacement for the original game's strategic tunneling system. The sequel would not receive an official home release outside of its native Japan, only appearing in the form of latter-day Namco compilations and retro re-releases. It's perfectly fine, of course, as is the case for almost all Namco classics, but simply cannot hold water when compared to its exceptionally well-designed forerunner.
Dig Dug II is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

The freedom to glide from rooftop to rooftop over haunted Tokyo will bring you so much more joy than any incremental damage upgrade. That's the most important thing I have to say, that it makes for good virtuatourism.
Oh, and I suppose a free content arrived this week too, adding new side-missions, handy new combat abilities, and a new "rogue-lite" mode. The update, uh, apparently also added Denuvo, over a year after the game launched? Cool, cool.

Nintendo is believed to be at it again with YouTube takedowns, reportedly targeting Zelda: Breath of the Wild mods.
The YouTuber supposedly in the company's firing line is the streamer and modder known as 'PointCrow'. He's got 1.6 million subscribers and made headlines in 2021 for offering $10,000 USD to anyone who could assemble a Breath of the Wild multiplayer mod.

For some, the Nintendo Switch can be an expensive investment. Once you've purchased the console itself, there are additional Joy-Con controllers, the Nintendo Switch Online membership, and, of course, first-party titles like Super Mario Odyssey that almost never seem to go on sale, even years after their release.
Thankfully, there are some awesome games on this system that cost absolutely nothing to play and are most certainly worth your time and attention. Here are the 10 best free-to-play games on Nintendo Switch you can enjoy right now.

The music of The Legend of Zelda is as much a part of the series’ identity as any of its characters, locations, and items. Though the specific arrangements change throughout the series, there are always familiar tracks and themes for fans to hear. This unique but similar philosophy to Zelda music allows games like The Wind Waker to have their own identity while still being unmistakably part of the wider Zelda world. Other games might have more iconic scores or a wider range of songs, but the music in The Legend of Zelda is among the most recognisable in gaming history.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fears of the Kingdom.
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was revolutionary for the Zelda series in a number of ways. You can talk all day about the stunning open world, the tonal shift, the slew of characters and references, and the change in the overall structure of a Zelda game. But maybe the biggest surprise was that it was the first game in the series to feature proper voice acting (no, the Phillips CD-i games don't count).
For the first time in the franchise's 30-year history, Zelda, Impa, and plenty of new and returning characters had a voice we could hear. But there's one big exception to the rule — Link, the hero of Hyrule himself. We're all pretty accustomed to Link's "hyaah!"s and "aaaahhh"s at this point, but given that so many of the major players speak, and Link just remains silent throughout important story moments, it seems a little bit odd, even if it's a recurring theme in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity and Tears of the Kingdom.

Last month, the new Peppa Pig: World Adventures game made headlines when a clip of the game showing a random Memoriam tribute to Queen Elizabeth II went viral.
The game's lead producer David Moral has shed some light on the situation, explaining to Eurogamer how the Queen passed away during development and the "whole trip in London" featuring the her had already been implemented. It "didn't feel right" to remove the content, so the team instead added a special screen paying its respects.

Pokemon Scarlet & Violet have released so many 7-Star Tera Raids lately that they’ve started to blur together in my mind.

Looking back, Excitebike would have benefited from being released a couple years later. Originally on Famicom in 1984, it was still stuck in the arcade mindset. It was very strictly round-based, there was no real progression, and the best you could do was compete for best time, which wasn’t actually recorded on the game itself.
The most console-specific feature that it had was a track builder, which was definitely cool. However, on NES, you couldn’t actually save your track, which was far less cool. If you were on Famicom, you could actually save tracks using the Famicom Data Recorder, which would save your data to a cassette tape. That’s extremely cool to a retro geek like me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new look for an evolving studio
Remedy Entertainment is updating its look. After over 20 years of sticking to the same logo, Remedy unveiled its new logo today.
The old Remedy logo, with a bullet in the letter R, was representative of the era of Max Payne, and a different kind of Remedy. But, as communications director Thomas Puha writes in the announcement, Remedy is evolving. And so its logo is evolving, too, to better reflect today's Remedy.
"The Remedy logo means a lot to us, but we know it also means a lot to you," Puha said. "Like the games we create at Remedy, we approached this process with great care, consideration and a lot of passion! We want to create memorable worlds, stories, and characters for you to experience through our games. We wanted our new logo to reflect how we constantly evolve and continue creating exciting games with the very best people. However, it’s all still one Remedy where courageous creativity thrives. We hope you like the new look."
The new logo, seen above, is an R with a bit of a mirrored, staggered look. It does remind me a bit of some of the visual effects from Control, which suits Remedy's lean into sci-fi storytelling over the years.

A question of identity
It might seem like a little shift, but reading about this today did make me reflect on how Remedy has shifted over the years. The studio started out in 1995, with an eye-shaped logo that infamously prompted a standoff with LucasArts and led to the logo that stuck for two decades.
In the time since, Remedy went from May Payne to Alan Wake, then on to Quantum Break. And now, with the success of 2019's Control, the studio is planning several spin-offs, as well as a Max Payne remake compilation. There's even Alan Wake 2 due out this year, a launch target that Remedy reaffirms in today's news. The studio's certainly grown a lot, and now it's got a new look to go with it.

Hi, I'm The Industry's Chris Moyse, you might remember me from articles such as 10 Best Lawsuits Filed Against Activision Blizzard and Juri's Soles: Delicious but Deadly, but today I'm here to talk to you about America's favorite animated, non-prehistoric family: The Simpsons.
In the 35+ years that The Simpsons has been on television — only 12 of those being years being Good — Captain Wacky and his family have taken a delightfully satirical stab at practically all forms of art, entertainment, and global services. From comic books to movies, cartoons to pop music, and even services such as Uber and esports in episodes that you haven't seen because you tuned out years ago.

We have a new trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the last one we'll see ahead of the game's launch next month. While it gave us some answers, we still have a boatload of new and old questions.
For a three, almost four-minute video, it's absolutely stuffed with things to talk about. Ganondorf has officially returned, there may be other forces at play, and theories about what's to come are being forged as we speak. So, we've gone beat-by-beat to piece apart some interesting tidbits we can glean from the video.

I’d be surprised if Victory Heat Rally didn’t catch your eye. It’s an intoxicatingly colorful and energetic-looking title. Based on the aesthetic from Sega Super Scaler racers like Power Drift and Rad Mobile, it’s a far cry from the mostly drab modern racing market. I’ve been following it for what feels like forever, but it’s taken me some time to get around to the demo.
Thankfully, Victory Heat Rally is more than just appearances. Without hyperbole, this is one of the most compelling racing titles I’ve played in a long time. It’s fast, vibrant, and deftly captures the attention-grabbing magic of old arcade titles. Just by following its development, I knew that Victory Heat Rally was going to be a worthwhile title, but I couldn’t imagine it would be this good.

Publisher Sega, in association with developer Relic Entertainment, has announced that wartime strategy sequel Company of Heroes 3 will be making its debut on PS5 and Xbox Series X on May 30, following on from its initial PC release in February of this year.
This will be the first time that the lauded strategy series will be made available on console platforms, with Relic promising a fully optimized experience for PlayStation and Xbox players. Company of Heroes 3 will feature a fully overhauled U.I. and control system designed especially for the console platforms, with in-game features such as Full Tactical Pause allowing players to masterfully control their troops in the thick of the action, unperturbed by the lack of mouse & keyboard control systems.

Set against the backdrop of the North African campaign of World War II, Company of Heroes 3 offers up new solo and multiplayer game modes, as well as the new, sandbox-style, Italian campaign. Unfortunately, reviews were incredibly divisive for the ambitious new release, and while many praised the sequel's new control features and highly impressive destruction physics, some critics complained that the title didn't do enough to recreate the intensity of battle, with weak A.I. opposition and a casual approach to moment-to-moment warfare.
Fortunately, the community has been utilizing the feedback forum to discuss the title's issues with developers. So, hopefully, there will be time and opportunity to polish the game's rougher edges.
Company of Heroes 3 launches on PS5 and Xbox Series X May 30. It is available right now on PC.

Solo-developer Wegenbartho-Games has launched a Kickstarter for their murder mystery adventure, The Murder Hotel. The campaign runs until May 3, 2023 and is seeking €8,500.
This is kind of hilarious. The Murder Hotel is a murder mystery, but rather than figure out the murderer, I guess you already know: It’s some scissor-wielding demon. The demon won’t let you leave unless you pin their murders on the various guests. Like, they didn’t actually do it, but you have to come up with a super-plausible theory that “proves” that they did. So, you’re just deliberately accusing innocent people.
[caption id="attachment_373827" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Wegenbartho-Games[/caption]
You need to convince a demon council, so maybe there won’t be any real repercussions for these people you accuse. I choose to believe they’re just going to be sucked down into Hell. I’m feeling really malicious, so I want to just creatively screw some digital people over.
Beyond the concept being delectable, the campaign is pretty informative on where the project is and what planning has been done. It’s enough information to build confidence and outline all the plans.
The downside is that the plan is for The Murder Hotel to launch in December 2024. That’s a reasonable development period, but I want it now. There are stretch goals for more languages and another to have actual voice-over. I hate when people talk to me, so that’s not a must-have feature for me.
The Murder Hotel is slated for release on Switch and PC. The Kickstarter campaign runs until May 3, 2023 and is projected to release in December 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Typhlosion has physical and special moves
Typhlosion is here in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, and with it comes a corresponding 7-Star raid. Anyone who defeats Typhlosion will be able to catch it, so we caught it as we always do. Check out all its stats, abilities, and moves below.
If you need help unlocking this encounter, check out our guide here.
[gallery size="large" columns="2" ids="373732,373733"]
Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Typhlosion loot list
Here’s everything I earned during my first clear of this battle. As a reminder, you can only catch Typhlosion once while the event is live. However, you can run the battle continuously for rewards.
Exp.Candy L x6
Exp.Candy XL x4
Calcium x5
Ghost Tera Shard x20
Ghost Tera Shard x10
TM114
Ability Patch X1
Star Piece x2
Exp.Candy L x6
Bottle Cap x1
Calcium x5
PP Up x1
Exp. Candy L x5
Mild Mint
Look at those Ghost Tera Shards, maybe I'll use them on Annihilape! TM114 (Shadow Ball) and the Ability Patch are only guaranteed to drop once, though more Ability Patches may appear if you continue to farm this encounter.
[gallery columns="4" ids="373734,373735,373736,373737"]
Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Samurott moves and stats
Typhlosion sports the Ghost Tera Type, making it similar to Hisuian Typhlosion from Pokemon Legends: Arceus. Like past events, it is level 100 and has its hidden ability Flash Fire. Here are its moves:
Eruption
Shadow Ball
Play Rough
Earthquake
Here are Samurott’s stats:
HP – 297
Attack - 204
Defense – 172
Sp. Atk – 279
Sp. Def – 206
Speed – 236
Also like past 7-Star encounters, Typhlosion will have the Mightiest Mark. This grants it the title of Typhlosion the Unrivaled.
Does the Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Typhlosion count as a Paldean Pokedex entry?
Nope! The Pokedex will stay at a maximum of 400, regardless of how many event monsters you catch. This may change down the line, but for now, Typhlosion doesn’t affect your Pokedex completion.

Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment has revealed a new company logo, and fans of the letter R are sure to be pleased as punch.
It’s been 20 years since Remedy updated its logo, but above is the image that will appear on the studio’s projects going forward. That includes Alan Wake II, a yet-to-be-revealed Control sequel, a Control multiplayer title, and remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2. The previous logo was pretty much just the letter R too, but this one has a different font and kind of hurts our eyes looking at it. 
In a blog post, Remedy gives its simple rationale for the update: 
“The bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne, but the Remedy of now is much bigger than a single game; we have a whole portfolio of games, new and old.  
It was time to update and redefine our visual identity to bring more consistency, showcase our evolution over the years, and better express our vision of today’s Remedy.”
So there you have it. What do you think of Remedy’s new logo? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

It was already interesting and good enough pretty much right away to earn a recommendation, but after one of what will definitely be several playthroughs, leaving my praise that faint would do it a terrible injustice.


Loretta is goddamn excellent by any standard. Where other games use the mentally unwell narrator to explain everything away with "turns out you're secretly crazy", it's instead just one layer of a complex horror mystery with splashes of drama and noir, whose surprises I'm straining not to spoil.

We're roughly one month out from the launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and another Nintendo property is joining the festivities. Splatoon 3 will host a Zelda-themed Splatfest on the weekend before Tears of the Kingdom's launch.
Running from May 5 to May 7, this special Splatfest will split players up amongst the three sections of the Triforce: Wisdom, Power, and Courage. Pick your favorite aspect of the Triforce, or maybe just your favorite holder to back, and join in the inky battles.
The Splatfest will also host fights on a special version of Scorch Gorge, with a Triforce-style layout. This map seems pretty well-suited to Tricolor Turf Wars in particular, which seems like it could make that mode fairly appealing for the weekend.

Get your Splatoon x Zelda virtual look too
It's not just about the battles, though. As any Splatoon player will tell you, it's as much about the fashion. And this special three-way Splatfest will also have residents of the Splatlands dressing up in themed shirts for the showdown, too.
Themed shirts are also hitting the Nintendo store, for real-life wear. So if you're a fan of both Splatoon and Zelda, and wanted to express that in everyday life, you've got an easy medium for it now. There's also a sale available for a bundle with Splatoon 3 and a three-month Nintendo Switch membership, running from April 17 through May 7.
Nintendo hosted a launch-window Splatfest for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet as well, and it's nice to see them keeping the trend up. It's a fun way to celebrate a new game launch, and all the added theming and cosmetics are a neat touch. So yes, I think I'll be booting Splatoon back up for a few matches, just to lock in my Power vote and shirt.

Although the game still could use some cleaning up, Game Freak is doing a decent job of keeping Pokemon Scarlet & Violet events and promos running: even if most of the latter are fairly small time. Well, there's
Spotted by Japanese Pokemon players via Pokemon Company emails (including this tweet from Twitter user ShxQ183ag88QPe6, who screenshotted the email), these new codes dole out items for the game, and can be redeemed once per save file.
New Mystery Gift codes have rolled out in April
Here's a list of all the codes and when they expire:
LEVEL UP (10 Rare Candies, expires on October 2, 2023)
CATCHBYBALL (Five balls of multiple varieties [Luxury, Quick, Nest, Dive, Dusk, Timer], expires on October 2, 2023)
REV1VE (Five Rare Candies, expires on October 2, 2023)
I know some folks are kinda bummed that so many of these item rollouts are duds, but hey, it's something at least!
Also, remember a Palafin distribution is going on
All of these Mystery Gift codes dropped at once, including one for a special Palafin. That code is "0C1CV1CT0RGAV1N" if you haven't redeemed it yet.
We have more info on the Palafin itself here.

How to redeem Mystery Gift codes in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet
After the treasure hunt starts (read: following your full tour of the academy), you can select the mystery gift option in the main X button menu. Here's how to find the mystery gift menu:
Press X and select "Poke Portal"
On the Poke Portal screen, scroll down and find "mystery gift," then select that option
Select "get with code/password"
Enter the code(s)

I mean, I barbecued some womb in a restaurant in Japan recently, and I can confirm that it was like calamari but tougher, and, largely, a lot worse. So, that's why the idea of Pringles releasing a limited-edition Minecraft Suspicious Stew flavour intrigues me! I would like to give it a go and see if it's actually quite nice or makes me barf.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japan's brutal working culture isn't exactly a secret. You've probably heard the horror stories, or at least, got the general gist that success in Japanese business often equates to time. You don't necessarily need to be doing work, you just need to be present as the clock hands shift. A hard worker is reduced to a statue that only springs to life again when their boss gets up to leave.
Mr. Saitou is a short pixel art RPG that offers a hilarious commentary on the absurdities of working culture in Japan, with occasional flashes of seriousness. Completable in one sitting, it's a game I'd recommend to anyone.

Splatoon 3's next Splatfest has been revealed, and it's a doozy of a collaboration between the inklings, octolings and The Legend of Zelda series. The Zelda-themed Splatfest kicks off on 5th May at 5pm PT and finishes at 5pm PT on 7th May.
To celebrate the launch of the highly anticipated Tears of the Kingdom next month, you need to answer that all-important question — Which do you seek? Power, Wisdom, or Courage? That's right, it's all about the pieces of the Triforce, which is pretty darn fitting. Not only that but during the Tricolor Turf War, matches will take place in a unique triforce-shaped version of Scorch Gorge for this Splatfest only.

A teasing look at the art book that comes packaged with the Street Fighter 6 Mad Gear Box, (that's a "collector's edition" to you and me), has given SF players a glimpse at some of the cool concept art that has gone into the redesign of the 18 World Warriors that feature in the fantastic-looking sequel. More importantly, however, it has offered us the hypothetical pleasures of a bald Juri.
The new images, pulled directly from the final draft of the art book, were shared on Twitter by Street Fighter 6 director Taka Nakayama, and offer a sneak peek at the initial design ideas for new characters such as Jamie and Kimberly, as well as the revitalized drips for veterans such as Chun-Li and Ryu.

We are living in an unprecedentedly competitive attention economy, one in which time and energy are increasingly finite and precious. Because of this, it can be easy to overlook games which appear simple and unassuming at first glance: retro monochromatic Game Boy-style graphics, cute-but-childish anthropomorphic characters, 8-bit chiptune soundtrack — Melon Journey: Bittersweet Memories is an old-school adventure RPG nostalgia trip, sure, but it reconnects us to a simpler gaming time and it's got all the hallmarks of a future hidden gem.
The original Melon Journey was a small RPG maker game created over a decade ago by indie team Froach Club. It quickly became a cult classic, with a sold-out 'Pocket' version being released for Game Boy later this year by Limited Run Games. This new entry with the 'Bittersweet Memories' subtitle was created as less of a sequel to the original, and more of an expansion on the previous bite-sized explorative adventure.

[Update: The code has officially been unveiled! Input "0C1CV1CT0RGAV1N" into the mystery gift menu of the game to get Palafin in a Cherish Ball. You have through April 17 to claim it!]
We have yet another Pokemon Scarlet & Violet distribution on the horizon, and this one is already technically included in the game: Palafin. As you may know, acquiring Palafin in Scarlet & Violet is done by evolving Finizen at level 38 while using the (online) Union Circle system. Some folks haven't done this yet (or are unable to), so perhaps this distribution will help!
Here's the full tweet from the Play Pokemon Twitter account:
"Tune in for the 2023 European International Championships live stream starting April 14th for some fantastic #PokemonVG & #PokemonTCG gifts! Learn how to add Palafin to your team roster and Miraidon ex to your digital Pokémon TCG collection."

The accompanying news article has a bit more info on how it'll actually be distributed, and a confirmation that it's based on competitive Pokemon player Gavin Michael's Palafin:
"Wait for the password to appear during the 2023 EUIC broadcast, then go to the Mystery Gift feature in your game and enter the password to receive Gavin Michaels' Palafin—you can even add it to your next competitive team! This password can only be used once per save data."

So that's it! Wait for the code to arrive and enter it. Seems easy enough! We'll update you when that time comes. Until then, you can find all the info you need on the Palafin itself below.
Promo Gavin Michaels Palafin info:
Poké Ball: Cherish Ball
Gender: Female
Level: 50
Original Trainer: Gavin
Nature: Adamant
Ability: Zero to Hero

A new update for Tango Gameworks' cyber-noir actioner Ghostwire: Tokyo has quietly added the controversial Denuvo anti-piracy technology to the title, over a year on from the game's initial release.
The addition, spotted by eagle-eyed players, was authenticated by DOSG after an experiment conducted by the website caused the title to flag authentication errors, revealing that Denuvo software was now implemented in the first-person adventure, which launched on PC in March 2022. The Denuvo software has been a source of irritance in the PC world, following frequent instances where the resource-hungry anti-tamper tech has, reportedly, caused performance issues in PC ports of popular titles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN26_029gzY&ab_channel=BethesdaSoftworks
Just recently, Capcom removed Denuvo from the PC port of Resident Evil Village — a title that appeared to be hugely hindered by the addition of the software from a performance standpoint. The addition of Denuvo to Ghostwire: Tokyo, a title published by Bethesda Softworks, comes just weeks after the publisher has come under fire for announcing that its upcoming vampire hunter, Redfall, would also support the copy-protection software.
In addition to the implementation of Denuvo, the new Ghostwire: Tokyo update includes a selection of new missions, new combat abilities including "Charge Rush" and a new counter-attack skill, as well as new roguelite mode, which goes by the sinister title of The Spider's Thread. Ghostwire: Tokyo is available now on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.
Confirmed, Bethesda has added Denuvo to Ghostwire: Tokyo [DSOG]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's grade the gorgeous Gerudo.
Let's talk about Ganondorf. Yes, that final trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom really was something, but what was the internet's biggest talking point once it was out in the open? Ganondorf got swole.
Now that we know of Ganondorf's appearance in TOTK, we've been reminiscing about all of the times that we have faced the Gerudo warlock in the past in an attempt to work out which version is the best. For many of us, our introduction to Ganon's human form came in Ocarina of Time, though with Big-G appearing on several separate occasions across a variety of mainline games and spin-offs, there are a good number of versions to choose between.

Update : Nintendo of Europe has provided a statement to Eurogamer saying that following its suspension of the eShop and officially shipping products to Russia in 2022, it "has decided to wind down operations of its Russian subsidiary".
Noting the current "economic outlook" as a factor, NOE states that it will "maintain a minimal presence in Russia to complete the wind-down process, and to fulfil legal, contractual and administrative requirements," and that "advanced discussions" have taken place with repair and warranty service suppliers in the region, "with LLC Achivka being one such potential supplier."

A legal challenge, issued by a party of video game fans against the proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft, has returned to cause more headaches for the publishers concerned — The so-called "Gamers' Lawsuit" was initially filed in December 2022, but, (as noted by GamesIndustry.biz) was dismissed by a judge last month.
The suit, put together by 10 members of the public hailing from New Jersey and New Mexico, argues that Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard forms antitrust issues, suggesting that the purchase would result in the closure of rival studios, a rise in the price of games, and the inhibition of competition, among other negative effects.

Thankfully though, in the US you can actually pick up AMD's more powerful last-gen flagship card, the RX 6950 XT, for just $10 more thanks to a deal at Newegg.

A few hours ago, the site shocked its users by shutting itself down.

Minecraft the game and Minecraft the franchise are two different, yet equally fascinating beasts.
Minecraft needs no explanation. If you’re reading this, I’m sure you already have an opinion on it. But its many spinoffs haven’t necessarily stayed true to more than Minecraft’s overall aesthetic. Minecraft: Story Mode gave us a Telltale narrative adventure when that was the rage, and Minecraft Dungeons asked “What if Minecraft was Diablo?” Minecraft Legends is the newest game in this extended Minecraftian Universe, this time introducing the blocky world to the strategy genre.
Some may take umbrage with these Minecraft spinoffs, but I’m in favor of them. I never got invested in Minecraft proper; I just wasn’t in the right time and place at the height of its popularity. That s…]]></summary>

Mojang Studios has returned to the crafting table in an attempt to take Minecraft in a bold new direction. Minecraft Legends is an open-world real-time strategy game where you gather resources, build defenses, and summon adorable mercenaries to protect the sanctity of the realm. Instead of the birds-eye perspective often featured in strategy games, Legends opts for a character-focused view, with your hero roaming the landscape on dynamic mounts, sword in hand, using resources and armies to e…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surveying the sprawling piglin outpost before me, a plan forms. With a flourish of button presses from my controller, I spawn a sizeable army of zombies. They'll zomble their way up the main path, and with their high health pools they'll cut into the vast piglin forces and buy me time. With another flourish a contingent of friendly creepers scuttles along behind me. I lead them on a flanking attack around the outpost, targeting their spawners while the main piglin army is occupied with my frontal assault. A masterpiece of tactical engineering!
Or it would have been, if my minions weren't so bloody stupid. Half my zombies fell off the staircase they were climbing due to their terrible pathfinding, and burned up in the lava moat below. Meanwhile, I sent my creepers off to explode against the first spawner I found. Only one of them got there; the others relentlessly humped a wall they could easily have climbed, until Piglins surrounded and slaughtered them. I returned to my starting point with what remained of my army, a fair bit poorer in resources, and a great deal poorer in patience.
Welcome to Minecraft Legends, a strange mixture of real-time strategy and open-world adventure which frustrates and impresses in equal measure. There's half a great game lurking here, but it's marred by inadequacies that have nibbled away at me like piglins at my walls. This game could have been so much more.

It’s not even a slow news day, but someone needs to talk about the rampant shirtlessness that’s going on in Hyrule these days. If someone is even wearing a shirt, it’s very likely that it is only half a shirt. Zelda has long been the series of choice for people who leave the camera lingering on a character’s physique for an inappropriate amount of time, ever since the Great Fairy popped out of Ocarina of Time. This kind of discourse is important, regardless of whether or not it will be forgotten about in a week’s time.
I have carefully analyzed the latest trailer for Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and through painstaking research and self-reflection, I have deduced the scientifically hottest hotties featured in the trailer.

Today's Final Fantasy XVI State of Play was centered completely on the upcoming RPG. It was easily the most extensive look we've had yet, showcasing everything from combat and bosses to RPG systems.
Final Fantasy XVI follows Clive, the protagonist, through three different parts of his life. Part of it shows him as a young teen, then again in his 20s, and later in his 30s. The warrior finds himself set on a quest for revenge across the world of Valisthea, dealing with the politics and powers of the supernatural Eikons and massive crystals along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s PlayStation State of Play was devoted entirely to showcasing new footage and information for Final Fantasy XVI, giving fans a guided tour of its action, exploration, characters, and more.


The presentation showed off a hefty amount of the flashy action RPG combat we recently got to sample in a recent hands-on demo. Though the story begins by following protagonist Clive in his 20s, the plot will also explore periods of his teen years and 30s. We got a look at the world map, various accessibility rings, and the combat prowess of Clive’s faithful wolf companion, Torgal. 
We also looked at Cid’s hideaway, a large headquarters that opens up later in the game where you can craft gear, buy items at a store, check quests, interact with allies, and practice abilities in a special training room. Despite showing off so much, teases that Square Enix still has plenty to share in the future regarding story quests, side quests, and endgame content. 
Final Fantasy XVI launches on June 22 for PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by reading our recent features breaking down the game's Eikon combat, Arcade Mode, and interviews with the developers who discuss the game's balance of multiple gameplay styles, its return to high-fantasy, and the series' abandonment of turn-based action.]]></summary>

It's possible to install Windows on your Steam Deck if you wish, but the drivers are rudimentary and there are a bunch of obstacles when it comes to controlling Windows via Steam Deck's controls or its touchscreen.

A leaked project from an internal Microsoft hackathon shows that staff at the operating system developer have noticed these issues - although it sounds like a version of Windows optimised for gaming handhelds is a long way off.

Warner Bros. Games and Rocksteady have officially moved the Suicide Squad into 2024. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has been delayed to February 2, 2024.
A report from Bloomberg in March said that Warner Bros. was looking at moving Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League from its May date out to sometime later this year. Today's news pushes it even further out, roughly nine months away.
"We have made the tough but necessary decision to take the time needed to work on getting the game to be the best quality experience for players," reads today's statement on social media. "Thank you to our amazing community for the continued support, patience and understanding. There is much more to share in the months ahead and we looked forward to seeing you in Metropolis next year."
https://twitter.com/suicidesquadRS/status/1646593761022038017
The Justice League lives, for now
Rocksteady's four-player co-op action game has been in development for some time, and already experienced some delays. Major shifts like this are not too uncommon, but the suddenness, combined with previous delays, makes Suicide Squad's case a bit stranger.
We had also just seen a significant chunk of this game at a recent Sony State of Play. The full co-op gameplay showcase didn't get everyone on-board with the direction though, and growing concern over a live service-focused structure took root.
So, now, Rocksteady's co-op Suicide Squad game is pushing the launch time back further. With an actual date set, that's at least something. But even the concept of February 2024 seems so distant right now, I've got to wonder what sentiment will be like when Warner Bros. and Rocksteady resurface later on.
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is now launching on February 2, 2024 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League has been delayed to next year following recent rumors that it wasn't going to make its May 26 release date. 
The superhero co-op shooter will now launch on February 2, 2024. Developer Rocksteady posted a short message on Twitter stating it wants to “take the time needed” to ensure the best possible experience. Check it out below.
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League puts players in the shoes of Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and King Shark as they fight to rescue Metropolis from an invasion by Brainiac. The villain has hijacked the minds of the Justice League, meaning the Squad has to take down Earth's greatest protectors to save the day. The game has received a hefty dose of fan vitriol since its last gameplay demonstration in February confirmed an always-online requirement as well as live service elements, such as a cosmetics-only battle pass. Other fans have found its cooperative loot-based shooting to be an uninspired fit for the property.
Although we don't know the specifics behind the delay, sources told Bloomberg in its original report last month that Rocksteady was only pushing the game to add polish and did not plan to overhaul the game’s existing framework. Even though a nearly-year-long delay is a lot of time, it's still very unlikely that it's enough for the team to make the sort of dramatic changes some fans are hoping for. We'll have to wait and see how Rocksteady spruces up the Suicide Squad and hope it results in a quality experience when the dust finally settles.

The song has since become the most well-known melody of the Mario franchise, not to mention one of the most recognizable music tracks in video games. Now, it will be forever preserved alongside some of pop culture's most famous and influential songs. 
“Having this music preserved alongside so many other classic songs is such a great honor,” said Kondo in a statement. “It's actually a little bit difficult to believe.”
Mario’s classic tune will be inducted alongside heavy hitters such as Madonna’s “Like a Virgin,” Jimmy Buffet’s “Margaritaville,” Queen Latifah’s “All Hail the Queen,” and Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas is You.” You can read the full list of inductees at the Libary of Congress’ website. 
This is quite an achievement for Nintendo and especially Kondo, who has lent his talents to numerous other Nintendo soundtracks and also had a hand in composing the music for the very successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie. You can read our recent interview with Kondo and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto about the making of the film here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sing with me, sing for the year
Musical role-playing adventure Stray Gods is charting a course for launch. The vocal venture will kick off on August 3 for PC.
The debut game from Summerfall Studios, Stray Gods is a story about Grace, who gets caught up in the life and drama of Greek gods after she's made the prime suspect in the death of Calliope. In the process, she comes into some new powers, and will have the opportunity to discover the truth. Maybe she can even find some romance on the side?
This quest for truth, answers, and heavenly connections plays out in interactive musical form. Characters break out into song, and the player gets to make choices about the tone of Grace's responses, potentially shifting the overall tenor and direction of the song.

The voice of the gods
It's a pretty fascinating system, with former Dragon Age writer David Gaider penning the script. And alongside an interesting premise and narrative framing, there's also a host of voice talent signed on. Here's a rundown of the voice actors working on Stray Gods:
Laura Bailey as Grace
Troy Baker as Apollo
Mary Elizabeth McGlynn as Persephone
Janina Gavankar as Freddie
Khary Payton as Pan
Abubakar Salim as Eros
Felicia Day as Athena
Rahul Kohli as Minotaur
Allegra Clark as Hecate
Merle Dandridge as Aphrodite
Erika Ishii as Hermes
Ashley Johnson as Calliope
Lauren "Lolo" Spencer as Venus
Anjali Bhimani as Medusa
Kimberly Brooks as Oracle
Anthony Rapp as Orpheus
Throw in Austin Wintory as composer, alongside musicians Scott Edgar, Steven Gates, Simon Hall of Tripod, and Jess Cerro (Montaigne), and it's a lot of talent.
Honestly, I am very curious to see how an interactive musical like this would shake out. These branching paths intrigue me, as does the Greek pantheon theming around a murder mystery. We'll see how Summerfall's debut Stray Gods comes together on August 3.

More than anything, I was impressed at just how good we have it in the multiplayer FPS genre at the moment. Apex Legends, Warzone 2, Overwatch 2, Valorant, Rainbow Six Siege. That's some unbelievably tough competition. XDefiant has to either give players something completely different, or absolutely nail the basics. It's opted for the second path, and having played several matches against a medley of press people and content creators, I'm not convinced Ubisoft's new arena shooter is up to the challenge.

Frictional Games has announced that a last-minute delay has affected its upcoming horror sequel Amnesia: The Bunker, which will no longer meet its May 16 release date — The first-person spooker will now launch on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms one week later on May 23.
"We’re pushing the release of Amnesia: The Bunker back by one week, and it will now be coming out on May 23 instead," noted the indie developer on Twitter. "This will give us a little more time to polish the game and make sure everything is perfect before launch. We appreciate your patience and hope you are looking forward to playing Amnesia: The Bunker. It will be worth the wait!"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6hfkkw6aKE&ab_channel=frictionalgames
The latest in the streamer-friendly horror series, Amnesia: The Bunker sees the player take up the role of a French soldier deep in the misery and isolation of World War I. Trapped in an abandoned bunker, the protagonist must pick their way through the darkness, solving puzzles and attempting to stay one step ahead of a mysterious and frightening force that lurks within the shadows and corridors of this living hellhole.
Amnesia: The Bunker hopes to bring new and unique mechanics to the franchise, including a sandbox approach to player choice, emergent gameplay, and constant alterations to the environment in order to provide variety and individuality to the player's experience. A grim story of survival, and the will to live in even the direst of circumstances, hopes to deliver the psychological horror that is the Amnesia trademark.
Amnesia: The Bunker launches May 23 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Made by Everest Pipkin, it's part idle game, part clicker, and wholly fascinating. Best of all, you can play for free in your browser.

Now, the 13600K has seen its first major discount, dipping to around the £300 mark at Amazon UK. Meanwhile, the same CPU without integrated graphics, the 13600KF, is down to £281. 
These are solid deals for a great-performing 14-core, 20-thread CPUs that excel in gaming and content creation - especially given that you can pick up a motherboard that allows you to carry over the DDR4 memory in your existing build to keep costs down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At PAX West in Seattle last year, I had the pleasure of interviewing the voice cast of Team Fortress 2. I chatted to John Patrick Lowrie (The Sniper), Gary Schwartz (The Heavy, The Demoman), Robin Atkin Downes (The Medic) and Ellen McLain (The Administrator) about the game's fifteen year long legacy, the process of finding their character's voices as well as their favourite quotes. It was a riot of an interview and, to be honest, a bit of a career highlight. It also did really well on TikTok, which I have mixed feelings about.

Fifteen minutes after the gang left the grimy conference room in which the interview took place (I had immediately crawled onto the floor in an attempt to ease the anxiety from having conducted said interview), I got a Twitter notification. Robin had posted a video. Following our chat, the group had attempted to order a sandwich from a cafe in-character, leaving the staff completely bemused as a result. Understandably the video did numbers, and over the last six months, the gang have been releasing new episodes in what is now known as "The Sandvich Saga" on a regular basis.

The GeForce RTX 4070 launches with a heavier price tag than the RTX 3070, and doesn’t make the shin-splintering performance leap forward that its predecessor did, but between its high speeds, low power usage, and DLSS 3 advantage, it’s a potent upgrade regardless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cococucumber - the folks behind the beautifully odd Echo Generation - are ready to release their next voxel adventure, the fairytale slasher Ravenlok coming to PC, Game Pass, and Xbox consoles on May 4th. It’s clearly riffing on Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland as our protagonist, the titular Ravenlok, moves to a new inherited house, gets sucked through a magical mirror and steps into a trippy, mushroom-filled land. From there, she needs to fight this realm's off-brand Queen Of Hearts and save the remaining, slightly weird, storybook denizens.

In a tweet, Arkane reveals that only Quality mode will be available when the game releases on May 2. A 60 FPS Performance option is coming at an unspecified date, but until it does, here’s how the game will run depending on your hardware:
Xbox Series X - 4K 30 FPS
Xbox Series S - 1440p 30 FPS
Sounds like PC is the way to go if you value performance over resolution, but hopefully, it doesn’t take too long for the option to appear on console. For more on Redfall, you can listen to our interview with Arkane Studios’ Harvey Smith in this episode of The Game Informer Show, then check out this article revealing the canceled PlayStation 5 version of the game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frogwares are in a bit of a tight spot at the moment, being as they are a Ukranian studio. If I was trying to make video games in a warzone and: a) my last game was a big sexy prequel to my long running Sherlock Holmes series; b) the one before that was a Lovecraftian detective game with pretty recent assets; and c) my back catalogue contained a Lovecraft-themed Sherlock Holmes mystery, then I'd probably do what they've done with Sherlock Holmes The Awakened. Which is to remake the old Lovecraft-themed Sherlock Holmes game, but with new assets.
It's also got new puzzles and areas, and a slightly rewritten story to account for this being a sequel to Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One. It's a smaller, less ambitious game than Chapter One with some jank knocking around, and I wouldn't recommend it if you're not a fan of the series, but you know what? I think there's a glimmer of greatness in the very fact of its constraints.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Illumination’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie has become a staggering box office success since its premiere last week. The animated adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has emerged from its first weekend as the best opening animated film of all time, achieving several other records along the way. 
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the film walked away with over $375 million in sales in its first five days, surpassing Frozen 2 as the top opening animated film premiere globally. That includes a $206 million domestic haul, $146 million of which was earned over the weekend (remember the film premiered on a Wednesday). Overseas, the movie has earned over $173 million.
Additionally, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is now the top opening film of 2023 (beating Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), has become Illumination’s most successful opening, and has the best opening of any video game film adaptation (surpassing Sonic the Hedgehog 2's debut). The film also has the biggest five-day premiere ever, a record previously held by Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. If all of that wasn’t enough, the film also has the biggest IMAX opening weekend of all time at $21.6 million globally.
Needless to say, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is exceeding expectations, and it’ll be interesting to see if it can maintain such a strong start. To get an idea of how it fares, you can read our review of the film here. Be sure to also check out our interviews with the movie’s cast and Nintendo’s own Shigeru Miyamoto and Koji Kondo.]]></summary>

Ripping into hordes in graphic details might cost you.

So, The Tank he lived, and also died. Questing endlessly in this grimy medieval world won’t cut it. You’ll also need to keep your troupe paid and fed, so when evening fell to find nought but a handful of foraged mushrooms and a single mouldy apple I’d pried from the fingertips of a disemboweled bandit, it was time to get creative.
“Waste not, want not”, said the Earl of Human Sandwich, the inventor of cannibalism (I’m told). With this in mind, I’d invested one of my early ‘Knowledge Points’ into a tech that let me repurpose my dearly departed as delicious drumsticks. Slain friendlies don’t disappear after battle. Instead, you’ll find their tastefully dressed corpses in the loot menu afterwards. Ghoulishly, the ‘loot all’ option doesn’t add their cadavers to your inventory with the rest. You’ll have to manually drag them over, giving you just enough time to consciously make the decision to either bury or eat them. I did not bury him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After 15 years, I finally managed to go back to Japan! And now I'm back, I thought it would be nice to recount the trip. It's a somewhat selfish thing, admittedly.

Square Enix recently provided hands-on demos to the press, giving us first-hand impressions of the game's combat, dungeon crawling, accessibility features, and other mechanics. We're curious to see what else they have to show that hasn't yet been revealed.

For the money, you get an 8th-gen Core i5 processor with integrated graphics, a compact 13-inch design, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. All in all, it's a pretty sweet spec for the asking price!

The Vampire Diaries follows Elena Gilbert, a high school student who discovers vampires are living in her hometown after one of them attacks her younger sister. The game is loosely based on the book series of the same name by author L. J. Smith, which later got adapted into a hit TV series.
Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill is the first installment of the long-running Nancy Drew game series, also based on a book series of the same name. In her first adventure, Nancy seeks to uncover the killer of a high school student who seems to have been disliked by all of his classmates.
You will need the data files from the games’ original install CDs, and a fresh daily build of ScummVM. Apart from the original release, Secrets Can Kill’s Russian translation is also supported. The ScummVM wiki pages for The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill contain information on which datafiles are needed. Please, report any problems you encounter in our issue tracker.

EA returns to the PGA with an inconsistent, frustrating simulation, struggling with its identity. While gorgeous, with pro golf’s best interactive presentation, the on-the-course action delivers inconsistent results.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For April's issue of Game Informer magazine, we took a look behind the scenes at Hyper Light Breaker, the latest game from developer Heart Machine. In addition to an interview with Creative Director Alx Preston, we were able to view exclusive footage of one of the game's mini-bosses, The Last Master. Check out the reveal below.


The Last Master is a deadly opponent that spawns randomly when players (known in this world as Breakers) activate beacons, objects that allow them to access the main boss gate. If you think she looks similar to the player characters, you've got the right idea; in the video, Preston says "She ended up here in this land as a Breaker and succumbed to the dangers of the Overgrowth." As a result, The Last Master's arsenal mirrors yours, wielding a sword, a spear, and an automatic pistol. Her behavior mirrors the Breakers' as well, and she can dash, jump, and climb after anyone that attempts to escape.
While the first game in the Hyper Light franchise was a 2D single-player experience, this new title is a 3-player co-op rogue-lite, with a new procedurally generated open world on every run. Players will create a Breaker, explore a cursed land called the Overgrowth, and attempt to the bosses plaguing this realm known as Crowns.

For more of the game, check out our feature in the latest issue of Game Informer. You also can see the initial reveal trailer here and the IGN's gameplay reveal right here. Hyper Light Breaker enters early access this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo IV arrives this summer, and it's making one last stop on the cover of Game Informer! We spoke with several of the game’s principal designers at Blizzard to learn more about the game’s endgame content, such as Helltides and Nightmare Dungeons, and provide a final overview of everything the game has to offer before it launches on June 6.
Setting the table for Diablo IV’s dark tone are two haunting pieces of cover art designed by the famed artist Brom. Our standard cover showcases the heavenly might of the rogue angel Inarius while the Game Informer Gold cover features Lilith, Diablo IV’s main antagonist, in all her demonic glory.
Issue 355 also includes a conversation about life and death with former Tango Gameworks artist and director Ikumi Nakamura in the abandoned streets of late-night Tokyo (which you can read online). You’ll also find an entertaining personal story about using VR as a carnival scam, a feature detailing Devil May Cry 5’s influence on Final Fantasy XVI’s combat, and an emotional piece discussing how a grieving father found solace in the Shenmue series’ depiction of loss. You'll also be treated to previews for upcoming titles, including Redfall, Exoprimal, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. 
You can also try to nab a Game Informer Gold version of the issue. Limited to a numbered print run per issue, this premium version of Game Informer isn't available for sale. To learn about places where you might be able to get a copy, check out our official Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, and stay tuned for more details in the coming weeks.

We’re standing at a slaughterhouse. But it’s a slaughterhouse in a deeply strange location, or, as Nakamura calls it, “Silicon Valley,” the technology district of Shinagawa in Tokyo, Japan. As I look at trucks packed full of cows at – whether they know it or not – the end of their lives, immense skyscrapers surround us, housing tech goliaths. Sony, Canon, and Microsoft all have offices here. The lifeblood of Japan’s tech industry, all looking down at death, turned to process.

After twenty years of development Dwarf Fortress finally made the jump to Steam in December 2021, complete with exciting new features such as "graphics" and "mouse support".

Following their panel on the highs and lows of procedural generation, the pair had a chat with Rachel about the game's recent Steam release, upcoming features, their favourite player stories and - most importantly - Zach's dog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo Live, a fan event celebrating all things Nintendo, is taking place in the U.S. for the first time this September. 
The event, which has previously been held in Japan, will take place in Seattle. It serves as a large convention that will allow Nintendo enthusiasts to play popular Switch titles, take photos with Mario and other characters, and enjoy live entertainment, including game tournaments. The event will also feature a number of Nintendo-themed activities scattered across the venue. 
“Fans of all ages can currently experience the unique games, characters and worlds of Nintendo on Nintendo Switch, but we want to expand that scope with a new experience,” said Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser in a press release. “With Nintendo Live 2023, we’re giving attendees a chance to celebrate together with family, friends and the broader Nintendo community in the spirit of fun and creating long-lasting memories.”
There’s no information on the exact date or location for the event nor when ticket sales begin, but you can keep an eye on the event’s official website to learn more once those details become available. Nintendo is enjoying a wave of positive momentum this year following the opening of its second Super Nintendo World theme park at Universal Studios Hollywood as well as the successful premiere of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.

Following the passing of legendary composer Ryuichi Sakamoto last week, Mat Ombler has documented his effect on the world of video games. Featuring quotes from Jesper Kyd, Takeshi Furukawa and Yuji Naka, it's clear that Sakamoto's influence on the way games sound cannot be understated.

That makes this Micro SD a premiere option for Steam Deck owners, who will benefit from faster copying times when transferring game directories from the internal storage to Micro SD or downloading from the internet, and game load times should also be as speedy as anything with this A2-rated drive.

Normally we've covered 32GB and 64GB kits in the past, but today it's time to look at the mainstream, entry-level option: a 16GB dual-channel kit, comprising of two matching 8GB sticks. Normally we'd expect to pay around £50 for these, but now it's possible to pick up one for just £35 thanks to the Ebay code APRIL10.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You might not know what Muv-Luv is. I hadn’t even heard of it till a few years ago. Which is strange, since Muv-Luv is considered by many to be one of the most greatest visual novels of all time. What begins as a light-hearted slice-of-life high school romantic comedy eventually pulls the rug out from under the player, and transforms into a war epic featuring mechs and aliens with a much darker tone. In Muv-Luv’s original Japanese release, this twist was hidden and only briefly hinted at in the marketing.
Today both Muv-Luv games are easily available on Steam, marketed specifically with this twist, and where they sit fully-translated and with Overwhelmingly Positive reviews. iOS and Android ports are apparently in development, and other Muv-Luv spin-offs continue to get translated. But the first time anyone experienced a complete English language version of Muv-Luv was in July 2010, when a fan translation group called Amaterasu released a patch localising the first game.

I could call it a 2D beat 'em up with your classic heavy/light attacks (actually punch/kick, but whatever), which is important to mention. It's also tempting to namedrop the things it reminded me of, like Hotline Miami, Beraltors, and a tiny hint of The Cat Lady, but that could get you picturing just about anything, and is unfairly reductive to a game that has the right to stand on its own.
Pill Baby is, obviously, all those things. It's far better and more coherent than any of those descriptions would make it sound.

Focusing on the epic space battles alone, Battlestar Galactica Deadlock was generally well-reviewed at its launch in 2017, and it’s become increasingly popular in the years since, thanks to hefty post-launch support and a lack of other BSG-related things going on. Luckily, Battlestar Galactica Deadlock is now free to keep on Steam until 6pm BST/ 10am PT/ 1pm ET on April 9th.

starts by suggesting that you play the original game's tutorial. This is included as part of the experience, which, as we'll get to, says a lot about how this sequel has been designed. 


In any case, I disregarded this advice. "I don't need an instruction manual for post-apocalyptic survival," I thought. I've rummaged through this particular abandoned house countless times, after all: In DayZ, in Dead Island, in State Of Decay, in Days Gone. I even reviewed the first Saints And Sinners back in February 2020. I know my way around a zombie's cranium better than anyone.

Anyone who has a copy of Backyard Football, Backyard Baseball 2001, and even Backyard Football 2002 (which was originally a LAN-only title) can download the latest daily build* of ScummVM and play online games against real people!
This all became possible because the three developers from the Backyard Sports Online fork had joined the team and brought their services with them to the ScummVM. These are LittleToonCat, Jim “jibbodahibbo” Westerkamp and Sam “QuestionMonkey” Kupfer.
Please note that Backyard Football and Backyard Baseball 2001 require online accounts for the complete online experience, so you need to register to Backyard Sports Online, which is our fantastic online-play service and a thriving community of fellow Backyard Sports players, they even have a couple of competitive online Baseball and Football leagues, if that's your style, you can find more information in their Discord server! People who already have a Backyard Sports Online account can log in using the latest daily build and play, but if you do not, you can register right here! This is not required to play Backyard Football 2002 online.
If you encounter any issues playing online, please let us know via the issue tracker.
This fantastic art is done by a fellow BSO community member Peppyrus.
* only the Windows, macOS, Debian, Raspberry Pi, and Android builds are compatible with network play at the moment. And only the 2.8.x branch of ScummVM has this functionality.

If what you're after is a more freeform, organic open world in which to survive, then the first Dying Light is arguably the better choice. Good news: its currently free-to-keep from the Epic Games Store alongside its excellent expansion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look, I’m not saying Far Cry 3 is responsible for *gestures vaguely towards modern AAA games* but it’s definitely a prime suspect. If I was trying to connect a piece of red string from the middle of my evidence board (which would probably be a picture of the map screen from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla), I’m not sure I’d push a pin directly into Jason Brody’s face, but I’d definitely circle it in black Sharpie a few times. Basically, in the eleven years since its release, I’ve grown a bit suspicious of Far Cry 3’s lasting legacy. 


And yet, in those halcyon days of 2012, we named it our game of the year. Although it’d be easy to simply say that decision was made a bit before my time here, I should probably admit that when reviewing the game for the blog I used to run when I was at university, I awarded it an equally prestigious (stop laughing at the back) 10/10. That almost seems ludicrous, doesn’t it? Far Cry 3? Game of the year? Surely not.


After spending a few hours revisiting the sunny shores of Rook Island, I was shocked to discover a game that feels surprisingly pure. Mechanically, I hasten to add. The actual act of playing Far Cry 3 in 2023 is still good fun, it’s the bits around it that are a bit ropey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For April Fool's Day, Sega released a game where the company finally went and did the unthinkable: they killed Sonic. The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog is a real visual novel in which you investigate the death of Sega's beloved mascot, currently free on Steam. Here's the game's description via the publisher: 
It's Amy Rose's birthday, and she's hosting a murder mystery party on the Mirage Express! When Sonic the Hedgehog becomes the game's victim, everyone is off to get to the bottom of things. However, something feels a bit off - is this really an innocent game or is something more sinister afoot?
Surprisingly, the free game has proved very popular. As told by Sonic social media manager Katie Chrzanowski (via GameSpot), more one million people have played the game. Going a step further, it's apparently the 61st highest-reviewed game on Steam right now, and as GameSpot points out, the best-rated Sonic game on Steam (though that's not the highest margin to clear, all things considered). As of this writing, The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog has over 11,000 user reviews on Steam, netting it an "Overwhelmingly Positive" ranking. You can check the game out for yourself right here. 
Over 1,000,000 of you have grabbed The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog and it's currently the #61 highest rated game on Steam of ALL TIME.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Players likely recognise Celeste as the pixel-perfect platformer from 2018, but it began its life as Celeste Classic, a free game written for the PICO-8. Celeste Classic presented a condensed climb up the titular mountain, letting you dash across platforms, hang onto walls, and collect strawberries - in miniature form. As a fun homage, you can find the PICO-8 version inside Celeste proper. And now, as an even funner homage, you can play it on the Playdate. A loveable game on a loveable handheld.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a moment in BioShock Infinite's opening act that's always stuck with me. As you emerge onto the floating city of Columbia, the game takes you on a guided tour of the sights and sounds of this airbone civilization. As you saunter through the streets, you learn about its citizens and its creator, just sort of taking it all in. The sun is shining. You're surrounded by smiles. Before you know it, an airship rises above the clouds and perches next to a hugging couple, gently swaying in the summer breeze. Aboard the ship is a barbershop quartet, cheerfully harmonising the iconic Beach Boys tune God Only Knows. It's a memorable scene, and has become an integral part of the game's lasting iconography. 


But for Tyler, Nick, Derek and Greg, this section was more than just a fun tease for the secret behind Columbia's unusual success. Self-confessed music school kids, the quartet inspired them to create their own musical group styled after Infinite's singing hairdressers. In 2023, BioShop Infinite celebrated their ninth year at PAX East, where they performed a wonderful collection of harmonised tunes to an absolutely packed community room - and we were there to film it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's weird that Road 96 has gotten a prequel, because it only came out about six months ag- what's that? A year and a half? Good lord. Still, it seems a slightly odd move, because Road 96 - a first person hitchhiking choose 'em up about the collective action of wayward teens bringing down a totalitarian government - doesn't really need a prequel. On top of that, Road 96: Mile 0 is a sequel to developer DigixArt's first game Lost In Harmony, a musical runner about skateboarder Kaito whose fiend Aya is dying of a terminal illness.
In Mile 0, Kaito and his family have moved to a small gated town called White Sands, in the 90s USA-adjacent dictatorship Petria, and made best friends with Zoe, who 96ers will remember as a recurring NPC from that game. Zoe is the daughter of an important minister and lives in the nice part of town; Kaito's parents are workers who are forced to live on the wrong side of the tracks. Through a combination of Road 96-style character-driven vignettes and Lost In Harmony-style rhythm action tracks, the two come to the conclusion they must leave White Sands. If you played Road 96 you kind of already know how Mile 0 has to end.

Not in the scientific, evolutionary sense of all of human history, I should add, but rather how we, the RPS Treehouse, ended up writing about video games for a living.
The question comes courtesy of Bloodyhell, who asked: When did you know that you not only wanted to play games, but to write about what you played? And, does writing about games ever dampen your enthusiasm when you are dealing with deadlines and putting words on a page?
A sneaky double-part question, there, but both good questions nonetheless. So come and find out our collective origin stories, and whether any of us have cried tears of pain and regret over the years after turning our favourite hobby into an actual job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's always been something quite comforting about loading into a brand new Minecraft world. Dropping into that first forest, punching that first tree... It's a promise of all the myriad adventures to come. And despite some fundamental changes in genre and perspective, it's something that the team behind the upcoming Minecraft Legends has tried hard to preserve.
I recently was treated to the most in-depth look so far at Minecraft Legends, in an hour-long livestream which gave us all some much needed answers on what manner of beast Legends actually is. It's a curious blend of action adventure and RTS, one that shares Minecraft's focus on exploration, but guides the player down a stricter, simpler path of summoning friendly mobs and constructing defences to repel a Piglin invasion. This will likely be a solid introduction to the RTS genre for a lot of players, but I came away unsure about whether the game will have enough depth to keep its prospective playerbase's attention.

Remedy’s time-bending Quantum Break - part superpowered shooter, part live-action TV show - has been delisted on Steam and The Microsoft Store. The game’s Steam page is still up, but it’s no longer available for purchase on PC or Xbox consoles. Publisher Microsoft had already confirmed the game would be “temporarily” removed from Game Pass (for console, it was never on the PC version) due to licensing issues, although there was no word on a removal from storefronts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Stars is an RPG unabashedly inspired by the 16-bit era of Japanese RPGs. Even just looking at screenshots of the game recalls the best of the era, and that’s not an accident. Developer Sabotage Studio’s CEO and Sea of Stars’ creative director, Thierry Boulanger, is a huge fan of the genre and has been building towards making a game like this since he started building the fantasy world Sea of Stars and The Messenger takes place in during Elementary school.
Dozens of classic RPGs inspired Sea of Stars’ development, including Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, but we asked Boulanger to pick the most significant ones in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for an excuse to break out that Leviathan Axe for another adventure? As of today, there's a new update for God of War Ragnarök featuring a load of new content, all built around a robust New Game Plus mode.
New Game Plus opens up for anyone who has beaten the game, and all of your equipment and skills will come along for the ride. You also have access to all weapons, including the Draupnir Spear. However, it should be noted that areas requiring that spear to access will still remain closed until you reach the appropriate point in the story. For similar reasons, you also won’t start your new playthrough with Sonic or Hex arrows.
Several new armors show up. The most interesting is the Spartan Armor, which recalls Kratos’ look from the old days in the Greek Pantheon. While wearing it, you get no perk, no stats, and it’s locked at Power Level 1 – expect a challenge.
New Game Plus also features a new level cap, enchantments, and progression paths to improve your capabilities. Players can also tackle an expanded version of the Niflheim Arena, where you play as either Kratos or Atreus and bring along a variety of companions to help out.
Among several other additions and improvements, players can also take on a Black and White Render mode for a more cinematic playthrough.
It’s a notably large blast of new content that ensures that dedicated fans should have good reason to jump back in if they desire.
God of War Ragnarök released last November for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.

The project comes from production company and distributor Universal Pictures and animation studio Illumination.

Nintendo was involved not as a licensor but as a partner with Illumination and Universal. 
Every step of the way, Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, who is credited as a producer on this film alongside Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri, had creative input regarding the story, characters, and references to the games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1993, the Super Mario Bros. made their big-screen debut through a live-action adventure starring Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper. While that film has garnered a cult following in the decades since its theatrical release, it does little to truly pay homage to Nintendo's flagship franchise in the ways all the best film adaptations aspire. Fast forward 30 years, and Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo have finally delivered a cinematic adventure starring the iconic fraternal duo that is joyful, fun, exciting, and, perhaps most importantly, respectful of the source material.
Warning: While I try to remain as spoiler-free as possible, certain elements of the narrative and characters are mentioned throughout this article.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Stadium, the classic 3D battler/minigame collection for the Nintendo 64, just got a Nintendo Switch Online release date. While the game's imminent arrival to the online service was announced at a Nintendo Direct in September 2022, today is the day we finally know when we can play it. Pokémon Stadium comes to Nintendo Switch Online Wednesday, April 12. As is the case with all N64 games, you'll need the expansion pack in order to play it. Check out the full trailer below.


While some fans may have hoped this port would include trading with Pokémon Home, they're unfortunately out of luck. The fine print in the trailer specifies that "Pokémon cannot be transferred to this game." That said, there is also a notable improvement: four-player online multiplayer will be available, so you can play Clefairy Says or Sushi-Go-Round with friends all over.
Nintendo Switch Online's expansion pack had a slow start, but its library has gradually snowballed into a much more significant package. In February, the service added a Game Boy Advance library, which included fan favorites like The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap and Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. A month later, Metroid Fusion joined the lineup. Meanwhile, the base tier of NSO got an update last month that added another small handful of titles. To see all the retro games currently available on the service, check out our complete list.

When Respawn Entertainment announced it was making a third-person action game in the Star Wars universe, many fans didn’t know how to react; the studio was critically acclaimed, but at the time, Respawn was purely known for shooters like Titanfall and Apex Legends. However, 2019’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order surpassed the expectations of many, delivering a terrific adventure full of exciting action and memorable moments. Now, with all the learnings of Fallen Order, Respawn is ready to top itself in hopes of creating another unforgettable Star Wars adventure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ScummVM project, a free and open-source software project that allows users to play classic point-and-click adventure games on modern systems, has announced a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence gaming.
Thanks to the innovative work of ScummVM developers, AI tools such as ChatGPT are now able to play point-and-click adventure games directly, without any human intervention.

"With this new capability, we hope to explore the potential for AI to learn, adapt, and evolve within the context of classic adventure games," said Eugene Sandulenko, lead developer of the ScummVM project. "Now AI can experience the joys of helping Putt-Putt join the parade or Adibou count things. We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans."
"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule."
Update: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:
Getting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.
Taking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream
Refusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!

After the success of Resident Evil, Capcom followed it up with this dino-themed spiritual successor. The title follows a similar blueprint to Resident Evil but ditches zombies in favor of "panic horror" dished out by blood-thirsty dinosaurs. The game stars Regina, a special ops soldier sent with a team to investigate an island research facility that has been taken over by these prehistoric lizards. Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction.

IGN reported on Tuesday that major publishers had either declined to attend or had little to no idea if the event would even take place due to an alleged lack of communication with organizer ReedPop and the ESA. Today, IGN received an email sent within the ESA explaining that the show "simply did not garner the sustained interest necessary to execute it in a way that would showcase the size, strength, and impact of our industry."
The official E3 Twitter account has now publicly confirmed the cancellation in a brief statement posted below. 
However, IGN received a press release stating that ReedPop and the ESA will continue to work together on “future E3 events”. Whether th…]]></summary>
