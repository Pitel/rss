The bad news is that you didn't just wake up from the coma that you had entered after you beat Skyrim. The good news is that Starfield players are bringing that Nostalgia back and making better physics videos than ever before.


Video game physics has gone a long way since the release of Skyrim back in 2011, and a whole new generation of players is trying their hand at messing with Starfield’s top-of-the-line physics. The results are sometimes hilarious, like the time when someone said that Starfield's physics were sh*tty. Crappy mistake, my dude.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Total Mayhem Games has announced that We Were Here Expeditions: The FriendShip, the next game in their series of co-op puzzle titles, is dropping now. Right now. It’s on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox platforms, and it’s also free until October 13.


The Friendship is the first in Total Mayhem Games’ bite-sized subseries, We Were Here Expeditions. These are meant to be shorter, more casual co-op experiences. According to the press release, “The FriendShip offers a more casual experience where the focus lies not on escaping but on having fun together and testing the strength of your friendship.”

The plot involves two explorers finding an abandoned amusement park on a deserted island. Amusement parks are at their best when they’re abandoned because there are no lines or people. 


I haven’t played any of the We Were Here games. Mainly because I’m a socially awkward misanthrope, and I don’t have a consistent co-op partner. Plus, playing a co-op game takes scheduling, and humans are my least favorite people. I’d be much more down with a concept like “I Was Here.” Which, as it turns out, there is a game called I Was Here, and it doesn’t look so hot. So maybe I’d just be better off trying to tolerate the presence of another person for We Were Here Expeditions: The FriendShip.


We Were Here Expeditions: The Friendship is available right now for Xbox One, PS4, and PC. It’s free until October 13, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We hope you like walls of endless text.
Gaming often takes itself entirely too seriously. There aren’t enough games that embrace ridiculous, silly ideas and run with them without coming across as shallow and one-note. Mugen Souls Z half succeeds at this; its opening scene includes a spaceship transforming into a giant robot for an epic space battle and it only gets weirder from there. It just gets in its own way far too often for anyone to enjoy the silliness.
A sequel to 2012’s Mugen Souls, Mugen Souls Z first made its way to consoles a year later. Now fans can dive into this endearingly strange world as Chou-Chou, the so-called undisputed goddess who captured seven worlds in the first game, sets her adorable sights on a new set of worlds to conquer. This time, though, she’s been stripped of her powers so a new goddess named Syrma has to throw other deities into a mysterious coffin to drain away their powers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the Lenovo Legion Go revealed itself, I was unconvinced by its portability credentials but enticed by the wireless mouse transmogrification of its detachable, Nintendo Switch-like controllers. A sparkling sliver of Swiss Army handheld design, providing a familiar taste of desktop play that the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally could never achieve without a USB dock.
Turns out, now that I’ve tried the Legion Go for myself, I was worried about the wrong thing. It’s nowhere near as heavy or cumbersome as it looks, and while the breakaway controls remain an exciting prospect, they also risk introducing an acute pain point. At the very least, the model I tested proved highly vulnerable to lead-handed RPS hardware editors, because I left the building very much with the impression that I’d broken it.

There are tasty treats simmering in the kitchen, like the remake of The 7th Guest and sequels to I Expect You To Die and Arizona Sunshine, but right now all the fine dining is happening on Quest and PSVR2, covering which would involve running my thumb under RPS' hermetic PC seal.


In my desperation, I've turned to golf, something I would never consider under normal circumstances. I feel about golf the same way I feel about the UK Conservative party, insofar as both occupy space that would be better filled with trees. But I haven't gone totally tartan slacks. We're only entering the realm of minigolf, which I am more positively inclined toward. It lacks the pretensions and exclusionary nature of its bigger, paunchier cousin. Anybody can rock up to a minigolf course with a putter and nobody will sneer at you for being shit at it. It's also small and inherently naff, traits I can likewise relate to.

The company will only make developers pay extra for the first installation of a game on a new device - so no fees for reinstallations, in theory, and no prospect of spiteful players "install bombing" games to drive up costs for their creators. However, the company haven't stated how or indeed, if they can distinguish legitimate from illegitimate installations in advance, seemingly because their method for tracking installations is based on "estimates" using a proprietary data-gathering system, which they aren't able to discuss in depth.

If you're anything like us, then Poncle's brilliantly addictive Vampire Survivors has probably taken up a fair amount of your time since it was released last month. Many of the tension-rising tunes from the game's soundtrack are probably firmly stuck in your head by this point (we know that they are for us), so we were pleased to see some of the biggest numbers get the live orchestra treatment at the Save And Sound video game music event.
Initially written by Daniele Zandara, with contributions from Filippo Vicarelli and William Davis, the 56-piece orchestra took on several pieces of the monster-mashing music and the results are fantastic. What's more, they're all available to watch on the Poncle YouTube channel.

Minecraft! After a month reporting on the barren planets of Starfield and plundering the rather more involving dungeons of Baldur's Gate 3, it's almost steadying to remember that these supposed titans are but momentary flickers, transient particles in the sunken Creeper eyesocket of Mojang's behemoth. And what a time to rediscover the game. Vanilla Minecraft has always felt like an autumnal creation to me, even before they added all the pumpkin heads - a game of long nights and campfires, with an ambience derived from Tove Jansson's Moomin books. Anyway, here's the teaser trailer for Minecraft Live.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stig Asmussen, the director of such critically and commercially lauded titles as EA’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is departing from the company, per Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier.


Asmussen, whose past works include directing God of War III for Santa Monica Studio, will be leaving EA “to pursue other adventures,” the company said in a statement to Bloomberg. As of this writing, it is unclear what these "other adventures" entail.


“After careful thought and consideration, Stig Asmussen has decided to leave Respawn to pursue other adventures, and we wish him the best of luck,” an EA spokesperson told Bloomberg. “Veteran Respawn leaders will be stepping up to guide the team as they continue their work on Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.”




Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Survivor were the first two installments in what Asmussen told IGN he hoped would be a trilogy, so today’s news makes this writer wonder if a third game is possible without Asmussen at the helm. 


Destructoid’s Chris Carter said about Jedi: Fallen Order that “you’re going to occasionally roll your eyes at a cheesy moment or groan at a technical issue, but Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order stands alone as an action game devoid of its Star Wars influence.” 


As for Jedi: Survivor, Carter said “after finishing up Jedi Survivor and immediately cleaning up what I had missed for fun, I found myself wishing for a world where Respawn Entertainment focused all of its energy on single player games from here on out.”

It seems Square Enix will contribute more to that, as it just launched a sale showcasing its massive backlog, including Final Fantasy and Legend of Mana.


The TGS Sale is running from September 12 to September 25 and features deals across a variety of platforms, including PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Some deals are exclusive to one or more of the aforementioned platforms, so we’ll highlight those below. 


There are several really cool discounts offered this time around, the biggest, in my opinion, being the Kingdom Hearts All-in-One Package, on sale for $49.99 instead of the usual $99.99. That's a whopping 50% discount…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new RPG is officially on the way with the announcement of Breakers: Unlock the World. This one comes from Vic Game Studios, who plans to show it off at Tokyo Game Show 2023 later this month. For now we'll have to make do with an announcement trailer. At 15 seconds long, it's a teaser in every sense of the word.


You may not get an idea of how this particular RPG plays, but you can see character models strolling by in the video below.




Library Quest


Here's what we know about the story behind Breakers: Unlock the World so far. The original RPG takes players to the ends of the earth on a journey to the Library of God. It's there that all the knowledge of the world awaits. The announcement says the cel-shaded rendering will make you feel like you're "playing an anime." Developer Vic Game Studios has some experience with that aspect. The team previously worked on Black Clover M: Rise of the Wizard King, a mobile game based on Yuki Tabata's Black Clover manga and anime.


There's no release date in place yet, but Breakers: Unlock the World is in the works for iOS, Android, and PC. Tokyo Game Show attendees will get to go hands-on at the Vic Game Studios booth this year. A playable build will be live beneath a massive LED display, so it'll be hard to miss. Tokyo Game Show 2023 goes down from September 21 to 24, and Vic promises more info on Breakers at a later date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1 crossplay will not be coming to the game during its launch. WB Games has confirmed Wednesday over Twitter that it will arrive later via a patch. 




"Launch is just around the corner and we can’t wait for everyone to sink their teeth into Mortal Kombat 1," says the official Mortal Kombat Twitter account. "Regarding Kross-Play, it will not be available at launch, but know we are hard at work at implementing the feature into the game and it will be koming post launch."


So, to put it all in one sentence: you won't be able to play Mortal Kombat 1 with fighters on platforms other than your own on day one.


Neither WB Games nor the developer NetherRealm has provided a release date or window for Mortal Kombat 1 crossplay.


Other replies ask if the game will support cross-save between PC and consoles. There has been no response from WB Games or the developer.


WB Games has confirmed that rollback netcode is used in Mortal Kombat 1. It's a popular connection tool that lets players have more stable matches.


Mortal Kombat 1 is releasing on September 19 for PS5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, PC, and Nintendo Switch. You'll be able to preload the game a few days early. You can also get Shang Tsung as a playable preorder character bonus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, slather me in oil and send me down a hill. A Chō Aniki has finally received a fan translation. This one is for the Super Famicom’s Chō Aniki: Bakuretsu Rantou Hen, which the team of muscle fanatics has translated to Chō Aniki: Buff Battle Ballad.


If you’re not already savvy, the Chō Aniki series is a collection of wonderful kusoge (crap games). Each game is a ridiculous celebration of absurd body-building physique and normally comes packed with bizarre homoeroticism. The first game was released on the PC-Engine Super CD-ROM² System in 1992. A typical Chō Aniki is a horizontal scrolling shoot-’em-up, but the series has long dabbled with other genres. Chō Aniki: Bakuretsu Rantou Hen is a 1995 Super Famicom fighting game.

The series hasn’t been strictly exclusive to Japan. Cho Aniki Zero was released over here on PSP. Meanwhile, the PlayStation version of Chō Aniki: Kyuukyoku Muteki Ginga Saikyou Otoko was ported to PS3 and PSP via the PSOne Classic lineup, but they were provided as-is. That is to say, they were not translated. However, they weren’t especially difficult to figure out for Anglophones.


For that matter, Chō Aniki: Bakuretsu Rantou Hen wasn’t impossible to play for those who don’t know Japanese. However, it is nice to see it finally get a full translation, even if it’s not official. Considering how notorious the whole series is, it’s very surprising to me that this is the first time the series has seen a fan translation. Yet, that statement was made on the mod’s page, so I fact-checked it and found it to be true. Weird.


The Chō Aniki: Buff Battle Ballad comes to us from modders Pennywise, Ryusui, and FlashPV. The patch can be found right over here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tomorrow is looking like a big day for trailers and announcements. Sony has just announced a new State of Play showcase, airing on September 14, 2023.


The Sony State of Play will air at 5 p.m. ET / 2 p.m. PT. The announcement doesn't confirm how long the show will last.




As for what to expect, Sony's saying there will be a focus on updates to previously announced games coming to PlayStation consoles. It's set to have indie, PlayStation VR2, and major upcoming third-party games in the show too.


The state of PlayStation


Speculation can run rampant around this, so at the very least, it's nice to just have a concentrated 24-hour window of it.


By the sounds of it, we're going to be hearing about a set stable of known quantities. Looking back at recent State of Play showcases, it seems like we could catch anything from a Destiny 2 update or some Street Fighter 6 additions to, as Sony noted, some virtual reality.


Hopes might be set higher for some news on big third-party games like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth or Death Stranding 2. Time will tell, I suppose. I'm personally curious to know if we'll hear anything on Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which was pushed out of this year and into next.


Either way, it'll be a packed news day tomorrow with a Nintendo Direct also airing in the morning. It's like a little mini-E3 in September. And with Tokyo Game Show just around the corner, there's likely even more news set to hit before the Fall season of games gets underway. Grab some popcorn and gear up for a stream-tastic showcase Thursday tomorrow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember when Demon’s Souls was released back in 2009, there were many people who called it a market-unfriendly game. There were pushes to get people to buy it just to experience this supposedly brutal and novel take on action RPGs. Flash forward 14 years, and it’s one of the biggest sub-genres in the industry.


On one hand, I love Demon’s Souls and most of the games that FromSoftware followed it up with. On the other hand, my favorite games to play are the ones I haven’t played before, and a lot of the Soulslikes that followed stick a little too close to the formula for my case. It’s something that nags at me. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but at what point does it cross into plagiarism?

Reddit user u/WeirdConcern4666 managed to break into Starfield's final frontier, which isn't actually space. Rather, it's the door that prevented players from floating around in the abyss, wearing only their protective suits.

        <updated>2023-09-13T19:07:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new indie action RPG has been gaining traction on Kickstarter. Anima - Song From the Abyss is the latest game from Spanish-based studio Anima Project.


The group has been around for a while, forming in 2005 and having several published games, but Anima - Song From the Abyss is the studio's first Kickstarter and most ambitious project. Stylish action games like NieR Automata and open-world titles like The Witcher are influencing the title's direction. 


Previous Anima titles were self-published and are solid games in their own right. Things like the budget were noticeable, but an interesting world and lengthy journey showed the team's passion. It's worth seeing how Song from the Abyss stacks up to NieR Automata given the first game's influence on the previous entries. 




One notable difference is that Song From the Abyss is more colorful than its predecessors. The Kickstarter states Zelda as an influence, and it's noticeable with how saturated the environments are.


Beyond that, Song of the Abyss' main appeal is opening the series up with a bigger budget game. The series always had an open-ended structure, but this expands the concept further. It's not open-world but ensures environments have a lot to explore.


A notable feature returning from Gate of Memories is character switching on the fly. If executed well, stylish action game fans will be satisfied with stylish combos while alternating between protagonists Soren and Noein.


Seeing new and interesting projects from small teams is always exciting. Anima Project is a three-person studio, and its previous efforts cut above what a team of that size can do with an action RPG. The good news is, the Kickstarter campaign has already cleared its initial funding goal. Hopefully, a bigger budget will help the team achieve its ambition and it will come out on time for its projected November 2024 release.

But, one thing to keep in mind when purchasing this expansion pack is that it’s not cross-compatible. This means if you own Pokemon Scarlet and purchase the DLC pack designed for Pokemon Violet, you’ll be out around $34.99 plus applicable taxes.


It might seem like a silly mistake to make when the eShop color-codes both versions of the DLC. But it’s one that any of us could make if we’re not paying close attention. You may ask why and how the DLC for Pokemon Violet is different from the DLC for Pokemon Scarlet, especially if they’re both called The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero. The answer is … exclusive ‘mons.

It's a little strange, but I get it. Even by Pokémon standards, the finale of Scarlet and Violet was pretty surprising, both in its narrative surprises and general structure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ravenage Games has announced that 9FingerGames' deckbuilding tower defense game Heretic’s Fork has hit PC today.


Set in a bureaucratic depiction of Hell (the worst kind of Hell), Heretic’s Fork has you take on the role of corporate manager. You hire subordinates, punish sinners, and protect the rift between Hell and Earth. It’s a mix of deckbuilding and tower defense, where you need to create strategies based on your hand of cards.




Heretic’s Fork employs that very particular art style that pairs drab colors and contrasts them with bright red. It touts both a rocking soundtrack by folks like Occams Laser. The developer also promises dark humor, and I’m already on board with the well-proven corporate Hell motif. 


There’s a demo available, but the press release points out that the full version has a fully interactive desktop with secrets to unveil. I think they mean computer desktop. I’ve been really digging a lot of deckbuilder games recently, but if there’s one thing I enjoy more, it’s fictional operating systems. So, weirdly, that’s the part I’m most interested in. I probably would have grabbed Heretic’s Fork for review, but this week, in particular, is packed for me. I’m not sure why everyone decided to release everything in mid-September, but here we are.


Heretic’s Fork is available now on PC. It will run you $9.99 USD and is launching with a 15% discount.

Currently, players have had to use a popular DLSS3 mod that was released the same day Starfield launched. Additionally, the post outlined plans to work closely with Nvidia, AMD, and Intel on driver support. An Nvidia driver released yesterday improved performance on new RTX GPUs.


The news post also highlighted the improvements in update 1.7.29 that hit Starfield today. The roughly 2.5GB update improved performance and stability and reduced crashes while increasing framerates. A few progression-blocking quest bugs were also fixed as well as part of the update.

Update : After being announced for Japan earlier this week, Sega has today confirmed that the Demon Slayer's upcoming party title, Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- Sweep the Board!, will also receive a Western release in 2024.
The game will see you taking on the role of some familiar faces including Tanjiro Kamado, Zenitsu Agatsuma, and Inosuke Hashibira and moving around a board containing several nods to the popular anime and manga series. Much like Mario Party, there will be minigames a-plenty and the game offers up to four-player multiplayer either local or online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Way back in 2019, I did my first game review for Destructoid. It was for Doinksoft’s Gato Roboto. I wasn’t a huge fan. I thought that it played well but was derivative and insubstantial, largely paling in comparison to the games it took inspiration from. To be fair, however, that was one of Doinksoft’s first attempts as a studio, and imitating those that inspired you is a totally fair way to start out.
With that out of the way, however, we have Gunbrella. Now, this is something I can get behind. Or get under. While there is still some obvious inspiration showing through in many places, Gunbrella makes it obvious that it’s a game that started with a simple concept and grew from there. It's the best, most organic way to make a game.

Editor's Note: As described in the text below, a glitch in an endgame battle prevented us from completing the Switch review build of Gunbrella 100%.
We're told that a launch patch is imminent following certification from Nintendo. While irritating, the bug didn't affect our enjoyment up to that late-game point, so we're publishing this review on the basis that most players will likely never encounter this issue in the retail version. We'll update the review text should the update not fix this glitch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s something that feels oddly momentous about sending one of Dune: Spice Wars’ harvesters to get to work worm-dodging while hoovering up MSG (magical space glitter). It was, after all, Dune II’s implementation of these trucks that are largely responsible for the shape of the entire RTS genre. I’ve mused before that if you count Alien as something that wouldn’t exist without Dune, along with the effects the RTS had on esports, it's wild to consider how different gaming could have been if Frank Herbert hadn’t visited Florence in 1957 to chronicle a natural phenomenon. It’s one heck of a butterfly effect, which is fitting, because Spice Wars itself can often feel like a creative exploration of how integral butterfly effects are to grand strategy rulesets. Forget those harvesters for a moment, because this dry but undeniably captivating 4X is all about the steamroll.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can’t fault the pitch. In Gunbrella you’re a sort of cowboy dude with a shotgun that’s also an umbrella. You use the umbrella to deflect enemy projectiles, block attacks, fly up into the air like a furious Mary Poppins and zoom along ziplines. You use the shotgun, as you might reasonably expect, to do the majority of your big murdering.


Gunbrella is a classic 2D platform shooter in the style of a steampunk western. It’s like Deadwood crossed with Singin’ In The Rain, if Gene Kelly ever used his umbrella to blow holes through anyone who didn’t sufficiently praise his tap dancing. Some light exploration bits have you travelling by train from frontier towns to mining villages, much of them decorated with giant spinning cogs – so you know it’s steampunk – and populated by a small cast of quest-giving locals, pill-dispensing shopkeepers and monologuing villains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favourite TV shows is The Rookie, because you never have any idea what could happen next. No episode can go more than five minutes without some kind of twist, often with no relation to anything that has happened up until that point. Like, you think the stand-off between criminals and their victims in a courthouse nuclear bunker has been resolved, but it turns out that while the camera was off him, a lawyer got stabbed by someone else. Hauma is bringing that kind of energy to the visual novel space. 
You play as Judith, a former detective and champion boxer who's wrapped up in solving the case her grandfather was working on before he died. On its face, Hauma is therefore a detective game in a pretty cool 2D comic book-style, with a slightly worse version of the Frogwares Sherlock Holmes mind palace as your inventory of clues, which you combine to logic your way through puzzles. But at the point where you're in a tunnel under the ruins of a Nazi temple in Munich, having discovered that the MacGuffin is a shin bone carved with the recipe for an eternal life drink (which was stolen by some nuns and taken to Bavaria, and then the nuns all got pregnant I guess?) - and, secondly, having recently survived a massive explosion at an Oktoberfest beer tent - you kind of think, well, things have gotten quite out of hand, haven't they?

In a statement to Axios, Unity exec Marc Whitten said fees will not be charged for demos unless they are a part of a download that includes the full game.


Additionally, Unity looks to have walked back one issue around multiple fees. Unity now says it will only charge for an "initial installation," per Axios, after regrouping to discuss the issue. However, an extra fee will charge if a user installs a game on a second device; once on a home PC and again on Steam Deck, for example. Whitten also says that developers will not be on the hook for fees through services like Xbox Game Pass, but rather, it would be the distributor (a.k.a. Microsoft).

Lies of P developer Neowiz proudly calls its The Adventures of Pinocchio-inspired action game a Soulslike, drawing direct attention to its From Software inspiration. The proclamation is a bold and risky move. While there are great contenders in this action subgenre, even the best are a few marks from what From Software creates and I went into Lies of P with that expectation. But then I put 40 hours into Lies of P in just five days, something I rarely do with any game. And then I doubled back on a save to get …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Nintendo Direct livestream is set to air, and quite soon at that. This one's a 24-hour notice, with September 2023 Nintendo Direct airing tomorrow on September 14.


The show will run for roughly 40 minutes, containing information focused on "Nintendo Switch games releasing this winter." It'll air on Nintendo's channels at 7 a.m. PT / 10 a.m. ET.




As usual, there were some rumors swirling about a September Nintendo Direct leading up to this announcement. But it's nice to see that the usual pre-Fall show has been locked in. We've usually seen a show around this time, coinciding with Tokyo Game Show, which is running September 21 through 24 this year.


Let the speculation begin


So, at this point, there's little else to do but speculate. Though Nintendo's specifying a winter window, I'm sure some fans are hoping to see some massive new announcements, especially after the reports out of Gamescom.


The upcoming fall slate is a little interesting for the Switch. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet just got its first batch of DLC in The Teal Mask last night, with The Indigo Disk still on the way. A 2D Mario game is on the way with Wonder, alongside a remake of a classic in Super Mario RPG. Plus, there are some potential hits lurking around, like Fashion Dreamer and a new WarioWare.


I'm personally hoping for a slew of surprising indie games. While this year's had some huge blockbusters, I'd dig something small and intriguing I could pick away at on my Switch. It's been sitting on the sidelines since Tears of the Kingdom for me, and could use an out-now surprise to encourage me to return.


We'll find out what Nintendo's winter has in store for us in tomorrow's Direct at 10 a.m. ET / 7 a.m. PT.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The console wars continue, and it looks like Xbox is enjoying a boost in the UK. It turns out sales of the Series S and Series X have increased by 76%, based on week-on-week figures up to September 2.


That's according to a report from Gamesindustry.biz. The data itself comes from GfK – a German market research company – which says that the Series X in particular enjoyed a 46% jump in sales across the United Kingdom.




One of the reasons for this has been attested to the recent 1TB model of the Xbox console. The Series S 1TB edition released at the start of September and, according to GfK spokesperson Dorian Bloch, accounted for 24% of all the Xbox systems sold at the start of the month.


There's another factor as well...


Of course, it isn't just a new model that's responsible for this increase in sales. It's been suggested that Starfield – which launched fully on September 6 – is partially responsible for this boost. 


Given that the game was available to people who pre-ordered the Premium Edition from September 1, it's entirely plausible that many people in the UK went out and bought an Xbox in preparation.


As we all know, Starfield is an Xbox exclusive and was made available through Game Pass from day one. It's easily one of the most anticipated releases of this gaming generation, much to the chagrin of PlayStation and Nintendo owners.


Reviews for Starfield have been largely positive, though many have noticed the usual assortment of bugs. It's a Bethesda game, after all. But a 76% jump in sales across the UK suggests that Microsoft making it an Xbox exclusive was worth it financially.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has consistently been a fan of airing Nintendo Directs during September, with the usual September Directs being some of the most exciting of the year. And the company will continue that streak in 2023 as it has announced a Nintendo Direct will air tomorrow, September 14.
The company revealed this on Twitter today, stating that the direct will run for "roughly 40" minutes at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET on September 14. 
Tune in on Sept. 14 at 7 a.m. PT for a #NintendoDirect livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information focused on #NintendoSwitch games releasing this winter.
https://t.co/tUb8vyZNfx pic.twitter.com/WJcQ5ZQl1b
September 13, 2023
As for what to expect, there's a lot of unknowns circling this Direct. Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the big upcoming release from Nintendo, but that just got its own dedicated direct last month. That's the same direct where we learned Nintendo was releasing a new Mario Red OLED Switch, too. 
Detective Pikachu Returns is another big Switch exclusive releasing next month, and it's likely we'll see more of it during this Direct. We just went hands-on with it last week and you can read our impressions of that here. There's plenty more coming to Switch in the last few months of 2023, too, but admittedly, exclusives are sparse. September Directs from Nintendo usually give players a look ahead at the next year so we're hoping to learn more about the company's 2024 plans. Considering "this winter" dips into next year, it seems we will learn more about the early months of 2024.
On that note, Nintendo reportedly demoed the Switch successor to developers at Gamescom last month, and other reports indicate this new console will be portable like the Switch and is targeting a release in the second half of 2024. Perhaps we'll learn about it during this Direct. Only time will tell. 
This Nintendo Direct will air at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET and will run for roughly 40 minutes. 
What do you hope to see from this Nintendo Direct? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cor, has it really been almost half a year since we've done one of these? Apologies, readers. I honestly don't know where the time goes. It's probably because we're spending too much time with our favourite guilty pleasure games, which is the subject of this latest Ask RPS column.  
The question comes courtesy of ronzilla, who asked: What were your favourite guilty pleasure games of 2022? As in, I play this all the time and I'm semi-embarrassed to admit it? 
A good question! In canvassing the wider RPS Treehouse for their responses, it quickly became clear that most of our guilty pleasure games extend way beyond the bounds of just the year 2022, so we've answered a bit more broadly than the original question perhaps intended. Still, hopefully there are still some entertaining answers in here nonetheless.

Today's the day, folks. After being initially announced in February's Pokémon Presents showcase, the first part of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's DLC, 'The Teal Mask', is now with us. If the events from the base game have become a little hazy to you by now then worry not, Nintendo is here to remind us what went down.
In a new recap video released today, Nintendo runs us through the important beats of the main game so that we can all be up to speed before diving into the DLC. The Scarlet and Violet plot was not all that in-depth, so this is more of a whistle-stop tour than anything, though it is good to be caught up all the same.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months before release, it was revealed that Bethesda would be partnering with AMD for Starfield, likely leaving Nvidia and Intel users worried. Now, Team Green has pushed out a new driver update that is said to boost the game by an average of 5%.


That's according to a recent blog post from Nvidia itself. The long and the short of it is the company is rolling out an over-the-air (OTA) update for the RTX 30 and RTX 40 series. The post describes it as a "Resizable BAR profile for Starfield which increases performance" for its modern graphics cards.




Anyone playing the game on PC with one of the above GPU generations should hopefully see some improvements to overall performance.


The Colony Wars vs the Graphics Card Wars


Given that Starfield has been better optimized for AMD hardware, the likes of Nvidia and Intel will likely have a harder time meeting expectations.


This does appear to be the case as noted in the above video from Digital Foundry. In the analysis, Starfield running on an Nvidia RTX 2070 SUPER struggles to reach 60fps. By comparison, Cyberpunk 2077 is able to achieve above 70fps with the same hardware and with ray tracing on.


Even the Nvidia RTX 4060 is unable match the performance output of AMD's own RX 7600. The former seems to have problems even reaching 40fps, while the latter more than outdoes its competitor in terms of framerate.


Hopefully this latest OTA update from Team Green should see some improvements. Future benchmark tests will at least be able to give the lowdown. If you're struggling to get the driver update OTA, Nvidia's own Sean Pelletier has some advice on how to force the update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although it was met with some criticisms when it was released in February of 2022, Dying Light 2 is a worthy follow-up to its 2015 predecessor. However, since developer Techland updated the game recently, the horror sequel has been facing the wrath of the review bombers.


If you take a look at the Steam page for Dying Light 2, you'll see that the scores now say "Mixed," with the review chart showing the negative reception the game's been getting recently.




Many have expressed anger at the Summer Time patch, which added new weapon animations, bug fixes, and more. However, it also introduced microtransactions in the form of Dying Light Points. These are purchasable with real money and can be used to acquire add-ons. As the Steam reviews show, this has not gone down well with fans.


Techland responds


As is usually the case with such controversies, the studio has issued a statement regarding these "frustrations." The developer says it has been listening to feedback and has started working on a "couple of solutions proposed by the community."


One such example is a second look at the "mechanics of adding an option to purchase individual items from the existing bundles." Whether there will truly be a 180 on the implementation of DL Points remains to be seen.


The fact that the message from Techland goes on to remind people of the "several bundles in the store that can be bought for less than 500 DL Points that you can grab now" sort of implies they're here to stay. We'll provide updates as this debacle unfolds!

Like most things Game Freak-related, some fixes have been rolling out at a snail's pace, including the updates added in patch 2.0.1, which is now live thanks to the launch of the Teal Mask DLC.


Here are the main highlights of Pokemon Scarlet & Violet patch 2.0.1

Actually, that statement isn’t severe enough to reflect how bad the internet is these days, so let me try that again: being online in 2023 is a fucking nightmare. There are only three websites. They are all designed to make you angry because it’s the most profitable emotion. Your aunt was indoctrinated into fascism by a page called “This country used to have real bin men” after she liked a meme about glass milk bottles in 2012. Every boy you went to school with has a podcast about football now. Your Mam once warned you about spending too much time on the computer but now spends eight hours a day playing Hay Day on her phone. AI was meant to let us lie in fields and read books, but instead it’s being used to show you what Breaking Bad would have looked like as an anime.
But it didn’t used to be like this!

In 2022, developers confirmed that they are busy with Project Rene, which will be The Sims 4's successor. A few things have already been confirmed about the upcoming game, including the fact that it'll feature collaborative play and cross-play. 


It was suspected that the game would adopt some kind of free-to-play model, as this is the form The Sims 4 has taken. Furthermore, a Maxis job posting was found which was looking for a Head of Marketplace and Monetization for an upcoming free-to-enter game.

Additionally, characters can now create an Ice Wall, in addition to using the Deku Smash.

Todoroki, Kirishima, and Ashido are available on Fortnite's Item Shop. Todoroki himself comes with two costumes and is 1,500 VBucks. There's a bundle with him and three other items, such as the Cold-Hot Hitters and U.A. Uniform weapon skin, for 2,400 VBucks. 


Ashido and Kirishima are 1,500 VBucks separately or 2,800 VBucks together. That 2,800 VBucks bundle also comes with the Cultural Festival Dance, Red Riot Thrashers, Red Riot Shield, and Acid Axe. 


Fortnite players can also find the Ice Wall ability, in addition to the Deku Smash as an item pick-up. You can score them easily from the All Might supply drop, which has the former hero's face on the balloon. The Ice Wall can protect your friends or slip up players as an offensive attack. 


Additionally, there are quests focused on My Hero Academia. These include finding All Might supply drops, damaging foes with the Deku Smash, and causing fire damage to structures around the world. If you finish enough of these quests, you'll gain an instant level-up.


Deku, Bakugo, and Uraraka are currently not on the Fortnite Item Shop at the time of writing, but they'll may join the lineup soon if you missed them the first time. Epic Games likely wants to go all-in with this Fortnite My Hero Academia collab.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NIS America launched a playable demo for Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless, alongside a new trailer for the latest in the long-running, strategy RPG franchise. The demo is now available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch. In addition, all progress made can be transferred to the full release.




For longtime fans of the Disgaea franchise, the new trailer for Vows of the Virtueless includes the return of Tsunami Bomb’s “The Invasion From Within,” which was included as the trailer music for the original Disgaea: Hour of Darkness back in 2007. To hit its fandom over the head with a nostalgia meteor this close to release, NIS America must have a lot of confidence in Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless.


In the latest entry in the Disgaea franchise, we follow Fuji and Pirilika as they seek to return the bushido code to the demonic realm of Hinomoto. As is to be expected from the series, there are a vast number of character classes to pick from, along with new features such as Item Reincarnation, Jumbification, and Hell Mode! Plus, with the inclusion of online ranked battles, it seems there’s much to do this go around.


Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless is set to release on October 3 for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch. You can download the demo today to test out the new features and, as mentioned above, transfer any progress made to the full version of the game when it launches.

I wondered why this was until I thought about how it handles romance. When I shipped Karlach and Lae'zel together, I compared Baldur's Gate 3 to dating sims rather than other RPGs and everything clicked. This is a fantastic RPG, but more importantly, it's an awesome dating sim.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple held a special keynote event today to reveal the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, new Apple Watches, and more. While new iPhones aren’t exactly surprising given the company's annual cadence, what is surprising is that Apple has also announced that Resident Evil 4 (Remake), Resident Evil Village, Assassin's Creed Mirage, and Death Stranding are coming to the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max, as reported by IGN. 

While details were sparse, Apple showed a few screens of the games on a virtual version of the iPhone 15 Pro during today's event, stopping short of showing gameplay of these games running on the newly announced phones. It's unclear what the gameplay experiences for these games will be like on the iPhone 15 Pro and Max; considering it's already possible to connect a Bluetooth controller, like the PlayStation DualSense or Xbox Series X/S gamepad, to various Apple devices, it's not a stretch to assume that’s the best way to play these games on this new device. 
As for how these games run on the devices, that remains to be seen. Apple says both Resident Evil games and Death Stranding will be available on the phones later this year, while Assassin's Creed Mirage hits the devices in the first half of 2024, according to IGN.
Resident Evil 4 Remake launched earlier this year, while Capcom released Resident Evil Village in 2021. Assassin's Creed Mirage is Game Informer's current cover story game, with an exclusive coverage hub as well, and the latest entry in this long-running franchise hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on October 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has announced a new Xbox Series X/S controller with a deep purple color scheme on the front and a bright white back. Aptly, this new controller is titled "Astral Purple." It looks great and is available for preorder now before its September 19 release date. 
Xbox says, "This rich purple color has a distinct regal look to spice up your gaming setup and bolster your collection," noting that the dark purple theme carries over to both thumbsticks, all four face buttons, and the three menu buttons in the center of the controller. The triggers, bumpers, and d-pad feature a matte black finish, and the back case is a bright white. 
Like most other Xbox Series X/S controllers, the Astral Purple edition will cost $64.99. It's available for preorder and releases on September 19. As expected, it features all the usual bells, whistles, and features of the standard Xbox Series X/S controller, so if you’re looking to add a little more purple to your collection, this might be for you. 
While waiting for its release, check out the Stormcloud Vapor controller revealed last month and then read about the Xbox Elite Series 2 "Core" Edition controller. After that, read Game Informer's list of the top 10 best Xbox Series X/S games.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetherRealm Studios' latest 2D fighter, Mortal Kombat 1, is right around the corner. Premium and Kollector Editions of the game go live this Thursday, September 14, and the regular edition goes live next week on September 19. Ahead of the game's release, NetherRealm has released the official launch trailer, featuring four minutes of new gameplay, fatalities, gore, and more. 
Today's trailer also features our first look at gameplay for Shang Tsung, whom you get if you preorder the game, more of the story, which centers on a rebooted Mortal Kombat universe by way of Fire God Liu Kang, and Reiko, General Shao's second-in-command. Check it out for yourself below:


Shang Tsung is still a sorcerer and his moveset in the trailer reflects that, with fiery projectiles, massive combos, and the ability to morph into other fighters. Reiko, on the other hand, is described by NetherRealm as "a savage warrior with a fighting style that matches his fierce persona." Elsewhere in the trailer, we get new looks at many of the roster's other fighters, like the Jean-Claude Van Damme skin for Johnny Cage and the recently revealed Nitara, who Megan Fox voices. 
Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on September 14 for Premium and Kollector editions of the game. The rest of the editions go live on September 19. 
While waiting for the game's release, watch Ed Boon talk about Mortal Kombat 1 on hot wing-eating interview show Hot Ones, and then watch this Nitara gameplay trailer. After that, read our hands-on impressions of Mortal Kombat 1's Invasions and Story Mode.

We have been back on something of a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge kick recently thanks to the release of the excellent Dimension Shellshock DLC. The heroes in a half shell are firmly back in our hearts thanks to developer Tribute Games and, after a recent interview from Xbox Expansion Pass with the game's narrative designer, Yannic Belzil, it seems that there is a chance we might see the studio take on a franchise other than the Turtles in the future.
When asked about what the future holds for Tribute Games following the DLC's release, Belzil commented that there is nothing currently in the works. That being said, he did note that the studio has been approached with offers to tackle something different:

Id Software's 1997 shooter was fancied up with a remaster released as a free update in August, complete with all the old stuff and one notable new addition. MachineGames, the studio behind the modern Wolfenstein games, have created a whole new story campaign for the remaster. I've really enjoyed playing it. It's the old Quake 2 you know and have complicated feelings about, filtered through modern design sensibilities. I think both veterans and newcomers could enjoy blasting these biomechanical alien horrors.

Lake added that, Remedy's sense of audience expectations notwithstanding, he himself has difficulty setting aside hours for longer games. "[It's] just struggling with finding time and you know, being interested in a story, wanting to see it through," he said. "So it can even be daunting at times to start playing a game that you know is really, really long."

In case you're wondering, I've checked with the authorities and yes, PHARAOH should be written in all capitals, making a laughing stock of all previous RPS reporting. If it feels unnatural, try to imagine that you're bellowing the game's title from the summit of a pyramid, so as to remind your embattled subjects of your magnificence. RPS boss Katharine behaves similarly in morning meetings. "EDITOR-IN-CHIEF," she roars at us repeatedly, until somebody rushes her the daily traffic reports, a steaming goblet of sphinx eggs and a gif of a crafty kill in Shadow Gambit.

"And once they do, they feel the urge to start a brand-new campaign because they've already figured out that portion of the gameplay."
Sitting across the table, these words ring frighteningly true for me. Unbeknownst to Nikolov, he has just described the exact experience I had playing the 50-turn campaign preview for Pharaoh a week earlier to an absolute tee. Unlike the far more knowledgeable brain of frequent RPS contributor Nic Reuben, I am a complete babe in arms when it comes to the Total War juggernaut machine, and it took me attempting to play two other games in the series (Three Kingdoms and Troy) and several restarts in Pharaoh itself before I felt just about confident that I (very vaguely) knew what I was doing. At the time, I thought, 'Man alive, how is Total War still so rubbish at teaching players how it works?' But when I speak to Nikolov a week later, he has some very welcome news for me: there's going to be a dedicated tutorial campaign where players can (hopefully) find their feet. Music to my ears.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The opening theme of Mythforce is a wonderfully observed 1980s positivity ballad in the style of Jayce and The Wheeled Warriors. This song believes in you, aggressively so. "MythForce! MythForce! Everyday people become heroes! / MythForce! MythForce! You and me, we can defeat evil!" The roguelike dungeon dallying that follows doesn't take that "you can do it!" Saturday morning cartoon flavour to its comedic conclusion in the same way an Adult Swim animation might, or a Devolver game would. Instead the real focus seems to be function over flavour, resulting in a skeleton-battering jaunt that is competent and comfortable, yet never fully embracing the silliness promised by the sick guitar riffs of the theme.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this episode of New Gameplay Today, Blake Hester and I show you a glimpse of a different kind of cooking game, Nour: Play With Your Food. Rather than tasking players with cooking a proper dish, developer Terrifying Jellyfish presents a playspace of ingredients, tools like blowtorches and meat tenderizers, and a suite of odd abilities that change gravity, freeze food, and make your culinary ingredients dance — all in the name of playfulness. While levels contain hidden experiences you can unlock by specific interactions, there's hardly a central goal in Nour. Similar to Townscaper, this joyful release is more akin to a toy than a game, and it's so much fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being a dedicated spacer I've never had much interest in the base construction aspect of Starfield, but that was before I learned that you can spacewalk by means of console commands, aka cheats. Reddit user WeirdConcern4666 made history on this front yesterday. Here's how you do it: 1) get up from the cockpit controls, 2) hit the tilde key to open the command console at the bottom of the screen, 3) type "player.setpos x 10" to teleport your character outside the ship, then hit return and 4) type "setgravityscale 0" to engage zero gravity and stop your character plummeting endlessly. Then hit the tilde key again to close the command console, and well, there you go.
Space sure is bigger outside a spaceship, isn't it? Just as well you brought that jetpack. If your vessel of choice is on the bulky side, like mine, you might need to increase the number on the end of "player.setpos" to escape the invisible barriers around your craft's exterior. Witness my character Mary Read's first attempts at a spacewalk below. If you've somehow discarded your jetpack, you can always punt yourself about with the recoil from an appropriately chunky firearm.

With Todoroki on the island, developer Epic Games has added his Ice Wall as an item to the game. With the Ice Wall, you gain the power to summon glacial shields that stand taller than players anywhere. It has a large pool of health and remains in play until its health is depleted. Plus, when you use it, everyone around it is knocked back. They also gain icy feet, which will cause them to slip and slide all over the place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know about you, but after spending 100+ hours in both Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Assassin's Creed Valhalla, I'm well up for an AC game that reins its open world in a bit and goes back to the sort-of single city stab-athon the series used to be. The ones where stealth actually mattered, and you felt like a proper assassin working from the shadows. Assassin's Creed Mirage is all this to a tee - as Ubisoft have taken great pains to remind us over the last year as they gear up to celebrate the series' 15th anniversary. 
And after spending three hours playing some of its early mission sequences, I can confirm this is very much a game whose sole purpose is to scratch that nostalgic itch good and proper (before we inevitably hurl ourselves into the still very ambiguous void of whatever the heck Assassin's Creed Infinity is). If, however, you don't have much fondness for those older games, and prefer the more action-oriented RPG-ing of recent Creeds, Mirage is probably going to feel like a step backward from all the things you know and like - and you may be better off waiting until the next big open world entry set in feudal Japan pitches up instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I heard of Steam it was, as you might expect, in conjunction with the release of a little FPS called Half-Life 2 back in 2004. You needed Steam to access it, whether you bought the digital version or a retail copy. Given relative unfamiliarity with digital distribution, the nascent status of broadband internet in the UK and US, and the much greater importance of physical game sales at the time, this caused quite a stir. I remember being alarmed by an op-ed over on GameRevolution.com that held forth at length about the risk of conflicts between Steam and other software, if players were outright required to leave it running. How quaint those anxieties seem today - the day of Steam's 20th anniversary. And yet, there's nothing quaint about Steam's ability to shape the field in which it operates.

        <updated>2023-09-11T14:41:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hitting pause in a video game is like dropping a wall across it. On one side of the wall lies what is called the diegetic space of the game, aka the fictitious world, which is generally the aspect that receives the most interest, the aspect that tends to attract the weasel word "immersive". On the other side of the wall lie menus, settings and other features that form a non-diegetic layer of bald operator functions - technical conveniences and lists of things to tweak or customise, from graphics modes to character inventory, that are cut adrift in a vacuum outside of time. 


In theory, the pause screen and its contents are not truly part of the game. There is no temporality, no sense of place, no threat, no possibility of play, no character or narrative, no save the princess, no press X to Jason or pay respects, no gather your party before travelling forth. As the scholar Madison Schmalzer points out in the paper I'm wonkily paraphrasing here, "the language of the menu itself emphasizes the menu's position as outside of gameplay by labeling the option to continue as 'resume game.' The game world is always privileged as the site that gameplay happens."

We enjoyed the game, giving it an 8.25 out of 10 – you can read our review here. If you haven’t jumped into From Software’s latest action title yet, though, you might be in luck because a new patch that's now live buffs various weapons and adjusts some boss attacks. 
From Software released Patch 1.02 today, and while the overall update is small, it buffs nearly 10 weapons and fixes a smattering of bugs. The studio says, “[This] new patch has been distributed to improve gameplay stability and make balance adjustments” and that it is “focused on balance adjustments that will allow players more build diversity in the early and mid-game whe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was a time back in my school days when cardgames were all the rage. Everybody had a deck of playing cards in their pocket for cheeky 15 minute rounds of Texas Hold 'Em between lessons, with Milky Way segments and Niknaks wagered in place of chips. Yes, I'm aware I'm starting to sound like Grandpa Simpson, and no, this wasn't from some murky era before the invention of videogames. It was the heyday of the Gameboy Advance! I'm not sure what we were thinking. But two things: 1) decks of playing cards are cheaper than game consoles, and 2) part of the fun, possibly, was that nobody really knew how to play the ostensibly well-known cardgames we were playing.
With the benefit of hindsight, I suspect there may have been creative liberties taken with the rules at times. I knew hair-pulling wasn't a legal move in professional poker. Anyway, I'm reminded of all this by Dungeons & Degenerate Gamblers, a warped and mildly satirical, 90s-styled take on Blackjack from Purple Moss Collectors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's Radeon RX 6800 and 6800 XT graphics cards have proven surprisingly popular even into 2023, as new price drops (and relatively modest gen-on-gen performance increases for newer models) has left them as competitive options in terms of value for money. 
Today we've got a deal on the RX 6800 non-XT, with an MSI model going for just under $400 at Newegg. That's a $70 reduction from its usual price and $20 cheaper than the cheapest RX 6800 model on Amazon. That's an awesome deal for a strong 1440p graphics card that comes with a copy of Starfield Premium Edition (which includes the Shattered Space story expansion, a digital art book, the game's OST and a few weapon/suit skins on top of the base game).

It's still rare to see a good example closer to £200 though, and that's exactly what we've got today: a 27-inch model from system integrators AWD-IT, the X= XRGB27WQ, available for £210 after a £70 discount.

Abriss has you destroying brutalist architecture in a futuristic cityscape using rockets, wrecking arms and laser pinwheels of your own design. Whatever you construct, the result is a glorious physics spectacle. After a little over a year in Steam Early Access, it hit 1.0 earlier this week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never watched the original Gargoyles animated series, but I've been on the internet for long enough to know that it's a cult favourite for being a Disney show with surprisingly dark themes. I also know that its video game adaptation, released in 1995 for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, was a 16-bit platformer with a similar appeal to other Disney games of the period like Aladdin and The Lion King.

Both those games were re-released in 2021, and now it's Gargoyles' turn. There's a first trailer for Gargoyles Remastered below.

At the same time, it’s a new chapter in a long legacy that surrounds the interplay between the original tabletop RPG and the video gaming hobby. It’s a strange truth that, even as a video game, Baldur’s Gate 3 has emerged as one of the most potent arguments in years for trying out the actual D&D game at a table.
When I was a kid growing up in the ‘80s, playing D&D was not something you would readily admit to. Beyond the open ridicule you might face from your peers, it had a genuine chance to get you barred from some of your friends’ homes. No joke. More than a few parents back then truly believed that D&D was tantamount to actual demon worship, and they wouldn’t want t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games chief creative officer Donald Mustard is retiring this month after seven years with the company. He announced this today on Twitter, stating that after working in the games industry for nearly 25 years, he is retiring to spend time with his wife and family. 
Most notably, Mustard served as the head of Fortnite, responsible for leading its storytelling and creative decision-making behind the game as a battle royale. Epic Games has not announced who will be taking over the role after Mustard retires, nor has it specified what the future of Fortnite looks like, although hundreds are working on it, and things will likely continue as usual. 
Here’s what Mustard posted on Twitter:
After an incredible adventure, I will be retiring from my role as Chief Creative Officer at Epic this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray proved to be an unlikely phenomenon when it was released last July, and now the little kitty and its robotic pals are heading to the big screen. Publisher Annapurna has announced plans to develop an animated movie based on the hit indie game.
Per Entertainment Weekly, Annapurna Animation, the company's new animated film division, is following up its debut feature, Nimona, with a film adaptation of the 2022 adventure game. It will be the first game in Annapurna Interactive’s roster of titles to get the cinematic treatment, and, according to the publisher, it won’t be the last. Annapurna has not revealed a director, cast, or release window for the Stray film. Annapurna Animation is led by former Disney Animation executives Robert Baird and Andrew Millstein. 
"This is a game that's all about what makes us human, and there are no humans in it," Baird tells EW. "It's a buddy comedy about a cat and a robot, and there's such a hilarious dynamic. So, there's comedy inherent in this, but there's not one human being in this movie. I think it's one of the reasons why the game was incredibly popular, that you are seeing the world through the point of view of an adorable cat. How did they pull that off, and how are we going to pull that off in the movie? We will, even though sometimes it feels impossible, but we know that's the essence of the game and the key to telling the story."
Stray was developed by French studio BlueTwelve. Taking place in a post-apocalyptic Earth devoid of humans, players control a cat who gets separated from its friends and sets out to find them. The cat's journey takes it through cities occupied by sentient robots, which it befriends along the way, namely a flying drone named B-12. Stray was among the most celebrated games of last year, winning Best Debut Indie at the Game Awards, and made its way to Xbox last month. You can read our review of Stray here.

The P5 Plus is a drive that we've covered many times over on the RPS Deals beat, as it comes very close in performance to the top options in its category - your Samsung 990 Pros and your WD SN850xs - while often costing much less.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has announced a digital broadcast set to air during Tokyo Game Show this month. The presentation takes place on September 21 at 2 a.m. PT/5 a.m. ET.
According to Xbox Wire, the event will feature “progress updates from Xbox and Bethesda Softworks and see a creatively diverse collection of games from creators predominantly located in Japan and across Asia.” The event will also reveal new titles for Xbox Game Pass.
The most likely game to appear is Final Fantasy XIV, which is heading to Xbox next spring ahead of its upcoming Dawntrail expansion. Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which last popped up during this summer's Xbox Games Showcase, could also reappear. Of course, there are plenty of big Japanse developed titles incoming that could get a spotlight, and it's always interesting to see what Asian companies and titles it courts each year. 
Tokyo Game Show runs from September 21 to 24. Publishers like Capcom, Atlus, Sega, Koei Tecmo, and Square Enix, among others, will air dedicated livestreams throughout the event.]]></summary>

The Bunny Graveyard fits right in with this idea, which tells a seemingly sweet tale across a series of mini-games à la WarioWare, but as expected, things take a creepy turn in the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I first clocked the mysterious-looking OU when Japanese indie collective Asobu did their pre-Bitsummit showcase stream in 2021. It wasn't entirely clear what OU was going to be at that point, other than a sort-of-puzzle game about an amnesiac boy who'd found himself in a fantastical world of picturebook pages, and even when Alicia Haddick played it for herself at Bitsummit proper the following year, OU still had a strong, impenetrable sense of ambiguity about it.  
But its striking art and rustic guitar soundtrack have stuck in my mind ever since, and finally, OU is now out in the wild. I've only played about two hours of it so far, but it's clear there's still a lot more to discover within its dreamy little vignettes. It's one of those games that's designed to be played multiple times to get the full extent of the story, and I've just hit the first of those Nier Automata-esque restarts. Honestly, I'm not quite sure what to think of it yet, but one thing is certain: I can't get it out of my head.

Publisher Behaviour Interactive (from Dead By Daylight fame) have now announced a free open playtest, available to everyone from now until September 21st. As lovely as the game looks, I’m excited to try Islands Of Insight for myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although most of my favourite films are tragedies, games with a grim and heavy premise don't often appeal to me as much as you'd think. I wasn't quite expecting to enjoy The Man Came Around, then, as it's about a group of desperate people trying to cross the border to escape their authoritarian government. In Winter, no less.
It's actually rather light in practice, although not in a flippant or trivialising way. The message is clearly that these things are serious and our sympathies should be, well, basic concern for the wellbeing of other people. But it's not as miserable to play as games with such serious themes often are. The premise is serious, but the act of playing it is not. I'd call it "diverting" rather than "entertaining", but the bottom line is there's a good afternoon or two in there for you.

There’s also been a shocking lack of, uhm, male organ-shaped spacecraft which makes putting this post together much less hard. But for now, onward! Let’s admire some cool ships.

I spent most of my hour-long demo session steadily working my way through its extensive tutorial, as I have not, in fact, played Cities: Skylines before now - although I can at least confirm that its tutorial is very newbie-friendly, and that I now feel more prepared to give it a go properly when it comes out in full on October 24th.
But the thing that really impressed me was just the sheer scope of its playable spaces. We've known since the end of July that its maps are roughly 5x bigger than those in the first game, and when I saw Colossal Order's Maps & Themes video, I thought, 'Yes, those sure look enormous!' But actually seeing them in person really put things into perspective for me, especially when I tried zooming the camera out and it just kept going and going and going and…

And while that reveal teased what many thought to be Kraven the Hunter, it wasn’t confirmed to be him until later.

Infinite’s previous trailers already made it look like a "Stellaris in a different version of space" affair - which is by no means an unfavourable comparison - and the latest footage shows off more grand strategy shenanigans. Planet management. Lotsa menus. Expanding factions, sometimes peacefully if you prefer a clear conscience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On today’s installment of Bad Calls I Have Made, I will cop to never really buying the idea of Starfield needing an SSD. Even among its astronomical system requirements, an inflexible demand for solid state storage seemed like a stretch; after all, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart runs mostly fine on a hard drive, and in a previous life that game was employed as a cheerleader for the PS5’s SSD. Starfield would probably just have rubbish load times or texture pop-in or something, and all would be revealed once I could try it on mechanical storage. Which I now have.
So, can you play Starfield on an HDD? No. It’s bloody awful.

Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. 
If you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.
We truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some would say the best way to wind down after a rough day down the Content Reactors isn’t to play a grotty occult horror game, but I caught a trailer for Tenebris Somnia earlier, and couldn’t help myself. In this foetid offering from Argentinian devs Andrés Borghi and Tobías Rusjan of Saibot Studios, you play a young woman, Julia, who is visiting her film-maker ex-boyfriend to drop off their old apartment key. Julia’s having a hard time getting over the break-up, but she’s clearly doing better than her ex: his apartment is full of broken glass, anomalous red gloop and creepy occult books. 


The game’s twist is that it’s two visual styles thrust into the same frame. On the one hand, you'll explore an 8-bit world of unpleasantly bright colours, finding and combining objects adventure-game-style. I say adventure-game-style, because this is a bit more energetic than most adventure games – you can equip and swing a wrench, and there’s a run button. On the other hand, well. Click the headline to find out, if you dare. Yes, this is me trying to do a jumpscare. Brace yourself! (It's just occurred to me, 24 hours too late, that the above joke only makes sense if you're viewing our Latest feed. Everybody else, erm - scroll down?)

As Boon sweats through increasingly spicy wings, we also get a glimpse at the previously announced Jean-Claude Van Damme skin for Johnny Cage. 
For the unfamiliar, Hot Ones is a 1-on-1 interview show in which celebrity guests are asked questions while devouring wings that get gradually spicier as the interview progresses (usually to humorous results). Boon’s discussion delves into his entry into the game industry, Netherrealm's decision-making process when selecting cross-over fighters, the studio's approach to storytelling, and other topics. Boon is one of, if not the first, video game developer to appear on the show, and watching him share his fighting game knowledge while simultaneously fighting for his life is an entertaining treat. 


During the discussion, we get the first clip of Johnny Cage's Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin, which you can see in the photos below. It will be purchasable in the Kombat pack that will be included in the Premium/Kollector's editions of the game. 

Mortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. For the latest roster reveals, check out trailers for Nitara, Sindel/General Shao, Ashrah/Havik, and Smoke/Rain.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most succinct yet exciting announcements from last year’s D23 Expo was Gargoyles Remastered, a modernized facelift of the classic (and challenging) side-scrolling Sega Genesis title based on the popular ‘90s cartoon. A new trailer revealed the game’s new presentation and an October release date.
Gargoyles Remastered takes the 1995 game and repaints it with a coat of new enhanced visuals more faithful to the series (and you can instantly toggle between the new look and the classic 16-bit graphics). It also includes the usual bells and whistles for remastered Disney games, such as an instant rewind, wide-screen presentation, and achievements. The original soundtrack has also been remastered. Check out the game's first trailer below. 


If you’re a Gargoyles fan looking to fight evil as Goliath and his friends again, you can pick up Gargoyles Remastered on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 19.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, Nintendo revealed longtime Mario voice actor Charles Martinet will no longer voice the character. The company stopped short of revealing who is taking over the role, although it did say we’d find out in the upcoming release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which does not feature Martinet as Mario. 
Now, Nintendo has released a new video featuring Martinet and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto discussing their history together, the role of Mario, and Martinet’s new role, Mario Ambassador. 
You can watch the video in full below, but we’ve transcribed most of it for your reading as well:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[E3 2023 was canceled back in March, and PAX organizer ReedPop was in charge of organizing the event, the first of a multi-year contract. However, E3's overseer the ESA has announced this partnership will not continue.
According to GameIndustry.biz, the ESA and ReedPop have come to a mutual decision to part ways. On top of that, E3 2024, which is still planned to take place, will not be held at its traditional venue, the Los Angeles Convention Center. This had been previously reported by the city itself. There’s no word on where E3 will be held, but the site reports that the ESA is also looking to completely reinvent the show in 2025. 
“We appreciate ReedPop’s partnership over the past 14 months and support their ongoing efforts to bring industry and fans together through their various events,” said ESA president and CEO Stanley Pierre-Louis in a statement to GameIndustry.biz. “While the reach of E3 remains unmatched in our industry, we are continuing to explore how we can evolve it to best serve the video game industry and are evaluating every aspect of the event, from format to location. We are committed to our role as a convenor for the industry and look forward to sharing news about E3 in the coming months.”
ReedPop had been tasked with revamping this year’s ill-fated E3 after the show had collapsed over the last few years due to the pandemic and waning interest from publishers/developers. The 2023 edition fell through after Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft declined to attend alongside publishers such as Ubisoft and Sega. The last in-person E3 was in 2019, and outside of the online-only 2021 event, every subsequent E3 has been completely canceled. Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest has filled the void since then.

Either way, I’ve recently developed an intense appreciation for teeny, tiny microgames, to the point where I’ve essentially been begging in the RPS Slack channel for recommendations. Just one more Steam link and I’ll be fine, promise.
And I don’t mean short games in the seven- or eight-hour sense. Not even film-length games like Portal or Jazzpunk. No, I seek to gorge on the slightest sub-hour canapés, games in which you can see and do everything in one or hour or less. "Irresponsibly large"? Another time, Mister Starfield, I crave something irrevocably small.

While rumors continue to swirl about what the Switch successor could be and when it might be released, new reports from Eurogamer and Video Games Chronicle say the company showed it to developers behind closed doors at Gamescom last month. 
Eurogamer says its sources say Nintendo showed partners tech demos designed to demonstrate how well the Switch successor runs. Specifically, one of the demos shown was reportedly a “souped-up version” of the Switch launch title, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Eurogame…]]></summary>

As billionaire jebends plot to establish their own corporate fiefdoms amongst the stars, our descendents' potential spacelives are looking as miserable as collecting 5 spacewolf livers. But I find some hope in spaceship salvage sim Hardspace: Shipbreaker, both in the overt plot about unionisation and in the small satisfaction of doing a job well. Head down, shut up, and focus on dismantling this spaceship carefully and efficiently. It's an attitude that won't save the world but can get you through one more day, and sometimes that's enough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I finished Part 1 of my perverse effort to play Starfield entirely as a space sim, I was both terrified and tantalised. A quick reminder of the rules: I can only acquire new ships by commandeering them, with no planetary landings permitted, which also means that I can't just shuffle between ships at whim after adding them to my hangar. It's possible the game contains an orbital shipyard of some kind - if you've found one, don't spoil! - but at the time of writing, any vessel I abandon is essentially gone for good. 


My first trophy as greenhorn orbital bandit Mary Read was a UC Transpo, which isn't so much a spaceship as a shoebox with toilet roll tubes and detergent bottles glued to the outside, its ordnance limited to a single laser. I began my second leg confidently expecting to spend many hours in this Fisher Price starmobile, vainly searching for a wounded battlecruiser or an abandoned solar yacht or some other, more capable vessel accessible to a space pirate of extremely modest means. This is going to be Jalopy: Galactic Edition, I said to myself. Imagine my shock (and slight disappointment) when I jumped to the very next planet and proceeded to comprehensively ding over a Crimson Fleet Spectre.

In truth, I was surprised (and somewhat saddened) by some of the comments we received around our Baldur's Gate 3 coverage. If you missed them, they were mostly in the vein of saying our increased volume of BG3-related posts felt like "spam", harking back to when we (and the internet at large) all went similarly bananas over Elden Ring last year. I know it can sometimes seem like writing about these games - particularly on RPS - feels like we're somehow neglecting everything else going on in PC gaming. But the truth is a little more complicated than that, so I wanted to take some time to talk a bit about this in this month's Letter From The Editor, because there are a number of reasons why this happens - and will probably continue to happen more generally as websites fight for survival.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, a game sits at such a cross section of my interests that it almost feels made specifically for me. In the case of Affogato, it’s three of my favourite types of games mashed together: it’s Coffee Talk by way of Persona by way of any card-based tower defence game – only here it’s sort of "reverse tower defence", as the game's Steam page is keen to point out. It's your own card units that are the ones moving along pre-defined tracks wreaking havoc on stationary enemies, not the other way around. Maybe tower assault would be a better term, but that's by the by. Served with a dollop of anime froth on the top, Affogato should be my exact cuppa joe. But despite its intriguing ingredients, I wouldn't say it's been wholly successful in slooshing them all together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oft' am I struck by the fact that video game homes belonging to characters in the depths of despair are nicer that all of the homes I've lived in myself. Granted, I'm a thirty-something in a country with a years-long housing crisis, so even the Baker House in Resident Evil 7 is of "I think I could just about afford that one day" status. But it comes to something when a 70s depresso-capsule at the bottom of the sea has more square footage and storage space than I do.
Under The Waves (which got patched today, and not before time because I've had one fatal error crash per play session since it came out last week so far) is about a deep sea diver called Stan, who is living and working at the bottom of a big wet metaphor for grief. You will know this because a) its Steam page says this up front, and b) it's not super subtle (this game is published by Quantic Dream). But, as newsman Edwin pointed out to me today, when was the last time the sea wasn't a metaphor for grief? It's never a metaphor for enjoying a nice raspberry ripple ice cream. And despite Stan making reference to "what [he's] been through" half an hour in, I think it does a great job with its chthonic sadness. You float about in your tiny little sub in a great misty darkness, listen to the extremely melancholy music, and you start thinking about sad stuff in your own life. But you get into Stan's capsule living area and you think "this guy has a carpet and a book nook, what the hell?"

The videogame in question is Pyrolith's V.A. Proxy, which I've had my eye on for a while, on account of it being inspired by Nier: Automata and Devil May Cry, with a landscape of megastructures and bruised and rusty art direction that calls to mind The Signal from Tölva. In this moody open world action game, you play one of three robots who awaken to find their memories gone, and promptly set out in search of their creator. It'd be an eye-catcher even without the atomic parry, which you can witness for yourself in the embedded clip below.

        <updated>2023-09-06T22:49:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1’s roster already has a few returning names from the series’ 3D era in the forms of Ashrah and Havik, and another long-lost favorite joins the fight. Nitara is making her long-awaited return, and it’s such a big homecoming that NetherRealm has enlisted actress Megan Fox to voice her.
Nitara is a vampire that made her debut in 2002’s Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. She’s only been playable in a couple of entries, had a small cameo in Mortal Kombat 11, and appeared in the 2021 Mortal Kombat film. Despite having only a few appearances to her name, she’s endured as favorite among fans who grew up with the 2000s era, and she looks as deadly as ever in MK 1. 
Megan Fox brings Nitara to life, and you can get a sample of her performance in the trailer below. “I grew up playing Mortal Kombat and I can’t believe that I’m voicing a character in the new game," Fox says in a press release. "It’s an honor to be a part of one of the greatest video game legacies of all time.” Given that Ronda Rousey voiced Sonya Blade in MK 11, it’s not surprising to see NetherRealm rope in another celebrity to perform one of its kombatants. 


Mortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Check out our latest hands-on impressions of its Invasions and Story Mode here. Be sure to also watch the game's most recent trailer from Gamescom 2023.]]></summary>

But the latter was the highlight of my experience. 
I completed three contracts during my hands-on time, each at different levels of progression for protagonist Basim Ibn Is’haq. Contracts are essentially mini-missions that task you with eliminating a target, obtaining an item, or doing something like moving a boat to a specified location. You must scout an area out, find your target, determine the path of least resistance to them or it – Basim is all about stealth and spe…]]></summary>

It's the company's first new IP in almost 30 years (a claim that contains in it an inherent threat for Starfield 2), and though Bethesda has copied some of their own homework for some themes and factions, Starfield is indeed a spacefaring adventure of epic scale and sometimes surprising beauty. It's this scale that makes Starfield feel unfortunately small and empty, a place that still has those fun little Bethesda side quests that escalate into something huge and absurd, but that can also swallow them whole in its cold, star-scattered grandeur.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the grim darkness of the far future, the galaxy is your oyster. Or at least it will be, once you've played 100 hours of Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, an RPG from Pathfinder developer Owlcat in which you can buy planets, configure your genocidal Dark Eldar friend to strike ten times a turn, and gaze on ruefully as a demon explodes out of your Psyker's head. 


An immediate and shameful disclaimer: I can't match Nic Reuben's deep knowledge of the 40K tabletop universe, which saw him ruminating upon the mysteries of the Koronus Expanse back in 2022, while holding Owlcat's feet to the fire over the absence of space dwarves. The nearest I got to playing 40K as a lad was its Battlefleet Gothic spin-off (which none of my friends were interested in, so when I say "playing", I mean that I sat in a room staring glumly at some unpainted Lunar-class Cruisers while other kids went out and climbed trees). The framing I'm working with instead, based on an hour of hands-off Rogue Trader gameplay, is that it's sort of Warhammer Mass Effect, but with XCOM-style turn- and grid-based combat, and while there are opportunities to be a compassionate hero, you fundamentally only have the option of playing Renegade. Let's dig in!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The animated film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has garnered critical acclaim since its release in theaters last month. As fans know, the best way to follow up a good TMNT project is to make a video game out of it, and that’s exactly what's happening next year. 
Publisher Outright Games, along with Paramount and Nickelodeon, have announced a new untitled TMNT game in development set within the Mutant Mayhem universe. It will feature the same striking visual design and follows a new story set months after the movie's events. There’s no word yet on if the film’s ensemble cast will reprise their roles.
In terms of gameplay, a press release only hints that the project involves “combining energetic ninja teamwork gameplay with a humorous narrative, players will take control of the Turtles as they interact with a host of memorable characters from the franchise and fight to save this stylized take on New York City from a new mutant threat.” Outright Games has experience working on games based on kid-friendly licenses, making titles based on Star Trek: Prodigy, How to Train Your Dragon, Paw Patrol, and Peppa Pig. 
The TMNT: Mutant Mayhem game is targeting PC and consoles. It’s the latest project in what’s been quite a renaissance for the Turtles, especially in video games. The resurgence kicked off with last year’s well-received TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, which recently got a big new expansion. The Cowabunga Collection bundled nearly every classic TMNT game into one package for a modern audience. A single-player action game based on the beloved TMNT: The Last Ronin graphic novel is also in the works.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Tilting Point has revealed Cypher 007, a new top-down action game starring James Bond, coming to Apple Arcade on iOS devices later this month. It launches on September 29 and takes players into "The Mind Trap." 
Because it's an Apple Arcade game, it will require a subscription. But after subscribing, the game is technically free-to-play and will feature zero microtransactions, like all Apple Arcade games. In it, you'll be able to unlock new gadgets and weapons, build resources, collect outfits and new character models from across the franchise, and more. 
Check out the Cypher 007 teaser trailer for yourself below: 


"The criminal mastermind Blofeld and head of Spectre has once again hatched a plan to sabotage his archenemy James Bond," the game's description reads. "This time, he has utilized brainwashing techniques known as 'The Mind Trap,' holding Bond captive in a mental prison in an attempt to turn him into the ultimate double agent. Play as Agent 007 on his most challenging missions yet – escape the Mind Trap, defeat Blofeld, and put an end to the Cypher program." 
Because it's a 007 game, you'll run into other MI6 operatives like Q, M, and Moneypenny, all while completing levels that increase in difficulty as you progress. You can compete against other players, too. 

Cypher 007 hits Apple Arcade later this month on September 29.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never got round to playing Shiro's 4X-plus-RTS adaptation of Dune, but chuckling spice baron Nic Reuben deemed it "intricate", "polished" and "well-considered" in his early access review last year, and I trust his nose for these things. The game now has a 1.0 release date - 14th September 2023 - which will also bring a sixth major content update featuring the politically adept House Ecaz faction - who, if the press release speaks true, "wield power like a paint brush". You love to see it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between great reviews – you can read Game Informer’s right here – and excellent sales that led to Nintendo having a record-breaking quarter, there’s no question The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a success for Nintendo. Despite that success, though, it seems the company is moving on from this Hyrule as Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma has revealed there will be no DLC for the game. 
That’s what he told Japanese magazine Famitsu in a new interview, as translated by Genki_JPN on Twitter. Based on his comments, the team behind TOTK might be moving on to a new Zelda game in a new Hyrule, too. 


“We have no plans to release additional content this time, but that is because we feel like we have done all we can do to create play in that world,” Aonuma told Famitsu, according to Genki. “This …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lightyear Frontier is not the kind of game that fits neatly into a 30-minute Gamescom demo. There's so much to see and do in this laidback farming mech sim that by the time my demo ends, I barely feel like I've scratched the surface of it (and that's even with the assistance of some handy secret dev cheats to show me some of the structures and features they've got planned later on in the game). Rather, this is a game that's designed to unfurl slowly, bit by bit, over the course of several hours, and before we begin, developer Frame Break's CEO Joakim Hedström tells me they've shortened the game's opening sequence for this particular demo, just so they can get players right into the thick of things as quickly as possible. 
But even on this whistlestop tour, there's plenty to dig into and delight in here - not least its gloriously bright and inviting colour palette (take that, Todd). I got to sample its farming, its wonderfully weighty mech exploration, and even indulge in a little bit of, well, powerwashing. Yep, PowerWash Simulator's influence was well and truly felt at this year's Gamescom, and I'm so very here for it.

And if you were planning to get it through PC Game Pass, that's another issue, as Game Pass games are locked down behind the fully Deck-incompatible Universal Windows Platform system. If the wonder of space depends on the it being a borderless infinity realm of endless possibilities, nobody told Microsoft.
There is a way, however, to sidestep both problems. Xbox Cloud Gaming will let you play Starfield on the Steam Deck at a steady (enough) 30fps, by streaming the game from Microsoft's cloud network direct to your screen - no Proton GE or Lutris launcher required. It still takes some setting up, but luckily, you’ve already clicked onto a step-by-step guide on how to do it.

Do you yearn for the older, simpler days before the great Unrealification and the invention of sex scenes, when people called a spike pit a spike pit, and you could count all the different colours in a screenshot on your fingers? Do you, in fact, reject this framing of retro-styled 2D pixelart games as "older" and "simpler", regarding it as condescending and false? Look, shut up already.

A large portion of '90s kids look back on Rugrats with great fondness. As one of the defining cartoons of both the decade and the network of Nickelodeon, Rugrats spawned its fair share of licensed video games, but last week's announcement of a new one still came as a shock. That game, Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland, doesn't just feature retro sensibilities – it's an actual all-new retro game built in 2023. Though the first Rugrats video game didn't release until the late '90s, Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland gives you the full retro experience, paying homage…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ring the bell, everybody, it's time for another round of game developers telling players that they don't really understand what a "game engine" is. The spark this time is little-known science fiction adventure Starfield, which I believe we've reported on before. The game has a few obvious foibles - in my experience as a space pirate, NPCs sometimes struggle to navigate their surroundings, and then there are those stark disconnects between planetary surfaces and orbital space. Hiccups such as these have led a few players to wonder whether the game might work better using different technology, and in particular, the newer versions of Epic's ubiquitous Unreal Engine. Isn't Bethesda's proprietary Creation Engine, which the company have been updating since 2011, getting a little long in the tooth?
You'll find a lot of the discussion below this post from Digital Foundry boffin John Linneman on Twxter, which has attracted both gloating PlayStation fans (remember, Starfield is Xbox-only in console land) and a number of thoughtful replies from some fairly senior game developers. This conversation goes back a fair way, of course - people have been ragging on Bethesda for using "the same engine" for years. And there's a definite air of world-weariness to some of the developer responses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The upcoming reimagining of Alone in the Dark is skipping Halloween this year. Instead of inviting players back to Derceto on October 25, the survival horror adventure will now arrive on January 16.
In a press release, developer Pieces Interactive offers a candid explanation for the move: it doesn’t want the game to compete with October’s heavy hitters like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and another big horror game, Alan Wake 2. 
“Our intention is to avoid competing with the wake of Alan's epic release and to evade the dazzling skyline of cities adorned by the graceful swings of Spider-Man," Pieces writes. "We aim to truly remain as Alone in the Dark as possible. To honor this, the spine-chilling horror game has been rescheduled to unveil its horrors on January 16th, 2024. This extension will serve a dual purpose: not only will it permit us to meticulously perfect the gaming experience, but it will also grant us the opportunity to fully immerse ourselves in the remarkable releases of October.”
The studio also released a new trailer starring David Harbour’s Edward Carnby, one of the game’s protagonists, showing off his performance and impressive facial capture. 


Alone in the Dark is a modernized revamp of the 1992 survival horror classic that stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour as protagonists Emily Hartwood and detective Edward Carnby, respectively. Players control one character to explore the haunted Derceto hospital to solve a sinister mystery, with both scenarios offering different story threads and moments. You can read our full preview of the game here. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

All three bundles will be released on October 6. 
The Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle includes a standard Switch console, a digital version of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and a three-month individual membership for Nintendo Switch Online. You can check it out in the image below: 
As for the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch Lite consoles, there’s Isabelle’s Aloha Edition, which is a pink Switch Lite with Animal Crossing leaves on the back of the console, and Tommy’s Aloha Edition, which is a teal Switch Lite with the same leaf details on the back of the handheld console. Both bundles will cost $199.99 and include a digital copy of Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The Isabelle edition is exclusive to Target and the Tommy edition is exclusive to Walmart. 
You can check out both bundles in the gallery below: 

These three bundles come just days after Nintendo announced a new Mario Red Switch OLED console, which will cost $349.99 and releases on October 6 as well. Nintendo revealed this console during its Nintendo Direct for Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which we went hands-on with to preview.

This is important because ScummVM currently supports only the Macintosh versions of these games. These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports. Now, thanks to the folks from ZOOM-Platform, you can easily obtain these game variants.

In the 22 years since Shenmue’s debut, I’ve played the game 23 times. Twenty-three times I’ve lived the life of protagonist Ryo Hazuki, watched his father die, and navigated his world and experiences. Each time I’ve realized something new about the game, the people who made it, or something new about myself.
Playthrough 23 was the most poignant of them all. I saw, noticed, and felt things I hadn’t in any other, and it’s given me a new appreciation for Yu Suzuki and Sega’s AM2 development team.
More than anything else, Shenmue is a video game about how a real person in a real world inhabited by other real people experiences the death of a loved one and the loneliness that follows.

I’d spent the first few minutes referring to it as a sequel, but he clarifies, "It’s not Hyper Light Drifter 2. It’s a follow-up, meaning that it’s an installment in the franchise of Hyper Light. So it’s a different game, different protagonists, different gameplay." After getting the chance to learn more about the game and see it in action, this distinction makes a lot of sense. For me to call it a sequel was misleading, given how different the games look and play.
Breaker is a 3D rogue-lite with a strong emphasis on multiplayer. Players explore an area called the Overgrowth, collect weapons and gear, and fight off monsters. And though the…]]></summary>

Retro love letters are a dime a dozen these days. From titles that veer too close to the source material to games that take the kernel of an earlier game's original concept and expand it into previously unforeseen realms, nostalgic experiences are everywhere in the games industry. Yacht Club Games emerged as an early leader of this trend with its smash hit Shovel Knight, which took the 2D action-platformer genre and gave it several fun twists despite keeping the core gameplay and visual styles faithful to the 8-bit graphics with which many of us grew up.

Nonetheless, Fisher was once the lead of a game momentous enough to compete for sales with Halo, have Hideo Kojima’s Metal Gear Solid team taking notes, and find itself referenced as the graphical and technical benchmark of the early Xbox years.
