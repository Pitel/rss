Disney's Mickey Mouse made a return earlier this year in the magnificent 2D platformer Disney Illusion Island. Now, in an update, Disney Games and Dlala Studios have announced they'll be releasing special new content that's entirely free for owners of the game.

Only this time, it’s on motorized bikes. Then you see it, and you realize Cool Riders is one of the least cool games to exist.


Let me back up a sec here. Cool Riders is absolutely one of the best retro games I’ve been introduced to this year. It’s a year where I feel something finally snapped in my head, and I’ve come to legitimately enjoy a lot of kusoge. But the thing about Cool Riders is that it certainly looks like kusoge, but it doesn’t play like it. 


It’s sort of a Street Fighter: The Movie: The Game situation. While the game’s graphics give you that whiff of kusoge, the mere fact that it’s built on the bones of a better game means that…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're looking for a more constructive way to deal with a ruined wasteland, Terra Nil now has a date for Nintendo Switch. Devolver Digital is bringing the eco-strategy game from developer Free Lives (BroForce) to Nintendo's platform on December 18.


Terra Nil previously made the rounds on PC, iOS, and Android (via Netflix) back in March. Devolver Digital shared a quick trailer to go along with the Switch news.




In Terra Nil, players are tasked with doing the opposite of what your average city- or world-builder requires. Rather than constant growth and expansion, you have to take a ruined world, breathe life back into it, and make like a tree and leave. This results in a short and sweet experience that brings something new to the table with a side of some much-needed optimism. 


During your time with Terra Nil you'll encounter a few different biomes, each of which is procedurally generated. You'll assist with ruined cities, volcanic glaciers, and more, including alternate levels that act as unlockables. There's something innately serene about helping the world start over again, and it's fitting that you'll ultimately leave it all to thrive on its own as if you were never there in the first place. 


At the time of this writing, the reverse city builder is just due out digitally via the Nintendo eShop. If you're looking to take some time to wind down and bring a lifeless world back from the brink, this is the best way to reclaim the wasteland.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To this day, I love getting together with my buddies and having a jam session in Rock Band 4. So when Epic Games announced Fortnite Festival, I was hyped. But upon finding out there wasn't support for our plastic guitars and drums, not so much.


Luckily, Epic Games knows that there are plenty of would-be rockers out there just waiting to jam out in a new way. And the publisher confirmed that for the dozens of us, implementing peripheral support is a "priority."




Within a Q&A style posting on the Fortnite website, the development team addressed several topics. When asked "Does Fortnite Festival support instrument controllers?" the development confirmed that compatibility isn't available at launch. However, the team stated "it's a priority for the team and currently under development. We'll have more to share in 2024."


Epic Games purchased Harmonix (the developers of the Rock Band series and several of the original Guitar Hero games) in November 2021. Fortnite Festival appears to be the lovechild of that marriage.


Harmonix was still an independent studio when they released Rock Band 4 in 2015. At the time, they partnered with Mad Catz to manufacture a fresh set of instruments for the series' fourth installment. But production on those instruments ceased years ago, and now they're very hard to find in the wild or extremely expensive to purchase used online.


Now that Harmonix is backed by a financial juggernaut like Epic Games, the big question is whether the publisher will manufacture a new set of peripherals to sell to fans. Otherwise, anyone who wants to purchase a second-hand guitar, drum set, or keyboard is likely to have to spend a pretty penny.

Fntastic took to Twitter to formally declare what some folks may have already seen coming. The studio behind The Day Before writes that the game "has failed financially," and that it "lacks the funds" to keep the rapidly sinking ship afloat. Fntastic claims in the note that it will use the income received from game sales to pay off debts to its partners.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["It's sad to say goodbye like this".
Without even an official announcement, it looks like Embracer Group has shut down UK game studio Free Radical Design, the team behind the TimeSplitters series of video games.
Staff at the Nottingham-based developer have been sharing their thoughts, goodbyes, and happy memories on Twitter (spotted via Game Informer), while a number of those have also shared "looking for work" updates on LinkedIn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The release of the third installment in the indie action-adventure horror title Poppy Playtime is now set for 2024. Originally scheduled for this month, developer Mob Entertainment took to Twitter to announce the delay. According to the developers, Chapter 3 simply isn't ready yet and needs a few extra weeks to reach the quality they are striving for.




No one likes delays, especially when you're this close to the scheduled release date. However, a brief delay of weeks is certainly understandable, especially if the game just isn't ready yet! Besides, for a single-player experience-focused journey like Poppy Playtime Chapter 3, it's very important for it to be at the quality you are looking for right out of the gate.


To help tide us over until the new year, Mob Entertainment also dropped the first gameplay trailer for Chapter 3, titled Deep Sleep. It looks like the biggest and most intense version of Poppy Playtime yet, so I'm here for it when it's ready.




Poppy Playtime Chapter 3 will release in early 2024 on PC and mobile devices.

LEGO Fortnite — a new game that's available inside of Fortnite — has been dominating online conversation since it dropped last week on all consoles. But former senior designer at Epic Games, Cristina Ramos, says that one key piece of game design was rejected for being "too hardcore". (thanks, Nintenduo!)
Ramos, who is now with Blasphemous studio The Game Kitchen, shared her thoughts on Twitter regarding the new mode in Fortnite. But what mechanic could be too hardcore for the hugely popular battle royal? Well, according to Ramos, it's Z-targeting — the very thing that was pioneered by 1998's The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A feather in your cap.
Turok first appeared in 1954 in Dell Comics, an American publisher notable for World War II-themed fiction and Warner Brothers licenses. Back then, Turok, dubbed Son of Stone, was indeed a dinosaur hunter, using wit and muscle to overcome a clashing of the species. In 1992, Valiant Comics rebooted Turok with more of a sci-fi lean, which is where the original Nintendo 64 games drew inspiration for their characteristic blend of futuristic elements. For American publisher Acclaim, 1997’s Turok on the Nintendo 64 was a certified hit. Even with its terrible draw distance, concealed by a prominent fog effect that limited your vision to mere meters, it was undeniably well-made, highly atmospheric, and full of clever implementations.
Fast forward to the end of the Nintendo 64’s life and the mainline series came to a conclusion in 2000's Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion. Nightdive Studios, now the go-to for classic FPS restorations, has finally closed the circle four years after its Turok 2 remaster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first it was a rumor, then it was news, and now it’s a reality. The recently revived Free Radical appears to have closed down today, another loss in Embracer Group’s ongoing campaign of shutdowns and layoffs.


While the original iteration of Free Radical filed for bankruptcy in 2008, it was partially revived as Crytek UK and later Dambuster Studios. However, in 2021, Embracer Group rounded up much of the key staff from the pre-bankruptcy days – including Steve Ellis and David Doak – and re-established Free Radical to work on reviving the TimeSplitters series. Now, before we even see any fruits from their labor, they’ve been shut down again.


As of now, Free Radical’s former webpage shows a very particular 404 message. Rather than a simple “Page not found,” it instead displays “404 Company Not Found :-(.” Meanwhile, artists Mark Normington and Adam Kiraly have said farewell to the company on Twitter.




The sheer amount of layoffs this year has made it difficult to be enthusiastic about the industry. For me, the loss of Free Radical hits pretty hard. I can still remember the day a friend of mine introduced me to TimeSplitters 2 on GameCube. We marveled at the level of detail and ate up the cooperative campaign. Later, in college, my group of friends would gather around Timesplitters: Future Perfect to cook up the strangest game modes. One particular hit was turning on one-hit kills and setting all the weapons to bricks and bats.


Embracer Group chose to expand rapidly during the Coronavirus pandemic and is now quickly contracting as the industry and the market as a whole seem to be contracting in terms of investment. As a result, Embracer Group has cut more than 900 jobs, with more reportedly forthcoming. This is during a year that has been exhaustingly rife with job losses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden is a game of twos. It has two protagonists and two broad ways of playing, leading to two broad narrative outcomes, and is created by a company who, as Don’t Nod’s lead narrative designer Elise Galmard explained to me at a preview event, feel like they make games for two different audiences - fans of noodly narrative intrigues on the one hand, and of fantasy combat games on the other. Among the game's challenges, of course, is to blend these halves convincingly.
A spiritual (hah) follow-up of sorts to 2018’s fairly well-received Vampyr, it takes place in the alt-historical realm of New Eden, which is kind of 17th century colonial North America through the lens of Dragon Age: Inquisition with a pinch of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. The titular Banishers are a ghost-hunting couple, the Scotsman Red MacRaith and the Cuban Antea Duarte. Antea is killed at the very beginning of the game, during a battle with an especially noxious spook, but she soon returns as a spirit, and your overall story objective is to either resurrect her body or help her "Ascend" to the afterlife.

Perhaps it's unsurprising then that a major German PC retailer recorded the 7800X3D as massively outselling any other processor on the market as of late. 
As of today, the best prices available in the UK and US are at Overclockers (£330) and Amazon ($358). Both retailers offer the CPU with a free copy of the truly stunning Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora game.

We'll admit it, we are more than a little excited to see what SEGA is cooking up. During last week's Game Awards, the studio announced that it would be reimaging and expanding on a bunch of its fan-favourite franchises, with Jet Set Radio being but one of the series to receive the 'surge' treatment.
The amount that we actually know about the project is reasonably small at the moment, but one thing that has been confirmed is that the game's original creators are skating back around to be involved in the next one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you thought people were done playing or modding Half-Life, think again. With the game recently celebrating its 25th anniversary, Valve's FPS is enjoying a bit more time in the limelight. To ago along with that, the community is working on a way to challenge players.


Over on ModDB, user jonnymartini is in the midst of looking for volunteers. The project, which is in the early stages of development, will add a few changes to the original Half-Life. For example, there are plans to introduce a new story element. In this scenario, Gordon will miss the train that takes him to Black Mesa at the start.

This will change things up, but will also allow for some other areas to be re-explored, such as from the training section or the Decay expansion.


Give 'em hell, Gordon!


But that's not all. The mod will be introducing new challenge modes to really test Gordon Freeman's might and gumption. There are five that have been outlined:



Crowbar only


Glock only


1HP only


Realistic mode (which will add realistic injuries, weapon classes, and more)


Permadeath.



Whether there'll be more challenges added cannot be said at this stage, but as I say, it's still early days. Currently, there's no release date for the mod, so you'll need to keep an eye on the download page for updates.


Hailed as one of the greatest FPS releases in gaming history, Half-Life has stood the test of time. Its environmental story aspects, seamless level transitions, and mute yet intriguing protagonist made Valve's maiden title stand out at a time when the genre was still finding its feet.

To celebrate the occasion, John Carmack and John Romero – both of whom played a pivotal role in the game's development – reflect on their time spent working on Doom. As you can imagine, it holds a lot of fond memories for the pair, who some have described as gaming's equivalent of Lennon and McCartney.

The Turbografx-16 is a nightmare to collect for. Sketchy capacitors mean that a lot of them just die on the shelf, and the typical price of a Turbografx game is ridiculous. Pricecharting has the average price of a game for the console at over $100. Forget the best games the console has to offer; if you want anything aside from sports titles, you’re paying out the nose. And that’s not even taking into account Turbografx-CD games.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues to pave a new path for the Zelda franchise, building on the gorgeous open-world formula that Nintendo introduced Link to in Breath of the Wild. But while these games have received critical acclaim, some fans desperately miss the "old-style" of Zelda — the more "linear" games.
Well, Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma is aware of that, and in an interview with IGN, he has a rather interesting response. Acknowledging that Tears of the Kingdom has taken the series in a different direction, Aonuma puts fans' desires partially down to nostalgia, but also on wanting "the thing that we don't currently have".

Following on from the success of the Ace Attorney Trilogy, which brought the first three games in the beloved series to Switch, PC, and other consoles, Capcom has taken the next three games (Apollo Justice, Dual Destinies, and Spirit of Justice) and bundled them once more into a meaty trilogy – but with a focus on greenhorn lawyer Apollo Justice, rather than Phoenix Wright.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In just over a month's time, the entire mainline Ace Attorney series will finally be playable on PC with the arrival of the Apollo Justice Trilogy. Launching on January 25th 2024, this collection bundles together the fourth, fifth and sixth games in Capcom's excellent lawyer 'em up - Apollo Justice, Dual Destinies and Spirit Of Justice - which originally launched on the Nintendo DS and 3DS across a ten year period between 2007 and 2016. It's been funny revisiting the earlier cases of these games after so much time has passed. Apollo's name may be the one on the box, but the series' original cover star Phoenix Wright is never far from the front lines - not only does he get tangled up on the wrong side of the law in Apollo's own debut outing, but he's back as a full-time defence attorney on the (w)right side of the legal bench in the other two. 
At the time, poor old Apollo always felt like he got the short end of the stick as Capcom tried to figure out what to do with the series, and to some extent, he still does - for he never quite gets out from under Phoenix's shadow to completely hold court on his own two feet. But now, after 2021's excellent Great Ace Attorney Chronicles proved that neither time, setting or its lead defence need to be set in stone for the series to carry on, the pressure does feel ever so slightly less intense on a second visit. There's no denying Apollo still has a bit of an uphill climb on his hands, but if, like me, you've been waiting for these games to be freed from their Nintendo-bound prison, this is arguably the best glow-up Capcom's done to the series to date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of right now, the official GTA 6 trailer has been watched on YouTube more than 140 million times. It's become one of the most-watched video game announcements of all time. Given that, it was inevitable that some would want a piece of that success by recreating their own versions.


As spotted by PCGamesN, Instagram user evilgame_ytb has put their personal spin on the GTA 6 teaser by giving it the Minecraft treatment. The reel uploaded to their profile shows the blocky recreation of Rockstar's trailer, complete with the Tom Petty soundtrack.




In fact, if you search "GTA 6 trailer in Minecraft" on YouTube, you'll see more than one example. Here's one from Alex & Steve Animation. It's not a shot-for-shot remake, but it's got wide shots of the beach and even features some of the dialogue audio. Of course, Petty crops up again to really sell the illusion.


And one done in Los Santos


Other games have been used for a different take on the trailer. Here's one from the channel GTA BELGIUM (as noted by DSO Gaming), which recreates GTA 6 in GTA 5. It even opens with a joke by playing the opening to Genesis' "That's All" track before a record scratch and then Tom Petty kicks in.


It follows the same vibe as the official trailer: a glimpse at some of the main characters, establishing shots of the beach and surrounding city life. Except it's in Grand Theft Auto 5. Then it ends with another joke, insinuating there's an "expanded and enhanced" version of the game coming to "PlayStation 6" in 2030.


All we're missing now is a Skyrim remix. Or maybe one done in Garry's Mod.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article is written in partnership with MicroProse.


Despite the name, piracy is entirely optional in Rise of Piracy. You can trade commodities and.. oh, who are we kidding? There’s no way we’re not going full Jolly Roger with this open-world action-adventure RTS, coming to PC. 


From Spideog Studios and Microprose (who also published the classic Sid Meier’s Pirates), Rise of Piracy invites you on a grand adventure on the high seas, as you work your way up from a lone ship to a vast pirate armada. 


Its huge, open world is set to be anything but dull. You can forge alliances and even become a privateer for one or more of Rise’s powerful factions. Is the potential profit worth risking your standing with the others? That’s for you to decide though, even without your intervention, they’ll still wage war on each other. And if you have chosen to eschew piracy, that’ll lead to blocked trade routes and a host of other problems. 


Rise of Piracy sports a massive world, with around 140 hand-crafted islands, spread across 9 different biomes. Thanks to its dynamic difficulty, even the mightiest pirate won’t be short on challenge. And if your fleet becomes truly, ridiculously formidable, you have the option to take on monsters and skeletons.


The bigger your armada, the grander your exploits will be. Rise even lets you specialize ships, tailoring them to your short and long-term goals. Want to storm a faction’s capital, claiming it as your own? Load up some troop transports, then team them with enough frigates to ensure they reach their destination.


With huge fleet-to-fleet battles and an optional PvP mode, it promises to be a treat for anyone with a taste for life on the high seas. Don’t let Rise of Piracy sail off into the horizon, wishlist it on Steam here. Your parrot will thank you for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Shadowverse series is getting ready to expand with a new game for mobile devices and PC. Cygames announced Shadowverse: Worlds Beyond as a free-to-play card battler, with a summer 2024 release planned for iOS, Android, and PC.


In the announcement overview, Cygames noted that "international language support" is planned for the new Shadowverse. While the competitive online collectible card game will be free to play, there will naturally be optional in-app purchases, so we'll see how that balances out when it launches. 


Check out the first look at the direct sequel to Shadowverse: 




Players will be able to move around the world with custom avatars, interacting and battling with others they run into along the way. According to the footage, you'll also be able to kick a giant soccer ball around, play Mahjong, and fish, among other activities. There are also events and "other content" in the works, with more details to come on everything at a later date. The battles themselves promise fresh features like super evolution and new amulet abilities. 


Tournaments are already planned for 2024, including the RAGE Shadowverse Pro Tour and both in-store and online tournaments in Japan. For overseas players, there will be the Shadowverse NetEase Championship, Shadowverse Korea Open, Shadowverse Taiwan Open, and Shadowverse Open West/SEAO. There's also a Shadowverse World Championship scheduled for early 2025, with 10 million yen and a special Shadowverse: Evolve card up for grabs. Various slots are available for qualifying through the other tournaments in Japan and other regions.

I badly need Crawford's thoughts on Emberstorm Entertainment's Reka, published by Fireshine Games, which has just been slapped with a Steam early access release window of Q2 2024.
In this curious, moody survival-ish adventure, you're an apprentice witch who travels about the land in a chicken-legged cottage loaned out by your mentor, the Baba Jaga. The cottage isn't just mobile - you can expand it with second-floor extensions and decorate the interior with jaunty wooden furniture. Sadly, there doesn't appear to be an option to employ gingerbread during construction, nor can you currently fly about on broomstick, but perhaps all that'll be added on the road to 1.0. Here's the latest trailer.

The Maw tends to be at low ebb over the Xmas period, because it has a violent allergy to festive cheer. But for the moment, it still clamours for News.


Some game releases we're pondering this week: squad-based RTS Stargate: Timekeepers (12th Dec), Settlers spiritual follow-up Pioneers of Pagonia (13th Dec, early access), anime chainsaw metroidvania Cookie Cutter (14th Dec), "pixel pulp" visual novel Bahnsen Knights (14th Dec), and multiversal metroidvania Trinity Fusion (15th Dec).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original DOOM is 30 years old now. That means it has been a little over thirty years since Nintendo turned down Id's offer to port their games to the PC and began a chain reaction that would result in Carmack, Romero, and co. creating the FPS genre. Thanks, Nintendo! 


I should also thank John Romero since the co-creator and level designer of the original DOOM has just released SIGIL II, an all-new unofficial DOOM campaign completely free of charge. I still haven't had the time to experience the sequel, but, if it is anything like the original SIGIL, chances are that any DOOM fan will enjoy it quite a bit. It's a treat to all fans of the original game, but it also adds a lot of new flavor that even newer players are bound to enjoy.

SIGIL II, unofficial DOOM 2 episode, is available now


SIGIL II acts as a new episode in a series, meaning that it features actual story beats. It also features nine new levels, eight new multiplayer arenas, a new OST composed by James Paddock, and new art.


On top of this new release, Romero will also be hosting a live Twitch event today, where he will be joining DOOM's other John co-creator, John Carmack, to discuss the original game. 




It's great to see that DOOM has survived for so long, and not just because of the latest games in the series. The older games are very much alive as well. Just this year, we also saw the release of one of the greatest mods of all time. I'm of course talking about Myhouse.WAD for DOOM II, which I'm just gonna recommend you try getting into fully blind.


If you own the original DOOM, you can now download SIGIL and SIGIL II for free, or buy their incredibly rad old-school big box versions here.

The entire game is pretty much modeled after what you already experienced in the acclaimed 2017 title, and yet we couldn’t begin to list all the fun elements they built upon to turn Tears of the Kingdom into another sensational hit.

Howdy folks, and welcome back to another edition of Box Art Brawl.
Before we get cracking with this week's battle, let's take a look at how we got on last time, hm? Well, it was Batman: Vengeance's turn to kick up a storm, with the European and North American variants of the GBA game going head-to-head in a duel for the ages. It was remarkably close, too, but ultimately the North American version managed to take home the trophy with 52% of the vote.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“When people read anything, no matter the source, they will believe it.” So says Doom designer John Romero on the subject of his relationship with John Carmack. Together, the pair built id Software and the FPS genre as we know it - before the cracks started to show during the difficult development of Quake, ending their professional partnership.
Yet any lasting acrimony has now dissipated. That became apparent when Romero’s new autobiography, ‘Doom Guy: Life In First Person’, showed up on shelves with a glowing back cover quote from Carmack. The latter praised Romero’s “remarkable memory”, and waxed wistfully about their shared impact on the gaming medium. “For years, I thought that I had been born too late and missed out on participating in the heroic eras of computing,” Carmack wrote. “Only much later did I realise that Romero and I were at the nexus of a new era - the 3D game hackers.”

        <updated>2023-12-09T18:37:53.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forget The Walking Dead; now it's The Playing Dead, as The Walking Dead: Betrayal is being pulled from Steam and offering a refund.


The game's being pulled after Skybound Games and Other Ocean Interactive were "not able to find a path to build the spirited community of backstabbers we originally envisioned," the developers said in a blog shared to the game's Steam page. 


The game, which has been available in Early Access since September, never received a full release. It's the second stumble for the otherwise popular Walking Dead franchise this year. The Walking Dead: Destinies, which was released earlier in December, was the subject of minor controversy surrounding its graphics.




What was The Walking Dead: Betrayal?


Announced at San Diego Comic-Con 2023, The Walking Dead Betrayal was a social deduction game that blended elements of The Walking Dead and Among Us. 


Players would work together in teams of Survivors to escape hordes of walkers. However, the social element came into play via "Traitors," Survivors whose goal is to sabotage the team for their own success. 


As of the announcement of its closure, the game sits at a "mixed" rating on Steam, across a meager 111 reviews. Many reviews regard the game as fine, though several lament the waning player base. Others draw attention to the similarities to Other Ocean's previous game, Project Winter, which had a similar gameplay loop.


How to get a refund for The Walking Dead: Betrayal


For players who purchased the game through Steam, getting a refund for The Walking Dead: Betrayal is as simple as requesting one through Steam. 


Users who purchased the game through a retailer will need to contact that retailer. More information is available on the game's store page.

This review originally went live in 2016, and we're updating and republishing it to celebrate the game's arrival in Switch's N64 library via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.

Originally released for the Nintendo 64 in 1998, 1080° Snowboarding was Nintendo's attempt to bring the snowboarding experience to its home console. And the company did a good job: six courses provide a variety of thrills as you hop on a board and tackle the snowy slopes. There are five riders of varying abilities, several boards are available to ride on, and there's the ability to perform some fancy-looking tricks, too. And it still holds up decently all these years later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers may know me as one of Destructoid's local Destiny heads, but right now, we need to talk about the Video Game Awards (VGA). Namely, how Cyberpunk 2077 stole a 2023 award from another game and studio.


On December 7, the VGA named Cyberpunk 2077 the winner of the ceremony's Best Ongoing Game award. This was in spite of the fact that Cyberpunk went up against actual live service titles like Apex Legends, Fortnite, Genshin Impact, and Final Fantasy XIV. 


As some may remember, Cyberpunk 2077 is not an "ongoing game." It's a single-player game and one that was released with disastrous initial results. The launch was so awash with issues that Sony would even quickly remove it from the PSN digital storefront. CD Projekt RED would go on to spend the better part of three years fixing the …]]></summary>

If you have even a passing interest in video games (and we assume that you do, since you have found yourselves here), then you probably will have heard of Did You Know Gaming? Since its launch in 2012, the trivia-focused website and YouTube channel has amassed a huge following, showcasing little-known facts and uncovering lost games that never saw the light of day. Now, the team is turning its attention towards another type of project altogether: a tabletop card game.
Do You Know Gaming?, a collaboration between the DYKG team and Lost in Cult, is a dungeon-crawling trivia game with a 1980s 'big box' feel. On a basic level, the card game lets you choose a character — each of whom has their own special abilities such as health bonuses, increased inventory space etc. — and set out on a quest to collect four Relics. Along the way, you'll encounter monsters who can be damaged by answering gaming trivia questions of varying difficulty, collect loot and take on final bosses. If it sounds like a video game in card form, that's because it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Considering that Capcom was ruling the fighting game roost in 1993, Saturday Night Slam Masters is such a low-key production. Street Fighter 2 blended together with a wrestling game sounds like such an amazing concept, but that’s absolutely not what Saturday Night Slam Masters is.


And that’s really weird, considering that one of the grapplers, Gunloc, has a bio that suggests he is related to a famous street fighter while Chun Li appears in the audience. Yet, despite the references that imply it exists in the same universe as Street Fighter 2, Saturday Night Slam Masters is pretty much just a wrestling game. It’s not even a particularly outstanding wrestling game, but it’s still one of my favorite arcade games of all time.


Why?

Oh, right, this news broke during The Game Awards.


Well, even if you’re feeling tired from a marathon of game trailers and celebrity appearances, these classic games are still well worth checking out. Also, the trailer for the update features more than a few seconds of gameplay from each game, unlike most of what we saw during The Game Awards. Oh, did I just say that out loud!

"Along the way, we lost quite a few people also, so we want to dedicate this to all the people that we lost," Vincke said, specifically citing lead cinematic artist Jim Southworth, who died last month.


It was a touching moment, the kind that sticks with you from an awards show like this. And at the time, the prompter visible to speech winners displayed "Please wrap it up."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GRYPHLINE has revealed that the next chapter in the Arknights series will soon make its console debut. A PlayStation 5 version of Arknights: Endfield has been announced, alongside an upcoming technical test for the PC version of the game.


Arknights: Endfield is an RPG that aims to deliver a blend Arknight's signature strategy with real-time combat. In a new trailer shown during The Game Awards, we can see the combat system in action alongside our first glance at the game's boss battles. As of writing, GRYPHLINE has not announced a date for the PS5, PC, or mobile versions of the game. However, players can sign up now for the PC technical test that will begin on January 11.




The PC technical test will have an English user interface and both Mandarin and Japanese voiceover options. The test puts you in the role of the Endministrator of Endfield Industries, who is rumored to show up whenever a crisis hits the company or the wider world of Talos-II. You'll get a chance to explore that world while leading a crew of nine playable characters, exploring the Endfield Industries tech tree, and dipping your toes in the battle system. 


The factory system — which lets you place factory buildings strategically and gain an edge in battle with items manufactured through your automated production line — will also be in play during the test period. Through this system you'll be able to directly impact Talos-II by modifying the terrain and surrounding environments. 


Sign-ups will be live until December 23 at 7:59 p.m. PT.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After winning big last night at The Game Awards and bagging trophies in three major categories, Remedy Entertainment has just announced "The Final Draft" for Alan Wake 2; a major update that not only introduces the New Game Plus mode we've been waiting on, but also unlocks an additional ending to the main story.


With all the intricate plot threads and surrealist narrative developments in Alan Wake 2, a few more playthroughs are definitely in order to wrap your head around Sam Lake's acclaimed sequel. And why start from scratch when you can retain all your equipment and instead contend with more challenging mobs?


The studio is teasing numerous "subtle additions" in the New Game Plus experience, including a Nightmare Difficulty setting and even new manuscript pages and videos. There are also bug fixes and performance optimizations, which might help the demanding game run more smoothly on older PC hardware.  The Final Draft is scheduled to go live on December 11.


via Remedy Entertainment


How to unlock the New Game Plus mode in Alan Wake 2


It goes without saying that a completed playthrough of the game is required to unlock the New Game Plus, but it looks like the new additions in The Final Draft will also require you to finish the game at least once.


You retain all your Charms and character upgrades, but the weapons will be found in the character's first available shoebox, as opposed to their inventory.


It's unclear if the new ending can be unlocked during your first playthrough, though with two more expansion packs (Night Springs and The Lake House) coming our way in 2024 and beyond, this probably won't serve as the definitive conclusion to the stories of our main protagonists.

I can't really blame you for being an open-hearted optimist, but must ask: have you never watched The Game Awards before? I have, and this year, despite not having had to stay up until 5am covering it, I'm grumpy enough to point out that we don't actually have to be nice about the great, clomping shiny trainer of marketing in 2023, the year everyone was laid off.

      <p>During The Game Awards, we learned that The Outlast Trials is wrapping up its time in PC early access and is heading to consoles next March. The game was first announced in 2019 and entered Steam Early Access in May.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game is a co-op take on the popular horror series, with up to four players controlling test subjects fighting to survive in a dangerous test facility. Check out its latest trailer below (headphone users beware: it's got a lot of shrieking streamers).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 1.0 launch will include a new Toy Factory trial with new MK challenges. It will also feature new evidence documents, character customization, cell decorations, legendary outfits, an increased level cap, weekly programs, and other quality-of-life improvements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game will be sold alone in a $39.99 Standard Edition and a $49.99 Deluxe Edition that includes the Regent Start Pack, giving players four legendary skins, exclusive cell items, posters, and player icons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Outlast Trials launches on March 5 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

If you're looking for something else, Outer Wilds: Archaeologist Edition is live on Switch. In case you haven't been following along, the Archaeologist Edition is just a fancy "GOTY with DLC" package. It comes with the Echoes of the Eye add-on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Morbidcore" isn't an established subgenre, but it's not hard to imagine what falls into this category. These are games exploring life's darker moments. Not for the sake of simply disturbing an audience, but instead, they’re stories communicating the more unsettling aspects of humanity — the parts we shy away from or refuse to acknowledge.


Grief, depression, trauma, and pain are all prevailing themes in these narratives, and while they don't aim to shock, they inevitably do. Indies aren't the only titles that attempt this, either, though they often do it best. Multimillion-dollar productions from megacorporations should have the budget to explore here, but it's often a one-person team or a small group weaving the tales that are most impactful.

Towards the end of every year, we all get to enjoy (or in our case, give up our evenings and ruin our fingers to the tune of) one of the gaming industry's biggest events. The Game Awards is not only an awards ceremony - it's a lavish smorgasbord of video game announcements, trailers, and news stretching into the early hours of the morning. At least for us Brits.

      <p>Mecha Break is an new multiplayer co-op mech game by Seasun Games that premiered during The Game Awards tonight. Fans of games like Armored Core VI and Zone of the Enders may want to keep it on their radar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game puts you in the cockpit of a variety of mech suits, which you can customize the look and weapons of, to take on other players across a variety of modes. The biggest battlefield is a 48-player battle royale. If you’d rather play alongside friends, a co-op option allows three-to-six players to team up to complete specialized missions. Other destinations include a 3v3 arena mode and a 6v6 battlefield mode. See the game in action below.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Upcoming RTS from developer Frost Giant Studios is set to release in Early Access in the Summer of 2024. The PC-exclusive title had its release date revealed alongside a brief gameplay trailer at The Game Awards. Frost Giant Studios first revealed the RTS last year.




The Frost Giant Studios team is made up of RTS developer veterans who have worked on popular titles like Starcraft and Age of Empires. Stormgate will feature an ever-evolving campaign in a science fantasy universe as well as 3-player co-op vs AI, 1v1, and 3v3 matches as well as a map editor. Actor Simu-Liu (Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings) also made an appearance to reveal his character in Stormgate, Warz.


I'm so ready for this. Starcraft was a big part of my childhood and while there have been some good RTS since, nothing has quite captured the Starcraft and Warcraft 3 feeling. 


Stormgate will be released in Early Access on PC in 2024.

        <updated>2023-12-08T04:24:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a long night of The Game Awards. Many trailers have been shown for upcoming games, but only one can be the final trailer. Capcom has taken that honor this year by revealing the newest installment in the Monster Hunter series, Monster Hunter Wilds.


As has been a recurring theme during this event, we didn't exactly see a ton of raw gameplay in this trailer. We do, however, see a lot of monsters. Also, some sick mount acrobatics are shown off. And before we know it, a title card is thrown on screen. Clearly this is a teaser just to let us all know this game exists, since that projected date of 2025 is still a ways off from now. Feel free to speculate based on the footage we were shown.




After the trailer, Geoff Keighley brought Monster Hunter series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto to the stage. Despite acknowledging that the game is dated for 2025, Keighley asked Tsujimoto when we might expect to play Monster Hunter Wilds. As one might expect, the answer for when we'll play this video game coming out in 2025 is "2025." However, Tsujimoto clarified that we should expect to learn more about the title during the Summer of 2024.


Monster Hunter Wilds will release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam. This is notable, as the game's predecessor, Monster Hunter Rise, was originally a Nintendo Switch title. The platforms shown indicate that Wilds will be closer in spirit to Monster Hunter World, which will be roughly seven years old by the time Wilds comes out. 


I'm interested to see if games like Monster Hunter Rise on the Switch and Monster Hunter Now on mobile devices drives winds up attracting new audiences to Monster Hunter Wilds once it releases. It's certainly made me pay more attention to the series, so we'll have to see if this strategy pays off when Monster Hunter Wilds debuts two years from now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom have unveiled the next entry in their dinosaur hat/pants/jumper-making sim this evening, and it's called Monster Hunter Wilds. A kick in the dino groin to this year's monster hunting pretender Wild Hearts, perhaps? Who can say. Formally unveiled at tonight's Game Awards, this new Monster Hunter is coming in 2025, and looks to be the jazzed-up successor to Monster Hunter: World. That's not a diss on Rise (which was excellent). Just that it's being developed for PC and consoles first, rather than Switch. And it looks rad as heck. Come and watch the reveal trailer below.

      <p>Despite claiming that it <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive-feature/2023/05/23/final-fantasy-16-there-are-currently-no-plans-for-dlc">had no plans to release DLC</a> for Final Fantasy XVI, Square Enix announced at The Game Awards that Final Fantasy XVI is getting not one but two pieces of DLC. They're called Echoes of the Fallen and Rising Tide, and the former is available to play right now.</p>

<p>Echoes of the Fallen adds new story chapters that takes place before the finale of Final Fantasy XVI. Clive and the gang follow the origins of a mysterious crystal to a strange ruin filled with deadly defenses tied to Eikons and plenty of monsters. Rising Tide is set to launch in Spring 2024 and is a bit more mysterious, but we do see Clive taking on what may be the scariest enemy in all of Final Fantasy: Tonberry King. Oh, and Leviathan pops up too.&nbsp;</p>

Then you might enjoy the just-announced Exoborne, a tactical open world shooter from Sharkmob, the Swedish studio behind Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt. Running on Unreal Engine 5 and set in fictional, near-future Colton County, USA, it's a PvPvE affair in which you roam a big ruined map either alone or as a team, fighting other players, NPCs and renegade "natural" elements. Published by Level Infinite, it'll be a premium game with live service elements and microtransactions, and there's no release date yet. I caught a briefing before today's announcement, and yeah, it looks all right.

In this instalment, you play a once-proud general of the Pell Los Empire, who has been falsely accused of treason and sent into exile. He’s pretty miffed about this! Berserk, even.

Hello have just screened a trailer at this year's Game Awards. Earlier this week, they invited me down to their Guildford offices for a quick, informal chat about the game, which I am going to characterise as Fable meets Microsoft Flight Simulator.

      <p>The First Descendant is a free-to-play looter shooter from Nexon. There have been beta sessions before now, but the game is getting a full, proper launch next Summer. The exact date is up in the air still, but <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2435229">according to a blog post from the developers</a>, it will be announced as soon as they can pin it down. Check out the latest trailer below.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fgwZ-xB4cBk" width="640"></iframe>

<p>In The First Descendant, you play as, you guessed, Descendants – a group of unique characters that each have distinct abilities and movesets. Your goal is to defend the planet from invaders called Colossi using the game's third-person shooting and RPG mechanics. The new trailer gives us a cinematic look at one of those fights, this time showcasing an entirely new Descendant.</p>

<p>There's no gameplay in this trailer, but the team assures fans that they're working to refine said gameplay, based on feedback from the nearly two million players who checked out their last open beta session. The main purpose of that beta was to test crossplay features, which makes sense, since the game is launching on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. Check it out for free when it launches simultaneously on all of those platforms in Summer 2024.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Ten years ago, at Geoff Keighley's awards show (then known as the VGX Awards), the development team at Hello Games revealed No Man's Sky. The ambitious space-exploration title promised a universe of possibilities and has since become the poster child for bouncing back from a challenging launch period.</p>

<p>To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the first teaser trailer, Sean Murray and Hello Games returned to Geoff Keighley's stage, now called The Game Awards, to give a brief retrospective and tease what's next. After a rundown of the last 10 years of active development of No Man's Sky, including several free updates, improvements, and expansions, the trailer teases big plans for 2024, with something that appears to involve more intricate space stations within the game.</p>

<p><strong>Check out the No Man's Sky 10-Year Anniversary Trailer for yourself below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p>No Man's Sky was released in 2016 to mixed reviews but received myriad updates and improvements in the years since, delivering something beyond what was even promised in the lead-up to launch. Today, it is widely praised by critics and fans and is put forward as the foremost model for how to improve a game after a rocky launch.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>10 Chambers, the studio behind the hit shooter GTFO, has another game in the works called Den of Wolves. It announced the project at The Game Awards, and it's a co-op heist first-person shooter.</p>

<p>Den of Wolves sees players working together as criminals-for-hire working for rival corporations in Midway City. You'll assemble a crew, outfit yourselves in gear, and plan what will hopefully be a successful heist. Hopefully.&nbsp;</p>

Will this second bite at making a (hopefully good this time) vampire game be the one? It's still early on in development, from the sounds of things, but here's the reveal trailer.

      <p>Arkane has announced that it's jumping into the Marvel universe by announcing a video game based on Blade.</p>

<p>The title, aptly named Marvel's Blade, is coming from Arkane Lyon, the team behind Deathloop and the Dishonored series, in collaboration with Marvel Games. Announced on Blade's 50th anniversary, the game is described as a single-player, mature-rated third-person action-adventure game set in Paris. The city has been plagued with vampires, so it's up to you to put a stop to it. Though it will feature plenty of action, it's described as a&nbsp;"very Arkane game", so fans should potentially expect it to have several of the studio's signature immersive sim hallmarks.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Hoyoverse, the team behind Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail, has released a new trailer for its next game, Zenless Zone Zero. Unlike its other two games, Zenless Zone Zero puts players in a futuristic metropolis in control of various characters capable of fast-paced, stylish action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail, Zenless Zone Zero features an anime-esque art style, with its characters and much of its world looking almost animated. This new trailer, which Hoyoverse revealed during The Game Awards 2023, showcases more of the game's narrative and its third-person action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you can see, Zenless Zone Zero is shaping up to be another great Hoyoverse game, and you don't have to wait too much longer to play it because it hits Android, iOS, and Windows PCs in 2024.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Don’t Nod, the team behind Jusant and Life is Strange, has a new story-driven adventure game called Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage.</p>

<p>The trailer begins rather innocently in 1995 with a group of four young high school friends –&nbsp; Swann, Nora, Autumn, and Kat – partying together without a care in the world. The video then takes a darker turn with hints that something sinister, and perhaps otherworldly, flipping their lives on their heads. 27 years pass with no contact between the friends, but the secret they swore not to talk about again brings them back together. Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage is the first title of Don't Nod's Montreal studio.&nbsp;</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3QHZxzTPsco" width="640"></iframe>

<p>The notion of killing the Justice League, some of the most powerful people in the DC universe, has always felt like an impossible task for the Suicide Squad, and the more we see of these corrupted superheroes, the harder it looks. This trailer gives us a look at Green Lantern's arsenal of hard light weaponry, the Flash's speed and lightning bolts, Wonder Woman's lasso of truth, and a shadowy Batman (which is potentially related to Scarecrow's fear gas, though that's just speculation).</p>

<p>Luckily, the Squad is equipped with a wide array of weapons and traversal techniques, making them way more mobile than they would normally be in the comics or movies. We get a good look at new gameplay of them swinging, soaring, and shooting as well, which you can experience solo with AI companions or online with friends.</p>

<p>But the best part of the new trailer? The release date hasn't changed. We can take on the Justice League next year on February 2.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Jurassic Park fans got a nice surprise during The Game Awards with the reveal of a new game called Jurassic Park: Survival.&nbsp;The cinematic trailer shows a young woman named Dr. Maya Joshi, an InGen scientist left behind on Isla Nublar in the immediate aftermath of the first film – one day after the park collapses, in fact.</p>

<p>Players explore the open world of Isla Nublar, which teems with a variety of newly escaped dinosaurs in a fully reactive world. Stealth seems to be more emphasized than combat, as players must use their intelligence, skills, and wit to outsmart and avoid John Hammond's prehistoric creations.</p>

      <p>Hideo Kojima, the director behind Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding, and Jordan Peele, the director of movies such as&nbsp;<em>Get Out</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Nope</em>, are making a new cloud-based project for Xbox Game Studios called OD Announced tonight during <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/every-winner-at-the-game-awards-2023">The Game Awards</a>, the project also stars Sophia Lillis (<em>It</em>) and Hunter Schafer (<i>Euphoria</i>).</p>

<p>In typical Kojima fashion, the trailer doesn't illuminate much. We see several characters reading (and sometimes failing to do so) a tongue twister before Lillis' character screams in horror at what they see behind a door.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Talking onstage, Kojima was joined by Peele to mostly compliment each other's work. However, Kojima stressed OD is, in fact, a game. But it's also a movie. And apparently something unlike much else. Or so he says. Peele said it was "crazy." I lost the plot after a while.</p>

<p>Anyways, check it out for yourself:</p>

<p>OD isn't the only project Kojima is working on. His studio, Kojima Productions, is also developing a <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2022/2022/12/08/death-stranding-2-announced">sequel to Death Stranding</a>.</p>]]></summary>

Announced during tonight's Game Awards, No Rest For The Wicked is quite a different kettle of cursed fish compared to Moon's previous games, but I'm also quietly intrigued by it at the same time. For starters, this is an online ARPG that combines the top-down combat of games like Diablo 4 with the patient, weighty boss battles of your Elden Soulslikes.

      <p>Former Tango Gameworks designer Ikumi Nakamura stepped on the stage of The Game Awards to reveal the first game from her studio, Unseen, called Kemuri.</p>

<p>A stylish trailer showed off the slick art direction with various cool street folks doing some parkour-style running and jumping while brandishing weapons such as a katana. They also seem to be facing a slew of supernatural beings. Unfortunately, the cinematic doesn’t reveal much in terms of gameplay or details, but it's a cool first showing, if nothing else. Check it out for yourself below.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Untitled Goose Game was one of the most viral indie games when it launched in 2019. It was simple and fun, overflowing with charm and personality. It seems like developer House House has some of that personality left in the tank, because their next game, Big Walk, looks incredibly intriguing. Check out the reveal trailer below,</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lHDXRuRj0EE" width="640"></iframe>

<p>In Big Walk, you and your friends will explore an open world full of puzzles and things to discover. According to the Steam page, you'll need to figure out new ways to communicate when you suddenly find yourself speechless. This explains why, in the trailer, we see lots of attempts at communication, from waving arms to holding up certain images.</p>

<p>The aforementioned Steam listing also says "Sit and watch the sunset, or steal your friend’s binoculars and kick them into the ocean." It seems that much like Goose Game, there will be plenty of time for shenanigans. You'll be able to check it out in 2025.</p>]]></summary>

It's also an online co-operative multiplayer game that will see and your friends solving all sorts of puzzles you find out in the wild. Come and watch the reveal trailer below.

Terrific, demonic rhythm-basher THUMPER is getting a sequel of sorts called THRASHER, created by the first game's artist and composer Brian Gibson. It’s a weirdo racer in which you use gesture controls to evolve the creature you're controlling, in a “breakneck race for survival that begins at the dawn of time”. Which is certainly a concept. Will there be any flying hell triangles in this one? Will my thumbs be able to keep up, seven years after almost breaking them against the sneering face of THUMPER's world 3?

      <p>God of War Ragnarök fans got three surprises at The Game Awards. One, the game is getting an expansion. Two, it drops next week. And three, it's free.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The expansion, called Valhalla, will be totally free. We see Kratos and Mimir traveling to an unknown where he battles the usual Norse creatures but also threats from his past, such as cyclops and undead Greek soldiers. PlayStation's official synopsis, posted below, describes the adventure as featuring some kind of roguelite element, but it is currently unclear what that means exactly.&nbsp;</p>

Embark with Kratos to Valhalla on a deeply personal and reflective journey towards a future he never thought possible. Master challenges of mind and body on an unraveling adventure that blends the beloved combat from God of War Ragnarök with brand new elements inspired by the roguelite genre.

<p>God of War&nbsp;Ragnarök: Valhalla arrives on December 12 for both the PS5 and PS4 versions of the game.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Announced tonight during <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/every-winner-at-the-game-awards-2023">The Game Awards</a>, Exodus is an upcoming sci-fi game about time dilation. Most notably, it features actor&nbsp;Matthew McConaughey, famous for his roles in&nbsp;<em>True Detective</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Dazed &amp; Confused</em>. And while he announced the game on-stage at the show, interestingly, the trailer didn't even feature&nbsp;McConaughey.</p>

<p>Judging by quick looks in the reveal, Exodus is a third-person action adventure. Its main narrative conceit revolves around an alien discovery and a couple experiencing time at different intervals. As the trailer's narrator says, "It was only days for me, but an entire lifetime passed for her."</p>

<p>Check out the reveal trailer below:</p>

<p>Even after watching the trailer, you might not have much of an idea of what the game is about; it's pretty scarce when it comes to concrete information. We see the protagonist (fittingly named June) as she hacks and slashes her way through spectral creatures in a mysterious world. Luckily, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2702430/Usual_June/">the Steam listing</a> for the game provides some context to her actions. Here's a bit of what the developer has to say about the game:</p>

Follow June and her new besties (alive and dead) as they investigate the town’s century-spanning secret history, explore a shattered multi-dimensional continuum, chill at the cemetery, defend themselves against massive monsters from beyond the pale, and deflect their parents’ questions about what they’re doing after they graduate.<br />
&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;It sounds like it'll be telling a typical coming-of-age story mashed up with supernatural heroics. In between story beats, players will also be able to experience some "frantic, flexible combat." We'll be able to get a taste of that ourselves when the game drops some time in 2025.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>The Odd Gentlemen, makers of games like The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom, have announced Harmonium The Musical, a melodic adventure game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It stars Melody Mecato, a young deaf girl and musician who loves performing. She wants to make it home for her big show but finds herself facing a powerful force that can only be beaten by the power of music. The whimsical game is told entirely through American sign language, including Disney-style elaborate, interactive musical numbers. Check it out below.&nbsp;</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the deadly (and delightful) card game of Inscryption, creator Daniel Mullins is returning to his happy land of little horses. Today he announced Pony Island 2: Panda Circus, a new genre-shifting curio described as "a phantasmagorical voyage through time, myth, divinity, and video games." I like that this description is likely wholly earnest and accurate. This news came during the pre-show for Geoff Keighley's Shopping Hour and if a game like this is relegated to the pre-show, I can only assume the main event will include Half-Life 3, Elden Ring 2, and Deus Ex 5.

      <p>Motion Twin, the team behind Dead Cells, has revealed its next game and it's an isometric action game called Windblown. Revealed during The Game Awards 2023, Windblown's most striking feature, other than being the next game from the team behind Dead Cells, is its animated art style.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game itself drops the 2.5 nature of Dead Cells for a more top-down, isometric approach with 3D action, and it looks great. It's due out on PC early access sometime in 2024. Other platforms were not mentioned.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check out the Windblown reveal trailer for yourself below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/shPyfu6aP58" width="640"></iframe>

<p>In Windblown, players control a Leaper on a mission to defend the Ark from a "very aggro Vortex." You can absorb memories of fallen warriors, according to Motion Twin, and then put them to good use by infusing their skills into your weapons. Plus, you can take part in all of Windblown's action with up to two friends.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The next game from acclaimed indie developer&nbsp;Daniel Mullins is Pony Island 2: Panda Circus. Announced during <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/every-winner-at-the-game-awards-2023">The Game Awards</a>, as you might expect from the creator of Pony Island and Inscryption, we have far more questions than answers.</p>

<p>Here's what we saw: a 3D adventure game that turns into a classic-looking 2D point-and-click adventure game. Voice actor and popular internet guy&nbsp;SungWon "ProZD" Cho is in the game during live-action segments. And a whole host of genre-hopping gameplay. It's a lot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check it out for yourself below:</p>

<p>Pony Island 2: Panda Circus is probably going to be released in 2025 or 2026, but the trailer doesn't make it clear. Mullins is coming off the critically beloved and aforementioned Inscryption – one of our <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/feature/game-informers-top-10-games-of-2021">favorite games of 2021</a>.</p>]]></summary>

A common complaint by users of these services is the difficulty in finding a real person to discuss their issues when things go wrong. That's something unlikely to change anytime soon because content is being taken down like never before.

Case in point: you can get the excellent Neat Bumblebee 2 USB mic for $17 at Woot right now, using the code TECHELF to knock off an extra $3 off the list price of $20. This mic originally retailed for $100 and attracted strong reviews at that price point - but at $17, it's cheap enough to recommend to literally anyone that uses a computer.

This is indeed an extremely Ubisoft game, with all the busywork and go-here-shoot-that roteness that entails, and although it throws some genuinely gorgeous visuals into the bargain, these also come at the cost of steep hardware requirements.
That said, good performance ain’t out of the question, at least not for modern CPUs and graphics cards. It will just take some digging through the graphics menus – digging that I’ve now completed, so join me as my blackened fingers bash out a convenient guide to Frontiers of Pandora’s PC performance and best settings.

A world you can relate you, but it’s not your world,” says Edouard Caplain, art director for Jusant, the meditative tower climbing adventure that is Life Is Strange studio Don’t Nod’s latest game. Moebius was the pseudonym of French artist Jean Giraud, and whose surreal sci-fi and fantasy landscapes, with washes of contrasting colour and impossibly huge structures of soaring rock, have influenced games for years. You can certainly see that influence in Jusant, too: a world you can understand, though it's quite unlike your own. 
RPS slapped on the coveted Bestest Best sticker when reviewing it a few weeks back, calling it “a show don’t tell masterpiece”. A sentiment I can get behind as a long-standing proponent of silent games ever since the Evil Within 2 insisted on puncturing its creepy baroque ambience with consistently stupid dialogue. Jusant comes from a team that know how to write a conversation, though. So why the change of pace this time around?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pour one out for Mimimi Games today, readers. Despite announcing they were shutting up shop following the release of this year's fantastic Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, today marks the grand finale for their stealth strategy masterpiece in the form of a new free Treasure Hunt update, and the release of their two paid expansions. Each brings a brand-new pirate to The Red Marley's undead crew, as well as their own half-dozen story missions to play through spread across islands old and new, and once you've begun each of their respective questlines, they're readily available to play in any of the game's regular plunderings, too. 
Mimimi have kept the identity of these pirates a secret until now, but after playing both DLCs for a big chunk of the last week, I'm confident in saying this is exactly the swansong Shadow Gambit deserves - with one of the expansions in particular bringing a poignant touch of coming full circle on Mimimi's work as a studio. Naturally, spoilers circle these waters like hungry sharks, but if you're resigned to such a fate, let's dive in below.

As I mentioned in our RPS reacts piece, I'm genuinely excited by the prospect of a renewed Vice City and you bet I'll be there for the inevitable five-minute narrated trailer that begins with a person saying, "Welcome to Vice City".
There's no doubt Vice City is going to be dense and chaotic, going by all the twerking and the social media parodies of real life Florida folks. But really, I do hope that Rockstar doesn't just reserve next-gen's horsepower for wildness. I want some peace, some quiet, some innocuous suburbs to laze around in. That would be nice.

Back when it was first revealed in May at Sony's pre-notE3 PlayStation Showcase, its colourful, fever dream visuals from Hotline Miami artist El Huervo instantly made it stand out among all the drab multiplayer shooters jostling for attention. Then, between talk of it being set inside a cosmic uterus known as The Sarcophagus and having to use seeds and plants over successive runs to alter the shape of the map to your whim, it only became more intriguing. Now, after playing almost two hours of this Metroid-y roguelite for myself, there's still a lot about it to take in and digest, but holy moly what a thing to behold at the same time. This is surely going to be one to watch for Metroidvania likers when it comes out on February 13th next year, because cor, this is looking really quite good, folks.

The developers have now shared a bit about how it differs from Hi-Rez's Tribes Ascend, released way back in 2012, which we adored.
Created by a former Hi-Rez subsidiary that includes several of the original Ascend leads, the new shooter retains its celebrated predecessor's emphasis on agility and momentum, but will be a premium game sold for $20 with separately sold cosmetics, rather than a free-to-play affair. It also won't have a singleplayer campaign, much to the probable consternation of Tribes: Vengeance fans, and the indifference of everybody else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the grim darkness of the far future… I will finish my review of Owlcat’s Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader. It turns out that trying to complete an estimated 100-hour RPG during the run-up to The Game Awards is too much for this humble Scriptor. There are still many more tabletop-style planetary maps to discover and plunder, many more character levels to scale, and many more cursed artefacts to tamper with before my protagonist, the closet Chaos worshipper Bruschetta de Plonque, can pronounce herself mistress of the Kronos Expanse - assuming the Inquisition doesn’t claim her first. But after 20 hours of the game, I can absolutely say that I’m looking forward to the next 80. While it doesn’t have the cinematic swagger and raw anecdote-generating capacity of obvious rival Baldur's Gate 3, Rogue Trader has mystique and depth to spare, both in terms of its grotty narrative and its exceedingly busy combat and levelling systems.

One suggestion is to expand geo-blocking restrictions to the audiovisual sector, including streaming platforms. This has spooked some stakeholders who warn that a ban on geo-blocking would put the entire industry at risk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many years, the GOG.com affiliate program has been a great way to support the project. By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.
Earlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.
Unfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.
Since we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.
We still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.
Thank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!

The jungles and the plains might be wonderful to look at, but they're too vast, filled with boring tasks, and overly reliant on level-gating to force a sense of progress. Sure, there's some spectacle in narrow escapes from the nasty humans - and their factories that make the plants droopy - but throughout the rebellion I ditched my bow for a shotgun with extended mags and a muzzle brake. For a game that's all, "the humans are bad", I was ready to defect. At least I would've been able to keep my shotgun.

The underlying court orders and other legal mechanisms are intended to make it harder for people to access pirate sites.

This ban apparently applies to Google's 'knowledge panels,' from which the site's problematic URL is carefully stripped.
