New studio Dramatic Labs announced Star Trek: Resurgence, a Telltale-style game about choosing your own adventure in the world of Luke Skywalker and Hans Solo. It looks hella Telltale, and they even have the digital corpse of Leonard Nimoy. But man, the Star Trek story I crave would be about downtime, not action.

Announced tonight at The Game Awards, Square Enix's big action RPG adventure will be hitting PC on May 24th 2022. I guess that technically still counts as 'spring' and therefore doesn't constitute a delay on its previous launch window, but it sure is a lot closer to summer than I was expecting. In any case, there's a shiny new trailer with some very hammy villains to enjoy at the same time.

Not only are there giant skull bosses with lasers bursting out of their eye sockets, but some of the creatures you'll face in the Tower Of Babylon look suspiciously like Nier: Automata-style bullet-hell boys. See it all in action below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two days removed from the launch of Halo Infinite, we finally have our first look at Halo The Series, the long-awaited Paramount+ adaptation of gaming's favorite Spartan.
While there aren't any ring-like space mechanisms the games are named for, the initial peek at Halo The Series gave us plenty to be excited about. It features plenty of Spartans, interstellar asteroid civilizations, and most importantly, Master Chief doing a cool, heroic landing and pose in the sand. 
Dr. Halsey narrates the piece, likely speaking to John-117 about how she's counting on him to be special and he gives people hope. We get some beautiful shots of human cities, Chief exploring some stony ruins, and what looks to be a brilliantly-lit alien structure. The Covenant is said to play a large role as an antagonist in the series, though we don't catch a glimpse of the coalition of extraterrestrial races quite yet.

Halo The Series is produced in coordination with Showtime, Amblin Television, and 343 Industries. It stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief/John-117,  Natascha McElhone as Dr. Catherine Halsey, Bokeem Woodbine as Soren-066, and Jen Taylor reprising her role as the AI Cortana. The show hits Paramount+ sometime in 2022.

Arc Raiders is an upcoming free-to-play cooperative shooter by Embark Studios, which is comprised of previous DICE employees who worked on the Battlefield series. Embark took to The Game Awards to unveil its project, Arc Raiders, offering our first big look at the game in action.
With Robyn's "Dancing On My Own" serving as the trailer's anthem, we were introduced to deadly mechanized threats coming from space that must be brought down with the cooperation of your squad. Plenty of gunfire and explosions naturally ensue. But then the trailer shows humongous mechanized beings that take up the entire screen, giving the fights a David versus Goliath feel. You are playing as the underdog and must work together with your team to shoot off enemy parts and make sure everyone stays alive. In one cool scene, a character launches toward the giant being and chucks a grenade right at its center. The trailer ends by saying: "They will never stop coming," and shows an armored baddie with red eyes rising. You can watch it for yourself above.
The game's description on Steam says players will wield tools and gadgets to outsmart the enemy and use physics to their advantage for success. 
Arc Raiders is set to come out in 2022 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Elden Ring trailer fresh out The Game Awards introduces the story of the new game from Dark Souls developers FromSoftware and Game Of Thrones author George R.R. Martin. Well, I say it introduces the story, I mean it does it in a very Souls way, reeling off names like "the Blade of Miquella, Malenia the Severed" without explaining anything. This seems like it would be the game's opening cinematic so if you watch this trailer now, hey, it's almost as if you're starting Elden Ring two months early. Almost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Previous trailers and tons of footage from the closed Network Test have given players a decent amount of information to pick apart and sort through regarding the upcoming From Software action-RPG Elden Ring. Today at The Game Awards 2021, we were treated to yet another taste of what's to come. Suppose you're looking for more information on Elden Ring. In that case, you might want to check out an extensive write-up of everything we discovered in hours and hours of wandering around the Network Test – or join us on video for some hot and spicy commentary. Today, players got a little more context about the world that From Software and G.R.R. Martin have created for Elden Ring. Check out the entire trailer below.

The trailer details the downfall of the demigods, with some style and flair. Wars raged between the demigods, with a grand battle between two champions. A mysterious character narrates the whole thing, and all it does is raise more questions. Well, hopefully, we'll have some answers – and can start exploring – soon enough.
What do you think this means for Elden Ring? After Bloodborne's mid-game surprise shift, I think everyone's anticipating that there are plenty of exciting secrets in store. These games are often better experienced without a full spoiler suite. Still, it's likely that any big revelations and surprises will be saved for post-launch as we continue to see parts and pieces stitched together from the early-game experience. What did you think of the trailer? Let us know in the comments! Elden Ring is slated to land on February 25, 2022 on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal 5 Experience has officially been revealed and it’s available to experience on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S right now. 
Revealed during The Game Awards 2021 by none other than Keanu Reeves, who plays Neo in the Matrix franchise, and Carrie-Anne Moss, who plays Trinity, this experience is a visual showcase of what Unreal Engine 5 is capable of. During The Game Awards 2021, Reeves and Moss were found in front of the iconic dodge-a-bullet-by-bending-really-far-backwards-scene from the first Matrix movie.

Reeves jokes that he can’t pull off moves like that anymore, but he says in Unreal Engine 5, he can. Then, we see some footage from Matrix Resurrections, which oddly enough features footage from The Matrix, too. From there, we returned to Reeves and Moss, who ask, “what is a game and what is a movie?”
Following this, the duo revealed the world premiere of The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience and it was quite impressive, if not a touch veering into uncanny valley territory.

It turns out that this experience is playable and seems to take place during a scene in which Neo and Trinity are dodging enemies while racing down a street. We haven’t played it yet, but if we had to guess, it plays like a shooter of sorts. It appears to be a tech demo with playable elements.

One of the most notable things about the game's appearance at tonight's show was the announcement of its composer: Takeshi Furukawa, the BAFTA Award-winning composer for The Last Guardian. We got a taste of his music as it played over the game's trailer, which shows a character riding atop some kind of robotic horse throughout a desert. As this happens, the character is chased by a group of rocket-powered, spider-like creates. The trailer ends with the character thrown from their horse, as small, cat-like creature paws at them.

Not only does the trailer serve up an impressive visual showcase, but it also highlights one of the most significant conflicts that can happen in the myriad hypothetical zombie apocalypse scenarios, where humans are at each other's throats as one of the most dangerous threats of all. It's almost like one of the challenges in these survival scenarios is to stay human despite society and the world crumbling into chaos. Oh wait, they put that in the title just in case we forgot. Nice! Anyway, check out this cool trailer that explores some pretty gruesome and grim stuff. Zombies are scary, and tough choices will be made in this game for sure.

That moment came by way of a cinematic trailer, but tonight's Game Awards provided a first look at gameplay. To the surprise of no one who played the original, there are rats. Lots and lots of rats. 
Amicia and Hugo are off on another dark quest and the biggest difference is that Amicia gets her hands a lot dirtier this time around. She's gone from wielding just a slingshot and hiding in the shadows to firing crossbows in what looks to be more involved combat. Of course, the supernatural rat plague remains the star and the swarm look deadlier (and more visually impressive) than ever.

I attended a hands-off preview, and it sure does look like a cartoony battle royale. The most standout thing to me was that you could put an entire cooked chicken in your pocket, or throw it at someone, so that's something.

Rocksteady debuted the first gameplay trailer for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League at The Game Awards. In it, we get to see how the unlikely team of villains gets around Metropolis and the ways they deal with Brainiac's hordes of mind-controlled soldiers and other eldrich-looking monstrosities. 
However, the footage didn't go off as planned. Debra Wilson's Amanda Waller hacked into the production and appeared on stage to lecture host Geoff Keighley about releasing classified information. She still let us see the game despite the threats. I'm not sure why; I'm not a security expert.
We got a great look at the Squad's mobility and combat capabilities in the extended trailer. Harley Quinn grapples to what looks like bat-drones to swing around the ai…]]></summary>

        <updated>2021-12-10T03:20:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Iron Galaxy Studios has announced Rumbleverse, a new colorful free-to-play brawler with 40-player online multiplayer. 
Announced during The Game Awards 2021, the Rumbleverse debut trailer showcases some of the fun and zany characters we’ll be playing as in the new brawler. It seems quite expansive too. Fighters in the trailer jump all around a city, scaling buildings and more. According to a press release about the game, players will use an “ever-changing arsenal of elbow drops, powerbombs, and dropkicks” to defeat others.

You’ll be able to customize your brawler, of course, as each has 14 points of customization.
While what we saw in the trailer looked great, it was purely cinematics. However, TGA host Geoff Keighley revealed that Rumbleverse will have a special gameplay event tomorrow, and it sounds like we’ll be seeing actual gameplay then. This first look is tomorrow, December 10, from 12 p.m. EST to 6 p.m. EST. 
Based on a title screen at the end of the trailer, Rumbleverse is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via the Epic Games Store. There’s no mention of Steam, so it seems if you want to play Rumbleverse on PC, you’ll need to do so through the Epic Games Store. 
“Welcome to Grapital City,” a description of Rumbleverse reads on the game’s official website. “This city was built to celebrate the glorious traditions of melee combat – and you’re invited. Create a unique champion. Get shot out of a cannon. Smash crates to find upgrades. Pick a fight and battle to the last.” 
If you’re interested in checking out Rumbleverse for yourself, you can sign up to jump into Early Access at Rumbleverse.com.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In one of The Game Awards' shortest reveals of the night, developer Innersloth announced the wildly popular Among Us is heading to VR. That's right; you'll be able to voluntarily strap yourself into a simulated crewmate helmet and attempt to survive while a murderous imposter roams your ship. Or, you could be the one stabbing your friends in the back as they go about trying to swipe that key card just right. 
The trailer only showed a glimpse of the VR game's new look, but the 3D reimagining doesn't seem to deviate too wildly from Among Us' simplistic design. The footage shows us what it will look like to stand in the Skeld, scanning around suspiciously at the several vents strewn about the room while trying to punch in a series of numbers in the keypad before us. Everything seems fine...until it isn't and the screen goes blank. Among Us VR seems like a fertile ground for jump scares. 
The team did not share more about the title in the trailer, but Innersloth's website gave us a little more to go on:
really have an emergency meeting together. (Note: VR version won't be compatible with the original Among Us game, so you'll only be able to play against other VR beans.)

Platforms, release dates, and additional information around Among Us VR will be announced at a later date. To stay updated, you can follow our new Among Us VR Twitter account or keep an eye on our site right here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We got our first look at Dune: Spice Wars this evening, and the game is clearly looking to follow-up on a long-established claim of success in the strategy genre.
The new trailer is mostly atmospheric, and we hear a lot of place and character names that firmly entrench the new game in the Dune fiction. As the camera pans out from a scene on Arrakis, we see a giant hand holding a portion of the planet, sand slipping from its fingers.
The game’s official site has more detail to offer, promising that Dune: Spice Wars is a real-time strategy game with 4X elements. The game is being developed by Shiro Games, the team behind the survival game called Northgard.
In the new Spice Wars game, players take charge of a faction vying for control of Arakkis, the only place in the universe where Spice can be found, a substance that can expand consciousness and allow for space travel across vast distances. Of course, players can take control of familiar factions like Atreides and Harkonnen, but it sounds like other factions are an option as well. The game is also promising a variety of mechanics and ways to aim for victory, including subterfuge, politics, growth of economy, or straight-up warfare. The game boasts 4X dynamics in real-time, as players will explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate while they seek control of the vast desert planet.
Dune: Spice Wars is coming to early access first to help further development of the project, and the first chance to try the game is on the way in 2022.
Dune is experiencing a particularly potent resurgence at the moment thanks to the new and successful film, and this first glimpse of the new game looks promising.

Forspoken is an upcoming action/role-playing game from Square Enix's Luminous Productions, and it has some top-tier talent behind it. The game's writing team includes Gary Whitta, Amy Hennig, Allison Rymer, and Todd Stashwick, to name a few. But we still haven't seen much about the game, which centers on a young woman named Frey who gets transported from New York City to a fantastical world. A new trailer shown at The Game Awards tonight changed that, introducing us to one of Frey's adversaries, played by Pollyanna McIntosh (The Walking Dead). 
In the trailer, Frey begs to go home and says she doesn't know how she got to this strange world. But it looks like she's not exactly having a great time, as she has to contend with fire-breathing dragons and other animal and human threats attacking her. And she's pretty much getting blamed for everything, with people saying she trespassed on the land and set this battle into motion. Thankfully, she has some cool magic at her disposal, and what looks like a hoverboard to get around with ease. You can watch the trailer above to see it all in action. 
Forspoken launches on May 24 for PS5 and PC. The game is said to leverage the graphical capabilities of Sony's new system, with ray tracing and procedural generation.]]></summary>

This year’s Game Awards has been full of great announcements and reveals, but if you’re a Trekkie, you might be most interested in Dramatic Labs’ reveal of a new adventure game that lets players explore a distant corner of the galaxy aboard one of Starfleet’s news ships, the U.S.S. Resolute. 
Star Trek: Resurgence is billed as a third-person choice-driven adventure game centering on two new characters, first officer Jara Rydek and engineer Carter Diaz. Set shortly after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation, Resurgence follows the crew of the Resolute as they unravel a sinister mystery between two alien civilizations that threatens to erupt into all-out war. While Resurgence is a wholly original story, Dramatic Labs also teased the fans might recognize a familiar face or two along the way. 
It’s worth noting that Dramatic Labs is composed of people with experience in the adventure space, as the team is comprised of veterans from Telltale Games, and many of Dramatic Labs’ devs worked on games such as The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, Game of Thrones, and Batman. 
“As fans of Star Trek, it’s truly an honor to be crafting a story which puts players right in the heart of the action, where significant choices and decisions will affect the entire narrative,” said Dramatic Labs founder Kevin Bruner. “Built from the ground up using Epic’s Unreal engine and our proprietary narrative engine, this game showcases our team’s evolution in creating thought-provoking story-rich adventures.”
Star Trek: Resurgence is scheduled for release next Spring for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC as an Epic Games Store exclusive.]]></summary>

The montage-style video shows off pterodactyl and plesiosaur-like creatures, further emphasizing the prehistoric theme established by the raptor-like Clawstriders and mammoth-inspired Tremortusks from previous showings. We also catch glimpses of massive armadillo-like machines that roll into balls to hurl themselves at Aloy and even a giant, menacing cobra. Aloy showcases some of the outfits she’ll wear, including some intimidating war paint and a striking red bodysuit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gearbox debuted a new look at Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands with a trailer at The Game Awards focusing on the fantasy looter shooter’s story and characters.
Will Arnett’s voice as The Dragon Lord opens the trailer, where a tome titled Bunkers & Badasses sprawls open, introducing the player’s role of The Fatemaker. This moniker explains itself pretty well! Soon after, we meet Valentine (Andy Samberg), one of the characters in your B&B campaign, who also introduces his “scary, stabby” friend, a robot named Frette.

A press release from Gearbox breaks down some of the characters we see in the trailer and will meet during our time with Tiny Tina (Ashly Burch). Valentine likens himself to a dashing rogue, while others pin him as a “washed-up, low-rent space pirate.” Also joining the playgroup is Frette, a former accounting bot who found herself traveling with Valentine after a “chance encounter” that resulted in her former employer “filing for Bankruptcy While Currently On Fire,” which is said to be legally different from regular bankruptcy.
Rounding out the team is Torgue, the famed Borderlands weapons manufacturer with a persona not unlike a professional wrestler. You can see him in the trailer jamming on a very complex-looking guitar, filling the role of the bard in Tina’s tabletop RPG. Speaking of which, Wonderlands has players moving around a tabletop overworld where fourth-wall-breaking objects like cheese puffs and bottlecap bridges enhance the sense of these characters sitting around a table, playing Bunkers & Badasses.
Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands launches on March 25 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Epic Games Store will be the exclusive home for the PC version at launch, with other PC marketplaces receiving the game later in 2022.

In the trailer, we see a variety of the game's different gangs, looks at the story, and its open-world mayhem – including, but not limited to, a helicopter swinging a car around like a wrecking ball, tanks wrecking shop, men getting kicked in the groin, and lots and lots of explosions. It's like 2012 all over again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heavy Rain developers Quantic Dream and Lucasfilm Games are making Star Wars: Eclipse, an action-adventure game set in the "golden age of the Jedi". It was announced at The Game Awards with a rather dramatic trailer featuring an alien playing some drums, adorable green monkeys in a market, lotsa space ships, and of course, plenty of shiny lightsaber shots. The rumours were true, then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jumpship, the development studio working on Somerville, was formed in 2017, and it has some big names behind it. According to The Game Awards host, Geoff Keighley, two years later, in 2019, one developer shared his dream of seeing the studio's debut project on the show's big stage. That was a wish Keighley seemed happy to grant at tonight's ceremony as he introduced a new trailer for Somerville.
Tense and enigmatic, the trailer flashes from creepy, abandoned toy stores to scenes showcasing speeding spacecraft. It doesn't reveal a lot about what fans can expect from the moment-to-moment gameplay, and doesn't unveil a definitive release date, but it does show off the game's fantastic aesthetic and nail-biting tone.

Though the footage got The Game Awards' signature "World Premiere" treatment, this is actually the most recent of several looks we've had at Somerville. Earlier this summer, Jumpship's title got the spotlight during Microsoft's E3 event. The trailer was equally enigmatic, though it introduced the idea that the game would follow a once-quiet world visited by hostile, extraterrestrial entities. Hopefully, we will see more of the game, and get a release date, soon.]]></summary>

It's being developed by the experienced members at Sonic Team Japan, with a story penned by Ian Flynn - head writer of IDW's current Sonic the Hedgehog comic (via Game Informer).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tonight’s Game Awards revealed that Sonic Frontiers is the official title for the next 3D Sonic game, and the hedgehog is expanding his horizons to a bigger world than ever. 
Frontiers is an open-world game – or open-zone as Sega describes it – developed by Sonic Team Japan and led by Sonic Forces/Sonic Lost World director, Morio Kishimoto. Sonic embarks on an adventure to the Starfall Islands, a collection of forests, deserts, waterfalls, among other biomes. It's unsure what to expect, but based on the trailer, Sonic has some titanic opposition standing in his way. Fans of the Sonic comic books should be happy to know that Ian Flynn, head writer of IDW's current Sonic the Hedgehog comic and former lead writer of the Archie Comics Sonic series, is penning Frontier's narrative.

Sonic Frontiers doesn’t have an exact release date, but it’s coming during the 2022 holiday season for current and last-gen consoles. It’s cool to see Sonic tackling a true open-world for the first time. Hopefully, it borrows some tips from another high-speed 3D platformer, Solar Ash.

Nightingale, a Victorian shared-world survival crafting game from ex-BioWare developers including ex-BioWare general manager Aaryn Flynn, has been announced. 
Flynn announced that he was building a new studio for Improbable back in 2019 and until today, it remained simply an internal Improbable studio in Edmonton, Canada. Flynn and the team announced during The Game Awards 2021 tonight that the studio is officially Inflexion Games and its first game is Nightingale. 
Set in a Victorian “gaslamp” fantasy setting, Nightingale will task players with exploring worlds in search of the rumored last haven of humanity called…you guessed it: Nightingale. It’s currently in development and slated for an Early Access release on PC sometime next year. 
Players can expect forests, swamps, deserts, and more in the lands of the Fae to explore. Along the way, they’ll need to construct estates, farms, communities, and more to survive using crafted tools, gear, and weapons. You’ll be able to do all of this alongside friends and foes alike, thanks to the shared world aspect of Nightingale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This evening’s Game Awards presentation brought a new look at Destiny 2: The Witch Queen. We’ve known for some months that the new expansion was going to change up the status quo of power in the Destiny universe. Specifically, the Hive goddess named Savathûn seems to have found a way to grant Guardian-like powers to her Hive soldiers. Of greatest significance, that means that the Hive foes you defeat can come back from death after you take them down.
That was the focus of the new video that debuted tonight, comprised of in-game footage that shows off a fireteam confronting a Hive Knight Guardian, accompanied by a live-action debrief between one of the human Guardians who was present and Ikora Rey, in her role as a leader of the Vanguard. The fireteam seems to destroy the Hive Knight, but then it comes back from death. The combat must eventually turn out to the better, as the returning fireteam member has the remains of the Hive Ghost, but it’s clear that things did not go well on the mission.
After the trailer, we also learned that the footage shown was from the opening mission of the new expansion.
Destiny 2: The Witch Queen is set to release across all platforms on February 22. It’s been a long wait for a major new expansion, but the scope and drama of Savathûn’s big coming-out party has us excited.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bokeh Game Studio, the new independent development house headed up by Silent Hill director Keiichiro Toyama, finally unveiled its debut project, Slitterhead, tonight at The Game Awards. Predictably, it's grotesque. 
The trailer opens with a man walking down a typical city alley before running into a woman. Shortly thereafter, we get our first glimpse at what is ostensibly a Slitterhead, as the woman's face tears open and her body mutates into a skeletal monstrosity. From there, a bizarre compilation of scenes plays, including, but not limited to, police being chopped in half by similar skeletal beasts, a man in a motorcycle helmet conjuring blood into a sword, another man in his pajamas falling through the sky, and more. We end on a shot of a densely-packed apartment complex as a plane flies closely overhead, before zooming in on an older woman whose face has torn open – much like the others – though this time it shuts, leaving the woman looking normal.
Check out the full trailer below:

Aside from what we saw in the trailer, we don't know too much about Slitterhead, other than what Toyama's hinted at in past interviews. Back in June, it was revealed he was working on a choice-driven game. In December 2020, Toyama told IGN Japan his next project (ostensibly this one) would be released in 2023.]]></summary>

Nightingale is a "shared world survival crafting game" set in a Victorian world of gaslamp fantasy, which will send us into magical realms to explore, build farms and communities, craft tools and weapons, and such for a fight against the Fae. Should any Fae be reading this post, allow me to stress to our readers that this is vile propaganda, and to stress to you that I would very much like to wake up with all my teeth.

Wonder Woman is finally getting her own game, and we didn't see this one coming. Today at The Game Awards, Warner Bros. Games announced the project with a small teaser that confirmed Monolith, best known for Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, would be acting as the developer. 
The trailer, which you can watch above, didn't give us much information, but it did begin with Diana's mother, Hippolyta, calling Diana home, saying a threat comes to their shores. It looks like Wonder Woman will have a big weight on her shoulders as she'll have to restore what's been broken and make allies. "You are a hero, but you can be more," her mother says. Wonder Woman's shiny red, blue, and gold armor flashes with the iconic W,  and we then see her lasso in all its glory.
The trailer ends by saying: "You can be a leader," which makes us curious how Monolith will challenge us with that task, especially since the brief description spoke about uniting old enemies and forging new bonds. Monolith is the studio that brought us the famous nemesis system, after all, so we wouldn't be surprised if it had some clever ideas for Woman Woman.
The trailer's Youtube description shed a little more light, saying Wonder Woman is an open-world action-adventure game where she'll have to unite two worlds.  It's also confirmed to be a single-player game, with an original story set in the DC Universe. The description also said the game is powered by the nemesis system, so at the very least, we can count on that to enhance the experience.
No platforms were verified at this time, but we'll update the story when they're revealed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced during The Game Awards 2021, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade will finally hit PC on December 16, more than a year after the game’s original release and months after it launched on PS5. However, it appears Intergrade will be exclusive to the Epic Games Store, or at least, a non-EGS version has not been detailed.

The trailer that aired during The Game Awards 2021 began with an Epic Games Store logo, and the closing screen that appeared at the end of the trailer had no mention of Steam. So, if you want to play Final Fantasy 7 Remake on PC next week, you’ll have to buy it on the Epic Games Store for now. 
As a reminder, Intergrade includes the Intermission story episode. That means you’ll be able to play as Yuffie and infiltrate a Shinra facility as the famed ninja on PC. You’ll also get to play as Cloud, Aerith, and more through the base story of Final Fantasy 7 Remake, which happens to be great. You can read about why in Game Informer’s Final Fantasy 7 Remake review. Read about how the sequel to Remake will be quite different after that. 
Are you going to be checking out Final Fantasy 7 Remake on PC next week? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

The live-action/animated film sees the return of Sonic (Ben Schwartz), Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey) along with newcomers Knuckles (Idris Elba) and Tails (Colleen O'Shaughnessey) in an adventure that looks as zany as the previous film. 
Robotnik is back (with a spiffy new jacket) and has recruited Knuckles to help even the score against Sonic. Thankfully, the blue blur is backed by his human cop buddy Tom Wachowski (James Marsden) and one Miles Prower. That's Tails for you non-Sonic nerds. Take a look at the fun trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today is bringing plenty of reveals at The Game Awards. One of the more intriguing is the long-awaited reveal of Alan Wake II. Rumored in one form or another for years, the new game promises to finally give us some answers about the enigmatic writer and his adventures – or maybe just more questions.
In the trailer, we hear narration from a mysterious voice, talking about expectations for a story, but the realization that sometimes a story isn’t what you expect or want it to be. As the camera zooms in on a single figure in a desolate town, we hear the phrase: “This story is a monster, and monsters wear many faces.”
The new trailer finally gave us a first look at Alan Wake II, including a release date of 2023. Remedy’s creative director, Sam Lake, was on site at The Game Awards to announce that this sequel is actually a survival/horror game, moving away from its action roots.
Unfortunately, Remedy’s Lake also revealed that we likely won’t learn anything else about the game until summer of 2022. We did learn, however, that Remedy’s Alan Wake II is headed to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and the Epic Games Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tonight, opening the annual Game Awards show, developer Ninja Theory showed off the first look at Senua's Saga: Hellblade II gameplay. 
The trailer opens with protagonist Senua entering a cave with allies as an impossibly large, human-like beast stalks outside. When the giant beast walks into the cave, subsequently collapsing on the wall, the team attacks the monster, setting it ablaze. Soon after, Senua's team goes up in flames, as the beast slams its way around, trying to strike back at its aggressors. Spotting Senua and the remaining allies left living, the crew retreats, trying desperately to run away and retaliate as best it can.

Senua and her team's efforts to bring down the beast all fall short as it continues to chase them outside of the cave, smashing surrounding structures. The trailer ends with the creature asking Senua for help. Senua replies, saying, "I know you," as one of the voices in her head says "It's you." The trailer ends there.
Host Geoff Keighley said at the end of the trailer that what we were watching wasn't a cinematic, but real gameplay, though it was hard to tell how interactive anything shown off in the trailer actually was – the camera was constantly whipping around during the trailer, seemingly indicating at least part of it was, in fact, cinematics. At the very least, it stands to reason everything we were seeing was running in-engine. 
Senua's Saga: Hellblade II will be released on Xbox Series X/S and PC. It will also be available through Xbox's Game Pass subscription service. No release date was given.]]></summary>

PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 will once again be the only platforms available for the test which will run from 7 p.m. Pacific on December 17 until 6:59 a.m. Pacific on December 20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At tonight's Game Awards, Falcon Age developers Outerloop Games announced Thirsty Suitors, a story-driven RPG about fending off suitors and exes while trying not to disappoint your family. Published by Annapurna Interactive, it looks eccentric and colourful, with battles involve throwing ghostly cars and calling in giant family members to swat your opponents. It also features cooking, skateboarding, and possibly dancing (though I can't quite tell from the trailer if the dancing is separate from the battling).

Sticking with naming conventions, it's unsurprisingly called The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. It'll be based on the film that came out in 1974, and the teaser trailer revealed at The Game Awards features a delightful creepy shot of leatherface.

The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is now making its way to the multiplayer game space. Today at The Game Awards, a brief teaser made the reveal. No gameplay was shown, but we did get a look at the small quiet town before Leatherface made his presence known. 
The clip, which you can above, shows Leatherface's bloody tools, including a yellow chainsaw. As a body swings upside down, it screams in terror as the chainsaw revs and blood splatters all over his face. "Texas Chain Saw Massacre: a multiplayer horror game based on true events" then flashes across the screen. Maybe it's taking a cue from the film, which marketed itself as being based on true events, but the plot was largely fictional with only minor details inspired by murder Ed Gein.
Fear the Gun and SumoDigitalLtd - Nottingham are behind the multiplayer horror game, which its official Twitter calls: "an authentic gaming experience based on the groundbreaking 1974 film." No platforms were confirmed at this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Giving us some serious Death's Door vibes, Have a Nice Death is an action roguelite game just revealed at The Game Awards. The stunning hand-drawn art, however, gives it a unique personality, and its tone seems a little more humourous than Acid Nerve's hit title. You will be playing an overworked Death, and, as the head honcho of Death Incorporated, it's your job to make sure souls make it to their final resting place in the afterlife. But everyone needs a break now and then. In order to secure a much-needed vacation, you must steer your executive team, the Sorrows, away from their over-enthusiastic spree on Earth. 
Stuffed with gorgeous visuals and hectic, 2D action, the trailer shows off what happens when Death takes matters into his own hands.

Have A Nice Death is coming to Early Access in March and, so far, developer Magic Design Studios has not announced whether the game will be coming to any consoles. Death-focused action title isn't the studio's first beautiful game. Back in 2019, it released Unruly Heroes, a vibrant adaptation of the popular Chinese tale Journey To The West, on every major platform, giving us hope that the developer's next project might follow suit. We will have to wait and see if we get more news on the title before it launches in Early Access next year.]]></summary>

The trailer shows off how the gunslinging protagonist handles business. That business being beating the snot out of all manner of otherworldly creatures. We see him dish out combos of jabs and uppercuts with electrified gauntlets while blowing enemies apart with a shotgun. Did we mention there's a lot of blood? You can watch yourself in the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of mystery surrounds the previously announced Homeworld 3. It’s been a long time since Homeworld 2’s release way back in September of 2003, but fans have hung their hopes on the exciting prospect of a new game on the way from Blackbird Interactive. Today’ Game Awards pre-show presentation brought us a new look at the mysterious title, in the form of a new trailer.
In the video, we’re greeted by a remixed version of Samuel Barber’s "Adagio for Strings," a piece of music renowned for high-drama appearances in a variety of media. As the music plays, we’re treated to a bevy of different spacecraft, moving both through atmospheric conditions as well as in deep space. We see a lot of beauty shots of a variety of ships, but we also are treated to a variety of battle shots that include larger capital ships and smaller fighters blowing each other into space debris.
Interspersed with the footage are glimpses of a long-haired woman seemingly suspended in some sort of chamber, ably recalling imagery from the earlier games – very possibly an appearance of Karan from the original games.
We know from an accompanying press release that the game is set generations after the original games as a standalone release, and set in a galaxy that has enjoyed long year years of success thanks to a large Hyperspace Gate Network, but that those gates are now failing.
“Homeworld 3 is the realization of the vision of what we set out to create in the Homeworld series, with modern technology allowing us to push beyond our wildest dreams of large-scale dynamic space combat packed with emotional sci-fi storytelling,” says Rob Cunningham, CEO of Blackbird Interactive.
It’s not much information to go on, but it is exciting to see the return of such a classic real-time strategy sci-fi franchise. The game is headed to both Steam and Epic Game Store in Q4 of 2022 – the first time we’ve learned of that date.

That's not all, though. Those who preorder the digital deluxe version will be able to play the game a number of days before launch. That number is three. You'll be able to play on February 28, three days before Babylon's Fall is officially released.
Along with the announcement of the release date, a new trailer for Babylon's Fall was shown, which you can watch below.

Babylon's Fall is a fast-paced fantasy action RPG that pits one to four players against the challenges found within the colossal Tower of Babylon. You take control of warriors called sentinels who wield powerful equipment named Gideon Coffins. These incredibly-named accouterments allow characters to hold and utilize up to four unique weapons, two of which can be used at a time. 
Square Enix and Platinum have worked together before on 2017 often-celebrated Nier: Automata. Platinum Games is, of course, known for developing many other action titles like the Bayonetta franchise, Astral Chain, Vanquish, and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance.]]></summary>

Falcon Age developers Outerloop Games have announced Thirsty Suitors, a stylized story-driven adventure where you play as Jala, a woman who finds herself having to deal with old mistakes and family issues when returning home for her sister's wedding. It was shown off as a part of The Game Awards pre-show festivities.
Thirsty Suitors' debut trailer shows it will be anything but the typical self-reflecting indie drama. While Jala will be reconciling with her immigrant family and their customs (along with a barrage of suitors set up by her grandmother), she'll also have to contend with the various exes she left in her hometown. Along the way, Jala will participate in turn-based battles, skateboarding challenges, and intense cooking scenes, which all look flashy and fun. 
Outerloop Games is a studio that prides itself on its composition of underrepresented cultures and the ability to surface those cultures in the games it makes, with Thirsty Suitors having a heavily Indian influence on its style and character heritage. In a press release, Thirsty Suitor director and co-founder of Outerloop, Chandana Ekanayake, says, "Our mission at Outerloop Games is to create accessible games about underrepresented cultures, and Thirsty Suitors will give players a glimpse into our teams’ personal experiences growing up, which might be vastly different from what players have experienced themselves."
Thirsty Suitors, which is being published by Annapurna Interactive, does not have a released date, with the trailer only sharing that it's coming soon. Nor do we know which platforms it will appear on. But, fear not, we'll be sure to let you know when that information becomes available.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Andrew Shouldice has been hard at work on Tunic for years. And for years, fans have been hoping to get information on its release window. After the long wait, we now know the Zelda-inspired title featuring a heroic fox is coming in just a few months. The surprise news opened The Game Awards pre-show, a stage usually reserved for smaller announcements, but for indie fans, this reveal might be the highlight of the entire night. 
Tunic is set to release on March 16 for Xbox consoles and PC. However, tonight's trailer had even more secrets to reveal than just the date, including new locales, tools, and enemies. In one previously unseen location, our vulpine sword wielder races across a narrow bridge glowing with pink neon light. Soon after, we see him use a whip-like item that Tunic uses to traverse long distances and bring ranged enemies into striking distance. And it looks like we are going to need all the help we can get because new opponents, like oversized, terrifying spiders, are ready to take the protagonist down.

If you need more Tunic now and can't wait the few months until the game's spring release date, you can get your hands on a demo of Tunic today as part of Xbox's ongoing gaming festival celebrating The Game Awards. Xbox owners can hit the store anytime between today and December 21 to download the game's short preview for free.]]></summary>

Immediate answers might include punchy phrases/words like “gun feel” or “kit customization.” Even so, it’s hard to define the gratification that comes with securing that coveted victory in ranked multiplayer or surviving a seemingly never-ending onslaught in single-player horde mode. A good shooter tends to contain a smorgasbord of enticing components – gripping atmosphere, weapon/ability balancing, enjoyable arenas, etc. Regardless of style (e.g., FPS, third-person, top-down), the aforementioned features tend to mesh well with polished gameplay, sweeping narratives, and new or improved mechanics. If you feel at home sprinting through multilayered environments, mowing down adversaries with precision and cunning, then the ten games on this list are definitely wort…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's all been building to this. The Game Awards 2021 promises to be a night to remember, featuring a massive slate of announcements, the crowning of a new Game of the Year winner, and even a musical performance by Sting (what the gamers are really here for). To celebrate the evening's festivities, we're going live and covering it all over on Twitch starting at 6:15 p.m. CT!
Click here to watch embedded media


We know you'll be there watching along with us, but what else will happen during the biggest award show of the year? For starters, we already know who has a chance at the big prizes such as Best Performance, Best Game Direction, and the highly sought-after Game of the Year award. Deathloop, Metroid Dread, Psychonauts 2, Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, and Resident Evil Village have a shot at the big prize, and without a clear-cut favorite like The Last of Us Part II in 2020, it could be anyone's award this year.
On top of the array of award winners, The Game Awards 2021 is set to have a metric ton of announcements and reveals featuring some of the biggest titles in the industry. We already know Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, Tiny Tina's Wonderworld, and whatever the next Sonic game is will make an appearance, but what else does host Geoff Keighley and company have up their sleeves? Will Elden Ring be making another appearance? Will we hear from early-2022 juggernauts such as Pokémon Legends: Arceus or Horizon Forbidden West? Only time will tell.
On the Game Informer side, your hosts for the evening will be none other than Alex Stadnik and Prima Games editor Jesse Vitelli. The official show kicks off at 7 p.m. CT, but we'll be starting things early at 6:15 p.m. CT to cover some predictions we have and watch the preshow along with you! If you want to learn more about The Game Awards, be sure to check out our write-up on everything you need to know ahead of the big event!]]></summary>

A combination of turn-based strategy, real-time strategy, and a sort of 2D puzzle platformer-ish spaceship game, Nova-111 originally came out on the Wii U, which means a lot of you might have missed out on it. But we gave it a 9/10, don'tcha know!
Luckily for you, you'll be able to weave your way through space-obstacles on the Nintendo Switch just days after Santa's gone back into hibernation, as it comes to Switch early next year.

        <updated>2021-12-09T19:17:58.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steelrising, the upcoming Souls-like from Greedfall developer Spiders, made its latest appearance tonight at the annual Game Awards, showcasing new looks at the story, characters, and monsters. 
One of the most immediate things about Steelrising is its striking art direction. The game's ostensible protagonist looks like a mix between a marionette doll and the clockwork soldiers from Dishonored 2. Being set in 1700s France, there's a great grime and darkness to the whole world, and the game's many enemies shown in the trailer all either look like they're decked in custom suits of armor or similar clockwork designs. 
Check out the trailer below.

Steelrising was first announced back in July of 2020. It's set in Paris during the French Revolution, pitting players against King Luis XVI's robotic army. When it was first announced, the game was expected to be launched sometime this year, though that has since been pushed back. 
Steelrising will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in June 2022.]]></summary>

While that’s true, what’s at the heart of the Halo franchise does not change – it’s Master Chief, Cortana, some punchy guns that don’t get old, and a soundtrack that never lets up. Throughout the decades, Chief and Cortana (and buddies like Buck) have found themselves on Earth, Sanghelios, hurtling through space, aboard exploding rings, and more. But no matter the locale, we were finishing the fight – even when some of those battles were more grueling than others.

Sadly, Chief was absent from the fight the Game Informer editors partook in to rank all the Halo games from worst to best.

The sad news broke today that Masayuki Uemura, the lead architect on the NES and Super NES consoles, died on 6th December at the age of 78. Uemura was an instrumental figure in the formation of Nintendo as the video game company we know and love today — his hardware design credits date back to the 1970s, and he also has a fair list of software producer credits to his name. It's no exaggeration to say that millions of players across the world have his engineering skill and expertise to thank for the systems we played in our youth and the great memories we formed with them.
Born in 1943, Uemura grew up in post-war Japan and developed an interest in playing with and constructing his own toys from a young age, partly due to the scarcity of new products available in the years following the end of World War II. He studied at the Chiba Institute of Technology and upon graduating he began his career at Sharp Corporation before eventually joining Nintendo in 1972, thanks to his relationship with Gunpei Yokoi. The two met and worked together while Yokoi was investigating Sharp's technology for use in light gun games in the early 1970s and Uemura evidently impressed Nintendo's chief designer at the time.

Released in the same year as Keita Amemiya's 1988 movie Mirai Ninja: Keigumo Kinin Gaiden (known as Cyber Ninja in the United States, Warlord in Canada and Robo Ninja in the UK), Mirai Ninja was powered by the Namco System 2 coin-op board and looks a lot like other ninja titles from the period, like Shinobi and Ninja Spirit. Amemiya, it should be noted, has since worked on video games like the Onimusha series and Shin Megami Tensei IV.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The lead engineer behind the Nintendo Entertainment System and its successor, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Masayuki Uemura, has died. 
First reported by Polygon, this news comes by way of the Ritsumeikan Center for Game Studies at Ritsumeikan University, which announced today that the legendary designer died on December 6. He was 78 years old. 
Uemura began working for Nintendo in 1972, where he quickly got to work prototyping light-gun games technology that would eventually pave the way for games like Duck Hunt. He then was selected to lead Nintendo’s home console initiative, as noted by Polygon. 
In 1981, work had begun on what would become the Famicon, perhaps more commonly referred to as the NES in the West. It officially launched two years later in 1983, and then Uemura and the team that helped create the NES got to work on the Super Famicon aka SNES, which would be released in 1990. 
Uemura retired in 2004, and he soon began working as a professor at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan. There, he taught game development. The university will be holding a memorial service for him at a later unannounced date.

It's out on PC on 16th December, with consoles to get the update in early 2022 - hopefully not long, then. It'll add a new endgame challenges, additional units, and most importantly a new ending for the story.

But anyway! Now seems like a good time to take a closer look at Infinite’s PC system requirements, and which graphics settings you should tweak to get the best performance.

From the makers of cult-classic shmup Kokuga and the author of the Kakegurui manga comes Yurukill: The Calumniation Games, the latest game to tap into the "people murdering each other to stay alive" genre that also includes Squid Game, Danganronpa, and Hunger Games.
Yurukill, to use its shorter and easier-to-spell name, places you in the shoes of Sengoku Shunju, a man who believes that he's been falsely accused of arson and the murder of 21 people. He, along with six other criminals, are the "Prisoners" — and their victims are the "Executioners". Together, they will have to form teams to tackle the twisted games of the amusement park that they've been trapped in.

But it's the season to be jolly, so we're talking about the times we thing kids in games are actually really good.
We do end up going on quite a lot of tangents, notably one on which Warhammer faction Matthew would play, and of course we ask Matthew for his thoughts on Mr. Beast's Squid Game. This week's Cavern Of Lies is in Nate's control, which means he takes us to Dwarf Fortress, with predictable results.

        <updated>2021-12-09T15:23:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a homecoming of sorts, two Gears of War character skins are joining the Fortnite roster today. 
Epic Games was the original owner of the Gears of War franchise, but it sold the rights to Microsoft back in 2014. Thanks to Fortnite, Gears of War cosmetics are coming to the popular battle royale. That’s because Marcus Fenix and Kait Diaz will be available for purchase in the Fortnite Item Shop later today at 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET. 
As you can see in the image above, they look as you’d expect, but Kait Diaz also comes with a Winter Orange Style variation. If you play a match of Fortnite on an Xbox Series X/S after purchasing the Marcus Fenix skin, you’ll unlock its Matte Black Style variation, which you can see below.
Marcus Fenix comes with the Sonic Resonator Back Bling, while Kait Diaz comes with the Reyna’s Pendant Back Bling. Other accessories include the Breaker Mace Pickaxe, the Thumper Pickaxe, the Butcher Cleaver Pickaxe, and the Skiff Glider. You can see each of these items in the image below.
Also up for grabs is the Knife Tricks emote, which you can view here, and the Emergence Hole Spray, which comes with “Kait & Marcus Bundle.” You can also purchase the pickaxes, glider, or emotes individually, but if you buy the Emergence Gear Bundle, you’ll get all of them. 
A new Gears of War quest will be added to the Battle Royale later today as well. Players can complete the Delta-One Quests from December 9 to December 17 to unlock the Crimson Omen Spray. To do that, you’ll need to collect three COG tags, crouch behind a barrier, damage an opponent with a melee attack, do shotgun damage to an opponent, and collect Thrashball memorabilia. 
While waiting for Gears of War to take over the Fortnite Item Shop, check out this Unreal Engine 5 character skin in Fortnite and then read about how Epic Games is developing Fortnite in Unreal Engine 5. Check out these recently-added Resident Evil skins after that. 
Will you be picking up Marcus Fenix or Kait Diaz in Fortnite today? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Famitsu's Japanese chart figures are now in for the week ending 5th December, revealing that Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl have remained on top for a third consecutive week.
The two games sold another 164,580 physical copies combined in Japan last week, taking their total physical sales count to just over 1.9 million. After two weeks on the market, the titles were actually outpacing the sales set by Sword and Shield back in 2019, but as their third week comes to an end, Sword and Shield's three-week sales total of 2,023,043 leaves the Diamond and Pearl remakes playing catch up.

Back in September, during the Epic Games vs. Apple legal dispute, which centers on Epic Games wanting to charge its customers outside of Apple’s App Store ecosystem (the company takes a 30-percent cut of each sale), courts released an injunction statement to stop Apple from preventing developers from going around its services for in-app purchases.

“Update #3.1 is our last game update before the start of the holidays,” the official EA blog post reads. “That means our team will take a break towards the end of this month and return in the new year with fresh eyes ready to go on the road to Season One. We’ll see you again in the new year where we’ll talk more on further changes and improvements you can expect in Battlefield 2042.”
EA’s blog post highlights seven key changes that the update brings to the game:
Improvements to bullets hit registration consistency.
Balance changes for bullet dispersion and recoil.
Further balance changes to Ground Vehicle 30mm, 40mm, and 57mm Cannons to reduce their effectiveness against infantry.
A fix for a rare bug where a player could appear invisible to enemies.
Fixes for several bugs related to Grenades and Launchers.
Improvements to the menu flow for Xbox players to make it easier to opt-out of Cross-Play.
Multiple audio improvements to enhance your overall sound experience, focused on clarity, distance, and directional perception.
The rest of the blog post lists the 46 changes and improvements coming by way of this update and if you’re interested to learn more, you can read the full list here.

Our picks below include both free and free-to-play games. Anything with a mandatory cost is excluded, as are mods or anything dependent on another purchase. The result is a list of games that run the gamut, from ARPGs to management, 2D platformers to co-op first-person shooters. 
If you'd prefer to consume a version of this list via the magic of moving pictures, you can do so with this handy video we've put together:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Great Battlefield 2042 Fix continues, with the final promised patch of this year having gone live today. While it’s not as hefty as previous updates, it’s still full of tweaks. And that’s good, because this game could use them. Expect your bullets to find their targets a bit better, various audio improvements, and rooftop objective removals from the Breakthrough mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a crazy summer that saw Final Fantasy XIV’s playerbase expand dramatically during what was supposed to be a quiet period, it’s no surprise that anyone wanting to tuck into the new Endwalker expansion has a lot of queueing to do. But if you can stand the two hour waits and dreaded 2002 error then you’re in for a grand, if a little slow-starting, adventure.
Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is the final chapter in the story arc of warring gods Zodiark and Hydaelyn, and sees you trot across the globe to make new friends, fight old foes, and get some space travel under your belt. It’s huge. So huge that it’s going to take a few more weeks to soak it all in and do a full review justice. Between the queue times and sheer scale and finality of the story, Endwalker is a lengthy undertaking.

Moreover, I’m disappointed how the transparency for the future of Arena has all but disappeared this year.
Last week, Wizards announced more changes on the horizon, bringing a bigger focus to exclusive digital cards, mechanics, and formats to Arena. On the bright side, it's neat to see what design spaces Wizards has wanted to explore that wouldn't pan out well with physical cards. Also, I thought many of the cards from Jumpstart: Historic Horizons would cause a bigger stir, but the new additions didn't burn the game to the ground as my darkest fears predicted.

This should make the game load faster and generally run better, which is a nice change for a game to still have the motivation to deliver a year after launch, but maybe not such welcome news if you're on a slow, throttled, or metered connection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When The Game Awards start cranking out trinkets and marketing tomorrow night, you'll be able to watch the whole shebang from within an official "metaverse experience" in game-making platform Core. Launched on Monday, it's named Axial Tilt, and what I played of it ahead of the live in-game event is rubbish. This is exactly what I have come to expect from the ongoing "metaverse" gold rush: marketing wrapped in a bad video game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker expansion is out now, with plenty of bunnyboys jetting off to the moon. That is, if they’re able to login successfully. The servers have been overwhelmed since early access began last week and the thirst for furry friends in maid outfits simply won’t abate. Not only do the long login queues persist now it's out properly, but there are plenty of errors plaguing the process which makes the wait even more frustrating. Thankfully, an update is being deployed today that should fix those server errors, increase server capacity, and make the login process a bit smoother.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't agree that being mean is always the funniest joke, but it is often the easiest joke, and let's keep that in mind as we talk about next year's Mario movie. You know, the one where Mario will be played by Chris Pratt. In the event that the film turns out to be good, I will enjoy it - like how the Sonic film was actually pretty decent, especially James Marsden's star turn. But for now, Untitled Chris Pratt Mario Movie is bad, and a guilt-free laugh.
I saw this extremely funny bingo card on Twitter and my eye was drawn to a discussion in the replies. One of the square on the bingo card is "Jump by Kriss Kross plays" and someone else says they think it's "50/50 they choose Van Halen's "Jump" over Kriss Kross", which leads yet a third person to bring up House Of Pain. From this exchange I am 100% sure that a jump-themed song will feature in this film - but the question is which?

In fairness it looks like a pretty comprehensive effort, combining expected tweaks like 21:9 ultrawide monitor support with performance-boosting Nvidia DLSS upscaling and even some general graphical upgrades. There’s a PC features trailer, too.

Unlike most other big games this year, Infinite has no preload option, so you won't be able to have it downloaded and ready to go by the time it launches. Though, developers 343 Industries say you can make the download a little smaller by having the FPS's multiplayer beta installed.

Microsoft have said that, while you can keep exploring the game's open world after you finish it, main campaign missions won't be available to repeat. Fortunately, this shouldn't be the case forever, because 343 Industries say that replayability is "being worked on", though they don't have a date for it just yet.

But priorities have shifted over the years, and while yes, it's nice to play a game at a crisp 1440p or 4K, what's equally important is that your game looks smooth and feels responsive. This is where refresh rates and response times come in, making your games flow better and feel more reactive. This is especially important in fast-paced multiplayer games, where a slick and accurate display can mean this between hitting your target and missing them.

When the first few dilemmas you face in an RPG aren't ethical or character ones, but about whether it would be more tedious to continue with this character or to play through the introduction again, you know there's a problem. By my third restart I'd abandoned all interest in playing any character I wanted, and started trying to estimate whatever would get this over with sooner. Mechajammer is a disaster. And not only because of the bugs.

You don't want to be cramping up your fingers trying to grip a mouse that's too small or big, or struggling with a shape that's isn't designed for your dominant hand. The feel of a mouse is as important as the fit, too. You're obviously going to be touching it a lot, so you want something with a comfortable texture and a click that feels right beneath your precious little fingers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Elex was divisive, to say the least. It was a game in which I was perpetually lonely and confused and being battered to death by carcinogenic poultry, but it must have been a profitable enough venture on its own terms to warrant a follow-up. That follow-up is Elex II, which is still several months away from release right now, but one I've been playing an early preview build of recently, showing off the first chapter of the game.
I was talking to Graham (RPS in peace) about this and he said: "Eventually one of these RPG sci-fi fantasy things will get close enough to being a BioWare game that it makes loads of money." This being the games equivalent of monkeys and typewriters. But although I agreed with Graham at the time, I think comparing it to BioWare might be mistaking the particular appeal of Elex II. It would be too simple to say that I "enjoyed" the hours I have spent with it so far. I didn't not enjoy it. I mostly came away respecting it for how little it respected me. Like the popular kids on the playground making life so difficult for you that you wish to become best friends with them.

The game's island flipped over too, revealing a whole new map for players to explore in Chapter 3 Season 1. And I find myself being lured in by two new features I usually adore in games: sliding on your knees while shooting, and swinging around like Spider-Man.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since 2018, Dragon Age fans have celebrated an unofficial Dragon Age Day on December 4th, highlighting all sorts of community work and events. This year, BioWare got involved too, releasing new short stories and hosting charity streams. They also took the opportunity to remind fans that Dragon Age 4 is still on the way, confirming that it'll be singleplayer. Don't get your hopes up for Game Awards news though, because it sounds like we won't hear any more about it until 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The breakout novelty simulator this year for me is Powerwash Simulator, a game about methodically moving your mouse over the surface of objects to blast away grime and rust with a murderously strong stream of water. It's not a chaotic system like Viscera Cleanup Detail, it's just a game where you slowly make something dirty all sparkling clean. Very chill. Now you can unwind with your pals and clean cars, toilets, fairground rides, and the rest together, thanks to the online co-op added in a recent update.

This is the prime indulgence of Halo Infinite, the latest of the venerable sci-fi shootybangs. Sweet moments where it's just you, an open country of undulating hillsides, and a truck full of trigger-happy marines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electronic Arts have announced plans to build a "connected Battlefield universe", as part of sweeping changes to the development teams behind the military shooter. As part of the changes, Vince Zampella - co-founder of Respawn, developers of Apex Legends - is now overseeing the Battlefield franchise, and Marcus Lehto (best known for Halo) is building a new studio to create narrative experiences within the series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a little over 9 months since Fights In Tight Spaces first released on to Steam Early Access, and as of December 2nd, it’s kicked open the door and walked into a full release. It’s a unique combination of deck-building and turn-based strategy, presented in satisfying and stylish 3D animation. Sort of Superhot meets Slay The Spire. 


  In Fights In Tight Spaces, you play as an anonymous secret agent with the aim of assassinating bosses, while moving through the game's multiple chapters. On the way to each boss are several smaller encounters, which act as opportunities for you to get some practice in. You take turns planning the best way to take out roomfuls of enemies, and eventually upgrade your skills and continue the cycle.

Yet beyond that lacklustre start is a surprisingly tight arcade space fighter wrapped up in a wonderful bundle of pompous space magic.

It's a game I have very fond memories of, and publisher Dotemu's latest dev diary about the soundtrack for the upcoming remake has cast me right back to those glorious, if rather futile afternoons spent staring at my parent's living room computer. Musician Louis Godart is recreating the original game's music from scratch for Pharaoh: A New Era, but he's also adding some authentic touches of his own to help do those classic tunes justice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you weren’t satisfied with only three DLC packs to play with in the hybrid metroidvania roguelike Dead Cells, don’t worry. The teams over at Motion Twin and Evil Empire have got your back. The latest DLC, The Queen And The Sea, has been teased with a tiny new trailer.
The Queen And The Sea is currently planned for a release early next year. It's described as the largest update to Dead Cells yet, and is designed as an ending to the route started by the two previous DLCs (The Bad Seed and Fatal Falls). I think it’s going for more of a The Lighthouse vibe, and not so much The Little Mermaid. You can take a look at the new teaser trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neon Giant's first DLC update for The Ascent is out now. They say the Cybersec Pack’s contents include “two new weapons, a new tactical, four new pieces of armor and four new animated weapon skins.” They’ve also put together a new trailer showing off these features, which you can take a look at below.


That's pretty much it when it comes to the DLC pack, but along with it, Neon Giant have also dropped a new patch for The Ascent too. This is the fifth patch for the game since its initial launch near the end of July 2021. This one includes fixes for various crashes, increases to the stability in co-op play, improvements to the audio, as well as other miscellaneous changes. 


The patch also adds a new feature called Transmogrification, which you’re probably familiar with if you’ve played games like Destiny 2 or World Of Warcraft. In the words of Neon Giant, this’ll allow players to “change their appearance to match the visual style of any armour currently in their inventory by visiting the Stylist and paying a small fee.” Once that’s done, you can equip any armour you want, and your character’s look won’t change.
