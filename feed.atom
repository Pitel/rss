        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flying cars and don't ask question
This week's Arcade Archives entry comes from the first-draft-name developer Video System, and sees us once again returning to the bottomless well of late-'80s/early-'90s shmups — Now available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, its vertically scrolling blaster Turbo Force!
Released to the arcade market in 1991, Turbo Force is the predecessor of smash release Sonic Wings, (better known in the west as Aero Fighters), and was a standout release for the shmup market, due to its support for up to three players over the typical genre standard of two. The "Turbo" of the title apparently refers to the player vessels, which are essentially flying sports cars packed out with powerful weaponry. Why, you ask? Frankly, it's hard to tell, as Turbo Force was developed as something of a mish-mash, a confusing project that shifted direction multiple times during its production period.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Paul Eales.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q38QE0kW6DQ&ab_channel=PaulEales
As such, while Turbo Force has a lot going for it — with fast action, cool pixel visuals, and an army of varied enemies and boss characters — the game is something of a tonal and directionless mess, lacking in story, purpose, or definitive theme. Regardless, lessons learned in the development of Turbo Force would lead to the inception of the Sonic Wings series, which would offer up a bounty of explosive hits both in the arcade and on home formats. Ultimately, Turbo Force was the "training wheels" for better things to come, and stands today as more of a shmup curio than anything else.
Turbo Force is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A legendary cast of characters
The best Kingdom Hearts characters have a ton of personality, have been through hardship, or simply have powerful and exciting abilities that dynamically elevate the series' battle scenes. A key element why Kingdom Hearts resonates with so many people is not just the non-stop action; but the passion behind the cast's motivations.
Characters like Sora and Roxas aren't afraid to express their emotions: to cry, to scream, to love, to smile. And many of the legendary series characters are more intriguing than the average RPG cast, and it's refreshing to see heroes, (or in some rare cases, villains), that we are able to relate to.
Warning: There are spoilers for Kingdom Hearts 3 and Kingdom Hearts 3: Remind in this list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Show me your (new) moves
These streets never sleep. Or at least, the Streets of Rage never do. Streets of Rage 4 just got a massive free update, adding a custom survival mode, new co-op moves, character balancing, and more.
Co-developers DotEmu, Lizardcube, and Guard Crush Games released the new update on Friday. In it, the crew says, are over 300 improvements to 2020's Streets of Rage 4. I've looked at the list, and it's massive, including character balancing changes across the cast of this beat 'em up.
One of the big bullet points is the new custom survival mode. This will let players tweak their survival mode experience to their liking, with slides and boxes for starting level, healing, weapons, hazards, enemy scaling, and more. You can get a glimpse of the options in this new trailer:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBCJUijhdM
Another big one is a new co-op attack, where you can pick up and throw your partner for a special strike. It's like a tag-team wrestling attack, only their fists are on fire. The update is live now for all Streets of Rage 4 owners.
Fists of fury
If you don't happen to own Streets of Rage 4 yet, this weekend may be a good time to address that. There's currently a sale across the Steam store, PlayStation Store, and Nintendo eShop. The Mr. X Nightmare DLC is also discounted too, and there's a bundle on Steam.
Basically, there's a lot of good reasons to play Streets of Rage 4. The most important one, though, is that it's a very, very good game. I have some fond memories running through this, both solo and co-op, and it's great to see this franchise revival still getting updates years later. Though there have been many other brawlers and beat 'em ups since, I always enjoy an excuse to jump back into Streets of Rage.

If you’ve not heard of Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo, then don’t worry. Although this curious visual novel is receiving a worldwide release on the Switch eShop, its reveal was specifically earmarked for the Japanese Nintendo Direct back in February.
So while we were undoubtedly smitten over Metroid Prime Remastered shadow dropping and the launch of Game Boy games for the Nintendo Switch Online service, the lack of a western announcement for Paranormasight means that many horror fans could have potentially missed out on what is undoubtedly one of the most interesting and entertaining visual novels we’ve seen in quite some time. Thankfully, we’re here to right that wrong.

This Saturday sees me getting all booked up for VS Fighting 2023, which is still months (and months) away, but the sooner I get it all sorted, the sooner I can just sit back and wait for the launch of Street Fighter 6 — A game that will very likely see me back out on the competitive scene, having not been utterly humiliated enough last time around. It's a kink of mine. As is Juri.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get ready
If someone told me they were creating a new OutRun with 3D graphics, I’d be extremely skeptical. OutRun was not merely a raster racer through and through, it’s the God-empress of raster racers. I would think that adding some depth to that would hurt the appeal. Not so, because OutRun 2006: Coast 2 Coast is about as faithful as I could imagine.
To be clear, OutRun 2006 is sort of the sequel to the sequel. OutRun 2 was released in arcades in 2003, and followed up with a port to Xbox in 2004. Afterwards, OutRun SP was released in 2004 as an upgrade to OutRun 2. OutRun 2006: Coast 2 Coast is a console (and PSP) combination of the two titles. It is the ultimate version, and I have no idea why it hasn’t been ported since. Probably the Ferrari license. It’s always licensing.

Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo seems to have snuck up on all of us. When my editor passed it over to me and asked if I’d be interested, I had trouble figuring out what it was supposed to be from the press materials, trailer, and even store pages that had sprung up. Square Enix is one of the few monolithic publishers that doesn’t shy away from mid-budget releases, but Paranormasight seems like such a small project that it’s surprising to see it outside of the indie sphere.
It's a visual novel. The staff on Paranormasight aren’t huge; not in the AAA industry, and not in terms of Square Enix veterans, at least. Most notably, the writer, Takanari Ishiyama, worked on the Tantei Kibukawa Ryōsuke Jikentan series, which remains Japan-only.

The past two decades might have seen pinball become something of a niche, rich folk's pastime, powered by a massively inflated collector's market and the increasing rarity of machine components, but for those of a certain age, there was, truly, a time where you couldn't enter a public building and not fall over a pinball machine or three. Arcades, bars, clubs, laundries, restaurants, theaters, corner stores, and gyms. If there was a five-foot footprint empty, then it had a pinball machine plonked on it.
There have been thousands of machines produced since the 1930s, from coin-operated bagatelle tables, through to the delightful electromagnetic (EM) machines of the '50s-'70s, these would give way to the Solid State (SS) machines of the '80s, pinball's golden renaissance in …]]></summary>

The glitches of Pokemon Scarlet & Violet fall into two distinct categories. On one hand, you have the silly bugs that blast you into space when you make a sandwich.

Thankfully, a solution is coming for one of the more serious issues in the latter category.
Announced via the official Japanese Pokemon Twitter account, a patch for Scarlet & Violet is scheduled to arrive in April. While we don’t know the full context of this patch, we do know it will address an issue affecting the Walking Wake and Iron Leaves event.

Lego hosted a special Super Mario presentation today for MAR10 (March 10) Day. Alongside a detailed look at an upcoming Bowser-centric set, Lego also teased that Donkey Kong will be making his Lego Super Mario debut this summer.
At the close of the stream, we get a good look at the Lego Donkey Kong build, which has a little spot for the Lego Super Mario figure to sit in. It's an interesting configuration, considering I don't remember Mario ever riding on Donkey Kong's back? Maybe I'm forgetting some weird outtake of the 1986 animation or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L8qJUwZ94A
We didn't get any more indication of what Lego Donkey Kong's set may entail. I'm personally hoping for some sort of chaotic mine cart course, and tons of little Lego bananas to scatter around.
Bowser's new brick castle
Today's spotlight also featured a good look at the Dry Bowser castle set, which is currently aimed for release on August 1 with a $109.99 price tag. I do like the Dry version of Bowser, but I love all the little details here. A bony Piranha Plant, the chain links and giant Bowser visage, and yes, even the Toad trapped in a cage.

The Lego Super Mario crossover has really taken off in the past few years, with tons of sets coming out of the partnership between Nintendo and Lego. Ranging from these playsets designed like game levels to the enormous, gorgeous Question Block set, it's pretty cool seeing the notorious plumber reimagined in brick form.
And if that doesn't satisfy your Mario craving, there's at least a feature film arriving soon to handle that too. The latest and final trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie premiered yesterday, strangely one day prior to March 10.

If you've got a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription and a desire to revisit Resident Evil 4 ahead of its long-awaited remake, you probably know that the original game is included in the Classics Catalog. But the version included in the Classics Catalog probably isn't the one you want to play.
See, the version of Resident Evil 4 included with your PS Plus Premium subscription isn't the 2005 PlayStation 2 port or the HD remaster for the PS4. Instead, it's an earlier version of the game released for the PS3. You might already be aware of this, but PS3 games in the Classics Catalog aren't emulated, nor do they run natively on the PS4 or PS5. They're streamed. And that's not ideal.

Square Enix has released an outline of its financial results briefing from Feb. 3, in which it says Forspoken sales have been lackluster.
The action RPG arrived just a few months ago, but the trend so far seems to have not lived up to Square Enix's expectations. The publisher also drew attention to its reception in reviews, which president Yosuke Matsuda characterized as "challenging":
"Reviews of 'FORSPOKEN,' which we released on January 24, 2023, have been challenging. However, the game has also received positive feedback on its action features, including its parkour and combat capabilities, so it has yielded results that will lead to improvement of our development capabilities of other games in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Names become Numbers
As part of yesterday's Nacon Connect live stream, the French publisher released a new trailer for its affecting and intense-looking release, War Hospital, which is currently in development for PC and consoles.
Developed by indie outfit Brave Lamb Studios, War Hospital is a harsh management simulator that will afford the player the unenviable task of attempting to build, run, and maintain makeshift medical facilities in the throes of World War One. As a British combat medic on the French frontline, with an almost hopeless situation at hand, it is the player's task to ensure that wounded soldiers are able to receive the care needed to keep them alive, standing, and ultimately, returning to the fight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unLUFJFvOt0&ab_channel=Nacon
Understaffed and undersupplied, massively difficult matters of efficiency and pragmatism will need to be tackled in order to ensure maximum survivability rate for a constant influx of patients. Research and develop new fields of medicine and healing, build extended wards and theaters within earshot of battle, and, when the war gets a little too close for comfort, be prepared to venture into the field in a desperate search for resources, and face the consequences of desperate, necessary actions.
While War Hospital certainly doesn't look to have the jolly, low-stakes nature of similar titles such as Theme Hospital and Two Point Hospital, the trailer above showcases a meticulously designed and stylishly presented example of the hospital sim genre. While certainly not a title for the weak of heart and nerve, War Hospital looks very promising, and worth watching for those willing to tip the ultimate scales of life and death.
War Hospital launches later this year on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

Autumn Pioneer has been working on a rather lovely little project over the past few years, and now the game is on Kickstarter. Shashingo: Learn Japanese with Photography is a chill, fun, and accessible educational game that combines photography with language learning, and if the Kickstarter is fully funded, the game will be coming to Switch.

Super Mario Run, Nintendo's middlingly successful attempt to bring a full Mario experience to mobile devices, has always followed a freemium model. As of a recent update, the app appears to be leaning a little closer to the "free" side of that portmanteau than before.
The 3.0.27 update, released as part of an advertising push for The Super Mario Bros. Movie, allows players to play one stage every day for free. You can play that one stage as many times as you'd like during that one-day window, but once that window is over, the stage will be locked again.
[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BPTrwu8pn4[/embed]
Still not fully free
You still can't play all of Super Mario Run unless you fork over a few dollars. Only one level will be available per day, and not every level will become available during the event. The event also only runs until May 31, so this isn't a permanent change to the Super Mario Run model. Still, it's the biggest chunk of content that's ever been available for non-paying players.
Normally, only the first world, the Toad Rally mode, and the Remix 10 mode are available for free in Super Mario Run. All of those offerings are, of course, still available for free in addition to the daily free stages. For the duration of the event, you'll also be able to unlock the rest of the worlds without time-gated restrictions at a discounted rate. While the full game normally costs $9.99, during the event you can snag it for $4.99.

Thankfully, no, this is simply a pretty walking simulator exploring an island bustling with wildlife. Here, enjoy this video with some sights from my peaceful strolls.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Work together to survive the horrors
It's never too early in the year for scares and frights. Outlast studio Red Barrels confirms that The Outlast Trials is going into Early Access on May 18, 2023.
The Early Access launch will go up on both Steam and the Epic Games Store, though pricing has not been announced as of this writing. While Red Barrels has hosted a closed beta already, this will be the chance for many more players to hop in and try out the new Outlast for themselves.
You can check out a new trailer below, which focuses a little less on the gameplay and more on The Outlast Trials' voice actors and their ability to scream. They're pretty darn good at it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKwMY4ZBJJ0
Red Barrels has made a name for itself in the horror genre with the Outlast series. They play almost like a found footage-style experience, where you have to sneak and scurry around while terrors hunt for you.
Outlast together
The difference in The Outlast Trials is that it can be a solo or co-op experience. You and up to three other players get "involuntarily recruited" by the Murkoff Corporation to test certain trials, and you can opt to tackle them solo or with your friends.
You'll still be hiding, running, and fleeing. But special tools will allow you new ways to sneak around or slow down enemies. There's also character customization options for your chosen trial competitor, too.
Multiplayer survival horror has been pretty popular, as games like Dead By Daylight and Phasmophobia can attest. I'm sure Outlast fans are probably interested in seeing what Red Barrels does with more players in its horror designs.
Really, it's just nice to have pals to encounter the scares with you. It certainly softens the scares for the fright-averse out there, in my experience.
The Outlast Trials hits Early Access on May 18. No date's been set for full release.

Pretty recently, a new expansion for Powerwash Simulator came out.

That's because the latest update features locales from Final Fantasy VII, and the game added co-op a little while back. My girlfriend finished the original Final Fantasy VII not too long ago, so I figured this would be a fun way to spend a few hours.
Until I took to Google and discovered that Powerwash Simulator's co-op is online only.

Lately, I've watched this play out with a number of AAA games. Games like Gotham Knights and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were total slogs, not just because of their poor technical optimization and bizarre design choices, but because…]]></summary>

Here at Nintendo Life, we thought it would be fun to take a non-exhaustive look back on how Nintendo advertised its various Mario games over the years, spanning from the original Mario Bros. right up to Super Mario Odyssey. Hits or misses, there's no doubt that Nintendo — or the ad firms it hired — flexed its creative muscles with some of these.

You'll probably start out Zellige thinking "oh, it's making some shapes and they turn into a pattern, whatever". But within ten minutes you'll be actively saying things like "does the empty space over here feel like purity or desolation" and "what does the contrasting colour of these triangles say about their relationship with the central star?".

It's been a while since I played a game about creating art that felt effortless even as I put in a lot of effort. Zellige: The Tilemaker Of Granada is humble but delightful. It's about designing tiles. And why something that straightforward is also rich and complicated.

Luckily, puzzle is a mainstay genre in video games, from classic point 'n' click adventures to weirdo physics puzzles and aliens in space.

Epic Games Store has revealed the next title that it will be offering up to its user base free of charge, and hopefully you have plenty of long afternoons to kill, as we're going 4X with Slitherine Software's deep strategy title Warhammer 40,000: Gladius – Relics of War, which will be available to download from March 16.
Released on PC and Mac in 2018, and developed by Proxy Studios, Warhammer 40,000: Gladius – Relics of War is a Games Workshop take on the deep, turn-based, 4X action that fills the hours of strategy lovers everywhere. Players choose from one of four races — Imperial Guard, Space Marines, Necrons, and Orks — before engaging in long-form combat in order to hold dominion over the titular world of Gladius. Unlike most 4X titles, there are no "Diplomacy" mechanics.
Well, it's not called Compromisehammer 40K, is it now?
https://youtu.be/aMSsNRkvIMQ
On release critics praised the title's adaptation of 4X to the Warhammer universe, as well as the game's action, but specialist press noted that the title failed to truly capture the intricate nature of 4X titles, resulting in a release that was both engaging and enjoyable, but fails to break the upper echelon of more dedicated brands such as Age of Wonders, Alpha Centauri, or Civilization. For Warhammer fans, however, Gladius — Relics of War will certainly scratch that strategic 40K itch.
Warhammer 40,000: Gladius – Relics of War will be available to download free from Epic Games Store from March 16-23. Until then, you still have time to pick up Raw Fury puzzler Call of the Sea.

A new trailer shows off Paul’s new look and familiar offense of dishing out powerful, flame-licked punches. At one point, he flexes his bicep so hard that it makes the sleeve of his leather jacket explode off of his arm. He also rides his motorcycle into battle, which is pretty cool and reemphasizes that he is, in fact, a biker. Paul joins previously announced fighters such as Kazuya, Jin, Nina, and others. 


Tekken 8 doesn’t have a release date, but there’s a solid chance it’s arriving later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

A special "Chainsaw Demo" for the Resident Evil 4 remake is out now. And if you finish the Resident Evil 4 demo and think it was a bit too easy, there's a little extra challenge in the secret "Mad Chainsaw Mode" difficulty.
As players have been cruising through the early RE4 experience, some have been greeted with a special difficulty mode. I first saw it from the folks over at Eurogamer, but it's been steadily making the rounds on social and more too.
The "Mad Chainsaw Mode" difficulty in the Resident Evil 4 remake demo is a special run. You only get one life, no respawns. Mad Chainsaw Mode will only be applied to that run, and if you want to run it again, you'll have to make new attempts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Until recently, the story of Intel’s Arc GPUs has been a litany of mild disappointments. After years of it being easier to buy an original O’Keefe than a reasonably priced graphics card, the Arc series brought hope that it might actually be possible to get a decent PC upgrade for less than £500. Then they were repeatedly delayed, confirmed to possess some unwelcome technical quirks (like wanting Resizable BAR on at all times), and ultimately released with merely decent-ish performance. Nothing awful, but nowhere near as special as they once seemed like they could be.
In 2023, however, Intel Arc may be on a redemption... arc. A series of driver updates, Intel claims, have improved average FPS performance by up to 87% since launch, with major gains in frame times (the time between each new rendered frame) as well. The specific model we have here, the Arc A750 Limited Edition, has also had its price cut from £330 / $289 to  £250 / $250. More power for less money? I’d say that’s worth a fresh evaluation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sleep well.
In 2017, Bedtime Digital Games released Figment, a cute and dreamlike action puzzle game that aimed to be a little more ambitious and expansive than their debut release, Back to Bed. We enjoyed it, and evidently plenty of other people did, too, as the studio has now brought us Figment 2: Creed Valley. Though Figment 2 feels like more of the same, it nonetheless offers up an enjoyable and engaging puzzle experience that we feel is worth your time, although perhaps less so on Switch.
Figment 2 borrows from the playbook of Pixar’s Inside Out by placing you in a fictionalized world within an ordinary person’s mind, where various abstract concepts like compassion or opinions are represented by tangible objects and characters. The narrative primarily follows Dusty, the embodiment of the mind’s courage, and his bird friend, Piper, as they work to fix the moral compass of a father struggling to balance his family’s emotional needs with his own sense of what he should be prioritizing as a provider. Dusty and Piper must fend off evil Nightmares that threaten to upset the balance of this man’s mind, all while trying to make their way through the whimsical and sprawling land of the eponymous Creed Valley.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Outlast Trials, the third entry in the popular horror franchise, will welcome players into its twisted world when it enters PC Early Access on May 18. 
A new trailer reveals the news in a rather unique fashion, showcasing voice performers recording the horrific screams, yells, and grunts that will unnerve players in the game. The game was first announced in 2019, and developer Red Barrels gave players their first hands-on sample of the game via a closed beta last October. The ETA for the full release remains shrouded in mystery, however. 


The Outlast Trials mixes up the formula of the previous entries by letting you play alongside friends in four-player co-op (although you can still play solo). The game unfolds in a secret facility during the Cold War, with players controlling involuntary test subjects being tortured in gruesome experiments. Avoiding enemies instead of confronting them remains the key the survival, though you obtain and upgrade tools that can increase your odds at staying hidden or slowing foes down. 
You can check out The Outlast Trials in early access on Steam and The Epic Store.]]></summary>

Puppet Combo’s publishing label, Torture Star Video, has announced they’ll be releasing Comp-3 Interactive’s game, Rewind or Die, on April 14, 2023.
This seems like something I need to play. Rewind or Die has you playing as a video rental store worker who finds themselves stalked by a slasher. You’ll work your shift on your own as your co-workers flaked out on you. However, as a slave to an uncaring society, you just need to keep your head down while receiving threatening phone calls.

I think this is exactly my favorite kind of horror game. The core experience of Stay Out of the House was fantastic, but one of its highlights was its prologue, where you work a gas station night shift, just waiting for the shoe to drop. I also commonly thump the drum of Happy’s Humble Burger Farm, where you serve customers at a fast food joint. Casting the player in a relatable experience is just such a great way to draw them into the game world. Plus, like anyone who grew up in the ‘90s, I have a lot of love for video rental places.
Rewind or Die will launch on April 14 on PC. If you’d like a taste of Comp-3 Interactive’s previous work, you can find them on itch.io.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And it's coming this fall.
NIS America has given us a firmer release window for the upcoming action RPG spin-off, The Legend of Nayuta: Boundless Trails. The upcoming game will be launching this fall, which means this will be the third game in the Trails series to be localised this year following Trails to Azure in March and Trails into Reverie in July.
Boundless Trails, however, is pretty different from the rest of the mainline Trails series. It's sort of a spin-off, but also sort of set in an alternate timeline. The continent of Zemuria doesn't get a mention, nor do any characters from the mainline Legend of Heroes games make an appearance. it's also an action RPG, much closer to Falcom's other big RPG series — Ys.

PlayStation Blog has released the specifications for the incoming PC port of Naughty Dog remake The Last of Us Part I, and they're unsurprisingly meaty, given the Gen 9 tech and general visual brilliance of the 2022 PS5 release.
Anybody looking for a steady 60 FPS at 1080P will need to rock a rig with an Intel i7-800 CPU and an 8GB nVIDIA GEFORCE RTX 3060 or equivalent. Those looking for "Ultra" settings, for example players looking for a 4K experience, will need an Intel Core i5-12600K CPU and a pricey NVIDIA GEFORCE RTX 4080 or equivalent.
You can check out the full "Minimum" to "Ultra" specifications in the image below.
https://twitter.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1633875501759737856?s=20
Whatever your setup, you'll need an SSD footprint of 100GB to store all of those lovely textures, visual effects, and hours and hours of dialogue. The PC edition of Naughty Dog's glumfest will also include additional features such as new resolution options for ultrawide monitors, as well as 3D audio support, and adjustable sliders for texture quality, shadows, and ambient occlusion, among other elements.
The Last of Us Part I launches on PC (via Steam) on March 28. The celebrated remake will be made available in standard format, or a Digital Deluxe Edition which includes early weapon unlocks and additional weapon skins. The Last of Us Part I is available now on PS5.

Automaton West reports that in Japan, players have come up with a fun little game that challenges players to reach the deepest, darkest depths of space by creating a chorizo sandwich. Things like this are only easy in Paldea, aren't they? To reach beyond Paldea and the Pokémon World's stratosphere, players need to set up a picnic table on a high point of Paldea. A popular area has proven to be the windmill hills in West Province (Area One).

I have no idea how old they are supposed to be and for some reason that’s not surprising.) survivors and a stalwart detective revisit the ruins of a hospital that was once home to a haunting ceremony. They all have amnesia, of course, because that’s a low-effort way to generate an air of mystery. Well, except the detective, who is just confused because he never really figured out what was going on in the first place. 
Overall, it’s a thoroughly okay game from 2008 that’s been papered over with some hazy lofi graphics to justify selling it at full price in 2023. It’s up to you if you think that’s worth it – I bought the Mass Effect remaster, so I’m hardly one to judge – but while the graphics have been thoroughly airbrushed, that’s no cure for Fatal Frame’s dated gameplay and undead pacing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanna go on the Final Fight ride
During yesterday's Capcom Spotlight live stream, the publisher announced that it was "building" a digital theme park, Capcom Town, for its upcoming 40th-anniversary celebrations. The digital funland will open in June and is a celebration of the veteran studio's legacy of games and franchises.
Very little has been offered in the way of details, but Capcom Town will feature "a digital museum and other buildings" which one would assume will be filled with artwork, marketing materials, write-ups, and trailers from franchises such as Street Fighter, Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Mega Man, and many more. We will likely see areas based on Capcom's arcade roots, hopefully offering nods to titles such as Strider, Side Arms, Gun.Smoke, and maybe even Cadillacs & Dinosaurs... Ok, now I'm just being unrealistic.
Capcom is genuinely one of the industry greats, and while the past decade has certainly seen the studio stumble on more than one occasion, the developer seems to have been back on track since the 2018 launch of Monster Hunter World, which has led to a string of quality, successful releases. And with Resident Evil 4 and Street Fighter 6 on deck for this year, it looks like Capcom will have plenty to celebrate come its June anniversary.
Capcom Town will have a grand opening on June 13, 2023. A teaser site is now live.

Four Horses has made two of its 3DS eShop titles free to download in the run-up to the digital storefront's closure at the end of the month. Kid Tripp and Digger Dan DX are both currently free and will be free for the remainder of the eShop's life, Four Horses has revealed. (Thanks for the tip, Dogorilla!)
The deal was spotted by @ZeningameDirect on Twitter, who tagged the developer. Four Horses said that it was told by Nintendo that "it was not possible" to make the games free, but two of the developer's titles have indeed had the price of admission removed.

Good morning, folks, and happy MAR10 Day! And in order to get your celebration for the beloved plumber and his amazing adventures off to a grand start, Illumination has received the "final" trailer for its upcoming release The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which launches in a little under a month from now.
The trailer, (which honestly perhaps shows a little too much for my liking), sees Mario's brother Luigi imprisoned within Bowser's Castle (complete with a great remix of the area's classic theme). Mario teams up with notable heroes such as Princess Peach and Toad in order to rescue Luigi, defeat the mighty monarch's army, and restore peace to the Mushroom Kingdom. The trailer ends with a battle sequence on the Rainbow Road, with Mario bustin' out his finest karting abilities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdD9geN6erk&ab_channel=UniversalPicturesUK
Look, I get it. Illumination only has one form of comedy — the collar-tugging, record-scratching, "oh no he did'n" deal. Yeah, it's trite, overdone, and cynical. But, despite all that, I can't help but think that this film looks pretty marvelous. From a visual perspective, it's a delight, with authentic sounds and music. I also think some of the jokes over the past few trailers have been pretty funny, and some of the casting, (like Jack Black's Bowser), is paying off. Of course, whether this fun and energy can be maintained over 92 minutes remains to be seen, but from what we've seen so far, I'm feeling very positive.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie launches in North American and European theaters on April 5. Don't forget to check out this ace line of posters released to promote the movie. Oh, and Happy MAR1O Day!

MAR10 always brings with it a whole host of Mario-themed fun. And last night, the voice cast of The Super Mario Bros. Movie got together on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon with The Roots to perform an awesome acapella rendition of the Super Mario Bros. Theme.
This delightful little cover features the voice talents of the movie all singing along to the iconic video game theme in one of Fallon's semi-regular segments, which have previously featured the cast of The Force Awakens, coaches from the reality show The Voice, and the animated characters from the movie Sing. A;; framed by the NES pixel art from the 1985 NES game from both the Overworld and the Underground.

Arrowiz, the Shanghai-based development team behind 2021's Hermitage: Strange Case Files, returns to Nintendo Switch with a determined attempt to replicate the general rhythm and vibe of Atlus' all-conquering Persona series in the form of Mato Anomalies. This is an RPG that throws a whole bunch of ideas and gameplay mechanics at the player but, unfortunately, it all comes unstuck due to clunky writing, uninspiring combat mechanics and environmental design that quickly becomes repetitive.
Thrown into a neo-futuristic Shanghai cityscape pulled straight out of the likes of Blade Runner, players assume the role of two protagonists: Doe, a hard-boiled private detective who deals in out-thinking his adversaries, and Gram, his mysterious exorcist sidekick who gets to do all the fighting. Working as a team, the duo set out to investigate a series of strange anomalies affecting the city, bringing them face to face with demonic entities known as the Bane Tide.

The 3DS and Wii U eShops are shutting down at the end of this month, and ahead of this, lots of game developers have been slashing prices on their libraries across both platforms. Capcom is the latest to do this - with an absolutely massive sale currently taking place on Nintendo's slightly older digital storefronts at the moment.
You can get 3DS titles like Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, older Phoenix Wright games, Resident Evil entries and even Street Fighter for just $2.99 USD. The same pricing applies on the Wii U eShop - with games like DuckTales: Remastered and Resident Evil Revelations also going for this amount.

Today really seemed to focus on setting out a release calendar for Capcom heading into the summer. Some got new release dates, while others with known dates got a few new tidbits of information. There was nothing outright brand-new, but it was still solid to see the schedule rolled out for the next few months of Capcom titles. And honestly, they look pretty alright to me.

A new trailer reveals the game centers on a time-loop, as a team of soldiers travel to the past and find themselves reliving the same day. Dinosaurs have also begun appearing all over the globe through mysterious wormholes, so our heroes strap into their weaponized exosuits to deal with that very strange problem. 


As a cooperative team-based multiplayer game, Exoprimal is an always-online experience and will feature season passes with a number of unlockable rewards, such as cosmetics. Those itching to try the game early can jump into a free open beta that runs March 17 to 19, but you'll need to register for a Capcom ID to play. Exoprimal will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. It will also launch on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

As part of this afternoon's Capcom Spotlight live stream, we got to see a new blink-and-you'll-miss it teaser for Resident Evil: Death Island, the CGI animated movie currently in production at Sony Pictures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUTrBXdVPAE&ab_channel=ONEMedia
The new teaser revealed that veteran hero Jill Valentine will be joining Leon Kennedy and Chris Redfield on their latest volley against the undead. The narrative of the film will the Resident Evil protagonists cross paths as their respective missions lead them to the abandoned Alcatraz Island in San Francisco. One can only assume that they'll find a lot more to uncover at the haunting prison complex than Clint Eastwood's papier mache head.
Resident Evil: Death Island is the next in a growing timeline of CGI films featuring heroes and villains from Capcom's survival horror series. Previous releases have included Resident Evil: Degeneration, Resident Evil: Vendetta, and the Netflix series Resident Evil Infinite Darkness. While there is not a specific release date for Death Island, Capcom and Sony are expecting to release the picture at some point in 2023.

RoboCop: Rogue City is the latest to try. Last year's Nacon Connect stream featured an underwhelming "gameplay reveal"; this year's Nacon Connect features a "gameplay overview".

Monster hunters on Xbox and PlayStation will finally be able to hop into the latest Monster Hunter Rise content. Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak hits Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5, as well as the Windows store, on April 28.
While Xbox and PlayStation players were able to hop on earlier this year, they've yet to be able to access the Sunbreak expansion that arrived for Switch and PC via Steam last year.
Sunbreak has already pulled in a hefty number of sales for Monster Hunter Rise, but it's good to see other console owners will be able to join in the action too.

There's more on the way, too. Several free title updates have already release for Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. During today's Capcom Spotlight stream, the company also confirmed it will be hosting a digital showcase for Title Update 5 in April, too.
Really, there will always be more monsters to hunt in the world of Monster Hunter. For PlayStation and Xbox players, they'll be able to join in the content soon.
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak lands on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Windows on April 28.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Discover the truth behind death in June
The stylish Nintendo DS adventure Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective gets its second lease on life this summer. Capcom has locked in a June 30 release date for the Ghost Trick remaster on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam.
Originally released for the DS back in 2010 and brought to the U.S. in 2011, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective was confirmed to be getting an HD remaster last month.
It's well-deserved, as Ghost Trick is definitely one of the gems of Nintendo's dual-screen handheld. The HD remaster will bring it all to more modern consoles with single screens, with upgraded visuals and sound. That includes new music arrangements by Great Ace Attorney composer Yasumasa Kitagawa, which are fully synchronized with the original music. The Ghost Trick remaster will even let you flip between the new and original music at will, too.
Add on a new gallery of artwork and music for Ghost Trick, and it does seem like the Phantom Detective is getting the historical treatment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ob83jbeJ4Y
Activate your ghost powers
If you've not seen Ghost Trick before, it follows the soul of Sissel, who wakes up to find he's dead. As he unravels the mysteries surrounding his murder, he has to possess and manipulate objects to alter events.
It's a quirky, entertaining story with a fair bit of heart. If you dig this era of writing, especially from the Ace Attorney team, this is absolutely one to keep an eye on.
Pre-orders are live now, and Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective hits PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam on June 30.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With less than a month to go until the theatrical release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Nintendo, Illumination, and Universal have released one final trailer to try and catch prospective audience members' attention. The final trailer came by way of a livestreamed Nintendo Direct featuring the main cast (including Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, Keegan Michael-Key, Seth Rogen, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Jack Black), as well as directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic.
The trailer gives us a more in-depth look at the Mario Kart sequences, which take place on the iconic Rainbow Road course. Along the way, we get Easter eggs, including side-scrolling sequences, shortcuts in Mario Kart courses, and even nods to Bob-omb Battlefield and Tostarena. To coincide with the release of this new trailer (which you can view below), we received a new synopsis of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.
Jurassic World and The LEGO Movie franchises) and brother Luigi (Charlie Day; It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia) are transported down a mysterious pipe and wander into a magical new world. But when the brothers are separated, Mario embarks on an epic quest to find Luigi.

Teen Titans Go!, Teen Titans Go! To the Movies) from a screenplay by Matthew Fogel (Minions: The Rise of Gru, The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trial of Terror
During tonight's Capcom Spotlight presentation, it was announced, as rumored, that a special "Chainsaw Demo" for incoming remake Resident Evil 4 is going live today on all platforms — Eager players can download the demo on PS4, PS5, PC (Steam), and Xbox Series X/S.
The demo will give us all a taste of how Capcom is handling the remake of what is not only one of the most beloved titles in the Resident Evil franchise, but one of the most popular titles in gaming history. We will once again step into a mysterious European village with Leon S. Kennedy, as he searches for the missing President's daughter, Ashley Graham, who has seemingly been abducted by a strange and mysterious cult.
https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1633968516486373376?s=20
The Resident Evil 4 demo will offer up the infamous village assault that opens Leon's terrifying adventure. OF course, "Chainsaw Demo" refers to the notorious chainsaw-wielding maniac that attack Leon during this sequence. As opposed to other recent Resident Evil demos, the Chainsaw Demo has no time limit, and can be run and re-run as many times as you wish, scratching that itch ahead of the full game's incoming launch. Have fun, and don't lose your head.
Resident Evil 4 launches March 24 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Series X platforms.

Get ready to deal with some dinos this summer. Capcom has locked in Exoprimal for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on July 14, and it's also coming to Xbox Game Pass.
This co-op shooter pits exosuit-adorned soldiers against huge waves of dinosaurs, mixing the horde system you usually see for zombies or Gears' Locust with prehistoric terrors.
Using different loadouts like Assault, Tank, and Support, the players try to keep the world from being overtaken by the long-gone apex predators.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLyNU4TlY8A
Alongside the co-op play is a competitive element. Exoprimal pits two teams of five against each other to complete objectives before the other. Story segments will be doled out through playing the Dino Survival mode, as well as various rewards and experiences to juice up your rigs.
Pass to the past
Add in a dash of mutated Neosaurs, that wield elemental powers and more, and it seems kind of interesting. Granted, there are a ton of pre-order rewards and other cosmetics.
Capcom also showed off a good chunk of its Survival Pass, which looks familiar to most battle pass set-ups. There's a free track, and a premium track. Picking up a deluxe edition will net you some bonuses too.
An open beta test is also set to run March 17 through 19, so you can get a sense early if you want to dive into Exoprimal. Meanwhile, the full game hits on July 14.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What're ya streamin'?
Today, Capcom is airing a special spotlight stream to show off what's in store for the company and its upcoming games. Like a merchant rolling out their wares for intrepid special agents, Capcom will simply ask us, "what're ya buyin'?"
The Capcom Spotlight 2023 will go live at 2:30 p.m. PT / 5:30 p.m. ET. You can follow along through Twitch, YouTube, or other video platforms. Even TikTok, I guess, if you want to stitch the spotlight or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pR6WYjw5mlU
Capcom's Spotlight is expected to run for 26 minutes and will contain information about its upcoming games, including some not suitable for children. Sorry little Timmy, no Resident Evil for you just yet.
What can we expect?
Already named among today's featured virtual programming are Resident Evil 4 Remake and the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection. Some might argue that's really all you need in your gaming life.
For those who still want more info, though, there are plenty of games for Capcom to talk about. Exoprimal and Street Fighter 6 both seem like candidates, even though we just got a new fighter drop for the latter. And there are plenty of tiny updates Capcom could hit, whether for VR adaptations or long-tail games like Monster Hunter.
Part of me does hope for just a small hint of Dragon's Dogma II, though that may be a bit too far off to discuss now. Either way, we can at least expect some Resident Evil updates and Mega Man news today. Let us know your thoughts down below!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Nacon Connect presentation, developer Teyon showed off new gameplay of the upcoming RoboCop: Rogue City. The game puts you in the metallic shoes of Alex Murphy as you explore Detroit in what appears to be a high-octane, technologically advanced first-person shooter.
RoboCop: Rogue City not only gives you the tech-enhanced combat capabilities of the eponymous protagonist but also gives you the ability to make dialogue choices as you meet new characters. This lets you decide how to fulfill your objectives, but as you might have guessed, the developers intend to throw various twists in a story about corruption and greed. Actor Peter Weller, who portrayed Murphy in the original films, is scheduled to reprise his role in the game.
You can see the action unfold for yourself below.


Developer Teyon was founded in 2006 and has released nearly 100 games since. Its most noteworthy releases include other licensed titles starring '80s action IP, including 2014's Rambo: The Video Game and 2019's Terminator: Resistance. RoboCop: Rogue City arrives in September for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really enjoyed the first Figment when it released back in 2017. An action-platformer with a musical theatre twist using the human mind as its stage? Very creative! Bedtime Studios’ follow-up Figment 2: Creed Valley keeps very close to the beat of the first one. You don’t need to have played Figment 1 to enjoy this sequel, but I almost feel like you’d be missing you if you didn’t (especially as it’s free on Steam right now, for today only).
Figment 2 has all the visual flair and catchy sing-songs of the first, but it feels weirdly smaller. Both games will run you about 5 hours each, but Figment 2 is a little less punchy, a little less diverse, and feels more like an encore rather than a dazzling comeback album. That’s not necessarily bad; I love an encore, and I enjoyed seeing more of Figment's surreal, subconscious mind-world. But, yeah, it’s very much the same as the first game, but with less scope and fewer fart clouds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of our Resident Evil 4 cover story last month, we showed off a slice of Chapter 5 gameplay in which some fans called out the heavy rain effects for being too intense and distracting. Capcom has heard those complaints and plans on changing the rain to make it more palatable. 
In an interview with Press Start Australia (thanks IGN), the outlet asked RE4 producer Hirabayashi Yoshiaki if the team was aware of the negative response to the rain, and he had this to say: 
“We’ve seen everyone’s reaction to the rain effects, and we are working on a day-one patch to make adjustments”
So there it is. It looks like “raingate” will soon be a thing of the past, and it’s nice that Capcom recognized the complaints ahead of Resident Evil 4’s release.  
Resident Evil 4 launches on March 24 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC. To learn more, be sure to visit our cover story hub for a month’s worth of exclusive features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wild Hearts gets its first free content updates this month in the form of new Kemono (the game’s term for monsters), quests, and more. Players won’t have to wait long because the first DLC hits tomorrow, March 10. 
On Friday, the Deeply Volatile Kemono Set adds the Hellfire Laharback creature for players to hunt alongside an accompanying quest and a new skill. On March 23, the Subspecies Kemeno Pack goes live, which introduces the wolf-like Grimstalker plus a new quest and new weapon/armor model. This update also adds more higher-difficulty quests, three new emotes, and three chat stamps.
Koei Tecmo also confirmed in a Twitter thread that the first update includes unspecified technical fixes too, and plans to share more specifics tomorrow. A tease for April’s DLC offerings teases new Kemeno, Karakuri, and other updates.
Looks like Wild Hearts fans will have plenty to keep them busy in the immediate future, and the (hopefully) performance improvements, whatever they may be, are a welcomed bonus. To learn more about Wild Hearts, you can read our review here.]]></summary>

At the time, no date was given for when the demo might be arriving, but thanks to some seemingly early Twitch ads doing the rounds today, it would appear that Resi 4 demo will be coming later today - presumably once Capcom's Spotlight Showcase stream has wrapped up this evening. Here's hoping it will also be available on PC, and not just PlayStation this time.

An intergalactic radar, in fact, because this is a hospital management game - in spaaaaace! - coming later this year. It's from a Brighton-based indie studio called Brightrock Games, and it sort of looks like Theme Hospital with a space skin, or Startopia with a hospital sim. Neither option is a bad thing, in my opinion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clash: Artifacts Of Chaos is nails, mate. And that's coming from someone who recently reviewed Team Ninja's Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a game that's mighty good at grinding people into paste. I'm not trying brag; I'm being vulnerable with you. I have a case of the Ben Affleck blues, where most sessions of Clash's third-person action-adventuring have me veering from elation to being slumped against a wall with Affleck's signature grimace on my face.
Aside from being really difficult, I'm a bit undecided on how I feel about Clash in the portions I've played so far. It looks fantastic and puts some brilliant spins on combat, but levelling is a bore and exploration has a confusing edge. It's at once both a grand time and an annoying one. The surreal lands of Zenozoik, it turns out, aren't all sunshine and turkey men. There are a lot of turkey men, though.

Today, the Crucial MX500 in its 2TB capacity is down to $102.99 at Amazon US, making it nearly 50% off its MSRP and the lowest price we've ever recorded.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new firmware update hitting the PlayStation 5 today will add Discord voice chat along with other fan-requested features.
The update allows users to link their Discord and PSN accounts to chat with friends through the app. Xbox received the same support last summer, so we’re happy to see it appear on another major platform. You can read more about how to get Discord up and running by visiting the PlayStation Blog. 
Additionally, the update introduces variable refresh rate support for 1440p, allowing smoother visuals for VRR-compatible HDMI 2.1 displays at 1440p resolution. The game library now filters PSVR and PSVR 2 titles. Data transfer between different PS5 consoles has also been added, and PS4-to-PS5 save data transfer has been significantly streamlined. Be sure to visit the PlayStation Blog for the complete rundown of what the update has to offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield, Bethesda's mammoth-sized space RPG, is launching on September 6, the publisher announced in a video today. Additionally, a presentation showcasing more of the game called Starfield Direct will air on June 11. 
In a new video hosted by game director Todd Howard, he states the Direct in June – which happens to be the weekend before E3 starts – will provide a "deep dive" into the game. He reiterates that Starfield is a unique experience that also has many of the hallmarks fans expect from a Bethesda title. We last saw Starfield during the Xbox Game Showcase last summer, where Bethesda revealed its extensive scope, including thousands of planets, spaceship construction, environmental scanning, and other features. 


Starfield was originally slated to launch on November 11, 2022, before getting delayed. It was later reconfirmed to launch within the first half of 2023, and though September sits on the second half of the calendar, we're happy to see the game get a concrete date again. 
Starfield will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will also launch day one on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Chucklefish announced Wargroove 2 today, a sequel to its well-received Advance Wars-inspired strategy RPG. 
Developed by Robotality, Wargroove 2 is set three years after the first game, with a new faction looking to use ancient technology to conquer the now-peaceful land of Aurenia. The main story unfolds across three interconnected campaigns set on land, the sea, and the sky and features a new cast of commanders. It also features a new roguelike campaign called Conquest that tasks players to complete a series of smaller battles while making permanent choices and relying on the same pool of units, health, and resources. 


Wargroove 2 features four-player co-op and versus battles (local and online) along with rule customization and asynchronous play. An in-game editor allows players to create custom maps, campaigns, and even cutscenes to share with other players. 
The first Wargroove was lauded as a fun throwback to Advance Wars when it launched in 2019, so we’re excited to see what Chucklefish has in store for the follow-up. Wargroove 2 doesn’t have a release window, but it’s slated to launch on Switch and PC. You can read out review of the first game here.]]></summary>

Publisher Chucklefish today announced Wargroove 2 in partnership with Pathway devs Robotality. There’s no date set for Wargroove 2’s release, but it’ll launch on PC and Switch whenever it’s ready.

Originally, Bilkins' Folly was due out on just PC but Webbysoft has added PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch to its list of platforms. A release date has not yet been revealed but the game is due in "late 2023." In Bilkins' Folly, you play as treasure hunter Percival "Percy" Bilkins who, with his canine best friend Drayton, embarks on a quest to find their missing family that myseriously vanished years ago. On their journey, the duo will hop islands, solve puzzles, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Have a go of Sons Of The Forest," my compatriots at RPS told me. "It's a great new survival game, with cannibals who live on an island!" And I was like, "wait, so until you turned up to they just eat each other? How do they have a sustainable population? What's going on here?"
Thus, in a spirit of pure scientific enquiry, I booted up Sons Of The Forest and immediately discovered that everyone has been lying to me, because Sons Of The Forest is not a survival game. Sons Of The Forest is very clearly an early 00s b-movie action thriller. The script was left in a filing cabinet in Slough in an empty office until the office was repurposed into a call centre, at which point it was found by a middle-manager whose paintball team thought it was awesome, and somehow he sent it to a game developer by mistake. This is what happened, and you cannot convince me otherwise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wayfinder, an upcoming action RPG with light MMO touches, is being developed by Airship Syndicate, the folks behind Darksiders Genesis and Ruined King: A League Of Legends Story. I've spent some time with the closed beta, poking and prodding at the game's live service cogs to determine whether it's running a smooth operation or a clunky one that may not be worth your time.
And you know what? The game took me by surprise. So far, it's a decent time that's perhaps more along the lines of a Destiny, than say, World Of Warcraft. I genuinely believe it could garner a big community and have a bright future ahead of it - but when it comes to such a saturated space, I worry that Wayfinder may struggle to stand out, and won't attract players who are done with the usual rise 'n grind demands of these sorts of games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse originally released on the Nintendo Wii in 2008 exclusively in Japan. Until this week, it had never been localized for North America, but starting March 9, it will be available on just about every platform with improved visuals and a new photo mode. Fatal Frame is a game all about fighting ghosts in haunted locations with a magic camera, but this will be the first time you can pause the game and take pictures in the contemporary "photo mode" way we are all now familiar with.
This episode of New Gameplay Today ended up being a long one, making it feel a bit closer to our Super Replay series where Marcus Stewart and myself have been playing classic horror games like Dino Crisis and Silent Hill. I promise we do encounter some ghosts, though – you just need to be patient.

If you hunger for something more concrete about how it might differ from its predecessor, as I do, then you might be interested in an apparently leaked list of achievements that contains details of disasters, weather, embiggened map sizes and more.

Anyone who makes or writes music knows that the path to a complete track isn’t a linear one. It’s a process where instruments weave in and out of the composition on the whim of the person making it. And even when the vision is clear, and you know exactly where you want to take the song, be it behind a drum set, a keyboard, a loop track, or even a computer, things can get in the way. Rytmos, developer Floppy Club’s first non-mobile game, nails that feeling. It uses puzzles to extract the joy, escalation, triumphs, and trials of making music, and it does so with g…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-03-07T18:56:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games announced last month that three League of Legends games would arrive this year, including The Mageseeker: A League of Legends story. Now, the company has announced that The Mageseeker will hit consoles and PC next month. 
More specifically, The Mageseeker will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 18. It will cost $29.99 on digital storefronts, and preorders include the Lost Silverwing in-game bonus. You can also purchase the Digital Deluxe Edition for $39.99, and it includes additional digital items like a Silverwing Supply Station Pack, Home Sweet Home cave decorations, exclusive spells, and Unchained skins. 
Check out the game in action in the new trailer below: 


"Developed by Digital Sun, creators of Moonlighter, the Mageseeker is a gritty 2D hi-bit pixel action RPG, set in Demacia, a mighty kingdom in the world of Runeterra that seeks to curtail what it deems as forbidden magic while wielding magic themselves to maintain order," a press release reads. "Play as Sylas, an escaped mage who joins a band of rebels in the deep forest. Their revolution will shatter Damcai's deceptive peace – a peace built with the blood and sweat of mages. The Mageseeker provides an action-packed fantasy gameplay experience for those looking to experience a story of power, identity, and justice." 
Riot Games also revealed today that it is selling a physical Collector's Edition of the game for $169.99. It includes a Sylas statue, an art book, a deluxe art print, the Lux Comic (special edition hardcover), Sylas & Lux enamel pins, and a vinyl soundtrack. All of this comes housed within an exclusive custom box. 

The Mageseeker follows the release of 2021's League of Legends Story game, Ruined King. Check out our thoughts on that in the Game Informer's Ruined King: A League of Legends Story review. The other two games Riot Games plans to release this year are Song of Nunu and Convergence.

Ridiculous, maybe, but these paranoid questions run through my head as Yu climbs a mountain. No safety gear. No helmet. Just his own hands, sneakers, and determination. I have to follow soon after, and though I’m undoubtedly scared, in the moment, I’m much more afraid of killing the creator of Spelunky than my own mortality. Though you could argue, in this hyper-specific example, the game should’ve been a cautionary tale. In Spelunky, you do die a lot. Nevertheless, I don’t want to be responsible for the death of one of the game industry’s most beloved indie developers.

But there is one bit of connective tissue, namely that charging into the fray is generally a bad idea. In the case of the game, that's because The Light Brigade is VR roguelike, one that blends Souls-like dark fantasy with World War II-era weaponry, with you playing a spiritually immortal but physically fragile warrior responsible for saving the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy birthday, anniversary, launchiversary, or whatever you want to call it to the Steam Deck. Valve’s handheld SteamOS games machine has successfully evaded hardware flop status, currently sitting fourth in Steam’s own top sellers list a full year after it began shipping. That’s well deserved, too: the Steam Deck was a fun little alternative way to play PC games when it released, and through a combination of added features, ongoing improvements to game compatibility, and simply a wider choice of great games, it’s a better device now than it’s ever been.


I was originally going to look back on the Steam Deck’s first 12 months with my eyes only, but what fun is a party of one? Thus I invited Valve designer Lawrence Yang and engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais for their takes on the Deck’s past, present, and future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lince Works, the studio behind the Aragami franchise, has announced that it will shut down next month. 
The Barcelona, Spain-based studio, which was founded in 2014, will end development on all of its projects as a result of closing its doors in April, as reported by Gematsu. The studio cites unfavorable "economic context" as the reason it's shutting down after nine years of development, primarily creating 2016's Aragami, its Nightfall DLC, and 2021's Aragami 2. 
Here's the studio's statement on its closing, in full:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer The Outsiders has announced the first piece of premium DLC for its critically acclaimed rhythm-based shooter, Metal: Hellsinger. The game, which challenges you to blast the demons of Hell to the beat of an original soundtrack featuring some of the biggest names in metal, is adding two new original songs to the soundtrack through the first piece of downloadable content.
The DLC, Dream of the Beast, adds original songs from two singers who didn't appear on the main game's soundtrack. Cristina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil and Will Ramos from Lorna Shore join the cast of recognizable singers to contribute to the soundtrack. Dream of the Beast also adds The Red Right Hand, a new machine gun, and three new outfits, each of which provide unique gameplay modifiers.
These updates join the game as part of the Dream of the Beast DLC, but players who don't purchase the premium content also have something to be excited for. The same day the DLC arrives, players can expect a free title update for Metal Hellsinger. This free update adds a new song selection feature.
Both of these updates arrive on March 29 on all platforms. The game, which took home Game Informer's "Best Shooter" award for 2022, is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. For more on Metal: Hellsinger, check out our review here. You can also read our interview with System of a Down singer Serj Tankian, who contributed to the base game's soundtrack, right here.]]></summary>

He declared that accounts engaging in "repeated, egregious weaponization of DMCA on Twitter" will receive temporary suspensions. The problems began when a popular user tweeted a stunning video owned by a professional photographer, who responded by sending a DMCA takedown notice. That sounds straightforward, but this dispute is a lot more complex than that.

In the case of new town builder Outlanders, I'd have to share a house with five other people, the farmer just died of old age, and my leader wanders around doing nothing while occasionally issuing edicts forcing me to have children. But at least there's a chance of pumpkin pie.

Despite my love for large-scale simulation games like Cities: Skylines as an adult, I was not a SimCity player growing up. Instead, I was pulled in the direction of the more manageable SimTown. The zoomed-in town management, where you can micromanage every aspect of your citizens' lives without the massive scope of SimCity, always appealed to me more. Perhaps that's why Outlanders, a simplistic yet challenging settlement builder, has now sunk its hooks into me on two occasions across both of its platforms.
In this small-scale managem…]]></summary>

Yes, this isn't the best gaming SSD in terms of raw speed, but its PCIe 4.0 design means that it uses less power and fewer lanes than PCIe 3.0 alternatives of the same speed, a nicety for desktop use and a big deal for laptops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cities: Skylines II was announced at today's Paradox Announcement Show, and it’s coming later this year.
This follow-up builds upon its 2015 predecessor with new features, such as fully-realized transportation and economy systems. Paradox didn’t reveal too many other specifics beyond stating in a press release that the game features “ a wealth of construction and customization options and advanced modding capabilities.” Cities: Skylines II is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC. Check out the teaser trailer below:


The original game was a big success, having sold over 12 million copies and filling the simulation gap left by SimCity's hiatus. Developer Colossal Order has supported it with multiple updates and expansions, including a VR port and a recent current-gen remaster. You can read our original reviews of Cities: Skylines on PC here and the console edition here.]]></summary>

The super auto-battler did eventually start making custom artwork for its later expansions, but much of the furious fauna was still emojis. That has now changed with today's patch, going back to replace all the old emojis with new animal pictures. Goodbye, old friends.

        <updated>2023-03-06T15:41:34.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Puma has unveiled a new shoe collection inspired by the popular MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV. 
The collaboration will consist of four shoes: two Puma Slipstream models and two RS-X models, as reported by Techraptor. For each model type, there's a (Warrior of) Light version and a Dark version, which basically equates to white and blue-green, and black and purple-pink. All four of the shoes look great but before you get too attached, these shoes are Japan-only for now. There's no word on if they'll come to the U.S. 
Check out the shoes in the gallery below: 

Each of these shoes will cost 17,050 yen, which is roughly $125, according to Techraptor. They will be released in Japan next week on March 15. 
Shoes inspired by video games have risen in popularity, with Converse releasing two sets of Pokémon-inspired shoes last year. Perhaps more than any other shoe maker, though, Puma has been steadily releasing video game shoes. In 2018, it released a pair of sneakers based on Sonic the Hedgehog's iconic red shoes and then in 2020, Puma released a line of Super Mario All-Stars shoes. Puma announced some NBA 2K21 shoes in 2021 and then just two months later, the company revealed an Animal Crossing: New Horizons line of sneakers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I have complained about mightily in the past, I grew up somwhere that didn't have much in the way of entertainment, so me and my friends had to engage in the time honoured tradition of making our own fun. Once we reached about age 17 this included playing poker with a shared second-hand chip set, and trying to do beer centurions (the progress in the latter affecting our interest in the former). I was never any good at it because, though poker was a fixture for several years, I was never really able to learn the rules. What hand is good? Why has your hand beaten his hand? But the little pictures are the best, I don't understand! It's disappointing because understanding poker is a cool adult thing, plus not understanding it makes certain pivotal scenes in James Bond films quite hard to parse.
Last week we got an email (shout out Aidan) singing the praises of Aces And Adventures, and I do try to check out recommendations from readers, even if I don't have time to reply or to write about the games. In this case I've made a special because Aces And Adventures is a great game that is teaching me winning poker hands through the medium of a dwarven warrior smashing things.

What's especially notable about this trailer is the animation style, which is quite unique for both the TMNT franchise and animation in general. It's reminiscent of stop-motion mixed in with the comic-style vibes of Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse, although it's also very much its own thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Cells is one of the best roguelites I've ever played and was one of the standout games in the very crowded 2018. However, its success is only possible through standing on the shoulders of the giants that trailblazed the genre. Of all the franchises Dead Cells drew inspiration from, perhaps no series was as influential as Castlevania. Because of this, the crossover between the two, which comes in the form of premium DLC for Dead Cells called Return to Castlevania, is a natural fit that not only resurrects Konami's dormant franchise but gives a nostalgic shot in the arm to one of the best roguelites available today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has revealed a new Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi game. 
Yesterday, the publisher released a short teaser trailer for the game, running less than a minute, that highlights footage from previous Budokai Tenkaichi games before showcasing what appears to be the new one. In the footage of the new game, we see Goku powering up. And then the words, "Get Ready For Battle" and "A New Sparking Begins" appear on screen. 
Check it out in the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi teaser trailer for yourself below:

「ドラゴンボール Sparking！」シリーズ

March 5, 2023
As you can see, the game might be called, in some variation, Dragon Ball Sparking (that's what the tweet calls it if you use Twitter's built-in translate function, too). But regardless, the trailer ends with "A New Budokai Tenkaichi" begins, quelling any doubt that this is a new game in the series that has laid dormant for 16 years. Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 was released in 2007.  
The teaser trailer doesn't indicate if this is Budokai Tenkaichi 4 or something else but it's exciting nonetheless to see that Bandai Namco hasn't forgotten about the series. It is somewhat surprising to see this announcement, though, considering Dragon Ball FighterZ exists. Budokai Tenkaichi is a fighting game series as well but to see a new one before a sequel to FighterZ, which was released in 2018, is something I imagine not many people could have predicted. 
While waiting to learn more about this Budokai Tenkaichi game, read Game Informer's Dragon Ball FighterZ review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Skyrim came out I was a student, and I worked in Gamestation (RIP) to help pay for chicken noodles. I remember the hype around it very clearly because Gamestation had a deal where you could buy it for like £22, and I had a sideline going when the stock was low to keep some back for my friends. Apols if you were caught in the crossfire for that, but dragon fever was running high off the back of a still very cool trailer, and shouting Fus Ro Dah was the only cure. 
In the years since, Skyrim has been released and re-released many times, on every conceivable platform. "Arrow to the knee" jokes became de rigueur and hacky almost overnight, and at this point might have horse-shoed back around to being funny again. There are many examples of unrelated games or videos that cut to black fading back up into the opening of Skyrim, in a kind of sub-genre of rickroll. Does it hold up now? Kind of. It's a really fun, ambitious RPG, with faults - but if the faults didn't exist maybe it wouldn't have been as popular as it was.

First off, our team developers have implemented a significant update to the file access system in order to use the Secure Access Framework (SAF) API for secure file access on external memory space, such as SD Cards or USB drives. This effectively should resolve a long-standing issue with modern Android devices, in particular those running Android 11 and above, whereby users could not properly access the game data folders or the save game files in the external storage.

This card normally retails closer to £50, with a stated UK RRP of £55, but it has dipped as low as £37.99 for a few days over the past year. 
Still, this is a very reasonable price for a memory card that's good for up to 130MB/s sequential reads and meets the A2 requirements for random performance.

This was obviously a real treat for me as RPS' resident Sims fanatic, but I'll admit I went in with my expectations parked in neutral. After all, the theme of this new-content duo is young families, and that just isn't part of the game I engage with too much these days.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/03/03/square-enix-president-yosuke-matsuda-is-stepping-down"/>
        <updated>2023-03-03T18:51:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yosuke Matsuda, president and representative director of Square Enix, is stepping down after 10 years in the position. 
The official announcement states that he’ll be replaced by the relatively new Takahashi Kiryu, a company director who joined Square in 2020, as part of an organizational restructuring. The proposed change will be voted for approval at the 43rd Annual Shareholder’s Meeting in June. Square Enix’s reason for the change is as follows:
Matsuda became president in 2013, succeeding Yoichi Wada as part of a massive restructuring. His time at the top could be viewed as a bit of a rollercoaster. He pushed for innovation in Square’s flagship franchise, Final Fantasy, and voiced commitment to remaking and re-releasing popular titles from Square’s back catalog, such as Final Fantasy VII. The MMO Final Fantasy XIV also became a global phenomenon under his watch, though the company as a whole has largely struggled to land a massive success outside of the franchise. In recent years, high-profile Square Enix-published titles such as Marvel’s Avengers and Babylon’s Fall had disappoitning releases, with the former ceasing development this year and the latter shutting down this week. 
Perhaps most infamously, Matsuda was also at the front of Square’s tumultuous relationships with its North American third-party publishers, namely Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal, whose titles such as the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy, Deus Ex, and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy were often deemed commercial disappointments. That came to a head last May, when Square Enix sold off these studios and their IPs to Embracer Group.
In recent times, Matsuda was also a vocal advocate for NFTs and blockchain gaming. In January, he published a letter detailing upcoming company initiatives, including making games that incorporate blockchain technology.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Leaks are the bane of every publisher's existence, forcing marketing plans to shift, change, or just get scrapped. But that's partly why I'm enjoying EA's approach for advertising the Skate. reboot. Footage from the open-world skateboarders’ playtest leaked last September, and EA have since responded by releasing their own janky videos. These clips give us a taste of the whacky ragdolling happening right now, and it's probably the most entertaining way of marketing a game while simultaneously sucking the air out of leaks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recommended a pretty wide variety of genres over the years, but I didn't expect a brick breaking game to surprise me like Destructure Colon Among Debris. It's not that I dislike them. They've just never really made much impression (possibly because I don't see all that many)
Destructure blends in a hint of shooting, resource management, and leans into the sheer fun of destruction, replacing bricks with "structures" that aren't meant to be anything specific, but give the whole feeling an impression of combat, an assault you're carrying out rather than a reacting, abstract geometry game.
Also it feels and sounds great to hit stuff. That's probably the bigger reason.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm going to Japan in a couple of weeks, and I am beyond excited. It's been 15 years since I last visited family in Yokohama, and my last memory is one where I'm miserable and I'm staring out of a cab window going back to the airport. I didn't want to leave. It sounds corny as heck, but I can't wait to sucker punch that memory with a swing that's been building for 5478 days, then jab it full of happy ones. Really, I imagine what will happen is I'll get weirdly emotional as the plane touches down and my mate Simon, who I'm going with, will be like, "Get a hold of yourself you buffoon".
I got LINE recently -  a Whatsapp equivalent that's big in Japan - to arrange some meetups with friends and family. Those arrangements have happened, which brings me great joy. But in a surprise plot twist, it meant I got back in touch with a guy called Sam. Now Sam, he's a good bud and we go a long way back. All the way back to the original Gears Of War days. And I think we've arranged, as is custom, to play Gears 6 whenever it arrives. Such is the bizarre way of things.

It was an insightful look at the nuts and bolts of game dev, so I’m glad Ninja Theory are returning to the concept for the spooky action sequel Hellblade 2: Senua’s Saga. The first episode takes a look at Iceland - the sequel's setting - and the team's painstaking commitment to recreating it as realistically as possible. The photogrammartry tech on display is seriously impressive, and following the team to Iceland feels like watching a British travel series, without the crude humour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed that Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers can jump into Metroid Fusion when the game is added to the NSO library on March 8. 
After surprise releasing Metroid Prime Remastered last month, Metroid fans have another game from the series' history to play through, this time in the Game Boy Advance game first released in 2002. Once Fusion is live with NSO, players can finally experience Samus Aran's full 2D series journey on the Nintendo Switch, starting with the original Metroid game all the way through Metroid Fusion and 2021's Metroid Dread. 
Check out the Metroid Fusion Nintendo Switch Online trailer announcing the news below: 


"In Metroid Fusion, interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran is attacked by an X parasite while exploring the mysterious planet SR388," Nintendo's description of the game reads. "This organism is not only deadly, but it can mimic the abilities of any creature it infects – including Samus herself! Saved from the brink thanks to an infusion of Metroid DNA, the X parasite's only natural predator, she soon discovers that the parasite has spread to the research station orbiting SR388. Weakened and out of options, Samus must do whatever it takes to destroy the X threat before it's too late." 
Nintendo says Metroid Fusion contains "a multitude of secrets" for players to experience that links Super Metroid to Metroid Dread. 
Speaking of Metroid Dread, read Game Informer's review of it to find out why it was one of our favorite games of 2021, and then read Game Informer's Metroid Prime Remastered review. Check out our list of every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Sega Genesis, and GBA game on Nintendo Switch Online after that. 
Metroid Fusion hits Nintendo Switch Online next week on March 8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon have quietly dipped their first toe into PC componentS, listing the Amazon Basics Computer Cooling Fan: a single-fan, RGB-lit air cooler. Judging from the manual it supports the very latest socket types for Intel and AMD’s gaming CPUs, and being under the Amazon Basics brand, it's dirt cheap at £21 / £27. 
It’s unlikely, though, that Bezos and the gang have been secretly funding R&D into an all-new line of PC gear. As Tom’s Hardware spotted, the Amazon Basics Computer Cooling Fan appears to simply be an existing budget cooler, the Cooler Master Hyper H410R, without the CM badge.

        <updated>2023-03-02T18:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The overlap of Powerwash Simulator fans and Final Fantasy VII diehards hits in full force today, thanks to the launch of a free DLC pack for the popular sim. You can use your high-pressure hose to blast dirt and grime off of popular locations in Midgar, and the best part is that the experience is totally free.
The Midgar Special Pack is available now for all versions of Powerwash Simulator. It adds five new levels, including Tifa’s Seventh Heaven bar and the Mako Energy Exhibit. Additionally, you’ll be cleaning up vehicles and mechs such as Cloud’s Hardy-Daytona motorcycle, Shinra Hauler, the Scorpion Sentinal, and the Airbuster. The pack also adds new dirt types, such as bio-residue. 


This DLC was created in collaboration with Square Enix, with Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura writing in a press release, 
“When I heard about the proposal for a collab, I was quite busy with various other collabs and reviews, but I was especially excited about this one. I had just been playing PowerWash Simulator and was daydreaming about cleaning things from my titles. My immediate response was, 'let’s wash the entire Shinra building.' Unfortunately, that seemed to be a bit difficult, but the final line-up is exciting, nonetheless. This is something I have been looking forward to a lot, and hope everyone has a great time!”
This pack follows a Tomb Raider-themed expansion that launched in January. This is a pretty neat trend, and see other video game properties added to the game that are in need of good clean-up. 
Powerwash Simulator is available now for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Now though, this 3440x1440 165Hz gaming OLED has dropped in price by a sizeable 26% or £310. That brings the monitor well into three-figure territory at £880, still pricy but a reasonable value given that this Dell monitor is head and shoulders above its IPS, VA and TN opponents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somehow, it's been almost a decade since the last numbered Age Of Wonders game. Despite dipping their toes into the sci-fi realm with Age Of Wonders: Planetfall three-odd years ago, developers Triumph are now returning to their fantastical 4X strategy roots with Age Of Wonders 4, due out on PC in just a couple of months on May 2nd - and what a homecoming it's shaping up to be. I've spent the better part of a week and half playing an early build of AOW 4, getting to grips with its enormous array of customizable factions and hero types in its generous crop of single-player realm maps. 


There's a heck of a lot to get through, but rest assured: this is Age Of Wonders through and through - and thanks to the addition of those new, customizable factions, it's also the most RPG-like entry yet, which is good news for budding D&D-ers looking for a grand, 4X strategy game to sink their teeth into. Heck, I'd even go as far as saying it could be one of this year's biggest and most exciting fantasy games outside of Baldur's Gate 3.

We now know when to expect developer Deck13’s latest, as the team have announced a May 16th date for PC and consoles. Publisher Focus Entertainment say a gameplay reveal trailer is “coming soon”, but for now we can enjoy a couple of new screenshots.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given that Dead Island 2 has been in development for the better part of a decade, it’s understandable to have some trepidation about its quality (and general existence). Developer Dambuster Studios hopes to convince players that Dead Island 2 is not only close to finished but is a worthy follow-up by releasing an extended gameplay walkthrough that provides the rawest look at its action. 
The guided demo follows Irish punk rocker Dani, one of the game's six playable characters, and shows off a lot of the moment-to-moment action across various locales. The gory F.L.E.S.H. system is on full display, as is the wacky makeshift weaponry, including electrified Wolverine-esque claws. We also get a look at the card-based perk system and one strange sidequest involving pizza. 


Dead Island is slated to launch on April 21 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. We recently featured the game on our cover and you check out a month’s worth of exclusive features by visiting our coverage hub.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Martial arts brawler Sifu has put a date on its upcoming Arenas expansion and Steam release: March 28th. We’ve known about the free update since last April’s roadmap, but developer Sloclap have finally released a trailer detailing the new modes in the expansion. All very exciting stuff for fans of the kickpunching adventure, although, if you’re my kind of nerd, you likely got a kick out of all the film references in the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're three weeks away from the release of the Resident Evil 4 remake, and in preparation of its imminent launch Capcom chucked over a fresh batch of in-game footage for us to talk about. The 17 minute long video showcased various sections from the game, including a late-game boss fight and a greatly expanded early area that sees Leon exploring a series of creepy caves.


As Rock Paper Shotgun's Resident Resident Evil Liker, I took it upon myself to obsessively study each individual frame of this video file to uncover its hidden secrets. Surprising even myself, I was able to extract 17 new details about Leon's refreshed holiday to rural Spain. That's one new thing for each minute of the footage! That wasn't intentional! What a pleasing coincidence!

And it succeeds in a surprising way: by making the rest of Half-Life look older.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Jedi: Survivor director Stig Asmussen of Respawn Entertainment wants the series to be a trilogy. 
This news comes from a new IGN Unfiltered interview with the director, which is where Asmussen revealed that even before the release of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in 2019, the team was already discussing sequel ideas. For Asmussen, Cal's story has always been a trilogy in his head. 
"We were already talking about the second game," said Asmussen. "I mean, frankly, we were talking beyond. And these are conversations that, when we're breaking this story with Lucasfilm, it's like: 'Well, where are we going with the second game?' I always wanted to see this as a trilogy. How can we take Cal and the crew to new places beyond what we were doing in the first game." 
Asmussen continues, stating that Respawn had a good idea of where Survivor, which is due out April 28, takes place in terms of the Star Wars timeline. The team also knew what the stakes were going to be, what the tone was going to be, what Cal was going to be up against, and how his crew was going to be factored into all of that. On top of that, Respawn thinks about the ideas "that we could do beyond that as well." 
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was originally due out March 17, but was delayed to April 28. While waiting to get your hands on the game, watch Game Informer's interview with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan, and then check out our exclusive preview of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor for new details about the story, exploration, and combat.

I'm not the new one in sheep’s clothing, because they haven’t released anything yet. Like many, I was especially drawn to The Wolf Among Us, a neo-noir murder mystery set in the same universe as the Fables graphic novels. It would have been quite poetic to return to the series ten years after its debut, but that’s not going to be paw-sibble, as new TellTale have announced that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed out of 2023. There’s no new release window, but maybe it'll be ready in 2024. Hopefully.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's easy to label Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty as a Soulslike that's basically Nioh and Sekiro mashed together. To some extent, that's true. But I think Wo Long is Team Ninja having sanded off some - not all - of the edges from the overwhelmingly complex Nioh, to craft an action RPG with even crisper combat than its predecessor. And crucially, it's more approachable as a result. Clever ranks and meters reward, whether risk-taking is your jam or you're more of a careful type. It may still be a tricky venture filled with demonic, titanic cows that'll want to pound your skull into the dirt, but this is Team Ninja's most encouraging effort yet.

Team Ninja has earned a reputation for crafting some of the most satisfying action games around, nimbly transitioning from the high-octane action Ninja Gaiden series to the Soulslike thrills of Nioh. Its latest effort, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, is an unforgiving but deeply rewarding showcase of freneticism that lives up to this lineage. The smooth swordplay, brilliant boss fights, and novel systems further prove Team Ninja’s ability to craft unrelenting experiences.

That political manoeuvring is intact in King Of The Castle, but this time up to 24 of your friends (or thousands of Twitch viewers) can join your campaign, hopping into the shoes of nobles from various regions. All of them have different goals, all of them can vote on certain decisions, and all of them have the potential to support or backstab the all-powerful monarch: you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has announced a new collaborative initiative called PlayStation PlayMakers. The console giant will partner up with celebrity fans of the brand to “celebrate their passion for gaming and PlayStation” by creating unique experiences for players. One of those famous names is NBA superstar LeBron James, who helped design a limited-edition PlayStation 5 accessories.
The special console plates and DualSense 5 controller were co-designed by James and will release in select countries. The hardware is adorned with artistic elements (including obligatory crowns) and personal inspirational messages by LeBron. There’s no word yet on the prices, but you can only pre-order these items through direct.playstation.com. sometime this year. You can read LeBron's thoughts on the project by visiting the PlayStation Blog. 
Other big names involved with PlayStation PlayMakers include country music star Jimmie Allen, actor and comedian King Bach, and other professional athletes such as BMX’s Nigel Sylvester, WNBA All-Rookie NaLyssa Smith, NFL stars Ja’Marr Chase and CeeDee Lamb, French football freestyler Lisa Zimouche, and Belgian football star Romelu Lukaku. The initiative feels similar to McDonald's recent push of celebrity-branded menu items, so who knows what to expect from these names and others in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Telltale Games has announced that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed and will now arrive in 2024. In a statement to IGN, the team explains it wants to avoid crunching the team and releasing an unfinished product as it moves development into Unreal Engine 5.
Telltale released a brief message on Twitter announcing the delay, but CEO Jamie Ottilie shares more context with IGN. Ottilie discusses the challenges of relaunching the studio in 2019, which were then compounded when the COVID-19 pandemic began the following year. That includes announcing the game when the studio was still staffing up to help secure early funding. Despite those early hurdles, Ottilie states that development has been going well since then, but the team recently decided it wants to adopt Unreal 5 to take advantage of the engine’s new features. Unfortunately, that meant having to redo a lot of the work that had been created in Unreal 4.
With such a big change, Ottilie explains that the only way The Wolf Among Us 2 could still arrive this year would be either to launch it in a less-polished state (which the team wants to avoid given its high expectations) or to overwork the staff. Given that the old Telltale was infamous for crunch and burnout, Ottilie is adamant about avoiding the same practice with this iteration of the studio. 
"I've done [crunch], and I don't want to do it again, and it's not fair to ask it," Ottilie tells IGN. "You can't plan a business around it. So yeah, part of it is about maintaining a healthy work culture. We don't want to burn out our good people.”
The Wolf Among Us 2 was announced at the 2019 Game Awards and will be an episodic title like its predecessor. However, Telltale is developing each episode at the same time, so the entire series will be complete when the first installment launches. You can watch the first full trailer from last year here. The studio’s other project, The Expanse: A Telltale Series, is still slated for this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Diablo IV, Blizzard aims to revamp the danger-infested hellscape of Sanctuary. The world’s five explorable regions – Kehjistan, Scosglen, Fractured Peaks, Dry Steppes, and Hawezar – offer their own flavors of topography, cultures, quests, and, of course, monsters. Blizzard is going to great lengths to ensure these regions are not only fun for players to explore, but feature more narrative cohesion and a stronger sense of place. 
Diablo veterans have explored regions of Sanctuary before, but this time they’re more than one-note areas highlighting a single climate or element, such as snow or desert. Each of them is biodiverse in its own right, with multiple biomes and threats exclusive to them. These realms also blend more naturally together; the lush green of one area gradually withers…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electronic Arts has reportedly laid off more than 200 quality assurance testers at its Baton Rouge office in Lousiana. 
This news comes by way of Kotaku, which reports that EA laid off these workers, who worked primarily on the publisher's battle royale Apex Legends, during a surprise Zoom call yesterday. The publication reports that its three sources were able to confirm the news, which began making rounds on Twitter when both current and former QA testers at the Lousiana office began to share what they had learned. 
EA just fired its entire Baton Rouge studio, which is essentially their entire Apex Legends QA staff.
February 28, 2023
Kotaku reports that around 8 a.m. CT, QA testers were invited to an unscheduled but mandatory Zoom call with Magnit Global, which is the contract agency that manages the workers. It was during this meeting that the entire QA team at the Lousiana office was "disbanded," according to Kotaku. 
The publication reached out to EA looking for a response to the mass layoffs, but the publisher opted not to directly address it, instead stating that as "part of its ongoing global strategy, we are expanding the distribution of our Apex Legends testing team and ending execution that's been concentrated in Baton Rouge, Lousiana, impacting services provided by our third-party provider." Be sure to check out Kotaku's write-up for the full statement from EA and additional context surrounding the layoffs, the Lousiana office, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year our project was accepted to the Google Summer of Code program for the eighth year in a row (and 16th time in total).
The intention of the program is to bring new contributors to open source projects, and the eligibility rules for participants are the same as last year, with both students and non-students welcome to participate. Check the  Google Summer of Code website for details of eligibility.
Participants can apply for either short tasks (about 175 hours) or long tasks (about 350 hours). The coding period typically runs from the start of June to the end of August, but there is some flexibility and the participants can opt to use a longer coding period if they are not available to work full time on the project during the summer.
ScummVM is looking for applicants! A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we’re open to your own ideas too. Please make sure you provide the required information in your application before submitting. We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, and get advice and help on getting started with the project and writing your application.
We have gathered some information to guide you, based on our previous 15 years of experience in the program. You may start your exploration from our Google Summer of Code miniportal.
We are looking forward to your application and participation!
