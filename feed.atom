How to get Star Rage


The only way to get the Star Rage Innate Technique is to roll it when choosing your Innates from the main screen. Unfortunately, Star Rage is a Special Grade Innate Technique which means there is only a 0.25% chance of obtaining it while spinning, which means that with normal luck you will spin a Special Grade every 1 in 400 spins. However, since there are six Special Grades in total, you will need to be even luckier because it's random which one you get. This means if you get luc…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're running a Nightclub in GTA Online and looking to boost your revenue from it, having a celebrity appearance can be immensely helpful.


Nightclubs are certainly one of my favorite activities given the glitz and glam that is associated with it inside the game. Even if you're managing your Nightclub efficiently, having a celebrity appearance is always going to be beneficial. There is an essence of RNG as you can't predetermine which celebrity will appear.


Nevertheless, they're almost always beneficial for your business, and let's take a look at how to attract the in-game celebrities to your joint.


How to make a celebrity appear in your GTA Online nightclub


To attract your celebrities, you'll need to complete certain promotion missions. Go to your Nightclub and login to your PC (in-game) to find Nightclub Management. From there, select "Promote", and you'll begin your promotion mission.



Once the mission has begun, step outside, and you'll find your escort vehicle. Once you enter the vehicle, a timer will begin.


The next job is to reach the next objective but try to avoid damaging the vehicle too much. Especially make sure that you don't end up mowing down the celebrity because that's not going to look too good.


After picking up the celebrity, you'll have to lose the paparazzi. They will be marked on the mini-map, so try and avoid them as much as you can.


After successfully managing to do the last task, you'll have to pick up another personnel for the celebrity.


Once done, you'll have to drop off the celebrity at your Nightclub. Once they have headed inside and spent some time, you'll get a message about the bonus.





Do remember that you can have only one celebrity per night. It's not a mandatory thing to do, but it's always a welcome way to boost your Nightclub's finances.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals features three types of heroes: Vanguards, Duelists, and Strategists. Arguably, the Vanguard can change the tide of battle the most. Traditionally known as tanks, the role of these heroes is to soak up damage to let the rest of their team invade the objective and make their way in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The heavily One Piece-inspired OP: Sailing Kingdom (what do you think the OP stands for?) is finally here with over 45 heroes from the series allowing players to put together their best team and take out hordes of enemies. We've put together an OP: Sailing Kingdom Tier list for all of the heroes so you know which ones to go for to have the best time in Sailing Kingdom.

OP: Sailing Kingdom Tier List


Our OP: Sailing Kingdom Tier List is comprised of unique tiers, in which we have placed all 45 of OP: Sailing Kingdom's heroes. Heroes in the S tier are considered part of the current meta in OP: Sailing Kingdom and are the best heroes in the game. Those in the A Tier are solid options that you can plug into any team and should be used while you work towards those in the S Tier. Heroes in the B Tier are good choices for the early game as well as for F2P players, while those in the C tier are okay at the start but should be replaced as soon as possible. Finally, any heroes in the D Tier are pretty much just to be used as fodder for upgrading your other heroes. Here is our complete OP: Sailing Kingdom Tier List for all Heroes in the game:


S Tier

Enel


Fujitora


Jozu


Kuma


Luffy


Sentomaru


Zoro

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the TOTY promo coming soon to EA FC 25, the NumeroFUT Challenge 1 SBC couldn't have arrived at a better time.


This is the perfect opportunity for you to store as many packs as possible. The latest fodder challenge is extremely easy to complete, and you can do so with items that are already available in your Ultimate Team squad. You'll get a free pack for your efforts, and it could land you with a walkout/promo item if you're lucky.


Let's take a look at how you can complete the challenge and the rewards waiting for you at the end. 


EA FC 25 NumeroFUT Challenge 1 SBC tasks


The NumeroFUT Challenge 1 SBC has one task, and here are its conditions. 


Task 1 - NumeroFUT Challenge 1



Max. Leagues in Squad: 4


Min. Clubs in Squad: 3


Max. 5 Players from the same Nation


Min. 6 Players: Rare


Min. Team Rating: 75


Min. Squad Total Chemistry Points: 27



EA FC 25 NumeroFUT Challenge 1 SBC solutions


The priority should be using items already available in your club, in order to save coins as much as possible. That said, you can also use this solution to complete the SBC. 


Task 1 - NumeroFUT Challenge 1



Conechny ST 74


Clara Pinedo CAM 77


Sarfo CAM 69


Suslov CAM 74


Vesga CDM 77


Duncan CDM 74


Valeri LB 72


Mumin CB 70


Scalvini CB 78


Hugo Novoa RB 69


Gollini GK 76



You can practically get a Prime Gold Players Pack for free of cost. This pack includes 12 Gold Player items, with 6 of them being Rare. Any one of the 12 cards will be rated 82 or higher, raising the chances for it being a Walkout/Promo card.


If I were you, I would just save the pack for two more weeks until the TOTY promo is live and you can try for what would be some of the best items in Ultimate Team.

Its art style wasn’t just well-executed for its time, it’s still considered to be some of the best pixel art to ever grace a cathode-ray tube, while the gameplay is tight and inventive. It is a titan of arcade games.


But there were a lot of them, and they definitely weren’t made equal. While the games by the original developers were all terrific, after SNK’s bankruptcy in 2002, things started getting shaky. However, it wasn’t always bad. In fact, depending on your standards, it was rarely bad, and most of the genuinely terrible chapters in its book are from recent attempts to cash in on its fame.


If you want to get into the series, the advice most would give is to play Metal Slug 1, X, and 3, with sometimes …]]></summary>

It's a great location to earn some money from fishing in the update and is also one of the four areas in which you will need to complete its bestiary to access some new rewards from the update. Here is where you can find the Cryogenic Canal in Fisch.


Cryogenic Canal Location


The Cryogenic Canal can be found near Camp 3 at the Northern Summit as part of the Expedition update for Fisch in Roblox. More specifically, you can find the Cryogenic Canal at the coordinates 19875, 578, 5642.


This area serves as one of four new fishing locales in the Northern Expedition, and the Cryogenic Canal specifically has two fishing spots from which you can catch a variety of fish. The canal itself is found inside a cave near Camp 3.

Full Cryogenic Canal Bestiary


In total there are ten fish unique to the Cryogenic Canal area in the Northern Summit. Like the other areas, the fish in the Cryogenic Canal each have specific seasons, times of day, weather, and bait types they prefer when you are trying to catch them. Here is the full bestiary of all the fish you can catch in the Cryogenic Canal:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Estefania Banini Flashback SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete the challenge to unlock a special card for your Ultimate Team squad.


This is the first Banini promo item we have received in Ultimate Team this year. To play with the card, you'll have to complete the full SBC set before it expires. Let's take a look at the cheapest way to solve the challenge, and if you should invest your resources in it at all.


EA FC 25 Estefania Banini Flashback SBC tasks


The Estefania Banini Flashback SBC has three different tasks, and here are the conditions.


Task 1 - Argentina



Min. 1 Players from: Argentina


Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 81



Task 2 - 83-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 83



Task 3 - 84-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 84



EA FC 25 Estefania Banini Flashback SBC solutions


Here's a set of solution you can use to complete the latest Flashback SBC in EA FC 25. 


Task 1 - Argentina



Any 9 81-rated items


Any 83-rated TOTW item


Cervi 76



Task 2 - 83-Rated Squad



Any 11 83-rated items



Task 3 - 84-Rated Squad



Any 11 84-rated items



If this SBC didn't require a TOTW item, it could have been a good bargain SBC. I am pretty sure that we will soon be getting evolutions that will allow you to upgrade 87-rated items. Banini also offers decent stats, and the rare Half-Winger++ role if you like that. The Technical+ will work well for her body type, as will the Dead Ball, Finesse Shot, and Rapid. 


However, the requirement of a TOTW item makes the SBC more expensive than my liking. You can still complete the challenge for pretty cheap, but it might make more sense to save as much fodder as possible for the upcoming TOTY promo.

We are now in preparation for the upcoming TOTY promo, and there's never been a better time to win free packs to open in the near future. The latest objective is pretty easy to complete, but you'll once again need to don your investigative hats. The first task is to deduce what the mystery nation is before you can complete the objective. 


Disclaimer: Find out the nation. 


EA FC 25 Pro Open Mystery Nation objective guide


Over the last four weeks of the FC Pro Open tournament, EA Sports has been releasing plenty of Mystery Nation objectives. Let's take a look at tonight's Mystery Nation objective. 



Score three goals using a Finesse Shot with a player from the mystery nation in any UT game mode. The name of the nation will be hinted at during the broadcast of FC Pro Open Matchday 5."




The task is pretty simple: you'll have to deduce what the mystery nation is. Next, use any item from that nation to complete the requirements of the objective. The task can be completed in any Ultimate Team mode, including Friendlies. This makes it easy for all to complete the task and unlock the rewards pretty quickly. 


Based on the clues handed out in the official stream, the Mystery Nation is Japan. You'll have to use any Japanese item to score three goals with Finesse Shots to complete the objective. As usual, you can do so in a single game, or in multiple contests. Once you complete the objective, you'll get all the rewards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New year, same tiers.
The new year is finally upon us, and it's time to see how the charts are shaping up for their first appearance in 2025.
Overall, it's much as you might expect. The usual suspects of Hogwarts Legacy and EA Sports FC 25 sit at the top of the table, though Elden Ring continues its surprise resurgence and climbs to third to close out the podium.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much of Balatro's charm comes from how playing cards change with various buffs and peculiar jokers you can unlock as you discover new poker hands. With multiple collaborations ongoing between different games, you can take this charm a step further by making your playing cards look like The Witcher, Dave the Diver, or even Vampire Survivors characters.


How to turn on collab decks in Balatro


You can change the appearance of your Balatro deck by heading into Options, followed by Customize Deck. Here, you'll find categories for each suit, options for high-contrast colors, and arrows to pick between collaboration decks.


Screenshot by Destructoid


You can find the same option in your pause menu if you're already mid-run and want to customize your deck. That way, you won't have to leave the game and potentially mess up your current round.


All crossover decks in Balatro


Currently, Balatro has collab decks with 16 other games:


Spades



The Witcher


Cyberpunk 2077


Shovel Knight


Don't Starve



Hearts



Among Us


The Binding of Isaac


Cult of the Lamb


Divinity: Original Sin 2



Clubs



Vampire Survivors


Slay the Spire


Potion Craft


Warframe



Diamonds



Dave the Diver


Stardew Valley


Enter the Gungeon


1000xRESIST



Since they're split by suit, you can choose which card types to stay the same and which to swap out. In short, if you love one game but don't have an opinion on the others, you can have one or two enabled and keep the rest off.


Unlike decks you unlock through winning runs, using crossover ones won't impact your interest, hands, or discards in any way. They're purely cosmetic, and you can think of them like skins for your decks. You can also use them on any deck type, so you're not limited to using specific ones to see the cards.

The tech experts over at Digital Foundry have weighed in on the recent 'Switch 2' motherboard leak, presenting their views on what the apparent compenents included mean for the power and performance of the upcoming console.
If you've been following along with the Switch 2 rumours for some time now, then much of what DF says probably won't actually come as much of a shock. In a nutshell, the team believes that the console will probably be capable of playing any PS4 game, albeit at a slightly lower native resolution. They're also quick to clarify, however, that this likely won't matter with the additional upscaling from Nvidia's DLSS.

Those eventually grew into their PCIe shoes, but only after months of dial-shifting driver updates – whereas the flagship B580 promises Nvidia-besting games performance from the off. Even at such a stage in the current graphics generation (the GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 could be revealed literally tonight, at CES 2025), there is something enticing about that proposition.

We are mere days away from the arrival of the former PlayStation Vita exclusive, Freedom Wars, on Switch. Ahead of its 10th January release date, Bandai Namco has shared a new trailer, setting up the story and showcasing all the fresh features we can expect to find in Freedom Wars Remastered.
The trailer serves as a good starting point for those unfamiliar with the 2014 Monster Hunter-esque action title. Narrated by your AI assistant, Percy Propa (complete with a nasty AI voice, we might add), the trailer explains that Freedom Wars sees you thrown into a dystopian future, where everyone is forced into a life of servitude under a one-million-year prison sentence. Those who want to make it out will have to prove they are worthy on the battlefield, teaming up with other trendy teens to take down massive foes.

Let's see if we fare better this time round: Sonic Galactic is an absurdly accomplished Sonic fangame from Starteam that, broadly, imagines how the Mega Drive and Genesis platformers might have looked and felt had they been made for the Sega Saturn. There's a new demo, if you fancy trying it for yourself. Please find it here on Itch.io. Perhaps if I'd put the download link higher up the page in the other article, people would have got distracted and refrained from dunking on me so awfully.

Not only is it relatively easy to unlock the Angel Race, but completing it can help you get some useful rewards and unique passives. To do so, you'll have to complete all four stages of the race.


How to start Angel Race in Blox Fruits


Triggering the Angel Race depends heavily on luck, as you can also spawn the Human, Rabbit, or Shark Race. The Angel Race has a 12.5% chance of being spawned, but you can use a Race Reroll to help your cause. You can purchase Race Reroll from the Tort NPC in exchange for 3,000 Fragments.

Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules. But it's still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.

Since you can't trade gold stickers outside of this event, it's a rare opportunity to get specific cards during brief 24-hour periods before being restricted to card pack opening again. 


It's also rare for Golden Blitz events to repeat past cards, meaning you might miss out on one you need if you're not online during a specific time. Let's check out every past Golden Blitz sticker during the Monopoly Games season to determine whether you'll still get an opportunity to trade a particular card.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sunshine, lollipops and chainsaws everywhere.
Cutting a bloody swathe through an army of the undead, Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP joins Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered on Switch. Both games complement each other as flawed but enjoyable examples of Grasshopper Studios' beloved catalogue. An idiosyncratic collaboration between Suda 51 and filmmaker James Gunn, Lollipop Chainsaw highlights the unique style of both creators. It’s a hyper-stylised, quip-heavy action game that remains a uniquely demented experience. Sadly, content omissions and some choppy performance hamper this remaster, tainting the colourful mayhem.
The plot is both a perfect representation of its era and a great opportunity to experience Gunn in a goofy horror mode that was stifled when the MCU beckoned. On the morning of her eighteenth birthday, cheerleader Juliet Starling is inconvenienced by a zombie outbreak in her hometown. Luckily, Juliet comes from a long line of zombie hunters, the undead horde is no match for her skills with a chainsaw and a set of pom poms. Unable to save her boyfriend from a bite, Juliet decapitates him and carries his magically animated head on her belt. Together, they must battle through high school and defeat five musically themed dark lords, summoned by an angry goth kid named Swan to end the world.

This past weekend brought us one of the most convincing leaks yet with a pair of photos depicting what appears to be the left Joy-Con from the upcoming 'Switch 2'.
At first glance, it looks pretty much how we'd expected: larger yet with a familiar design, and a new magnetic rail that backs up previous reports on the console's upgrades over the current Switch. Upon closer inspection, however, the Joy-Con may also be housing an optical sensor on the side, right next to the 'SL' button.

That's specifically RPGs with "AAA" budgets, whatever AAA means these days. Cain is, of course, well aware that there are many RPGs from smaller teams that "evolve past the paradigm of violence being the default way in which the player interacts with the world", and that there are plenty of puzzle games, adventure games and the like in which there is no violence at all.

It is, like Dark Souls, a game about equipment and stamina management, but it finds most success as a soulslike in the sensation that you are alone somewhere bad, not able to do very much except hit horrible things in the space between them trying to hit you. It also offers notable moments of lonely, loud footsteps rebounding off cold stone tiles in the seconds after felling some giant man-bastard - one of the subgenre’s greatest un-joys.

Łoziński lists his work on the Unreal Engine 4 "cpu/gameplay optimisation" for the PS5 version of the game, but he also claims to have done the same — as well as "lead, vulkan rendering" duties — on two further, unspecified platforms.

Where the ripple encounters larger masses, such as planets, suns and... other things, it rebounds, riding the weft of stardust back down to Earth. As it returns home, the signal is modified.

One of the biggest surprises of 2024 was undoubtedly the release (and accompanying marketing campaign) of Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club. It marked the first proper new entry in the Famicom Detective Club franchise since 1989, bringing with it a whole bunch of dark, mature themes that we don't often see from Nintendo these days.
In fact, in a new interview with Inverse, producer Yoshio Sakamoto and assistant producer Kaori Miyachi commented on the game's development, with Sakamoto specifically noting how surprised he was that Nintendo opted to approve the project so willingly considering its more mature content. Miyachi, meanwhile, was significantly more confident:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a lot of great fan-made Sonic the Hedgehog games out there. Sega has been notoriously chill with fans of the Blue Blur using its characters in their own projects, and there are even a handful of community-driven remakes of old games that could use a modern touch-up. The one we’re talking about today is Sonic…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam Deck, Mac, and other Linux-based enjoyers of superhero shooter hit Marvel Rivals can once again play without fear of being pulped under an unlawfully swung banhammer. Developers NetEase had recently doled out bans of up to 100 years to players they suspected of cheating, but in their eagerness, failed to distinguish between legitimate compatibility layers – the software that non-Windows operating systems, like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS, use to run native Windows games – and actual hacks. Per IGN, NetEase have now apologised to the affected players, and lifted the bans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll be blunt: the only thing that really entices me about SpaceCraft is that it's from Shiro Games, creators of such robust RPG and strategy fare as Dune: Spice Wars, Evoland, Northgard and Wartales. As a concept, at least, SpaceCraft seems both flavourless and oddly inclined to overplay its own familiarity. I mean, look at that title. Consider its chilly blend of functionality and punmanship. Look at that capital "C", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft. This you may do eternally, for there are thousands of planets in store.

I’m busy replaying The Suffering 2 for the sixth time to see a new 15 second cutscene that recognises which combination of morally aligned beginnings and endings I’ve picked. It reads your save from the first game and everything!". Say ‘memory card’ to a youthful, broccoli-maned Fortnite enjoyer nowadays. Go on, I dare you. You’ll be in a home before you know it.
Still, having new toys at regular intervals is one real upshot of our new live-service barrage of ephemeral novelty, perpetually flung at my dizzy eyeballs like gleaming carnival daggers at exhausted spinning wheels. Especially if they’re for the exquisite strategy of Mechabellum. Season 2 released yesterday alongside patch 1.2, bringing with it a new unit and specialist, some reworks, and lots of cosmetic bits I pretend not to care about but then get excited when I unlock a new one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I come and go with the work of Ken Levine, celebrated auteurman and reported burnout-inducing manager, but I'm interested to see more of Judas, his current project at Ghost Story Games. The concept for Judas is that you're trapped in a computer-run society housed aboard a colony ship, the Mayflower. The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. "Bioshock Infinite in space", we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.
In Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.

Clicked a camera button. Placed an object upon a table. They had touched things, and beyond this, they had felt them. They knew that the player could never truly be Indiana Jones, but they could be allowed to make a pretend man who sounded at least 83% like Indiana Jones do things with his hands that very much resemble the sort of things Indiana Jones might do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brendan Greene, the modder-turned-millionaire who designed battle royale game PUBG: Battlegrounds, wants to make his studio's next game a "metaverse", although he says he's wary of using the term. The project is called "Artemis" (at least for now) and you won't be seeing it any time soon. That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. 
Greene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led "multiverse of worlds" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox. He is nonetheless "full of confidence".

It's like scrutinising a Hitman level from above, except that all of these people have evolving relationships and sleeping patterns and they might hunt you down if you murder any of their relatives.

The newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel "Seith" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven't updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as "Ghost Of A Tail" is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.

Official data made available to the public is limited but with help from data provided by an anonymous source, we can identify key trends from a very controversial year.

Or at least, it was middling for my own personal taste, which is quite unsavoury at the best of times. Most of my best picks made it into the calendar proper, but a couple didn't.

Anyway, hope you all have a restful Xmas folks and a cracking new year. I hope Santa bought you some nice warm socks or a chocolate orange so dense, you could tee it off at your local golf club.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. 


So! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.

The court found that Cloudflare's services are instrumental in facilitating access to live pirate streams, undermining Italy's 'Piracy Shield' legislation. The order, which applies in Italy, affects Cloudflare's CDN, DNS resolver, WARP and proxy services. It also includes a broad data disclosure section.

Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

Despite the win, the broadcaster was disappointed that the court had found the company behind Rojadirecta liable, but not company owner Igor Seoane. After the Supreme Court held that Seoane could be held liable, last Friday a court confirmed total damages of $33 million, with Seoane and the company jointly liable for half of that amount.

Historically, domain name registries have been hesitant to take action but with the right approach, progress can be made. This week, anti-piracy group BREIN reported that following their complaints, the .nl and .eu registries took action against several 'pirate' domains. On closer inspection, it appears that copyright has little to do with it.

The only thing missing from his account of the game was the bread needed to make that rich, meaty concoction a tasty, nourishing sandwich.
And by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m hoping you’ll forgive a spot of mission-bending here, given Should You Bother With? Is usually intended to test out the new and the strange of gaming hardware. Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.
Recently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clambering deep out of the Contemplation Pit, where reading reviews or opinions or, god help you, Takes, is forbidden, I am curious to learn how people have been categorising Songs of Silence. Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.
Taxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time. But even if you absolutely, utterly, and correctly loathe card-based systems, this game has none.

It begins as a "fireball of occult potentiality," dangling in the Great Hall of the Unseen University, which evolves into a ghostly "embryo universe." The embryo expands "lightly as a thought," with spectral continents "sleeting" through walls and people. It surges across the landscape until the entire population and geography of the Disc is exactly duplicated and enclosed by a shimmering shadow-self of "shining threads that followed every movement."

This meant players were invited to drop everything and head for home - to embark on one last great stand against the final, desperate, and dangerous alien attacker: a Thargoid Titan called "Cocijo". Don't worry, they got him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At any given moment I am in the center of a wonderful vortex of skeletons. Bones splash and rattle and burst out of the ground in sharp, horrible spurs. My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.
This is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. 


Speaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.

The dog was called Senator Umeshefaat, and he was very civil, even if he was shedding his black and white fur everywhere. We spoke in his home village at dawn. Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was "hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal." I suppose every politician has their enemies. 
That Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.

Previously, on my mission to survive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl with only wild mutants as my weapons, I’d discovered clues that someone else was attempting to tame the Zone’s beastly inhabitants. With one of their electronic tracking collars in hand and absolutely no preexisting knowledge of their location, I set out to find this kindred spirit, only for the Zone to once again slam a door in my face.
A cold, steel, very literal door to boot. It turns out that the scientist’s laboratory is locked up tight, and will remain so until I delve about twenty hours deeper into the faction war that’s bubbled up while I’ve been running around throwing irradiated rats at people in tracksuits. Fine. Fine! But I’m keeping the collar.

Since then the modding team has grown to 40 people and the scope of the mod's features has ballooned. It's now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff 'em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First revealed all the way back in December 2023, Archetype Entertainment and Blur Studio's sci-fi action adventure Exodus hit us with a few things: Matthew McConaughey is involved, it looks a bit like Mass Effect, it's being developed by BioWare veterans, and it loves a bit of time dilation. In October of this year, we got a look at some icky celestial faction and zero in the way of actual gameplay. And now? Now we finally get a look at how you do things. Like sucker-punching armoured space bears in the face with electro-pistols.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After much teasing, the vicious tyrants of Arrowhead Games and their noxious puppets, the "democratic government" of Super Earth, have announced the very first Helldivers 2 licensed crossover. In yet another hollow display of solidarity and "Liber-tea", they've teamed up with the loathsome fascists of Killzone, the elderly shooter series from Sony and Guerrilla Games.
From today, you'll be able to buy weapons, armour and cosmetics belonging to Killzone's despicable stormtroopers from the Helldivers Superstore, and there's the suggestion of an additional Killzone-themed reward depending on the fortunes of the so-called Galactic War, a xenocidal bloodbath couched as an exercise in bringing "freedom" to the upstanding socialist Automatons, the blameless wildlife of the Tyranids, and the Wellsian cosplayers of the recently added Illuminate faction.
We here at Rock Paper Shotgun stand against Super Earth and Arrowhead's wanton aggression, which absolutely isn't a big satirical joke based on some Verhoeven film or other. Anyway, those capes. Find an image and further details below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Times Of Progress is a special game for me, because it's the first news tip I have ever received from Sin Vega, Prime Minister of Strategy Gaming. Sin once described writing news articles for our former news editor Alice0 (RPS in peace) as like practising backflips in front of the kung fu master. Writing about a new city builder at Sin's suggestion is like being invited to budget the development of Londinium by Julius Caesar.
The terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences - has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months. Today I bite the bullet, and emerge from my lodgings to issue a hesitant speech to the masses, hoping like hell that Caesar is too preoccupied with the latest Gaul uprising to notice my errors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toy Box sounds like a very Xmassy game, but then you watch a trailer, and realise that it is not very Xmassy at all. It's a free visual novel with a macabre puzzling element. The setup is that you're a toy inspector working for a jovial Grand Toy Maker, his face hidden above the top of the screen. Your job is to disassemble toys - five in all - according to his eldritch written instructions, and either "salvage" them or "sentence" them to the incinerator.

If you missed the reveal, perhaps because you value sleep over the spectacle of Geoff Keighley's fashion friends, let me catch you up: in Nightreign, you pick one of eight preset characters and explore a parallel-universe version of Elden Ring's Limgrave map, fighting lesser foes and levelling up quickly so that you can battle a boss at the end of each 15-minute in-game day.
