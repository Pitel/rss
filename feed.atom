Ubisoft is the latest company to lay off employees, with the French publisher's Montreal studio (Assassin's Creed) reportedly hit the hardest, cutting 98 jobs. In total though, Ubisoft is axing 124 jobs as part of a global company restructure.
Some of the positions impacted include administration and IT jobs, along with Ubisoft's IT and SFX teams. It's doing this to streamline operations and enhance the company's overall collective efficiency. Notably, production teams won't be impacted by this restructure:

Nintendo and Sony may not have the best history, but it seems they'll be teaming up for a live-action Legend of Zelda movie.
Yes, in case you somehow missed it, Miyamoto recently took control of Nintendo's social channels and announced a Zelda movie project had been in the works for "many years" now. There's still a lot to take in here, and one thing you might not have realised just yet is Sony is actually involved.

For those who haven't squared off against this gas-masked psychic, one of his powers was the ability to read your memory card and make note of what you've been playing. This largely hinged on how many Konami games you had saved, but it was still wild at the time. Look, it was 1998, so having a character call out Castlevania: Symphony of the Night was more than enough to blow your mind. 


Psycho Mantis can name a small handful of games you've been playing. For those he doesn't mention by title, he'll say something generic like "You like action games!" Been jamming Azure Dreams or Suikoden? He'll hit you with the "You…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's that time of year again! The nominations reveal for The Game Awards, happening on December 7, will occur on Monday, November 13, with tickets available now.




According to Geoff's tweet, over 30 categories will be announced, including the highly-anticipated Game of the Year. This year has seen many acclaimed games, with titles such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kigndom, Baldur's Gate III, and Alan Wake 2 making big waves. Last year, the Game of the Year went to FromSoftware's Elden Ring. It'll be interesting to see what gets nominated this year, as well as what dark horses and snubs may appear, much like years past.


For those who want to experience the show in-person, tickets are now available for purchase. The event will take place at the Peacock Theater. Previous years had the show at Microsoft Theater, but no reason was given for the new location. Ticket prices range from $81 to $181, depending on where you choose to sit in the Orchestra section.


Starting in 2014, The Game Awards, created by Geoff Keighley, is in its 10th year. While the event did exist prior in the form of 2013's VGX and Spike Video Game Awards, the show was a little loose with its presentation. In years since, The Game Awards have become a bit more prestigious, and now loosely resembles other music and movie award shows. 


Still, expect many big announcements, much like years prior. Famous announcements in the past include Xbox Series X, Death Stranding 2, and Joker from Persona 5 in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After nearly two years toiling away in the Early Access mines, developer Stray Bombay has announced that The Anacrusis officially launches this December. 


The Left 4 Dead-like has been tweaked and patched 53 times since it entered Early Access. More than a million players have tested the game and seem to like what they've experienced. The Anacrusis has managed to maintain a 'Mostly Positive' rating on Steam. It's a more optimistic response than other games that have aped the legendary zombie co-op game.

It's like Left 4 Dead with a retro vibe and aliens


In case you're not up to date and your eyes glossed over while reading the prior paragraph, The Anacrusis is a first-person co-op game akin to Left 4 Dead and Vermintide. The former makes sense as the studio was co-founded by Chet Faliszek, a former Valve writer who worked on the original L4D games. 


The Anacrusis doesn't shy away from its inspiration. Like L4D, a team of up to four players gets together to shoot their way through multiple stages. The game also includes an AI Director that keeps an eye on players and their progress, altering things like ammo or weapon spawns. If you're doing too well, then the Director may try to knock you down a peg.


The Anacrusis isn't a carbon copy of its spiritual predecessor, though. It rocks a retro '70s vibe and some kitschy flair with occasionally salmon-colored environments and weaponry. You also fight against hoards of aliens, as opposed to infected, taken, Ridden, or whatever the hell else we want to call zombies these days.

Considering its pedigree and the surrounding early praise, The Anacrusis may be the L4D-style game to try when it launches out of Early Access in December. The full version is available on the Steam Store on December 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ll be getting a deeper look at the future of Playdate in an upcoming live stream. The company announced that it will be hosting a 12 minute showcase via YouTube on November 8 at 9a.m. PST. 


The showcase is set to introduce developers working on the next slate of Playdate games and to offer some insight into “more fun stuff on the horizon.” In a follow-up message, Playdate teased what that fun stuff might look like. The company wrote, “No big hardware news, but keep an eye out for something blue & new.”

Save the date


Playdate was first announced back in 2019, and the little handheld console made its way into gamers' hands for the first time in April 2022. The console’s games follow a bit of a strange release schedule. The first “season” contains 24 different games, which become available two-per-week after you first get your device. Those are the flagship titles, and other games can be bought through Playdate's Catalog service or sideloaded onto the device.


Thanks in part to the handheld’s unique approach, Playdate has skyrocketed in popularity. A year after its launch Playdate had sold over 50,000 units. That’s more than double what developer Panic had projected and orders were backlogged into late 2023. Currently it’s possible to pre-order a Playdate for when the next batch of devices arrives. 


The November 8 showcase could shed some light on when Playdate will be more readily available. It will also finally give owners and people with a pre-order waiting in the wings a peek at what Playdate’s second season of games will look like.

Dubbed for the insignia Commander Shepard bears throughout their journey in the original trilogy, it's usually a day of celebrating the series and some news about future projects.


While the amount of news has varied over the years, BioWare has a new Mass Effect in the oven. So naturally, the developer revealed an ARG trail today that led to some cryptic teasers. The good news, is they're for the new Mass Effect. The less exciting news? They're pretty slim.


After the first two trailers, code-named Epsilon and Oculon, were revealed showing a mysterious figure in an N7 jacket walking, the Nebula trailer gave us a full-on view of our enigmatic strider. It is... someone wearing a helmet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has confirmed that it's working on a live-action film for The Legend of Zelda.


In a statement, Nintendo confirms the Zelda movie will be produced by Shigeru Miyamoto and Avi Arad, the chairman of Arad Productions.


Director Wes Ball has already been tapped to helm the project. Ball's previous work includes The Maze Runner theatrical adaptations, as well as the upcoming Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.


The live-action Zelda film will be co-financed by Nintendo and Sony, with the former covering over half. Worldwide distribution will be handled by Sony Pictures Entertainment. And notably, Nintendo is developing the picture themselves.


"By producing visual contents of Nintendo IP by itself, Nintendo is creating new opportunities to have people from around the world to access the world of entertainment which Nintendo has built, through different means apart from its dedicated game consoles," reads today's statement.


Nintendo's cinematic universe


After the runaway success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, it was easy to speculate over which Nintendo property might see its next film adaptation. After all, video games are big in the adaptation field right now, whether it's on the silver screen or at-home streaming.


A live-action adaptation direction is an interesting one, though. The adventures of Link and Zelda certainly seem ripe for cinema. But whether this will be an adaptation of a game or, more likely, an amalgamation of ideas into a new-but-familiar narrative, remains to be seen.


Still, it somehow means that we are, indeed, getting a Legend of Zelda film. Let many months of speculation about who will play Link, and whether they will speak, commence.

        <updated>2023-11-07T20:00:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Remedy Entertainment dropped a new update for Alan Wake 2, one that should clear a few progress-halting issues some players are having. Oh, and apparently it fixes that one annoying problem that seemingly keeps coming back. 


The latest update is on the smaller side, but it's likely a welcome sight for anybody stuck due to a bug. Last week's update brought a whopping 200 improvements and fixes to the game, covering everything from lip-syncing to overall polish. However, there was one that came back — ironically enough, just like an echo. 





Latest Alan Wake 2 update fixes Hotel progress-halting issues again (maybe)


The last patch attempted to fix an Echo not aligning correctly in the Oceanview Hotel Lobby. Remedy itself called it "annoying" while issuing an apology. The bug has been a hard one to squash and is addressed once more in the new patch. Remedy writes that it was "fixed in the previous update, but Echo hell still persisted." 


Here are the patch notes via Remedy:



Xbox Series

A workaround fix for the issue where the audio cut out intermittently in the Prologue. We are expecting a full fix for this issue in an upcoming update.




ROOM 665

Fixed an issue (again) with the Echo scene not aligning and unlocking correctly (this was fixed in the previous update, but Echo hell still persisted)  




LOCAL GIRL

Fixed an issue with a mouse (with a big presence) blocking progress.





Hopefully, Remedy managed to slay the Echo dragon once and for all. Of course, we'll know for sure when the next update rolls our way.


Remedy is also working on an update that will add New Game Plus mode to Alan Wake 2. There is no solid release date for it, but the mode will add new Manuscript pages and video content to slightly alter the narrative.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Ubisoft will lay off 124 employees as part of a cost cutting strategy. These departures are happening across several of its departments, including many at its Canadian offices.


The layoffs are hitting a variety of departments at Ubisoft, including some administrative teams, Ubisoft IT, and Hybride, the company’s SFX studio. In a statement to Kotaku, the company explained the reasoning behind the move. 


“Ubisoft is proceeding with a collective dismissal in its Montreal establishment within the framework of a reorganization of its production support services across Canada, by consolidating these functions Canada wide, Ubisoft will be able to optimize its resources to be more sustainable in the long term.” 


The company also said it is “providing comprehensive support for our colleagues who will be leaving Ubisoft during this transition” and emphasized that the current restructuring won’t have an effect on its production teams.

Déjà vu


Ubisoft as a whole has been facing challenges lately. Lengthy delays for games like Beyond Good and Evil 2 and xDefiant have undoubtedly affected the company. Just this May, Ubisoft let go dozens of employees at its North Carolina and Newcastle locations. Employees at the time said they were given no notice that they would be losing their jobs.


Sadly this is part of an ongoing trend in the gaming industry this year.  In September Epic Games cut 16% of its workforce. Just last month Naughty Dog and Telltale Games were hit by a wave of layoffs. More than a dozen different companies have faced layoffs in the back half of 2023 alone.

More specifically, subscribers will get access to the Crunchyroll Game Vault. Members will have access to the new feature starting today.




The vault is open


Crunchyroll plans to add new games to the library over time, but as of today, there are five launch titles. Here are the five launch titles:



Captain Velvet: The Jump+ Dimensions


River City Girls


Wolfstride


Behind the Frame: The Finest Scenery


inbento



Unfortunately, it looks like for now only Android versions of the above games are available, though the press release indicated iOS versions are coming soon.



"Crunchyroll Game Vault is a curated, focused library of premium titles for the global anime fan that loves gaming, adding even more value to Crunchyroll memberships by connecting fans with anime-infused content. With Crunchroll Game Vault, we're also looking forward to working with international developers to bring their titles to mobile for the first time or introduce existing mobile games to the Crunchyroll community as part of an amazing line-up."
- Terry Li, Executive Vice President of Emerging Business at Crunchyroll



Crunchyroll is already essentially a much-have for Anime fans in America, so any additional value can probably be considered a win. I recently resubbed to check out a ton of the new shows that are starting up in recent and future months, so I'll probably check out some of the games on the vault as well.


The Crunchyroll Game Vault is available today for Crunchroll premium subscribers.

Revealed at Gamescom back in August and coming to Switch (and Steam) in 2024, Wild Country is described as "a cozy-competitive card game with city-building elements" by its developer, Lost Native.
The game involves constructing buildings for the critters of Big Sky County while collecting cards and engaging friends and/or family in a competitive game of strategy. The deck/city-building elements bring to mind classics like Slay the Spire and SimCity, and the emphasis on competition appears to add some humour and spice to the cosy aesthetic, something we've seen plenty of over the past few years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Glory Society posted an announcement on Twitter today stating that they have decided to “suspend operations” and that “this is the end of the development of Revenant Hill.”


According to the announcement, the team has disbanded after two members had to depart due to health reasons. Considering the small size of the team, the task of replacing even two members was too difficult. They also cite the “schedules, budgets, and fraught task of reworking the whole project” as reasons why the team has decided to call it quits.




Glory Society's Scott Benson, in a separate Tweet, has said that he has been diagnosed with severe heart failure, most likely resulting from a virus, and that it will "greatly limit [him] for the foreseeable future."


The team was working on Revenant Hill. It was set to be a game about a cat trying to make ends meet at the edge of a graveyard. Notably, it involved the co-creators of Night in the Woods. The art style is pretty unmistakable. The game was shown off as part of the May 2023 PlayStation Showcase, but unfortunately, it sounds like it isn’t to be.


The Glory Society's announcement goes on to say that “after the dust has settled, perhaps we’ll talk about what we’ve made and learned together.”


Like most creative endeavors, game development requires a great deal of dedication and passion. Setbacks are the truest test of both those things, and overcoming them proves a lot more than any individual success. Hopefully, this isn’t the last we hear from the individual developers of The Glory Society.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Ubisoft is the latest developer to join 2023's wave of layoffs. According to IGN, the company laid off a total of 124 employees. 98 of them were based in Canada, which IGN calculates as roughly 2% of the company's Canadian workforce. The cuts included administrative and IT workers, some of whom were employed at the Hybride VFX studio, a company that has worked on shows like Ahsoka and The Mandalorian.


"These are not decisions taken lightly and we are providing comprehensive support for our colleagues who will be leaving Ubisoft during this transition," the company told both IGN and Kotaku. "We also want to share our utmost gratitude and respect for their many contributions to the company. This restructuring does not affect our production teams." Another quote obtained by Kotaku claims that the layoffs are to allow Ubisoft to "to optimize its resources to be more sustainable in the long term."
This news comes after a year of several big Ubisoft releases, including Assassin's Creed Mirage, The Crew: Motorfest, and Just Dance 2024, but that's in spite of the fact that they canceled several games this year and delayed Skull and Bones... again. Unrest at the company has been ongoing as well: back in September, IGN reported widespread frustration after employees were suddenly called to return to in-person working conditions.
Ubisoft now joins Bungie, Media Molecule, Telltale Games, Team17, Epic Games, Naughty Dog, Microsoft, and more on the unfortunately long list of companies that have laid people off in the past year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Digital Eclipse has announced via Twitter that they will reveal the next game in their Gold Master Series during the Day of the Devs The Game Awards Edition on December 6, 2023. This follows this year’s August release of The Making of Karateka.


The Making of Karateka feels like an evolution in re-releasing older games. While Karateka itself might be a tough sell in today’s market, Digital Eclipse contextualized it using a tonne of behind-the-scenes footage, documents, and interviews. With this added context, it’s a lot easier to appreciate the game in the spotlight. Beyond that, it also provides great insight into not just the rigors of game development but the business as it was at the time.




The Making of Karateka was advertised as the first in their Gold Master Series (though it followed the foundation they set with Atari 50). No other titles have been officially revealed. I can definitely think of more than a few that I’d like to learn more about.


The developer was recently acquired by Atari, who has seemingly pivoted to the business of game preservation and has suggested an eagerness to work with Digital Eclipse on similar projects. The chances that the subject this time will be a game from Atari’s history is definitely greater than zero. At the same time, it might not be.


We’ll have to wait and see at Day of the Devs The Game Awards Edition on December 6, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games is in court trying to prove that Google is running an illegal monopoly with their Google Play store. As part of the trial, Epic Games Store boss Steve Allison has admitted that the Epic Games Store is still not profitable, according to reporting by The Verge.


If this sounds extremely familiar, it’s because Epic tried to get a similar ruling against Apple. It went pretty poorly for them at that time. I guess all those layoffs the company performed freed up enough budget to pay their lawyers for another go. If at first you don’t succeed.


Speaking of not succeeding, the Epic Games Store doesn’t seem to be. We knew it wasn’t turning a profit from emails revealed in 2021. Part of this is because the company has been doling out money to try and secure exclusivity for certain titles and giving out others for free to try and drive adoption of the platform. More specifically, the leaked emails showed that Epic paid $146 million for Borderlands 3 to be exclusive to the platform.


To put it more into perspective, Epic thought if they gave out free games, secured exclusives, and gave developers a better share of the sales, they would be able to get people to adopt their platform and secure 50% of the PC market. They previously said they expected to start bringing in an annual profit by 2023. Four years later, that strategy still hasn’t worked. Meanwhile, this past September, they laid off 16% of their workforce. When that fails, I suppose the next logical step is to sue your way to success. We’ll see how that works out for them this time.


The Epic Games Store launched in December 2018. It is still not profitable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of Apple's key selling points of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are the devices' ability to play some pretty modern and demanding games. One of which is the recent Resident Evil 4 remake, and it's launching on compatible iOS devices soon.


Capcom announced that the Resident Evil 4 remake will be coming to the iPhone 15 Pro on December 20. It will also be available for iPad and Mac devices with the M1 chip or later on the same day.







The Ada Wong-focused DLC, Separate Ways, launches alongside the core game. It features additional content that resolves around "a secret mission that expands on the adventure and features thrilling new game mechanics."


The preorder available now enables a demo of Resident Evil 4. It showcases the beginning of Leon Kennedy's otherworldly endeavors, and gives you a feel for how the game works on mobile devices. You can play via the device's touchscreen or with compatible bluetooth controllers. It's also cross-platform playable with a single purchase so you can easily transfer play across your iPhone 15 Pro, iPad, or Mac. The latter of which offers keyboard and mouse controls. 


Resident Evil 4 isn't the only prominent console title heading towards mobile. Ubisoft also confirmed it will be bringin Assassin's Creed Mirage to iOS platforms. And Capcom's Resident Evil Village launched for the aforementioned Apple devices on October 30. 


Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil Village, and Assassin's Creed Mirage are all landing on modern iOS devices without the need for cloud support. It's a pretty incredible time for mobile phone gaming. If you're hesitant, don't be. Resident Evil 4's remake earned a good score when it rolled out for consoles and PC in March. As did the Separated Ways DLC, which actually scored a bit better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Red Hook Studios revealed the first DLC for Darkest Dungeon 2 as The Binding Blade. The new DLC will feature a handful of new features including two new playable heroes with their own unique trinkets, signature items, fully-voiced backstories, and a new roaming mini-boss.




Two new heroes have entered the fray


The new DLC will feature two new playable heroes: The Duelist and The Crusader. The Duelist has the ability to switch between Defensive and Aggressive stances while also ignoring enemy defenses and countering attacks with Riposte. She also has the ability to reduce cooldowns and provide offensive and defensive buffs for her team.


The Crusader is a popular hero from the original Darkest Dungeon who is returning for the sequel. The Crusader is a front-line hero with the ability to tank damage while supporting his team with healing and stress recovery.


Both heroes have their own fully voiced backstories including playable flashback encounters that players can explore. Each hero also has their own trinkets and signature items that players can use to specialize them even further.


A new roaming mini-boss called The Warlord will also make an appearance in The Binding Blade DLC. No further details were provided, but I'm all for new bosses.


I played a good bit of Darkest Dungeon 2 when it entered its Early Access stage but just haven't had the time to jump back in since it was fully released. This DLC seems like as good a time as any to jump back into the madness.


Darkest Dungeon 2: The Binding Blade releases this December on both the Epic Games Store and Steam.

Risk of Rain 2 - EXXXXXXX-X is the current title of the DLC in question, and there's virtually nothing known about it right now. Even its official Steam listing is a total unknown, as it appears to be some type of in-universe transmission decoder that isn't quite done just yet.

This open-world action game unfolds in a new section of James Cameron’s wildly successful Avatar universe, and this new chapter in the mythos graces Game Informer’s cover this month. 
Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – Exclusive Coverage Trailer

Rumours of the Switch successor are hotting up by the day, though Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa seems keen to challenge the accuracy of the claims (thanks, Nintendo Everything).
In a recent financial call, the contents of which were written up on the Japanese site Mainichi, Furukawa dug into some of the latest 'Switch 2' discussions. Speaking to the claim that Nintendo's follow-up console was showcased behind closed doors at this year's Gamescom event, the company president stated, "The rumors online that appear to be public information are not accurate". (according to Simon Griffin and SatsumaFS' translation for Nintendo Everything).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's time again for financial reports, and Nintendo's is particularly interesting, as it reveals that its first-party IPs are doing exceedingly well, including Tears of the Kingdom. 


In August, it was revealed that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom had sold 18 million copies. With the latest financial report, Nintendo claims that Tears of the Kingdom has sold over a million more copies, bringing up the total to 19.5 million. 


Other first-party franchises have been also thriving, including Pikmin 4 which is somewhat of a surprise. It has managed to sell 2.61 million copies already, surpassing the sales of prior titles. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have also sold well, managing to top 23.23 million units sold. 


Mario has also been enjoying a good year thanks to the exposure it has been getting from The Super Mario Bros. Movie, and Mario 8 Kart Deluxe has sold 3.22 million copies. The company will continue to capitalize on the franchise's popularity through Super Mario RPG Remake and Princess Peach: Showtime!.





Nintendo's first-party franchises doing amazing numbers


According to company, net sales during the first half of the fiscal year increased by 21.2%. It is also revealed that "sales in the first half of the fiscal year were the largest since the launch of Nintendo Switch." This has been attributed to a 133.3% year-on-year increase in mobile and IP-related income, as well as the general depreciation of the yen. 


Overall, the profit margin remained at the same level as last year, which isn't a bad thing. Nintendo, in part, attributes this to the increasing sales of the Switch OLED model which has a smaller profit margin. 


Forever secretive, it is hard to predict what's next for Nintendo. There have been rumors that there is a Switch successor in the works, though president Shuntaro Furukawa has called these reports inaccurate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amnesia: The Bunker has all but reinvented Frictional Games' horror series, a crucial move at a time when the previous entry didn't quite hit the mark for some. However, the original – The Dark Descent – will always hold a special place in the hearts of horror fans. And if you thought the 2010 game was scary as it is, get ready to play it in VR.


As spotted by PCGamer, a mod over on ModDB has taken the OG Amnesia title and completely remade it. By rebuilding it in the Unity engine (boo hiss, etc.), CreaTeam's Sclerosis has managed to implement VR into the acclaimed horror game.




The above trailer shows off the more immersive aspects of the game. If you didn't know it was a rebuild, you'd swear it was just the original release. The team looks to have done a comprehensive job remaking Dark Descent, right down to the redesigned controls that have been "meticulously adapted to virtual reality controllers."


If you've missed Amnesia, you've missed a treat


I'm a long time fan of the Amnesia series. The first game set quite the tone in the indie horror scene, particularly at a time when the genre was experiencing something of an identity crisis (Resident Evil 5 came out the year before – just saying).


With no ability to defend yourself, being forced to hide from monsters, and the knowledge that staying in the dark too long was just as detrimental, The Dark Descent was a breath of (horrifying) fresh air.


Who knows whether Frictional will be able to reinvent the franchise again with subsequent entries. But judging by the likes of The Bunker, the series still has a lot of life left in it.

For decades now, Nintendo has fostered a family-friendly image that has made the brand a firm favourite with gamers both young and young at heart. It would be hard to argue that Switch isn't the family console to own, given its colourful library of top-tier software and the convenient way the hybrid handheld system slots into family life.
However, along with all the excellent Everyone-rated games, Switch's popularity has attracted developers of M-rated titles, too, and the catalogue of adult-only Switch games is also enormous. And since Nintendo Life is now 18 years old(!), what better way to celebrate adulthood than with a selection of amazing games we can finally play now we're all grown up?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At Apple's keynote event last September, everyone expected them to announce the new iPhone, but nobody expected them to announce that multiple Resident Evil games would be headed to the device. Resident Evil Village hit the App Store just last week, and today, Capcom has let us know when Resident Evil 4 Remake is coming to the platform: December 20. You can see some screenshots from the Apple port below. 

The game won't be available to all iPhone owners, however. Resident Evil 4 Remake will only be available on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, meaning you'll have to grab the newest product in order to play this game on the go. That said, it will also be available on iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. If you're a diehard Apple fan and have multiple RE4 Remake compatible products, you'll be happy to know that the game also supports cross-progression between Apple devices, so you can start a save file on your Mac at home and pick it up on your phone when you're on the go.
The game is available for pre-order on the App Store now, but players will be able to start the game for free before committing to a full purchase. Its recently released DLC, Separate Ways, will launch alongside it as well. While we haven't been able to go hands-on with this version of the game quite yet, we like Resident Evil 4 Remake quite a lot: you can read our review for it right here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix revealed its financial results for the last six months ending September 30. From the report, we learn that while profits may be down, Final Fantasy is reaching new milestones. 


The report reveals a 33.4% drop in operating income and a 42.1% decline in ordinary income. According to the company, there has been a fall in net sales for MMOs and games for PCs and smart devices because the latest releases including the "September launch of 'Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis' were unable to compensate for factors including weak performances by existing titles."

Final Fantasy is still one of Square Enix's greatest assets


Don't take this as a sign that Square Enix is doomed, however, as there is a 5.3% increase in net sales. The company attributes this rise, in part, to Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster. 


This isn't the only positive thing revealed about the franchise, as the company also claims that it has sold over 185 million copies. This is good news for fans, as reports earlier this year suggested that Final Fantasy 16 did not meet the upper end of expectations. 


Dragon Quest also gets a mention, and it is stated that it has sold 88 million copies globally. Looking forward, Final Fantasy will have plenty more chances to boost its sales. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is set to launch on February 29, 2024, and a PC port of Final Fantasy 16 is still on the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early on in The Talos Principle 2, one of your soon-to-be robot pals says to you with a completely straight face, "We're here to solve this puzzle, not to discuss philosophy." I can almost see Croteam's writing team now, chuckling inwardly to themselves as they do a big silent wink to camera from behind the robot's eyes. You're not fooling me, Croteam. I'm here to solve puzzles and discuss philosophy, and I know you are too. You can't stop talking about philosophy in this game, and frankly, I wouldn't have it any other way. 
Millenia may have passed since the events of The Talos Principle, but the problems faced by this new society of advanced robo-humans (of which you are number 1000 to be 'born' into this world) still feel all too relevant to the issues posed by the lives we're living today: what is the price of progress? Will we ignore the mistakes of the past and push the world toward irreparable destruction? And why have cats remained loyal to this new race of robo-people, cementing their status as the superior future pet, when dogs have devolved back into vicious wolves? There are some puzzles too, I guess. Those are pretty great as well.

When the original Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl came out in 2021, it was a relatively bare-bones experience, but those bones were solid. Despite lacking many single-player modes, items, and even character voices, the core gameplay was good enough to keep the game afloat until it received refinements via online updates over the next two years. Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2, however, comes packaged with all those improvements and more. Developer Fair Play Labs has learned its lessons, and while the game isn't without its faults, it's a more-than-worthy follow-up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam hardware survey is a chance for Valve to get an idea of the kits PC gamers are using. Not long ago, the likes of Nvidia's RTX 4000 series was hardly being used, but it seems Team Green's latest generation is starting to find its audience.


The most recent Steam survey – specifically the graphics card results – shows that previous generations of Nvidia products are still the preference for Steam users. For example, the RTX 3060 is at the top spot, while the even older 2060 remains in second.


Screenshot via Destructoid.


However, you can see that the 4000 series is now on the rise. According to the table, the RTX 4070 saw a jump of 1.19% between September and October. Additionally, the 4060 – which only came out this summer – saw an increase of 1.25%. On the other hand, the RTX 4090 struggles, with a 0.11% decrease.


Why the general increase?


According to an October report from Digital Trends, AMD and Nvidia graphics cards have been seen at their RRPs or cheaper. This could well explain why more PC users are starting to make the leap to the Ada Lovelace range.


Of course, while the Steam hardware survey is useful, it's worth pointing out that participation is completely optional. Therefore, not all users will have taken part, which may or may not skew the results. In any case, it certainly looks like Nvidia's current generation GPUs are finding their way into gamers' systems at last.


For what it's worth: I did decide to take part in the survey. I'm not ashamed of my GTX 960M. You can see it right there near the bottom of the table, with a loss of 0.05%. On second thought, if I ever needed a bigger indicator that I could do with an upgrade, this is probably it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lords of the Fallen, the spiritual successor to 2014's Soulslike with the same name, hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC last month – you can read Game Informer's Lords of the Fallen review here. After a recent patch a few weeks ago that made the game easier and added in some Halloween festivity, developer Hexworks and publisher CI Games have released its schedule of content for the game and it includes new questlines, two new events, more armor and weapons, and more. 
The roadmap also includes a "regular weekly cadence of updates focusing on bringing further stability, performance optimization, and balancing improvements to the game, including its online crossplay experience." 


Stopping short of specifics, Hexworks says before the year's end, it will add multiple new quest lines to Lords of the Fallen, with the opportunity to unlock some unique armor sets and weapons. The studio says some of this armor and weaponry has been co-created with the community during recent collaborative livestreams. Plus, the studio says "players can look forward to 12 new spells, new finisher attacks, and a whole host of community-requested features, including the recently revealed New Game Plus (NG+) modifier system – a first for the genre, and highly anticipated by the Lords of the Fallen community." 
"At Hexworks, we're incredibly proud of the open relationship we're fostering with our community," studio head Saül Gascon writes in a press release. "We are actively listening to their constructive feedback and working diligently to deliver what we believe, collectively, will elevate Lords of the Fallen further. Every addition to the game is a labor of love, as we strive to push both it and the genre's boundaries."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the Stardew Valley orchestral tour kicking off in 2024, Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone's highly successful farm-based RPG is still a major talking point in gaming. One can't help but wonder whether the game will make its way into other aspects of pop culture, but that might be easier said than done.


You see, according to an interview with IGN, Barone is quite protective of the Stardew Valley brand. He says that he's wary about just "[handing] it over to someone" to make what they want with the IP. This is largely in reference to a potential movie adaptation of the game. While there isn't one in the works, Barone says he'd be interested in a big screen version if the right studio or director came along. However, he still says he would "need to be closely involved" with such a project.


Imagine Stardew Valley set in Twin Peaks


In particular, Barone would likely agree to an adaptation if he was approached by Studio Ghibli. In a somewhat tonal shift away from Japanese animation, he also said he would be happy if Eraserhead and Twin Peaks director David Lynch wanted to make a Stardew movie. Now, who wouldn't want to see that?


As for the game itself, we're anticipating a new update, which the developer has been teasing lately. We don't know when it's likely to roll out, but version 1.6 is said to be adding new dialogue, a new farm type, winter outfits for villagers, and more.


In any case, Stardew is still going strong, notable for having a huge amount of content for a small, independent game. Whether a film adaptation will ever see the light of day remains to be seen, but I'm wondering how Tarantino would portray a sleepy Pelican Town.

Just two years after the release of Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, the Nicktoons have been thrust together once again in the name of licensed platform fighting, of all things, in Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2. The original was a solid outing with deep mechanics, but was held back by a lack of polish outside of gameplay, and although history isn’t exactly repeating itself with the sequel, it certainly rhymes.
Anyone familiar with the first game will immediately notice something different about the fighters, they all feel a lot heavier. Rather than zipping around at lightning speed, each and every character has been slowed down considerably, giving more weight to each movement, but also a bizarre floatiness in the air with serious momentum on the ground.

Having watched the initial trailer at some point years ago, I felt like Air Twister was a game I needed to experience. Unfortunately, it was released on Apple Arcade. I had let my trial subscription lapse on that service because I simply didn’t use it. I don’t play games on my phone. It’s for checking the comments on my articles and should otherwise be ignored.


Finally, it has arrived on consoles, which is where video games live.

Since its October 27 release, Remedy has released three updates, including its biggest yet last week, for the game so far. And now, a fourth update is live and while it's one of the smallest yet, it fixes a few key issues.


Alan Wake 2 Update 1.0.9 
PlayStation 5: Update 1.00.09
Xbox Series X/S: Update 1.0.0.9
PC: Update 1.0.9
Xbox Series – A workaround fix for the issue where the audio cut out intermittently in the Prologue. We are expecting a full fix for this issue in an upcoming update.
Room 665 – Fixed an issue (again) with the Echo scene not aligning and unlocking correctly (this was fixed in the previous update, but Echo hell still persisted)  
Local Girl – Fixed an issue with a mouse (with a big presence) blocking progress.
And that's everything in the latest Alan Wake 2 update. Catch up on everything the Alan Wake 2 update from last week fixed with the game here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Switch continues to inch closer to becoming Nintendo's best-selling hardware ever, as it has now surpassed 132 million units sold. It did so thanks to great software sales for new first-party games released this year like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4. 
This news comes from Nintendo's Fiscal Year 2024 second quarter financial results, which ended September 30. In it, we learn the Switch has officially reached 132.46 million units sold, getting it closer to the company's best-selling hardware, the Nintendo DS at 154.02 million units sold. The only other console above the DS overall is the PlayStation 2 at roughly 158 million units sold. 


It's possible the Switch reaches the DS' numbers, assuming a new-gen console doesn't end sales of the hardware. And consider…]]></summary>

The developers in question are a mixture of former full-time staff and former Keywords Studios QA testers who have worked on Dreadwolf under contract. They've organised pickets outside BioWare Edmonton's offices in Canada, and are calling on BioWare fans to get involved on social media, while trying to engage current BioWare staff in conversation about unionisation.

Publisher QuByte Interactive has released the launch trailer for its upcoming 'horror life-sim' Bem Feito, launching on the Switch this week on November 9th, 2023.
The trailer evokes commercials from the '80s and '90s, featuring atmospheric clips, a soothing voiceover, and an appropriate CRT filter to make things look extra authentic. It's certainly a weird one, we'll give it that.

Nintendo has today published its financial report for Q2 FY2024 and it looks like things have been going really rather well. On top of some meaty sales figures for the likes of Tears of the Kingdom, Pikmin 4 and the Switch console itself, the report finds that Nintendo's sales in the first half of the fiscal year have been "the largest since the launch of Nintendo Switch".
Comprising sales from hardware, software and other "mobile, IP related income" like The Super Mario Bros. Movie, apps and the like, Nintendo's ¥796.2 billion sales from Q1-Q2 this fiscal year have trumped all other first-half earnings from the Switch's lifetime — which, when you consider that this console is knocking on its seventh anniversary, isn't bad going.

Unlike the last report, which saw The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom sneak into the proceedings, this quarter remains relatively unchanged. In fact, all of the titles have managed to hold onto the same positions as we saw back in August, with the number of units sold ever rising.

As part of Nintendo's latest financial report, which tracks the second quarter of the fiscal year ending March '24 (that's April 1st to September 30th, 2023 specifically), the company has announced that Pikmin 4 has sold 2.62 million units since its release on July 21st, 2023.
The milestone puts the game ahead of Pikmin 3 Deluxe which, as of December 2022, had sold a total of 2.4 million units (though it's reasonable to assume Pikmin 3 has managed more since then). To manage such a feat in just a little over two months is quite remarkable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo just announced a brand new bundle for the Switch OLED that isn’t simply another Mario Kart package. The bundle goes on sale November 19, just in time for Black Friday shopping.


The new Switch OLED includes Super Smash Bros. Ultimate via digital download and three months of Nintendo Switch Online. The Black Friday deal runs at $349.99, saving you about $67.98 — around the cost of a new game if you're looking to add more to the pile. 


If the OLED model isn't what you're looking for, Nintendo's also got deals on the Switch Lite. Two new Animal Crossing bundles join the console lineup in time for the holiday season, including a pink Isabelle Aloha Edition and a turquoise Timmy and Tommy Aloha Edition. Isabelle's bundle is a Shopper's Drug Mart exclusive, while Timmy and Tommy editions are only available at Walmart. Both are $259.96.


Nintendo's Black Friday deals include more than a system bundle, too. Price cuts on games include $25 off The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Luigi's Mansion 3, Xenoblade Chronicles 3, and Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe. You can grab some older heavy hitters for $30 off, including Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, Super Mario Odyssey, and Metroid Dread. 


With holiday shopping deals revving up for Black Friday, Nintendo has its full list of offers up on its official hub. If you're among those just itching to dive into Super Mario RPG though, that's a sale for a Nintendo sometime in the far, far future. Aside from a few pre-order bonuses, you're stuck paying full price and maybe reading our hands-on experience with the remake while you wait.

Spike Chunsoft came through with some fresh details for Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island. In addition to some quality of life updates to exploration, the latest rougelike is looking to make livestreaming even more convenient with an enhanced Live Display Mode. 


The updated display presents an abundance of information on a single screen, in both standard and simplified views. This makes it ideal for streaming, as the display shows everything from play time to turns, weapon and shield strength, and the player's current status. Here's a sample of how the standard Live Display Mode view looks:

PlayStation Twitter support ends soon


"As of November 13, 2023, integration with X (formerly known as Twitter) will no longer function on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 consoles," says PlayStation on its official website. "This includes the ability to view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so)."


This means it won't be quite so easy to post photos of Spider-Man swinging across New York or Kratos taking out a giant foe in God of War Ragnarok. You can still do post shots on the platform, but only through the PlayStation App or by offloading and uploading photos manually.


PlayStation has not provided further reason for this decision. Changes have been rolling out for the API, and Sony isn't the only one that's shut down its direct integration—Microsoft turned off its Xbox-to-Twitter sharing earlier this year.


To make matters worse, the X CEO posted shoddy, blurry gameplay footage of Diablo 4 with an off-screen camera on the same day as this announcement. It shows him defeating Lillith in the worst way possible. Perhaps using the Share function would be a better way to share this epic moment.

Navia was first introduced in the Fontaine teaser trailer and has had a presence in the Fontaine Archon Quests. Now it appears she’s making the leap from NPC to playable character. She’s a Geo character with an Ousia Arkhe. From her presence in the teaser trailer, we can reasonably guess that she will be a 5-star character. Other than that though, her character introduction doesn’t include many new details. It looks like we’ll have to wait patiently for the leader of Spina di Rosula to become playable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[November 6 is Stranger Things Day. Canonically, this is the date that season one of the Netflix show opens on. It's a big deal for die hard fans of the show, and Behaviour Interactive figures it's as good a reason as any for another Dead by Daylight and Stranger Things crossover. 


It was August 2019 that the first collaboration occurred between Dead by Daylight and Stranger Things. Known a the Stranger Things Chapter, it consisted of two new survivors, a new killer, a new map, and a batch of cosmetics. It quickly became a fan favorite amongst the Dead by Daylight audience. And now, like a horror villain that just won't die, it's back.




The new killer added to the survival game was the infamous, and horrific, Demogorgon. Much like in the show, it was terrifying to see it scurry around the map and lunge at the survivors with its gaping maw and vicious claws. It also has the ability to move around Hawkins National Laboratory via portals which added to both its versatility and potential for jump scares. 


The two survivors added to the game were Nancy Wheeler and Steve Harrington. The duo were playable on a new map within the Stranger Things Chapter, the Hawkins National Laboratory: Undergound Complex. As you can see in the above trailer, it has a sinister and ominous feel to its halls. A perfect replication of what fans experience when viewing the show. 


In addition to the survivors, killer, and map, all of the prior cosmetics will be making their return to the Dead by Daylight in-game store. The Jonathan Byers outfit is an alternative skin that can be applied. As well as Steve's Scoops Ahoy outfit from season two. 


All of the Stranger Things Chapter content is available now in Dead by Daylight. Behaviour Interactive didn't specify how long the DLC would be available. So if you're interested in running through the depths of Hawkins as one of the show's heroes, pick it up while you can.

It became best known for being the foundation of Duke Nukem 3D, but it was also used for a number of less notable games. Duke Nukem 3D came bundled with a suite of editing tools, so a strong modding community sprang up around it.


Unfortunately, Extreme Paintbrawl came out during a very awkward time in terms of compatibility. That is to say, it was during that point when Microsoft was trying to bury DOS under Windows, which is, anecdotally,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation integration with X (formerly known as Twitter) is ending for PS5 and PS4 next week via a new update. That means users will no longer be able to directly upload screenshots and video clips from the console to the social media site.
An announcement update posted to the PlayStation Support page states that on Monday, November 13, X integration will end, which includes the ability to “view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so).”
While a bummer for those who make frequent use of this feature, which offers a simple method of posting gameplay content to the platform, there are a couple of more involved alternatives depending on your platform. If you’re a PS5 user, you can still use the PlayStation mobile app to upload gameplay captures to then post on X. You can read how to do that here. PS4 users have to rely on ShareFactory and do a bit more work, and you can read those steps here.
Microsoft made the same move in April by disabling sharing to X directly from the console and instructing players to instead use the Xbox app on mobile (with some speculating the decision was made to avoid paying the platform's then-new monthly application programming interface (API) fee). This now means that the Switch will become the sole console that supports direct media sharing to X. 
What do you think about the decision to end X integration? Did you use this feature regularly? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

"We're blown away by the response to #FortniteOG," said the game's official Twitter page. "Yesterday was the biggest day in Fortnite’s history with over 44.7 MILLION players jumping in and 102 MILLION hours of play."


The new OG season takes players back to the beginning of the battle royale mode. It brings back beloved locations like Tilted Towers, Greasy Grove, and Snobby Shores into the experience. This has obviously attracted fans to return to the game.

In a game where play time counts can end up in the hundreds of hours, that’s a fairly terrifying prospect.

        <updated>2023-11-06T19:20:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard Entertainment has revealed that the first expansion for Diablo IV is called Vessel of Hatred, and it hits the game late next year. The Diablo team revealed this news over the weekend during BlizzCon 2023, which is also where we learned about three new World of Warcraft expansions and three new Overwatch 2 heroes coming to the game. 
During BlizzCon 2023, Blizzard kept Vessel of Hatred details light, stating it will share more details next summer. As for what to expect, it features a campaign that continues the dark tale that began in Diablo IV. "Vessel of Hatred brings players back to learn the fate of the prime evil Mephisto and his demonic plans for Sanctuary," a press release reads. "Travel to the lush jungles known by the locals as Nahantu." 
Check out the Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred expansion announcement trailer for yourself below: 


Blizzard says Vessel of Hatred will allow players to traverse an exotic new region, vanquish new evils, and perhaps most excitingly, explore fresh ways to kill demons and loot chests with a completely new Class "never seen before in the Diablo universe." 
And that's all Blizzard shared about Vessel of Hatred. Diablo IV's first expansion is due out in late 2024. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Diablo IV review and then check out this story about how Diablo IV (and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III) won't be coming to Xbox Game Pass this year, even though Xbox now owns Activision Blizzard. Read about the ongoing Diablo IV Season of Blood after that.

        <updated>2023-11-06T18:38:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard Entertainment has revealed the next three heroes of Overwatch 2, including Mauga, a new duel-wielding tank hero that hits the game next month. Plus, the Overwatch 2 team teased a new DPS hero and Support hero hitting the roster sometime down the line. 
Mauga was actually playable for free as a part of a limited-time trial run for the tank hero this past weekend, but he's already out of the game; his real debut happens alongside Overwatch 2's Season 8 launch on December 5. "Equipped with two chain guns (Gunny and Cha-Cha), Mauga is ready to bash through the front lines of his opponents and tear through anyone that stands in his way with tons of fire-power," Blizzard says about the hero. 
Watch the official Mauga gameplay trailer below: 


Here are some additional Mauga screens from Overwatch 2: 

Elsewhere during the Overwatch 2 BlizzCon 2023 presentation, which is where Mauga was revealed, Blizzard pulled back the curtains on two more heroes coming to the game sometime in the future. The first is a DPS hero named Venture, with a unique Splatoon-ish weapon: 
The second is a new support hero codenamed Space Ranger, and given this hero does not yet have an official title, it's the hero we're expecting to debut in Overwatch 2 last out of these new ones. 
The final piece of Overwatch 2 from BlizzCon 2023 is Clash, a new PvP mode where two teams are tasked with capturing five distinct points on a map. Perhaps most excitingly, Blizzard is bringing back Overwatch map Hanamura as playable in Clash, except under the new name Hanaoka. Here's a look at Hanaoka below: 
For more about BlizzCon 2023, read about the three World of Warcraft expansions announced during the event. After that, read Game Informer's Overwatch 2 review, and then check out our Diablo IV review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I reviewed Hunt: Showdown for a different parish back in 2019, it was a swampy, stealthy, slow-paced extraction FPS that consisted of weaving through mouldy undead and pockets of inconveniently noisy wildlife, ears pricked for the rustle of a rival player in the bushes. It was a game in which every footfall felt like a gamble and every second lasted an eternity, even before you entered the lair of a giant spider. Fast  forward to 2023, and streamers are playing Hunt: Showdown like it's Titanfall 2, scurrying along walls with scant regard for the NPC cannon fodder below, duelling each other on rooftops with pistol shotguns, and tearing through those poor, befuddled boss monsters like sandcastles.


Thus the fate of any competitive shooter lucky enough to acquire a seasoned pro following, I guess. But still, returning to Crytek's PvPvE shooter has been a shock, and speaking to the development team, it sounds like the devs themselves have been struggling to keep up with the more ambitious players, too. Showdown was never expected to endure quite this long and evolve in quite this way, according to general manager David Fifield, and managing the community's ambitions for the game is as much of a challenge as compensating for the limitations of its ageing engine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Red Shoes.
Fairy tales are never really what they seem. Growing up, we’re all exposed to these moral stories – often based on fable and myth – which have been adapted multiple times and, in many cases, softened too, whether it’s through a beautifully drawn picture book or a sanitised Disney adaptation. But as you get older and more curious, you start to peel back the layers of these cutesy tales and often find more sinister origins lurking beneath
Little Goody Two Shoes is the embodiment of this notion. You play as Elise, a young girl whose grandmother has just passed away. Elise wants more in life – she wants to go from rags to riches, but she spends her days being a “little goody two shoes” by helping out the people of Kieferberg. But after meeting a new friend and finding a pair of red shoes in her back garden, Elise’s wish seems much closer than she ever dreamed. It’s a fascinating tale, one that works when it plays to its strengths, though some frustrations are holding it back.

It’s not at all uncommon, though, for writers to be wracked with doubt. Many years ago, I saw the novelist…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks. A small bit of RPS Game Club news today. Since it's starting to get toward end of the year season, Game Club will be taking a short break for the next two months. That means we won't be running it this month (November), or next month (December). We will, however, be returning with a fresh set of monthly game selections in 2024, so you can look forward to more group play-a-longs and liveblog chats early next year.
In the meantime, though, we hope you've enjoyed this first year's outing of the RPS Game Club, and we'd love to get some feedback on it for how we can improve next year. Regardless of whether you're a regular Game Clubber or have only ever watched it from afar, please come and join in the discussion below to help us make it even better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2021, Twitter user Thomas Violence, an Australian podcaster who was working in a bar at the time, recounted that a 19-year-old had asked for a refund on their drink because they realised they were too drunk already. One of the early replies was an "ummm actually," pointing out that you had to be 21 to buy booze in most states, and Thomas Violence responded "I'm one of the dozens of people worldwide that live in a country that's not America". I am reminded of this tweet a lot, and I am reminded of it whenever I log on to Puzzmo, a new daily browser-based puzzle service from Orta Therox and Zach "Zach Gage" Gage.
Puzzmo is great, and currently in a sort of gradually expanding beta where you can sign up to get a chance to be sent a log-in, or existing users can give two friends a log-in (I have used mine already, sorry). Every day you get a few different puzzles, with a subscription model offering bonus puzzles. I've not subbed because I'm just not built for anagram puzzles and I do not understand chess, which form about half of the daily offering, but I enjoy doing the daily fliparts and crosswords a lot. Except. The crosswords always have clues that are very specific to the USA.

The Finals is a multiplayer shooter that seems to take place entirely at this elevated pitch. In the dozens of open beta matches I've played, the result is as thrilling as those other games, but also exhausting. I wish it would chill for just a moment so I could fully enjoy its delights - of which there are many.

Nicméně se zdá, že se nám podařilo dosáhnout Pyrrhova vítězství, poslední námi evidovaná phishingová doména byla vyřazena ze zóny 16. 8. 2023. Od té doby se phishing cílící na české uživatele přesunul na zahraniční domény, kde je jeho zrušení obvykle zdlouhavější.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, we spent time with tha ltd. and Enhance Experience, the creative teams behind Humanity, for a documentary on the game's development.
While, on its surface, Humanity is a puzzle game about leading groups of people to a goal, as its name implies, its story wrestles with ideas of what it means to be human, the nature of groups, and why we always seem to resort to violence. Humanity's story reflects real-world events, showing us the paths we're currently on.
Watch The Documentary:


"Soon after we began making Humanity, a number of big events and movements broke out around the world," Enhance founder and CEO Tetsuya Mizuguchi tells us. "There were human rights movements, the Hong Kong protests, [and] then there was the pandemic. And war soon followed in Ukraine. We had no idea how quickly and deeply AI would infiltrate our society either. I think all these things found their way into the core of Humanity. That question, for example, 'What is humanity? What is human nature?' We would often talk about how people, looked at individually, are good. There are so many wonderful people out there. But when they become a group, or a nation, or even just big groups, at that level, something happens. It's like a different switch gets flipped. And what you see there, that is what we're trying to depict in Humanity."
Watch above or over on Game Informer's YouTube channel to see the full documentary about the making of Humanity. "Violence Is Inevitable" speaks to the core creative team, including Mizuguchi and tha creative director Yugo Nakamura, about the project's origins, its complications and lengthy development cycle, and how it came to show us the nature of humanity.]]></summary>

Now, more than six years later, Fortnite has had its biggest day ever again, bringing in 44.7 million players and 102 million hours of play on Saturday, November 4. 
Epic Games tweeted this record over the weekend, calling it the biggest day in Fortnite's history before thanking Fortnite and OG players.
Way to start things off with a big bang 💥
#FortniteOG. Yesterday was the biggest day in Fortnite’s history with over 44.7 MILLION players jumping in and 102 MILLION hours of play.
November 5, 2023
As for why, Epic doesn't list a specific reason but it's pretty clear it's because of the new season itself. Dubbed Season OG, a short one-month-long season of Fortnite brings players back to the Chapter 1 map for some throwback battle royale nostalgia. Plus, near-weekly updates will take players on a journey from Chapter 1: Season 5 all the way to Chapter 1: Season X. 
Check out Game Informer's breakdown of everything you need to know about Fortnite's Season OG. After that, check out the first official throwback teaser Epic released and then watch this nostalgic Tilted Towers video.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Opinions vary on whether 2005's Boiling Point: Road To Hell was ever, could ever have been, a good game. What's clear is that it was interesting, both as an early example of an open-world RPG and as an infamously broken example of Eurojank.

You don't need me to tell you that fake video games appearing in TV shows and movies are typically absurd and terrible. But just because something is bad, doesn't mean it's uninteresting. Having watched dozens of movies and episodes with fake video games, I'm going to celebrate a few over the coming weeks. Some daft fake games have neat ideas, some shows portray their fake games in an interesting way, and some fake games are even quite good.

Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness. As Spider-Man's first fully 3D action-adventure game, it laid the groundwork for mechanics such as web-swinging, a variety of web shooter attacks, and wall-crawling stealth gameplay. Let's see how it holds up 23 years later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV’s world of Eorzea is a utopia. Sure, there’s the looming threat of Garlean invasion and/or the possibility of world destruction throughout A Realm Reborn and its expansions - but on the plus side, almost everyone you meet is up for a round of cards.


Over the last quarter-century, Triple Triad has managed to escape its origins as a fun side minigame in Final Fantasy VIII to become a fully-fledged phenomenon in XIV. The Gold Saucer runs regular tournaments, random strangers are happy to be challenged to a match - often throwing in one or more of the game’s many variant rules (though Chaos can do one) - and might even give up one of their prized cards when defeated, with almost 400 to collect as of the game’s latest patches. Emphasis on the “might”: I dread to think of the hours spent replaying NPCs in the hope of a random drop as I filled out my collection.

I headed along to Final Fantasy’s London Fan Fest last month with a fetching deck of Triple Triad cards in hand. (Square Enix provided entrance and accommodation for the event.) Where better to try and live the dream of challenging random strangers to a card game, and learn more about the community that has fallen in love with the MMO in the 10 years since A Realm Reborn released?

Released today, it gives you a massive, gloomy map full of towering, greeny-black Gothic structures that are packed with backstory documents, but contain absolutely no enemies. The only thing separating you from all that winding, lore-drenched architecture is distance. Check out the trailer below.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/11/03/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-2-set-to-premiere-in-2025"/>
        <updated>2023-11-03T12:02:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, HBO's The Last of Us successfully brought developer Naughty Dog's critically acclaimed and fan-favorite PlayStation exclusive to life on the TV screen. Its Season 1 premiere was HBO's second-largest debut since 2010, and its second episode broke records, too. Roughly three weeks after the premiere of the series, HBO revealed The Last of Us would be getting a second season. And now, thanks to a new Deadline report, we know it will start shooting next year and premiere sometime in 2025. 
Deadline learned this at a New York news event, where HBO boss Casey Bloys reportedly told press that Season 2 will head into production early next year, aiming for a 2025 premiere. Unfortunately, that's all Bloys said about the season. But, as noted by Deadline, series co-creator and executive producer Craig Mazin revealed earlier this summer pre-strike that the team was already able to get some work done, adding that the first episode was already written. 


"We got pretty far actually, we were doing great," Mazin told Deadline. "[The Last of Us game co-creator Neil Druckmann] and I had been sitting and talking with [The Last of Us Part II co-writer Halley Gross] and Bo Shim, the new writer that was in our little tiny room with us – obviously not a mini room because we're greenlit proper, we're a real show, and because I hate that mini room stuff."
Considering the first season of The Last of Us covered the events of the first Last of Us game, including its Left Behind DLC, it's clear Season 2 of the show will dive into The Last of Us Part II. We're all still awaiting some casting announcements, like who will play Abby and Lev, but that likely won't happen until the actor and writer strikes are over. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's The Last of Us Part 1 review and then read our review of The Last of Us Part II.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a confession to make, readers. I'm mildly obsessed with Starfield's cuboid food brand Chunks. In all honesty, I'm kinda obsessed with Starfield's food in a more general sense, and I have almost as many screenshots of its tube-like meal boxes, stale toast slices, vacuum-packed sachets of rice balls, steak slabs and spiced worms - and, of course, Chunks - as I do its planets and NPCs. I'm weirdly fascinated by what Bethesda think our future meals will look like when we eventually start travelling across the stars, and not just because I like ragging on their somewhat plastic-looking textures and marvelling at how everything from orange juice to beer and wine comes in kid's size cartons with a little straw on the side. 
Chunks are my favourite food of the lot, though. These cubes of faintly glistening organic matter are bite-sized monstrosities that are quite possibly some of the most unholy things I've ever seen. How this became the dominating foodstuff across the known galaxy is a mystery worthy of its own sidequest, because let's be honest, I'm all for eating wonky fruit and vegetables, but would you truly go to shop, sit down at a table and order an apple that's been squeezed into a perfect cube? Or a cube with yellow skin that professes to call itself grilled chicken? I would probably try them once for curiosity's sake (it's the food of the future, of course I want to know what that tastes like!), but it's also exactly the kind of thing I'd swear off immediately because nope, nuh uh, I just can't even contemplate it anymore. And then it dawned on me: this is exactly how I feel about Starfield as a whole.

Activision have now posted an explanation for the heavier footprint of this year's Call of Duty, while pointing out that you can customise your install to lighten the load.

While it's technically Season 5 of Fortnite Chapter 4, which follows the previous Last Resort season, developer Epic Games is calling it Season OG, and it makes sense considering how much of Fortnite 2018 is making an appearance.
The throwback nostalgia continues throughout the season because each new update brings with it a different phase of Fortnite Chapter 1's past, starting with Season 5. That means weapons like the Assault Rifle and Pump Shotgun, and vehicles like Shopping Carts, will be featured in both Zero Build and regular Battle Royale Fortnite.

RoboCop: Rogue City is likely the best game the action hero has ever starred in. That bar isn’t tough to hurdle, but the adventure delivers plenty of thrills for fans to be excited about. This narrative-driven first-person shooter has a loving reverence for the films and a good understanding of its protagonist, swinging for the fences with a lengthy original story, fun references, and plenty of enjoyably cheesy humor. Unfortunately, like the franchise’s vision of Detroit, Rogue City is very rough around the edges, resulting in a flawe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!
Kingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. 
Escape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.
Both games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.
To play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Press releases published today by Spain's National Police and the Ministry of the Interior celebrated the dismantling of a pirate IPTV operation, the arrest of eight suspects, and alleged losses to rightsholders of €366.25 million. In dozens of local and international news reports, this 'official' figure is cited verbatim. We have zero faith in it, and we aren't alone. After a silent unreferenced edit, the police press release now reads €366,250, but the government's copy remains intact.

        <id>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-2024-review</id>
        <link href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-2024-review"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like when Sir Alex Ferguson oversaw his final game at Old Trafford, there’s a complicated atmosphere surrounding this year’s Football Manager. Football Manager 2024 is the last iterative game in the series before Project Dragonfly arrives next year, through which Sports Interactive plan the most radical overhaul of the game since the introduction of the 3D match engine in FM 09. This includes a complete rebuild of Football Manager in Unity, implementing brand new animation technology, and the inclusion of women’s football. But there is a reason why the studio has stuck with this tried and tested formula for so long. Big changes come with big risks, and as any Man Utd fan will know, those changes don’t always pay off.


But such concerns are for the future. FM24 is with us right now, and while it may be swapping the dugout for the stands ninety minutes from now, this isn’t some ceremonial exhibition match. It’s business as usual, and in mostly good ways. Sports Interactive have made meaningful changes to the management game both on and off the pitch, all built on top of fundamentals that remain as complex and compulsive as they have for years. That said, FM24 also demonstrates why a change is welcome, as in its current form it can struggle to strike the balance between authenticity and fun.

I rarely replay games, let alone horror games, which are often one-and-done sorts of things - though I do, of course, enter the Pumpkin Carving Festival every year.
I want something that has a general air of spookiness without being a jumpscare frightfest. If I hadn't played The Tartarus Key already I'd be playing that, is what I'm saying. But the other day I played the demo for An English Haunting and it's exactly what I want. It's just not going to be out for a while. Rats!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Rishi Sunak bundles nerds into Bletchley Park, we at the Electronic Wireless Show podcast are investigating the real danger of AI: somewhat rubbish text-to-speech voicelines making The Finals less fun. We discuss the arrival of AI voices in big-name games, the disappointingly businessy thinking behind it, and whether we can think up some uses for AI-generated material that we can actually get behind. All sparked by voice actor Gianni Matragrano’s video compilation of the lines in question, which you should probably watch before listening to this episode, or there’ll be a bit where Nate appears to bellow "THE KING FISH" for no reason. Well, maybe not no reason. It’s still Nate.


Plus! We talk about what we’ve been playing this week, which coincidentally for me was The Finals, while Nate’s been digging deeper into the Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor demo. I also recount the teeth-based controversy surrounding Cities: Skyline 2, in turn begging the question: what are they going to do with all those teeth?

It's billed as a detective game for true crime fans, but it reminds me of those puzzle books you used to get, where you are shown an illustration of a crime scene and, if you stare at it long enough, can figure out the assigned solution. Scene Investigators is like that but the scene is a big 3D one you can walk around. A crime has happened and you need to figure out what, mostly by peering at the dates in a diary to cross reference them with the time and day a phone message was left. This is why I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. It's quite hard. But! Some people will really like it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The android is unresponsive, standing frozen mid-step with one foot off the ground. I hold its metal head in my hands, tilting it this way and that as I stare into its cold red eye. It offers no resistance to my pushes and pulls, as though I was a hairdresser directing a patron’s head. Based on Stanisław Lem’s 1964 novel of the same name, The Invincible’s Firewatch-like first-person adventure is intent on exploring how machines will come to shape humanity’s future. Over the course of its ten-hour story, where you step into the Soviet-styled space boots of biologist Yasna, you will take on her desperate search for the missing crew of her research ship, The Dragonfly, lost somewhere on the rocky, sandstorm-whipped world of Regis III.
Using a logbook filled with hand-drawn maps and scrawled notes, I’ve tracked Yasna’s crew to a makeshift game to the east of where they originally landed. Instead of humans, I find the lifeless robot. I want the android to give me answers, to tell me where my crew mates are, to explain what happened on Regis III, and why I can’t remember anything before I woke up in the desert with my possessions scattered around me.

Back in the '90s, Nintendo played faster and looser with its library of characters. Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward. If you're ready to learn the answer for at least some of them, read on!
Impressively, the answer is yes! At least for Link and Donkey Kong. I have not been able to play to the point in the game where Samus appears, so I can't answer that question yet. When you get close to Link after seeing him in the sleeping bed, a "talk" option appears, and when you click it, a Zelda musical sting plays.
Donkey Kong's cameo has always been questionable as to whether or not it is him, as he is just labeled "Guerilla", but he sure looks a lot like Donkey Kong, just with a crown.

The Super Mario RPG remake releases November 17 for Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Omni-Man, the J.K. Simmons-voiced character from the Invincible animated series, is coming to Mortal Kombat 1 next week on November 9. Ahead of his debut, NetherRealm Studios has released the official Omni-Man gameplay trailer and alongside hard-hitting (and gory) super moves, it features a brutal and show-accurate fatality for the character. 
The trailer teases Liu Kang for allowing a Viltrumite into the Realms of Mortal Kombat before more than two minutes of Omni-Man action plays out. And closing out the trailer is the fatality for the upcoming Kombat Pack character. We won't spoil it here, so check it out in the Mortal Kombat 1 Omni-Man gameplay trailer below: 


Omni-Man hits Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the first Kombat Pack on November 9.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in August, a Pokémon Presents revealed that the first part of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's DLC, collectively known as The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, would hit the game in September. That has since come and gone, with players eagerly awaiting the second part of this expansion. And now, the official Pokémon Twitter account has revealed The Indigo Disk DLC goes live next month. 


More specifically, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2: The Indigo Disk hits Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on December 14. As those keeping up with Game Freak's ninth generation of Pokémon know, The Indigo Disk brings players to Blueberry Academy, which is actually in the Unova region, rather than the Paldea region where Pokémon Scarlet and Violet take place. The Unova region is the setting for Pokémon Black and White, and their sequels, Pokémon Black 2 and White 2.

November 2, 2023
Many players are speculating that The Indigo Disk will, in some way, tease remakes of the fifth generation of Pokémon, as those are next in line for Game Freak's cadence of remaking previously released Pokémon games. With players leaving Paldea to check out an academy in Unova, many predict some hint at potential Pokémon Black and White remakes await trainers. But only time will tell. 
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2 – The Indigo Disk hits the games on December 14. The DLC can be purchased as a pack for $34.99. 
For more, read about how after The Indigo Disk is out, every starter Pokémon will be available in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and then read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There comes a point when adding yet another behemothic RPG to your collection of unfinished, behemothic RPGs ceases to be a mark of eccentricity and becomes an act of manifest self-hatred. I, for instance, have just activated a beta code for 100-hour levelling fest Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader even as I make a mental note that really, I've got to make some proper headway in Baldur's Gate 3 this evening.
For The King 2, at least, seems pretty trim and digestible at a reported 30 hours in length. Released out of early access today, it's a blend of fantasy table-top gaming and roguelite, in which you lead a party of adventurers across a hexagonal map to quash an evil Queen in grid, dice and turn-based combat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What kind of game does the label “survival horror” denote? Since its inconspicuous first appearance in the original Resident Evil’s loading screen (functioning first and foremost, lest we forget, as a handy marketing catchphrase), the term has been so enthusiastically embraced and haphazardly applied as to be rendered almost meaningless in 2023. Horror gaming has witnessed multiple seismic shifts since 1996, most notably the turn to action-oriented design with the likes of The Suffering and Resident Evil 4 in the mid-2000s, as well as the rise of spooky almost-walking-simulators like SOMA in the mid-2010s. 

Yet the term survival horror has expanded to such a degree that it now seems to stand in, albeit rather awkwardly, for the entirety of video game horror. Even with the caveat that borders for these kinds of labels are notoriously hard to define, survival horror remains an unusually amorphous realm, one that (as a quick search of the relevant tag on Steam will reveal) lays claim as much to first-person bloodbaths like Zombie Army Trilogy as it does moody, combat-free adventures like Visage. Still, old distinctions linger, and a clutch of recent indie survival horrors qualify their work with the word “classic”. I interviewed some of the developers to find out why - and, more importantly, what classic survival horror means.

        <updated>2023-11-02T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game Informer can exclusively reveal Assassin's Creed Valhalla: The Hidden Codex, a new graphic novel from Dark Horse Books that brings players back into the world of assassin Eivor, a medieval Nordic land, a new hidden order, and more. It will be released as a hardcover graphic novel on April 30, 2024, in retail stores and online, for $19.99 (and it hits comic book stores on May 1, 2024). Mathieu Gabella is the author, with art from Paolo Traisci. 
The Hidden Codex follows Edward, a scribe and reluctant monk after he escapes from a kidnapping performed by a clan of Vikings. After securing his freedom, Edward finds his brother missing and strange documents "blackened by a language he innately understands." 
"No one knows where these occult-looking symbols came from, but Edward has seen such writings before: in the workshop of an enigmatic wise man among the Vikings who is part of a secret order: Those Unseen," a press release reads. "An order that could offer answers to Edward, and guarantee his aspirations of freedom and knowledge. But with that knowledge, can he find and rescue his own brother before it's too late?"
Ubisoft senior transmedia content manager Etienne Bouvier says the company is lucky to work with Gabella and Traisci as they are two long-standing fans of the Assassin's Creed franchise who infused their love of it, and knowledge of its lore, into this book. 
Assassin's Creed Valhalla: The Hidden Codex hits bookshelves and online retailers on April 30, 2024, before it hits comic book stores on May 1. It is available for preorder now and costs $19.99. 
For more about the series, read Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Valhalla review and then read our Assassin's Creed Mirage review. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every Assassin's Creed game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modding Resident Evil with Thomas the Tank Engine in place of Mr. X/Lady Dimitrescu/Nemesis/the monster of your choosing is so much a tradition at this point that Capcom may as well set the inevitable Resident Evil Zero remake aboard the interior of the chirpy children’s TV character. While players might be having fun modding Thomas, Shrek and Barney the Dinosaur into its survival-horror series, Capcom has expressed concern that some mods may cause "reputational damage" to the company and their games.

Mafia II: Definitive Edition
This remaster of the 2010 crime game spruces up the adventure with improved HD visuals. It also includes all of its post-launch DLC. You can us take a tour of the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.
Dragon Ball: The Breakers
This 7-v-1 multiplayer game pits a team of random normies, plus Bulma and Oolong, against a player controlling iconic Dragon Ball villains like Frieza, Cell, and Buu. The non-villains must work together to survive and escape stages in a time machine. The villain player’s job is simple: hunt and destroy everyone else. 
Aliens: Fireteam Elite
Up to four-players team up to battle hordes of xenomorphs in this cooperative class-based shooter. In our review, former editor Jason Guisao gave it a 6.5/10, writing, 
As a reminder, you have until November 6 to add October's monthly games to your library.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large gaming monitors can reach some crazy-high prices - so what's to stop you from getting a smaller 4K TV instead? You get a much bigger screen for the money plus TV functionality, and if you choose carefully you won't give up PC niceties like 4K 120Hz support or  FreeSync and G-Sync compatibility. 
This leads us neatly on to the 42-inch LG C3 OLED, which has dropped to £949 at Currys in the UK for Black Friday (it's normally £1399). This tasty £450 discount brings the monitor down to a price that it actually offers better value than many large-format gaming monitors, while offering far superior HDR, incredible motion clarity and of course full compatibility with PS5 and Series X consoles.

Plus, we talk about games we've been playing recently, which includes Alan Wake 2. Alice does an unhinged rant while unaware she is once again ravaged by Covid.


This is why episode 35 is coming out a week after it was supposed to: yes, I had coronavirus the entire time! Apologies for the delay. But, you know, not like loads, I was pretty sick.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is perhaps ironic that in attempting to crystalise my thoughts about Alan Wake 2 - a game about a novelist with such crippling writer's block that they end up spawning an entire evil doppelganger of themselves to sabotage their own work - I, too, have been hopelessly staring at a blank screen for the better part of 24 hours. I have not, thank goodness, reached the stage where my psyche's split in two (yet), but this spiral of self-doubt has now got to the point where I simply have put words, any words, in front of one another to write my way out of this hellish pit of despair. 
Alan himself goes through a similar ordeal of writing to escape as he tries to find a way out of the prison-like dimension known as The Dark Place, where he's been trapped since the events of the first game - and I take heart from the fact that it's clearly well-worn territory for the folks at Remedy as well, such is the forensic precision in the way it's portrayed onscreen: a chaotic, supernatural tornado that not only threatens to unravel Alan's own identity, but also the wider world as we know it. It's imposter syndrome writ large, and honestly, Remedy are pretty on the money with this one. Horace is not a pretty taskmaster when the words stop coming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thirsty Suitors is a dazzling new entry in a genre that is always badly in need of bolstering: turn-based RPGs without anime aesthetics and a story about something other than killing God. The game sees you play as Jala, who returns to her dilapidated hometown after getting dumped by the older woman for whom she abandoned college and her high school sweetheart. Waiting for her is a disappointed mother, a soon-to-be-wed sister who refuses to even speak to her, and a shadowy cabal formed of her spurned exes from the time in her life when rampant, unrelenting teen horniness nearly ripped the town apart. Jala’s journey to redemption and genuine adulthood will take her to the psychic plane to do cathartic (if overly simplistic) battle with her wronged exes, to the local skatepark to pull off some janky grinds, and to grounded emotional revelations that are rarely written this well in videogames.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20 and quickly became Sony's fastest-selling first-party game. While we loved the game – read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review here – players have discovered bugs and issues leading to laughter and, in some cases, progress impediment. Fortunately, developer Insomniac Games has been quick to fix issues with updates, like one last week that fixed an incorrect flag and the infamous white cube model issue. 
Now, the studio has released another update targeting various bugs players might be encountering in the game related to specific missions, shortcuts, tutorials, and more. 


Here's the full Update Version 1.001.004 release notes: 
Addressed an issue where players could become stuck during the finale of Marko's Memories
Addressed an issue where a boss could become stuck in geometry
Addressed multiple issues where the player could become stuck during the Galvanize tutorial
Addressed an issue where players with shortcuts enabled could become stuck in a puzzle during the New Threads mission
Addressed an issue where the Charge Jump would break when assigned to a shortcut
Addressed an issue where the Upgraded Classic suit had duplicate eye details
Further addressed issues where models would not load properly after long play sessions
Improved stability 
Hopefully, if one of these issues has stopped you from progressing past certain points in Marvel's Spider-Man 2's various quests, you'll be able to advance after installing this update. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review and then read about how Insomniac updated New York City for the sequel. Then check out this story about this missing NYC landmark in the game. After that, read our guide for the best graphics mode in Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and then check out our spoiler-free tips.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gran Turismo 7 is getting its biggest update tomorrow in the form of Spec II (a.k.a update 1.40). The content drop, which is free, adds a new cooperative mode, seven new cars, a fresh track, and more.


Perhaps the update’s biggest addition is four-player local split-screen. Unfortunately for PS4 players, this option is only available on PS5. Speaking of PS5-only features, those players can enjoy taking on Gran Turismo Sophy, which developer Polyphony Digital describes as a “prototype revolutionary racing AI agent” 
Spec II also adds the snowy Lake Louise track. Set in a Canadian ski resort, it comes in three variants: long track, short track, and tri-oval. New Master License events are coming and the update also adds quality-of-life features, such as a dashboard that tracks player progression.
Of course, new vehicles are always exciting, and here are the seven joining the roster:
Dodge Charger R/T 426 Hemi '68
Dodge Challenger SRT Demon '18
Lexus LFA '10
Mercedes-Benz 190 E 2.5-16 Evolution II '91
NISMO 400R '95
Porsche 911 GT3 RS (992) '22
Tesla Model 3 Performance '23
Spec II adds a host of smaller additions, such as new Cafe menus and new photo mode options, and you can read a complete breakdown by reading the blog post on the Gran Turismo website. You can download the update on November 2. For more on Gran Turismo 7, check out our review.]]></summary>

Ever since its first title 20 years ago, the WarioWare franchise has shapeshifted to take advantage of the capabilities and gimmicks of whatever the current Nintendo platform was. But the first entry on Switch, Get It Together, bucked that trend, putting you in control of the actual cast of characters in platforming-style microgames instead of taking advantage of the Switch’s unique traits. WarioWare: Move It aligns more with the traditional WarioWare experience, resulting in a better overall collection.
Move It takes the core tenants of the WarioWare franchise and cranks them up to 11. Players mus…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has unveiled Sonic Dream Team, a new 3D action-platformer launching exclusively on December 5 on Apple Arcade. With it launching on Apple Arcade, you'll need to subscribe to the iOS-based gaming subscription service, which costs $6.99 a month. Dr. Eggman has discovered The Reverie, a special ancient device that can manifest dreams in the real world, and it's up to Sonic the Hedgehog and friends to stop him from doing so. Players must navigate "twisted dreamscapes, rescue your friends, and put a stop to Dr. Eggman's nightmarish dreams of world domination." 
Sonic Dream Team features six playable characters in Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy Rose, Cream, and Rouge, and Sega says each character brings their own flair and personality alongside three movement types "that provide unique exploration opportunities while navigating the dream world." It also features four boss battles, never-before-seen worlds spread across "four unique dream worlds with mind-bending environments that include wall-running, gravity changes, and more." Plus, Sonic Dream Team can be played on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. 
Check out the Sonic Dream Team reveal trailer for yourself below: 


And here are some Sonic Dream Team screenshots too:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beware major plot spoilers for the entire Amnesia series, together with descriptions of fictional torturing techniques.

The most ghoulish of Amnesia's many ghoulish ideas is "vitae". It's a luminous, blue-green fluid that can be used as an energy source, a chemical catalyst and a supernatural healing agent. Each Amnesia game is broadly a story about the production of vitae, with some levels consisting of huge distillation and refining apparata, and major plot developments tied to what you do with it. In the original Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you'll brew potions using vitae in order to keep a decapitated head alive. In 2020's Amnesia: Rebirth, you'll use ornate metal cannisters of the stuff like batteries to power otherworldly machines. Vitae is the blood and breath of Amnesia, the grease upon the narrative axels, the fuel in its boiler, the miracle McGuffin that sustains its nastier flights of fantasy. But what is vitae, exactly? Agony.

After a September patch that included various changes to make the Soulslike action RPG easier, game director Jiwon Choi has released a Director's Letter to confirm plans for a Lies of P sequel, tease DLC for the game with two new images, and more. 
Lies Of P Sequel Confirmed


Choi began the video thanking players for helping the game sell 1 million copies in less than two months after release. He then sneakily drops a line confirming the Pinocchio-inspired Soulslike is getting a sequel. 
"Our highest priority is developing the DLC and working on the sequel," Choi says in the Director's Letter. "The dev team…]]></summary>

The modder in question is vexthecollector, whose catchily-named Spacestations for Outposts lets you bolt together hab modules, windows and docking bays to fashion your very own Deep Space Nine. Sadly for my character, the acutely terra-phobic star pirate Mary Read, you'll need to first build an outpost on a planet in order to access the goods.

But I'm a brave boy, so I dropped in, and of course died almost instantly. Sekiro is still one of the toughest soulslikes around, absolutely filled with extremely dangerous bosses and twisted body-horror monstrosities that can carve you up with just a couple of hits, sending you back to the last checkpoint bereft of all your XP. But the Headless scares me so much, I actively avoid facing it until I have absolutely no choice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jusant is all show, no tell, which is a bold swing. Video game characters aren't often big on show don't tell in 2023. A lot of them have been cursed by their creators to narrate everything they do, as they do it, incase the meatsacks controlling them are unable to parse even one second of what is happening on screen without direction. I love HZD's Aloy, but does she ever just stream-of-consciousness her way through life.
In contrast, the nameless protagonist in Don't Nod's new climbing puzzle adventure (what even are genres?) is also silent. There are no other NPCs. You are climbing up through the ruins of an old civilisation. As such, Jusant relies on the devs having crafted an understandable world that you can barely interact with, aside from painstakingly climbing across it like a spidery archaeologist. You've got to have faith in your environmental storytelling if you're making a game like that. And Don't Nod have nailed it.

Jusant asks players to do one thing: climb. As a silent mountaineer accompanied by a cute critter, the only thing standing between you and your mysterious mission is one very tall mountain. The journey to its summit is treacherous, but thanks to an ingenious climbing system, beautiful art direction, and intriguing world-building, inching toward the top is worth the effort. 
The intuitive climbing mechanics are the star of the show. Pressing the left and right shoulder buttons lets you grip handholds with the correspond…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little knowledge can be worse than no knowledge at all. I know a little about the Yakuza series, having reviewed the 1980s-set Yakuza Zero for this very parish in 2018, and tried a bit of 2019's turn-based battler Yakuza: Like A Dragon. Fast-forward to 2023, and all Yakuza games are now Like A Dragon games, including the forthcoming Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which is an... Animal Crossing game, actually? With skateboarding? I'm still getting my head around the existence of a zombie spin-off, Dead Souls, to say nothing of the samurai-era Like A Dragon: Ishin. And then there's the inter-quel Like a Dragon Gaiden, due this November, which seems like a relatively straight-laced delve into the past of original protagonist Kazuma Kiryu. Phew, it's just as well Ed Thorn wrote that guide to the order you should play the Yakuza games in.


It sounds like the developers at Ryu ga Gotoku Studio have a hard time keeping track themselves, especially given the rate at which Sega publish Like A Dragon games. According to studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama, Like A Dragon's creators feel a lot of pressure to get the games done quickly, not just with a view to making money but because as projects that riff so copiously on pop culture, Like A Dragon stories go out of date fast.

And yet! That's a large part of what I enjoy about the new subterranean survival-craft-'em-up The Lord Of The Rings: Return To Moria. It's a slower, more weighty survival game than you might be used to if you're a Valheim or ARK type, for example, and you'll spend a lot of your time in the dark. But what is this, a survival game for elves? No sir. And besides, like I said, it's rather sweet. Cosy, even.

Atari states that Digital Eclipse benefits by gaining access to “world-class IP” to grow its business and development capabilities further.

Ahead of the premiere (release? Launch?) of the experimental Silent Hill Ascension tonight, we had a chance to speak with the developer Genvid about the game (TV show? Crowd-directed narrative?) is, what it will mean to the Silent Hill universe, and how much work is going into animating the versions of the narrative that may never be seen.
Calling Ascension a video game is almost a misnomer. There is an interactive element, but you won’t be holding a controller in your hand pushing characters to make decisions in the traditional sense. Instead, viewers will download the Silent Hill Ascension app on mobile devices or PC (there is a PlayStation option, but only for viewing episodes, not participating)…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've only just read Sin's thoughts on Akuma Kira's Lunacid and lo and behold, the PS1-styled, first-person dungeon crawler has now released out of Steam Early Access, to considerable rejoicing. Lunacid is a homage to classic FromSoftware games - no, not that juvenile upstart Dark Souls, but King's Field and Shadow's Tower, which date back to the late 1990s. 


I played one of the King's Field games as a sprog and found it to be an extended cave system full of lava, demons and torment. Lunacid sort of applies the perspective and medieval fantasy combat of that series to a story reminiscent of Demon's Souls - the From-alike that spurred the Japanese studio to international fame - with a world that has been flooded with toxic mist by a "sleeping old one below". Your job, as some unfortunate outcast chucked into a pit, is to journey downward and confront this mysterious creature, using any and all combinations of rapiers, clubs and fireballs. Off you go then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Toby Fox followed up their 2015 critically acclaimed and fan-favorite 2D RPG Undertale with Deltarune Chapter 1 in 2018. This chapter was the first in what we'd later learn is a five-chapter top-down RPG with puzzles, bullet hell sequences, and Final Fantasy-inspired combat, and Chapter 1 was released for free. Fox dropped Chapter 2 in 2021 in a surprise announcement, and now, players patiently await the release of Chapter 3. Today, more than two years later, Fox has revealed an updated plan for their Deltarune release strategy. 


With Chapter 3 nearing completion, Fox plans to finish Chapter 4 and release Deltarune as a purchaseable product. And following that, development on Chapter 5 will continue and hit the game when it's ready. To help with this, Fox has hired a producer "whose entire job it will be to speed up the overall game development for future chapters," according to a new statement released. 
You can read Fox's full statement below: 
Elsewhere in the update, Fox says Chapter 3 took a lot of trial and error to figure out how it would work but that with Chapter 4, "I already feel very confident about how we can progress." They also note that people on the team are already transitioning back into working on Chapter 4 and that everybody is excited to work on that part of Deltarune. 
For more about the game, watch the original Deltarune teaser and then check out this Chapter 2 teaser. After that, read Game Informer's Undertale review.

These include the modestly-known about Control 2, a sequel to the paranormal Brutalist telekinet 'em up that is seeing "good progress", and the forthcoming remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2, on which Remedy are collaborating with GTA and Max Payne 3 developer Rockstar.
Further afield, there's the mysterious Condor project, a co-op multiplayer Control spin-off (pictured above) that builds on Remedy's experience crafting the single-player component for wayward service-based shooter CrossfireX. And at the very edge of sight, there's the faint outline of something called Codename Vanguard, about which naff-all is known. Could it be that "crazy, huge budget, dark gothic fantasy" Remedy's creative director Sam Lake would like one day to make?

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is the next canonical chapter of the Avatar mythos. Set during the one-year gap in Avatar: The Way of Water on the other side of Pandora in a new area called the Western Frontier, players control a Na’vi raised and trained by the Resources Development Administration (RDA) who finds themselves taking the fight to the corporation. That requires, quite literally, getting back to their roots as they reconnect with Eywa while learning what it means to be a Na’vi by ingratiating themselves with the game’s three new clans.

IGN and Bloomberg have learned new information about the layoffs that occurred at Destiny 2 maker Bungie this week, including that roughly 100 employees were laid off from the company. As for why, IGN's sources report that during an employee meeting after the layoffs, Bungie CEO Pete Parsons told staff that the layoffs were due to the underperformance of Destiny 2 over the last year as well as "lower-than-expected preorders" for the upcoming expansion, The Final Shape. 
Employees were reportedly told that Destiny 2 player sentiment had reached an all-time-low and IGN's sources say employees at the studio have attempted to discuss this with Bungie leadership, asking to make the necessary changes, presumably to get player sentiment back up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crytek have no plans to make a sequel to sweaty monster-culling FPS Hunt: Showdown, and will thus hopefully avoid the publicity problems currently faced by Activision-Blizzard's Overwatch 2 and Valve's Counter-Strike 2 - both presented as sequels with fancier technology, but in practice, more like service-game content seasons arbitrarily upgraded into replacements, with the 'previous' games, Overwatch and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, being taken offline to avoid splitting the playerbase. 


Speaking to me in an interview about Hunt's evolution since its launch out of early access in 2019, the game's general manager David Fifield observed that while Crytek may yet make another Hunt game it won't be a straight Showdown follow-up - and it certainly won't come at the expense of your ability to play the original game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in June, when our Ed got a 30-minute hands-off glimpse of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, he had suspicions that Ubisoft's next big open world-athon was hiding some dark, terrible secret beneath the surface. It was almost too good, and too lovely-looking to be completely true, he proposed, and the brief tour of this rather enormous-looking game wasn't quite long enough to really dig beneath the surface to see if Ubisoft's lofty promises would hold up to closer scrutiny. 
Now, just over a month from release, I've finally been able to put it under a proper microscope, playing two hours of the thing from around the 25% mark of its campaign. And it really is as visually impressive as Ed suggested all those months ago. At long last, this is a game that looks and feels like an actual "next-gen" blockbuster (or as much as a game can, at least, when we're already several years into the current generation cycle). But Ed was also right to feel a wee bit suspicious of Frontiers Of Pandora. Perhaps not in the way he expected, but enough that I heard the same thing being muttered over and over again by almost everyone at the end of my preview session at Ubisoft's UK offices: "I can't work out where the heck I'm meant to be going, or what I'm supposed to do."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies to the chief, but there’s a not-entirely-accurate bit in Katharine’s post announcing Starfield as October’s RPS Game Club game. I, of the RPS Treehouse, do truly love Starfield, and have only been quiet about it because admitting you enjoy The Grey Bethesda Game but couldn’t get into Baldur's Gate 3 or Elden Ring feels a bit like going to the Savoy Grill and only ordering chips. No one will ask you to leave, but they’ll probably start questioning your judgement.
But dammit, I like chips, and I like Starfield! I like its roving space captain fantasy, I like its utilitarian aesthetic, and I like how its click-clacking guns sound like extremely violent mechanical keyboards. Especially if I get to fire them at floating pirates, while I’m also floating, and said firing punts me upwards into a ceiling.
