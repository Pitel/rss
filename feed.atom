Sea Of Stars, the upcoming RPG from Sabotage Studio and a prequel to its 2018 hit The Messenger, is well on its way to launching at some point in 2023.
Development appears to be going smoothly at the moment and, as announced by Sabotage in 2022, the game's soundtrack will feature music from legendary Japanese composer Yasunori Mitsuda, who has previously worked on titles such as Chrono Trigger, Mario Party, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3.

According to reports from the number crunchers over at market study groups GfK and GSD, 2022 was a tougher year than usual for UK gaming retailers, with a drop in the sales of both consoles and games when compared to 2021.
Over the course of the year, some 34.2 million games were sold to UK players. While that number is not to be sniffed at, it represents a 6% drop on 2021. 20 million of these sales were digital, for a loss of 3.4% over 2021, while the remaining 14.2 physical sales represent a 9% drop year-on-year. Interestingly, this reduction in sales is attributed to the release of newly-released titles, which has caused an increasing trend of players not purchasing back catalog titles with the same regularity as they once mig…]]></summary>

When I first asked the team to put together their most anticipated games for 2023, I was thinking we'd have a reasonably sensible number of things we were all looking forward to, you know, somewhere in the region of the 43 games we highlighted at the start of 2022. Very quickly, though, it became apparent that, actually, there are simply loads of games the RPS Treehouse is personally excited about this year, and cor, it would be rude not to include every last one of them. I'll be upfront: there are a fair number of TBA games on here that probably aren't going to come out in 2023, but as ever, we remain hopeful and optimistic all the same. So let's dive in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't expect The Last of Us HBO show to extend beyond the story of the two games in the series. That's because The Last of Us game director Neil Druckmann says there are no plans for stories beyond the games in this show.
This news comes by way of a new interview with Druckmann from The Hollywood Reporter, as reported by GameSpot. Here's what Druckmann told THR specifically: "We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games. We won't run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since The Last of Us Part: II doesn't end on a cliffhanger." 


Druckmann and TV series writer Craig Mazin have mentioned that a second season of this show might cover the events of The Last of Us Part II (personally, I think The Last of Us Part II could cover two seasons of television). Despite the duo not wanting the show to go beyond the games, there might be a way for the show to cover more ground after the events of The Last of Us Part II. If Naughty Dog were to develop a theoretical The Last of Us Part III, it wouldn't be surprising if the HBO show covered that down the road. Chances seem pretty good considering Druckmann told THR that there is "more story to tell" in the world of The Last of Us games. 
Mazin also touched on his desire not to extend the show beyond the games in the THR interview, as noted by GameSpot, stating that he doesn't "have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show." 
"When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can't help but get kind of...stupid," he continued. "Endings mean everything to me." 
For more about The Last of Us on HBO, read our interview with Joel actor Pedro Pascal and Druckmann about the changes made for this TV show. Check out this new piece of concept art from The Last of Us multiplayer game that Naughty Dog is currently developing after that.

The class action lawsuit that was filed against CD Projekt RED for the disastrous launch state of its mega-selling RPG Cyberpunk 2077 has been settled for $1.85 million USD.
The suit, filed on December 24, 2020 by New York's Rosen Law Firm was launched by a party of investors who accused CDPR of misleading its shareholders over the quality of the title, which famously launched in disastrous fashion on PS4 and Xbox One back in December 2020. The suit argued that CDPR offered "materially false and misleading" statements on the title in its development stages, before finally releasing Cyberpunk 2077 in a "virtually unplayable" fashion.

But perhaps more than any property that has moved from interactive medium to passive television, The Last of Us seems most suited to make the transition. Joel and Ellie’s story is an emotional and cinematic one that does not rely on player choice.
Ahead of the show’s premiere we spoke with some of the actors about the adaptation, as well as Neil Druckmann, co-creator of The Last of Us, who was heavily involved in writing the show and directed a few episodes.
Druckmann is no stranger to directing actors, even if the recording process of a TV show is different from how it works in a video game. “There is a certain luxury we have in video games that when we capture a performance, we have eve…]]></summary>

Rumbleverse was developed by Iron Galaxy Studios and made its debut on the Epic Store and other console platforms in August last year. Simply put, it's an "exciting" 40-person brawler royale. Although it's free, it does allow players to pay real money for add-ons, seasonal items and in-game currency.

Nintendo's marketing campaign for Fire Emblem Engage is now well and truly underway. Following previews going live, it's now released a brand new overview trailer that runs for close to nine minutes. One catch is it's only been uploaded to Nintendo's YouTube channels in Japan, so you'll have to watch the whole thing in Japanese.
It still provides a closer look at the game - showcasing the lands of the new title, the new protagonists, returning characters, the series' famous tactical gameplay and even some of the fun mini-games, like a workout one!

What's more, the game has received the coveted "overwhelmingly positive" reception on the platform with well over 15,000 reviews.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new standalone competitor arrives soon
HTC has revealed its new standalone virtual reality headset, the Vive XR Elite. It's able to handle both virtual and augmented reality, and comes in at a price tag of $1,099.
Pre-orders went live today on sites like Amazon, where you can check out the specifications for this new headset. HTC's new set looks to compete with the likes of the Meta Quest, an extremely popular headset that's also cut out the cables.
This headset looks aimed to do many of the same things you'd expect out of something like the Meta Quest. It's a standalone VR headset that can also hook up to a PC for some extra power, and it has adjustable diopter dials for glasses-wearers. The battery allows for up to 2 hours of continuous power but is hot-swappable, and the screen comes in at a combined 3840 x 1920 resolution, with 110 degree field of view and 90 Hz refresh rate.
Quite interestingly, the Vive XR Elite can also fold up into a case and go on-the-go with you, like a pair of sunglasses. It's a neat trick, but certainly intriguing for folks who want their VR games to travel with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LPZr04Xf34
As for other Vive headsets, The Verge reports that the Vive Focus 3 and Vive Pro 2 headsets will stay on sale, though the Vive Flow will likely be retired near the end of the year.
Expanding reality
This headset looks to compete in the growing market of VR/AR headsets, which is where other companies seem to be looking too. The Vive XR Elite looks to pack in some power with its headset, while still keeping things light and portable.
It's an interesting competitor to Meta's options, both for the price-bumped Quest 2 and the pricier Quest Pro. We'll have to see how this new headset fits into the landscape later on this year.

The Nintendo Wii was gaming’s greatest magic trick.
Back in 2006, the Wii felt like the next frontier of gaming. Swinging your arm to throw a bowling ball was so immersive that people broke their TVs without even thinking about it. Yet as the console aged, the luster of motion controls faded. What started with “can you imagine playing Smash Bros with the Wii remote?” quickly turned into “please do not give me the Wii remote to play Smash Bros.”
Still, the games that understood the benefits and limitations of the system were unforgettable. The Wii has some experiences you still can’t anywhere else, despite the rise of virtual reality. Even the system’s background music fills the Wii to the brim with personality. As usual, distilling a system’s years-long legacy …]]></summary>

City Connection has announced the next title in its retro-loving S-Tribute range — Coming to PC and console platforms in February, the new release will feature two titles from the colorful puzzle series Puzzle Bobble, also known in western territories as Bust-a-Move.
The S-Tribute title will include 1995's Puzzle Bobble 2 and its 1996 follow-up, Puzzle Bobble 3. The new release will include the arcade versions of both games and a selection of home console ports for both titles. Both the Japanese Puzzle Bobble and western Bust-a-Move variants will be available. Also included are over 1,000 fan-created stages from Puzzle Bobble 3 and an editor, allowing players to build their own colorful stage layouts.
In addition, The Puzzle Bobble S-Tribute release features a selection of modern options, including save states, a rewind function, slow-motion mode, various dip-switch settings, and arcade-style scanline filters. So if you fancy a trip down memory lane, then the confusingly titled Puzzle Bobble 2X / Bust-a-Move 2 Arcade Edition & Puzzle Bobble 3 / Bust-a-Move 3 S-Tribute (lordy) will be available digitally on February 2 on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

The Nintendo eShop is celebrating the start of the year with some sales on Switch games. The new Year Sale is live right now, with decent cuts into a chunk of the Nintendo Switch's catalog.
This year's sale runs from January 5 to January 15, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Purchases here goes towards Gold Points too, so it's easy to rack up some extra spending cash.
Some highlights of this sale are actually some surprisingly recent games. For those looking to dump many, many hours into the Nintendo Switch at the start of the year, you don't need to look much further than Persona 5 Royal. The massive RPG finally made its way to Nintendo Switch last year, and the 30% cut drops the price tag down to $41.99.
Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope is also on sale, albeit only for its Gold Edition. While the 22% cut takes it down to roughly $70, just a hair above the base game's price, it also include the Season Pass. And if you want a solid tactics game with some surprising and inventive takes on the genre, you can't really go wrong with Sparks of Hope.
Heck, even Sonic Frontiers is seeing a 30% price cut, and AI: The Somnium Files - nirvanA Initiative has also dropped by 30% for the sale too. This is a solid way to catch up on some games you might have missed at the end of last year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuTcBAkyNL4
The Switch sales carry on
My personal pick from the sale is Celeste, the incredible 2018 platformer which is dropped to a mere $5 for this sale. Seriously, if you haven't played Celeste, it is well worth your time.
Some other price cuts have been popping up on the eShop too, as noted by social media sales aggregator Wario64. So if you're still looking to get a slightly obscure 3DS game like Culdcept Revolt for a low, low price, now's the time to do so.

No sound chip is as ubiquitous as the Ricoh 2AO3 found in the NES and Famicom consoles. 5-channels wide (usually only four were used), the sounds of this 8-bit microprocessor were cemented into the brains of anyone who was in the room with it. Some of the most enduring songs ever produced in video games got their start on that unassuming slab of plastic and silicon. Today, when someone wants to make a video game soundtrack sound vintage, they parrot the tones of the Ricoh 2A03.
I remember being in a discussion with someone long ago who made the observation that early video game music is like outsider art. Music in video games was still a relatively new concept during the 8-bit era of consoles, so there was no precedent for how it should sound. Because chiptunes couldn’…]]></summary>

Baba Is You is one of the best, strangest puzzle games of the past decade. Instead of moving blocks and finding keys, your main mechanic is moving words — making it so that you are the key, or changing the goal of the entire level to suit your needs. Okay, you'll still be moving blocks and finding keys, but it's different, alright?!
Developer of Baba Is You, Hempuli, occasionally makes tiny games on itch.io, some of which are to do with Baba (or Keke, another one of the game's characters). There's Baba Is You XTREME, which has real physics and no grid; Baba Friend, which adds a little Baba to your desktop; It's A Me, an unplayable Mario-like platformer; and now, arguably the best spin-off of all...

It's a new year, and a few more games are going free on Epic's PC storefront. Kerbal Space Program and Shadow Tactics - Aiko's Choice are free this week on the Epic Games Store.
From now until January 12, you can hop onto the Epic store and claim both Kerbal Space Program and the standalone Shadow Tactics expansion Aiko's Choice for free. These will add the games to your library for good, so even if you're not looking to play either one right now, just claiming it puts them both in your collection for later.
Kerbal Space Program is the infamous rocket-disaster simulator about launching small, unsuspecting Kerbals into orbit with your specially designed rockets. It's a straightforward concept on paper that's made more complicated when you realize it is, actually, rocket science. Playing Kerbal is a pretty fun way to learn about how hard it is to put a metal tube in space, while also cackling when your plans go spectacularly awry.
Otherwise, Aiko's Choice is a standalone expansion for Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun. The base Shadow Tactics is a fairly well-liked stealth tactics game, and Aiko's Choice is like a concentrated version of it. It's a campaign all its own, and doesn't require the base Shadow Tactics to play.

Ground control to Kerbal Tom
It's a solid pairing of games for this week's Epic giveaway. Both also sit in some interesting niches of gameplay, so this is really a good excuse to try them out without putting down any cash.
As for the next Epic Game Store freebie, the Store lists the impostor game First Class Trouble as its next upcoming game giveaway. That's expected to go live on January 12, and be available to grab through January 19.

Players control Kai, a lone warrior battling an evil robotic army in a post-apocalyptic world. This side-scrolling action title boasts plenty of satisfying action thanks to Kai’s fun melee combat, nimble platforming abilities, and his signature grappling hook, which he uses to traverse levels as well as yank and toss enemies. Sporting great 16-bit art and a strong soundtrack, Gravity Circuit is worth keeping an eye on for fans of classic throwbacks.

Electronic Arts has addressed a major data storage glitch that has caused untold damage to the save data of many Madden 23 players. The glitch — which struck EA servers between Wednesday, December 28 and Thursday, December 29 — has corrupted the Franchise save files of many users, essentially deleting their custom leagues entirely.
"Unfortunately, if you logged into franchise leagues during this time, your data was affected due to a data storage issue that resulted in franchise files being corrupted," said EA in a statement. "We know how important your franchises are to you, and we are actively working on a fix to restore some files via a backup as soon as possible."
However, EA noted that, unfortunately, many of the affected save files were beyond repair, and that, of all corrupted data, only around 40% of users would find their Franchise data salvageable. Thus, it is simply a nerve-rattling case of "fingers crossed" for all those affected, as they wait to see whether their custom leagues — that they have no doubt poured many, many hours into curating — have been permanently wiped.
More information is expected from the EA tech team next week, and users are asked to keep a close watch on the official Madden 23 Twitter. Wishing you luck if this concerns you.

Many JRPGs have slow openings, taking their time to establish the story and familiarize the player with the mechanics before letting them loose into the world. I figured that was the case after playing an hour of Dragon Quest Treasures, so I said to myself, “It’ll get good soon!” I said it again two hours in, three hours in, and five hours in, until eventually, I was forced to accept that this was as good as the game would get. Dragon Quest Treasures is never short on charm or style, but simple, sub-par combat and loot-hunting mechanics had me scraping the bo…]]></summary>

New Year, new games! Well, not yet, so much.
This week the eShop is a little light, as Nintendo doesn't have a game to highlight: and it even took me a solid 15 minutes to decide which game to feature. I ended up settling on the Humongous Classic Collection, which has six games throughout the Pajama Sam, Freddi Fish, Putt-Putt, and Spry Fox series. Given the amount of kids who grew on those games, it was worth the mention.
The real action begins later this month when Fire Emblem Engage hits the Switch, and catapults us into fairly big first quarter of gaming.

Such is the life of a part-time games journalist. Most of my free time is locked up playing through games for review, and I think all my reviews for 2022 averaged out to around a 7, which doesn't exactly make for an exciting, OMG kind of list.
My actual game of the year, Immortality, has already popped up on several of these things and I don't think we need yet another writer droning on about its greatness.

After the bonkers bonanza of Game of the Year and holidays and wrapping up everything in a neat little bow that happens at the end of every year, the slate is finally wiped clean for 2023. This is, arguably, one of the most exciting times in gaming — when the year is fresh and unblemished like newly-fallen snow, and we can dream of what might happen next.
Here at Nintendo Life, we don't have a crystal ball, but we do have many years of experience, and that's better than nothing when it comes to predicting what's next for Nintendo, indies, and the dear ol' Switch. And fear not, we (mostly) won't be mentioning the existence or non-existence of the Sw*tch P*o in here — no hardware, only software!

In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
Episode 1 - The Harry Mason Shuffle
Episode 2- When Doves Cry
Episode 3 - Bible.
Episode 4 - Age Seven, Short, Black Hair
Watch on Twitch!
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.
If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

Looking back on the past few years, it's been tough in the video game industry in the UK. 2022 proved to be no exception, with game sales and console sales down for most of the year compared to last year. Gamesindustry.biz shared GfK's figures, which show an overall 6% drop in game sales for 2022, and a 29% drop in console sales.
At the last minute, the Switch outsold the PS5 to be the best-selling console of the year in the UK — despite a drop in sales of just under 28% compared to 2021. But between the Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series, only 60,000 units separated the three, so it was a close call

Speaking in the publisher's press conference, PlayStation president Jim Ryan singled out the titles as two of "over 30 games" that are currently in development for the PS5's virtual reality hardware, which is currently set to launch in February of this year. Little more was offered in the way of information, though Gran Turismo 7 owners will be able to upgrade to the PSVR2 edition of the title for free.
No release date was offered for the PSVR2 port of Beat Games' Beat Saber, which stands proud today as one of the most loved and recognized rhythm action titles for the modern gaming era. The colorful and exciting game is currently available on PS4 (via PSVR) and PC via HTC Vive, Oculus Quest, and Valve Index.
PSVR 2 will launch worldwide on February 22, priced at a princely $550. The current PSVR catalogue will not be compatible with the new hardware. You can watch Sony's CES 2023 conference, including the PSVR2 update and details of the PS5's recent sales figures, in the video embedded below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Now you can enjoy the miracle of a timeless classic of the past".
One of 2023's biggest surprises is the return of Cannon Dancer - Osman. Developed by Mitchell Corporation and released in arcades in 1996, thanks to a limited run of arcade machines for the game in the west, this side-scrolling gem was once lost to time. But very soon — 9th March according to the North American Nintendo eShop — we'll finally be able to play this classic on home consoles for the very first time, thanks to ININ Games.
So, what's the big deal other than this being a once-lost gem? Koichi "Isuke" Yotsui, the director behind Capcom's legendary Strider, was the lead designer on Cannon Dancer - Osman, and he's gone on record calling this game "my Strider 2" (we'll forget about the real Strider 2 for a second).

Granted, my gaming tastes wax and wane over a year, with lengthy JRPG stints rolling inevitably into junk food like Assassin's Creed Valhalla. No matter what, my one constant is an FPS or 'competitive' game, I suppose. Games like Apex, or Warzone, or even Fortnite.
And yet, for whatever reason, I don't consider them as candidates for the Bestest Best games of any year. I might pour hundreds, possibly thousands of hours into them and they won't even make it into my personal list of absolute faves. That's reserved for games, not games.

Yesterday saw Sony hold its live presentation at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and, as part of the company's announcements, it was revealed that the PlayStation 5 (PS5) platform has now surpassed 30 million global sales.
The final quarter of 2022 was seemingly key in pushing PS5 to this impressive number, as Sony's most recent numbers on PS5 sales, released back in September of last year, noted that the console has sold around 25 million consoles. Thus, five million additional units have been purchased between September 2022 and January 2023, making it the most successful retail window for the PS5 to date. This success comes despite the console's recent price rise, which came into effect in August 2022.
In addition, PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan noted that the console shortage issues that troubled the PS5 in its first years of release should have all but dissipated and that nobody looking to purchase a console should have any issue in finding one available. Ryan thanked the PlayStation community for its patience in dealing with the "unprecedented demand" for consoles over the past two years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony released a sneak peek of its upcoming Gran Turismo movie yesterday evening during its CES 2023 press conference, and as expected, it features a lot of fast vehicles. 
Starring David Harbour (Stranger Things), Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lord of the Rings), and David Barnet (Never Have I Ever), and directed by Neil Blomkamp (District 9, Elysium, Chappie), Gran Turismo is based on a true story. That story is about the GT Academy contest, which was a real contest held between 2008 and 2016 by Sony and Nissan. Winners were given entrance into Nissan's Driver Development Program, as noted by Video Games Chronicle. The film appears to be telling the tale of someone who won entrance into this program and then went on to become a real success in the racing world. 
Check out the Gran Turismo sneak peek for yourself below: 


As you can see, this sneak peek is a mix of what appears to be movie footage and behind-the-scenes footage, with stars like Harbour, Barnet, and Bloom talking about their excitement for the film. 
Gran Turismo hits theaters later this year on August 11. 
Alongside this sneak peek, Sony also revealed that Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the long-running series released last year, will be getting an update that makes the game playable on its upcoming PSVR2 platform. 
While waiting to learn more about this Gran Turismo movie, read about Project Leonardo, a new customizable accessibility controller kit PlayStation unveiled yesterday and then read about how the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 30 million units sold.

Happy New Year, Fire Emblem fans! And what a start to 2023 it looks like being for all you tactical RPG aficionados, as Intelligent Systems' Fire Emblem Engage gets set to drop onto Switch in just a handful of weeks. We've already been busy blasting through the game over the Christmas holiday period and, at around about 12 hours into the main campaign, we reckon there's plenty of reason to get very excited about the imminent arrival of this one.
Fire Emblem Engage introduces a colourful new continent in the form of Elyos, alongside an expansive new cast of characters who get to mix it up with a host of Emblem legends from across the series' history. The story here sees you assume the role of Alear, the red and blue-eyed Divine Dragon who's been awakened from a 1000-year slumber in order to go toe-to-toe with Sombron, the Fell Dragon, an ancient beast who's got his mind set on world domination. In order to stand any chance of defeating this newly-resurrected enemy, Alear is gonna need to venture across the length and breadth of the game's gorgeous world in search of magical Emblem Rings which contain the power of legendary heroes. Only Alear has the ability to call forth the Emblem warriors from the rings, and they're going to need every last one of them by their side in order to prevail.

I had always observed the Fire Emblem series from a distance, worried its strategy gameplay wouldn’t be for me or stressed determining where best to start and how to play through the franchise’s various entries. Fire Emblem Three Houses was the first I gave a good try and 80-plus hours later, it’s one of my favorite games on Switch and turned me into a Fire Emblem fan. Since its reveal, I’ve looked at Fire Emblem Engage as a test bed: am I actually a Fire Emblem fan, or did I just really like Three Houses and its engaging Hogwarts-like school mechanics? If the 10 hours I’ve put into Engage so far are any indication, I’m happy to say it’s the former.

This news comes by way of the company's recent CES 2023 appearance, where PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan revealed these numbers alongside words that seem to indicate the PS5 shortage might be over, or at least coming to an end soon. PlayStation also touched on its upcoming PSVR2 release and accompanying 30-plus game lineup, and pulled back the curtains on its new customizable accessibility controller kit, Project Leonardo. 
As you can see, it seems Ryan and PlayStation are confident in the supply of PS5 consoles around the world. If you're still on the lookout for one, it seems now is the time to start searching retail stores again.

The company revealed this during its CES 2023 presentation yesterday, stating that the kit is "designed to remove barriers to gaming and help players with disabilities play more easily, more comfortably, and for longer periods on PS5."

The company says it has worked with accessibility experts at organizations like AbleGamers, Special Effect, and Stack Up, as well as community members and game developers to design a controller kit like this that works "out of the box."

AMATA has revealed that its "hard but fair" puzzle-platformer Backpack Twins has clambered onto Switch! For $11.99/£10.79 you can attempt to escape dangerous dungeons and lava-filled pits while controlling a pair of twins — and you'll probably die more than a handful of times. (Thanks for the tip, Bunkerneath!)
The game originally launched on Steam in 2019, and has since been ported to other platforms, with the Switch being its last call. Sporting retro pixel graphics and tight controls, you'll need to think quickly in order to survive.

You might remember in one of 2021's stranger collaborations, Fujifilm teamed up with Nintendo to let you produce polaroids of your favourite Switch screenshots via the Instax mini Link printer. These snaps could then be personalised with all kinds of Nintendo-themed frames and stickers including Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Mario and Pokémon Snap. Now, Fujifilm has announced that Splatoon will be the next franchise to get in on the polaroid personalisation.
In a new update for the Instax mini Link for Nintendo Switch app (coming 19th January), the squid kids take centre stage as a batch of Splatoon 3-themed stickers and frames ink their way onto the customisation options.

At Wrestle Kingdom 17, an event put on by New Japan Pro Wrestling, Omega entered the ring to Sephiroth's tune from Final Fantasy VII. Omega already has several ties to the silver-haired villain, including naming his incredible finisher after the song. For Wrestle Kingdom, though, things turned up a notch.
Making use of the massive screens for framing, Omega arrived in full Sephiroth attire. And in a glorious flourish, he extends his hand out with a massive, lone wing. Add in that pinpoint turn, and it's a pr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The publisher is making changes to its long-term plans
Future digital plans seem to be shifting for Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast. Several video games in development have reportedly been shut down by Wizards of the Coast, as the company looks to make changes in its long-term plans.
A new report from Bloomberg claims at least five video games have been cancelled by Wizards of the Coast. A spokesperson told Bloomberg that Wizards is "committed" to digital games. But it has also made changes to its long-term portfolio to "focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing [Wizards'] existing brands", or that show promise in expanding or engaging their audience in new ways.
There will be under 15 people losing their jobs due to the changes, though the Wizards spokesperson tells Bloomberg that they will eb given a chance to seek new roles within the company. Both Hidden Path Entertainment and OtherSide Entertainment are studios potentially affected by the development, according to IGN.

Forgotten realms
Wizards of the Coast has been in the digital realm for a while, but has been making a heavier push in over the last few years. Notably, the company turned to Divinity developer Larian to take up the Baldur's Gate series and work on Baldur's Gate 3. While currently in Early Access, the RPG is slated to go live with its 1.0 version later this year. It's been garnering some praise for its early efforts, too. Some other projects, like the Dark Alliance reboot, haven't been so warmly received.
Wizards had previously stated it has "seven or eight" games set for the near future. It's also been opening studios like Archetype Entertainment, to develop its own video game projects. Parent company Hasbro, however, has been facing a financial downturn, with shares falling 40% last year.

Naughty Dog is celebrating the 10th anniversary of The Last of Us this year, and it's planning to share some news as part of it. The studio shared a new piece of concept art for its The Last of Us multiplayer game that's in the works, and says more news is on the way for 2023.
The Last of Us director Neil Druckmann announced this in a blog, detailing the franchise's history up to now and its future potential. Looking ahead to the 10th anniversary, the team plans to share more about the future of The Last of Us franchise, specifically spotlighting the multiplayer game.
"We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game," said Druckmann. "With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay."
There's also a new piece of concept art for this unnamed multiplayer project, showing off what the team has been working on. We can see some ruins and rusted scenery, but mainly, a seemingly beached cruise liner. Odds are high that place has some nasty infected inside.

What's left of us
The Last of Us looks to have a big year in 2023, between more multiplayer news and the upcoming premiere of the HBO adaptation on January 15. Druckmann says that over the course of the season, there will be an inside look at the original The Last of Us, its Part 1 remake, and the adaptation. It's been a decade since Joel and Ellie first set out, and the pair's cross-country adventures seem poised to make a big return this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Soviet retrofuture in stunning detail
With its uncanny robots, fearsome enemies, and slick style, Atomic Heart has to be one of my most anticipated games of 2023. It somehow manages to reference all of our favorite blockbuster games while still managing to carve a path of its own -- naturally I'm excited to see a game going all out to try something new. We've gotten to see a nice lineup of trailers since Atomic Heart was announced back in 2017, and now we've got one more to add to the list. During Nvidia's CES 2023 showcase, the devs behind the game, Mundfish, let fans in on how amazing the game's ray-tracing and particle effects will look, especially in 4K.
This new trailer came along with an announcement that Nvidia DLSS, or deep learning super sampling, technology will be supported on 33 upcoming games, of course including Atomic Heart. The company describes DLSS as "a revolutionary breakthrough in AI-powered graphics that massively boosts performance." That sounds great to me, but I'm also assuming you have to have the latest graphics cards and processors to be able to run it. Not to mention a 4K monitor and all the fixins that go along with it. I'll likely play it on the PS5, because I'm probably the least tech savvy person in all of gaming. I hope the computer whizzes out there have fun though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah74ys4t3Fs
I can say with confidence that Atomic Heart is going to look incredible with top-of-the-line graphics, but I also think it's going to be a gorgeous game regardless of specs. It has such a fun, distinct art style and atmosphere, I think Mundfish will have it locked down regardless of which platform we choose to play the game on. I've certainly been let down before, but if nothing else, it's cool to see a studio putting something out that's so different from what we've seen in the past few years. Nice graphics are just icing on the cake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One first party exclusive made it into the top 10
With 2022 fully in the rear view mirror, it's time to check in and see how the year went. For the Nintendo Switch, things were mostly good! Metacritic however has their story to tell, including a full "top 40" breakdown of the best-reviewed Switch games of 2022.
Note that the criteria is fairly broad, as it involves every game from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 that had at least seven reviews; ranked entirely by Metascore (ratings).
The top 10 Switch games of 2022, according to Metacritic:
Portal Companion Collection
Persona 5 Royal
Xenoblade Chronicles 3
NieR: Automata - The End of YoRHa Edition
Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration
Neon White
Tunic
Cuphead in the Delicious Last Course
13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe
Seeing a first party Nintendo game in the top five is unsurprising: but it is a bit shocking that there aren't more in there. The rest of the list is filled with ports of celebrated games (Persona 5 Royal, NieR Automata), as well as timed console exclusives like Neon White (which was only on PC and Switch for roughly six months). On the flipside there's games like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, which only just came to Switch this year after it was exclusive to the PS4 since 2019. It's a good mix! Several sole Switch exclusives were kept off the top 10 list due to a mixed reception (mainly looking at the new Pokemon generation).
It just goes to show you that the Switch really has carved out a spot for itself as a port machine that people prefer; and a platform that can deliver high quality ports if the studios are up to the task. You can find the full breakdown here, including the entire top 40.

When you ask a rhythm game fan to list their favorite titles, good money says that they'll start rattling off a bunch of games you can't actually play. Many of the "best" rhythm games are available only to those with access to a halfway-decent arcade or expensive peripherals. Most of those expensive and inaccessible games are excellent, but what are the odds that you'll actually play Dance Dance Revolution A20 or Rock Band 3 in the near future?
If you're like me and only have a couple of modern consoles and a halfway decent PC, it can be hard to break into rhythm gaming. Thankfully, there are plenty of top-tier titles readily available on modern platforms. They might not be quite as good as the finest offerings at a Round1, but they do have the undeniable benefit of bein…]]></summary>

A pseudo prequel is an interesting form for a multiplayer mode to take, especially considering this is the pseudo sequel to My Time At Portia. 
The beta will run from January 12th - January 20th, after which any progress you've made will be wiped.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beyond balance patches
Hidden Variable has released the previously announced "major update" for the Nintendo Switch edition of cartoonish tag-fighter Skullgirls 2nd Encore. More than just a balance patch, the new update rebuilds much of the game's engine at a core level, in efforts to severely improve the Switch edition's performance.
The update, practically a full reinstall of the base game, features fully-rewritten code that vastly improves the load times of the Switch port, while also tightening up online play, ensuring more stable performance, and wiping out a litany of small, troublesome bugs. Hidden Variable hopes that this new version of Skullgirls 2nd Encore will offer Nintendo players their best experience with the fighter to date.
https://twitter.com/Skullgirls/status/1610366242824626179?s=20&t=zA-lXIXiJTH2K17WE8Ky3A
In addition, the new update brings with it the addition of the Skullgirls Season 1 Pass. Switch players can now pick up previously released season one characters — such as Annie of the Stars and Umbrella — while bringing the game up to parity with the PC and console editions in regards to balance and tournament standard features. This update has been a long time coming, and finally sees the Switch Skullgirls community rewarded for their patience.
2023 promises to be a big year for the long-life fight franchise. The coming months will see the arrival of the sinister assassin, Black Dahlia, as well as new stages, character color palettes, webtoons, merchandise, and more. For a full report on Skullgirls' road ahead, be sure to check out our exclusive feature from last month — which includes some first-ever looks at character model sheets and animatics!
Skullgirls 2nd Encore is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile platforms.

The studios released a short teaser video, debuting the shooter sequel's logo but sadly devoid of any actual in-game footage. Regardless, it was announced that Payday 3 would be launching on PC (via Steam) and unspecified console platforms later this year, in news that will no doubt cause a lot of itchy trigger fingers among veteran heisters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us turns 10 years old in June, and Naughty Dog plans to celebrate the milestone with an array of special announcements along the way. One of those updates involves a closer look at the upcoming standalone multiplayer title.
In a blog post, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann reflects on The Last of Us’ legacy as well as the franchise’s future. In addition to the HBO adaptation premiering on January 15 and the PC port of The Last of Us Part 1 hitting in March, Druckmann states fans will learn more about the long-awaited multiplayer experience that serves as a follow-up to the original game’s Factions mode. Druckmann writes,
“We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game. With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”
Naughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. 
Though we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023.

A heads-up for all of you shopaholics that Sony Interactive Entertainment has refreshed its ongoing PlayStation Holiday Sale, adding thousands of titles with discounts up to a huge 75%. The sale, which began at the tail-end of December will now run until Wednesday, January 18.
Obviously, there's little point in me picking out specific titles, but a huge breadth of genres and releases are covered here, from retro classics to some of 2022's finest. Deluxe Editions and DLC are also up for grabs, along with a wide variety of indie hits and Japanese obscurities. I'm in no doubt that you might have already burned out your bank accounts over the past fortnight, but that's why the stagger the additions this way. Pretty sneaky, sis.

And I did try to play some of them, for a bit. Elden Ring and Tunic were both too hard for my state of mind, which was as robust as pink candyfloss. Even Vampire Survivors wigged me out because it's so visually busy by the end game, and I was in a more "Ferrero Rocher and jigsaw of the London Underground map" sort of place. My downfall was seeing PowerWash Simulator on sale on Steam. I bought it, and then played it for 40 hours.

Speaking in a telephone hearing on Tuesday, FTC attorney James Weingarten noted that there has been no "substantive" settlement talks between the trade body and the publisher, suggesting that the two parties will have no option but to pursue the FTC's filed suit to legal trial, which is tentatively set for August of this year.

        <updated>2023-01-04T13:49:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wizards of the Coast, the company behind Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering, has reportedly canceled five unannounced games alongside layoffs affecting "fewer than 15 people," according to a new Bloomberg report. 
The people that will lose their jobs will be given a chance to apply for new roles within WotC, but this apparent business restructuring will affect others outside of the company as well. Bloomberg reports that this reorganization will hit Otherside Entertainment and Hidden Path Entertainment, both working on games for WotC, hard. News of this change follows the release of Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance's release last year, which didn't fare too well with critics and players, amidst Larian Studios' continued development on Baldur's Gate 3 (which does not seem to be affected by this reorganization despite WotC serving as the game's publisher). 
These two games, in part, represented WotC's bigger forray into the video game space as Bloomberg reports that the company had signed contracts with several studios to make games. WotC also "built at least six of its own game studios," according to the publication. 
One project in the works that is now canceled went under the codename "Jabberwocky," according to Bloomberg, and two more externally developed games early in development are no longer moving forward as well. These cancelations and layoffs comes as parent company Hasbro's shares fell 40% last year. 
Wotc told IGN that it remains "committed to using digital games as a cornerstone of our strategy for bringing our games to players around the world," adding that it has "made some changes to our long-term portfolio to focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing our existing brands and those which show promise in expanding or engaging our audience in new ways."

This lines up with what Microsoft said last month, where it announced that if these workers vote to unionize, it would voluntarily recognize the union.

With season 2 of Invincible set to premiere on Amazon Prime sometime this year, Fall Guys is whetting fans’ appetite with skins for Mark, Omni-Man, and Atom Eve. The outfits hit the in-game store on January 5, and that hopefully means a release date announcement for the series won't be too far behind.

Fall Guys enjoyed a bit of a renaissance in 2022. In addition to its usual deluge of seasonal content updates, it went free-to-play in May and launched on Xbox and Switch, gaining a larger player base of contestants and renewed interest in general. We look forward to seeing what 2023 brings for the title, but this is a pretty good start.

        <updated>2023-01-03T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polish developer The Astronauts have revealed a new trailer for their upcoming rogue-lite shooter Witchfire. In addition to showing off some new gameplay clips, it announces that the game will use NVIDIA DLSS3 technology, which a press release says will "massively boost performance." You can watch the trailer below.


Announced by NVIDIA last September, DLSS 3 can boost a game's performance by a significant margin. One demo on NVIDIA's site shows two instances of Cyberpunk 2077 running at 96 FPS with ray tracing still enabled. "DLSS 3 allows the seemingly impossible, high framerate without compromising the visuals," Adrian Chmielarz, creative director and co-founder of The Astronauts says in a press release. "A no brainer for a game like Witchfire, which is both action and beauty."
Witchfire is a dark fantasy first-person shooter from the creators of Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Set in an alternate reality, players are caught in the middle of a war between witches and the Church, and must use weapons and powers from Vatican sorcerers to defeat their enemies. 
The game is set to enter Early Access in the Epic Games Store sometime later this year, though that wasn't always the case. It was delayed last October because the team decided to overhaul the world's design and make it more open. This trailer is a good indication that the studio is still hard at work, though; here's hoping that "early 2023" ends up being as soon as possible.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New year, new content: Cult of the Lamb is getting a "major content update" sometime in 2023. According to a Twitter thread posted to the official Cult of the Lamb account, this update will introduce features many players have requested, including accessibility improvements, quality-of-life features, new difficulty options, and more depth.
This Major Content Update will release in 2023 and be FREE to all players!
pic.twitter.com/FWFW7sC7F0
December 30, 2022
The biggest change they showcase in this thread is the introduction of heavy attacks, which can be activated by holding down the attack button. These are more than slow swings that do more damage; in Cult of the Lamb, every heavy attack has a unique effect. For example, the sword's heavy attack smashes the ground, doing an explosion of damage that harms any enemy caught in its range. Meanwhile, the dagger creates a line of knives that fall from the sky, and the axe can be thrown around like a boomerang. This is just the tip of the iceberg; developer Massive Monster says it's "just one small tidbit" of what's still to come.
The update should come soon, but not that soon. The last tweet of the thread clarifies that the developers are currently working on a patch to fix some console bugs and that the major update won't be released until after that. Their release window also isn't any more specific than "2023," so it could come out any time this year.
If you're interested in learning more about the game, you can check out our review.

        <updated>2023-01-03T15:24:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IO Interactive has announced that Hitman 3 will become Hitman World of Assassination later this month and will include all levels from Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 in it for free. 
More specifically, this big update for the Hitman trilogy arrives on January 26 and includes two major changes: 
"Hitman 3 will become 'Hitman World of Assassination,' which will also include access to Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 through our existing Access Pass system. Current Hitman 3 owners will get a free upgrade to Hitman World of Assassination on all platforms."
"We're drastically simplifying the purchase experience for new players. Hitman World of Assassination will be the single experience option to start playing." 


This update makes it so that all Hitman 3 owners will have the same base content ownership, and it attempts to eliminate confusion over which edition to buy to obtain certain levels by making it so that there is only one purchase option. The other DLC will apparently still be available for purchase, but owning all the IO Interactive Hitman trilogy levels will be easier than ever now. 
Hitman World of Assassination will cost $70, and it includes Hitman 3, the Hitman 1 Game of the Year Access Pass, and the Hitman 2 Standard Access Pass. You can also purchase the Hitman World of Assassination Deluxe Pack for $30 to get the Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack, the Hitman 3 Seven Deadly Sins Collection, and the Hitman 2 Expansion Access Pass. 
"Those are the only two products that new players need to consider when buying any Hitman game digitially as of January 26, 2023," IO writes in a blog post. "The changes have also been made with the Freelancer game mode in mind, where being able to easily access all locations from across the World of Assassination is parmount to maximizing your enjoyment." 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Hitman 3 review and then read about the new Hitman 3 Freelancer mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a New Year’s message, Square Enix’s CEO Yosuke Matsuda reaffirmed the company’s focus on blockchain technology with “multiple blockchain games based on original IPs under development” despite the public backlash against the initiative. This echoes Matsuda’s New Year’s message from last January, where the company first expressed its enthusiasm for an NFT-fueled, metaverse future. More recently, Squeenix partnered with the “environmentally friendly” blockchain firm Oasys, probably to sidestep potential controversies about, y'know, the environmental impact of the technology.

This news comes by way of a new Kickstarter update from developer Nightdive Studios, which states the team has picked "a few last things to share before our quickly approaching launch window of March 2023." as reported by Video Games Chronicle. This remake, which is set to hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC has had a 2023 release year attached to it for a minute now, but this new Kickstarter update points attention to the game's Steam page, which now features a "March 2023" release window.

        <updated>2023-01-03T13:47:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Starbreeze Studios and publisher Koch Media have released a new teaser trailer that calls 2023 "the year of PayDay 3." Presumably, this means the co-op shooter is still on track to release sometime this year. 
Koch gave PayDay 3 a 2023 release window way back in March of 2021, detailing the game's new publishing deal alongside news that there is at least 18 months of post-launch support planned for the title. Later that year, in June, Koch released a new piece of concept art, citing that PayDay 3 will feature a "fully-fledged social heist universe" set within a Hollywood-like setting. That was the last we saw of PayDay 3 until yesterday, when IGN revealed the "official reveal trailer" for the game, although considering how little is shown in it, it's less of a reveal and more of a teaser. 
Check out this new PayDay 3 trailer below: 


As you can see, there's not much to this trailer other than it calling 2023 "the year of PayDay 3." Here's hoping that holds true.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield, the new and upcoming sci-fi RPG from Skyrim makers Bethesda Softworks, was originally due out in November of 2022, but it was delayed to the first half of 2023 last May. Starfield was then a big part of an Xbox showcase last summer and during that showcase, Microsoft revealed that every game shown would be coming in the first half of 2023. 
Now, a new Bethesda support page for the game has reconfirmed this "first half of 2023" window, as spotted by Klobrille on Twitter.
"Starfield arrives exclusively on Xbox Series X/S and PC in the first half of 2023," the support page reads.
This isn't the biggest surprise; Xbox has discussed this release window for Starfield on two occasions before this support page, but it seems the company is really dedicated to getting it out in the coming months. 
While waiting for an official release date, read about why Bethesda's Starfield delay is key to its new-gen success and then check out this story about how your Starfield character will not have a voice. Read about how Starfield's ambitious scale might be worrisome after that and then read about how Xbox Series X/S first-party games will cost $70 starting this year.

By graduation, I’d worked as a writer/narrative designer on prototypes, vertical slices, documentation – you name it. And after many adjustments, my thesis even won a highly competitive grant to assist post-grad development! Short deadlines and secondary assignments led to high-stress periods, albeit in a controlled, academic environment, but the lessons about collaboration and creativity were invaluable.
It’s an ordinary school night, and I’m in a video call with my friend Jude. I watch them casually scroll through graffiti-adjacent concept art and brief clips of a passion project called Ponch: Cyberspace Investigator. They give me a rundown of the game’s mechanics, inspirations, and vibe, which includes phrases like “platformer,” “Ace Attorney-inspired dialogue puzzles,” “detective work,” and “hack the internet.” Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In October 2001, Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto III – and the entire pop-culture paradigm shifted. It’s hard to say anything about GTA III that hasn’t been said a million times over the last 20 years, but suffice it to say, it laid a blueprint for open-world games so complete that the game industry still largely follows it today.
To celebrate the game’s 20th anniversary, we recently talked to Rockstar North art director Aaron Garbut over email about his time working on GTA III, what it meant for Rockstar as a company, and its overall legacy in 2021. Read more...]]></summary>

I guess it’s time for me to publicly confess which games I voted for in this year’s advent calendar but that didn't get it, and without the usual protection of anonymity granted by group lists. Listen: please don’t judge me. I just want to say that up top before you find out where I live and start sending me pizzas or something. I am fallible. You cut me, I bleed red. I put my bread in the toaster one slice at a time.

The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he's away, we've prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.

There's a small chance you're spending the next several hours at a bacchanalian rager, but I'd bet that you're not. You're more likely enjoying a few hours of peace and quiet after a week with family and wishing Jools would hurry the whole thing along.

That sounds like a perfect time to peruse your gaming library and wonder what you could play. Look at all those games you haven't got round to yet! Maybe 2023 should be the year you really commit to learning Dwarf Fortress, now the Steam version is out. Maybe this is the year you finally give an MMO a try or see your first JRPG to completion. Or maybe this year you're going to uninstall your backlog in its entirety and just accept you're only ever going to play Spelunky from now on.

What are your gaming ambitions for 2023? Tell us in the comments below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As both a parent and the resident news lad here, I probably spend way more time talking and writing about games than getting hundreds of hours to actually play them. While most of the games I've snuck the odd minutes with – I hesitate to say hours – made it onto our Advent Calendar for Horace’s approval, the three below were a few that made me and my family smile at different points throughout 2022. Roll on 2023 - and even more games.


Possibly my most magical Christmas as a kid was in 1997, aged 12. I got a Saturn and an issue of the UK’s Official Sega Saturn Magazine that had a Christmas NiGHTS Into Dreams disc on the cover. I reckon that it was my favourite, most unabashedly fun time for gaming ever (outside my decades fiddling around on PC, obvs). Indie platformer Lunistice is a blatant love letter to the 32-bit era, and the kind of game that largely skipped the poor old Saturn.


You guide Hana the Tanuki about as she dreams, aiming to get her to the Moon. Hana properly speeds along, bouncing and spinning her tail to thwack enemies with a lovely splat effect. Devs A Grumpy Fox have really nailed the classic 90s platformer vibe, thanks to all the different dreamworlds that Hana gets to careen through. Don’t expect something open-world like Sonic Frontiers, because Lunistice is deliberately meant to be a linear, short experience. Good grief, could we use more of those.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little known fact is that all of the RPS staff are complex clockwork automata, designed and built by a little gnome with the kind of inch-thick glasses that make your eyes look comically large. We're each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he's away, we've prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

Publisher Deep Silver released some spinoffs after Riptide, like Escape Dead Island, Dead Island: Epidemic, and the 16-bit beat ‘em up Dead Island Retro Revenge, but a full-scale, numbered sequel hasn’t yet happened, despite being announced nearly a decade ago. 
The first iteration of Dead Island 2 was helmed by Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager, as Dead Island developer Techland had parted ways with the property and worked on Dying Light.

This brought a broad mandate to cover indie games and PC Game Pass and to do, like, whatever else I think might be fun or good. It has been weird to not clock in and just Do News, and to have responsibility only over myself. This freedom has felt great when I've had ideas, and terrible when I've not. I'm still feeling it out, settling in, and making mistakes, but I'm quite enjoying myself. Hopefully you have enjoyed some of it too. Here are a few of my favourite things I've written this year!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Images of what appears to be a special The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED model have leaked online, but it's currently unclear if this is a real console or a believable fake. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that the images of this console appeared on the Famiiboard forum last night from user Kysen. The user didn't provide many details about the potential special edition Switch, but as you can see in the images below, the photos are quite believable. There are pictures of the console, the packaging, the Joy-Con, and more.
Check out the possible leaked images of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED special edition for yourself below:

December 30, 2022
As you can see, it appears that this model of the Switch is real. However, elaborate and well-done fakes have been done before so there's no telling if this is actually real until we learn more information. It wouldn't be the most surprising thing ever, considering Nintendo tends to release special edition OLED models for big releases like this year's Splatoon 3 and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. 
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom hits Switch on May 12 so it might be a while before we learn if this special edition OLED model is real. In the meantime, check out our list of the biggest 2022 games delayed to 2023.

So, here are the games I would've slammed into our advent calendar if I were still allowed to cheat, along with some that simply didn't quite make the cut.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metal Gear Solid creator and Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima and Metal Gear Solid publisher Konami parted ways with each other back in 2015 and since then, there hasn't been a mainline entry in the famed MGS series (although there was the not-so-great Metal Gear Survive in 2018). 
While there's no reason to believe Kojima and Konami are teaming up again anytime soon, it seems the latter might be preparing for some kind of return to MGS. Longtime MGS producer Noriaki Okamura wrote in a recent issue of Famitsu that "2023 will be a year of many announcements," as reported by Gematsu. 
In this special end-of-the-year issue of Famitsu, multiple Japanese developers and producers wrote quick teases about what 2023 might hold for them. It's here where Okamura teased that 2023 will be a year of announcements for Konami Digital Entertainment. More specifically, he said "Other than [the educational edition of Momotaro Dentetsu announced last year], 2023 will be a year of many announcements," and that his keyword for 2023 is "long-awaited," as noted by Gematsu. 
Now, this could just be his way of saying that Konami, as a whole, will make some announcements and that maybe some of them will be long-awaited by fans. However, given that it's Okamura – a longtime MGS producer – saying this, there's reason to believe that maybe he's teasing a return to the MGS series. Perhaps we're getting a remake of one of the games, or maybe a new mainline entry. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of the Metal Gear Solid series.

We're each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us.

Arc Raiders
Arc Raiders was set to be the debut title from Embark Studios, a team of ex-DICE talent led by former EA head Patrick Söderlund. The co-op shooter about fighting off robots from space made a splash during last year's Game Awards. In a surprising twist, however, Embark announced months later it was delaying Arc Raiders to next year to focus on launching another shooter pro…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's Ryzen 5600X was a favourite of value-oriented gamers when it debuted in late 2020 - to say nothing of RPS head big honcho Katharine - so unsurprisingly AMD followed it up with an even cheaper model, the 5600, about a year later. This non-X variant performs more or less identically, with a slightly low rated boost clock that translates into one or two percent worse performance in CPU-limited scenarios. Given the fact that the 5600 is £13 cheaper on Amazon right now, we'd recommend it over the X any time.

This makes it a good performer even in sustained write scenarios, as you might encounter in video editing and the like, while its good random read/write speeds are good for gaming. Sabrent has discounted the drive to £77.99 on Amazon UK, which is a good price for this level of performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is still on track to release sometime next year, and developer GSC Game World has released its first trailer in six months, showcasing gameplay with some narrative trappings along the edges.
Courtesy of IGN, the new video shows that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is looking pretty darn good. The narrative-driven shooter is set in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in a post-apocalyptic world laden with dangerous mutated monsters. Players must fight their way to the heart of the zone while steering the non-linear plot through choice-driven gameplay. 


Formally confirmed in 2020 after years of start and stop announcements, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has had a tumultuous development. After announcing and quickly canceling NFT plans due to fan backlash in December 2021, the project came to a screeching halt in February due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC is based. Many employees were forced to evacuate their homes in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Other designers chose to defend the city. One of GSC’s designers who volunteered to fight, Vladimir "Fresh" Yezhov, was recently killed in combat. 
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is slated to arrive on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) and PC in 2023. It was one of the many titles to get bitten by the delay bug and pushed into next year, a list you can check out here.]]></summary>

The video intentionally didn’t explain what the game was, but beyond including the word Aperture in the title, it was clear it took place in the Portal universe. The end of the trailer revealed it would be releasing only a few days later, and it would be free.


As promised, the game released on March 1 and it feels like nobody played it, which is a shame because it is a fantastic, “Playable Short,” as Valve refers to it.
Aperture Desk Job doesn’t have portals in it, but it is a Portal game. It features an established Portal character, as well as a new character named Grady, voiced by one of my favorite comedians (and maybe yours after you watch the clip below), Nate Bargatze.

I cut it down by about half to get what we have here, a collection of interviews and thinky pieces and silly pieces and wonderful pieces from 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two of the year’s biggest open-world games, Elden Ring and Pokémon Scarlet have been Frankensteined into one tantalizing entity thanks to the work of one talented modder.
The modder in question goes by the handle Arestame, who tweeted a trailer of their handiwork that drops Scarlet assets into the Lands Between. The mod outfits the Tarnished in the significantly less protective garb of Pokémon trainers, who cruise the dangerous landscape atop the motorcycle-like Koraidon. The video highlights how Elden Ring would be an even better game if it had Lechonks and Quaxlys roaming about, though that doesn't make it any less dangerous, as evidenced by one particuarly brutal Pokémon ambush. Check out the video by clicking the embedded tweet below.

December 28, 2022
It’s unclear if this mod will be publicly available to download or if this video is only a proof-of-concept showcase. We’ve reached out to Arestame for clarification and will update this story if we receive a response.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a well-documented fact here at RPS that I love a good spreadsheet. Specifically, my spreadsheet that lists all the lovely games I manage to play each year. I've been looking at that spreadsheet a lot in recent weeks, and I'm pleased to report that most of my top game picks from this year have successfully made their way into the RPS Advent Calendar. There were plenty that didn't, of course (pouring one out for you, Dorfromantik, Flat Eye, Dome Keeper and Lost In Play), but such is the way of things when your current list of completed games for the year is teetering on the verge of 50. 
No word of a lie, I would probably be here all day if I laid out my entire long list of honourable mentions for 2022 (additional shoutouts to Railbound, Cursed To Golf, God Of War, Weird West, Jack Move, Hard West 2 and The Kids We Were), but for the sake of all involved (and poor Alice Bee's editing pencil), I've narrowed it down to a shortlist of three. (Do still go and check out those other games, though. They're all absolutely rad).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sequels are often contentious, but I feel like video games can get away with being a part of a long-running series – and, crucially, still be good while they’re at it, well past the point where a book or movie franchise would have outstayed its welcome.
The thing is, though, when it comes to GOTY lists like our Advent Calendar, it’s a much bigger task to convince your fellow voters of the merits of your new favourite game when it’s the third, fourth, or maybe even sixteenth in its series. I’m adamant that those games deserve their share of recognition at the end of the year, which is why my honourable mentions celebrate 2022’s new entries into some of my favourite ongoing series.

I did, however, play a few hours with both Dani and Ryan, two very different survivors that add their own flair to the story of this zomb-pocalypse. 
I came out of this cover story trip convinced Dani is the survivor for me, but Ryan is great, too. And there are still the other four survivors I didn't get to play. Nonetheless, I want to tell you about Ryan, and Dambuster Studios does, too (read about Dani here)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Each mainline entry of the Street Fighter series is an important milestone in the fighting game genre. Though every numbered entry received critical acclaim, Street Fighter V sticks out among fans as the outlier of the series; the game experienced perhaps the most tumultuous launch of any Street Fighter game to date. But out of that trouble emerged something great. Thanks to the team’s persistence, post-launch roadmap, and an injection of new blood into the project's leadership, Street Fighter V drastically improved its core gameplay, online play, content offerings, and more throughout its six-year lifespan.
With the benefit of those lessons learned, many team members that righted the ship are back to develop Street Fighter 6. The latest entry delivers myriad improvements, new features, and a sleek new aesthetic while simultaneously acknowledging and paying homage to each entry before it. Street Fighter 6 feels like yet another evolution of the fighting game genre ushered in by the franchise that pioneered it in the first place. Read more...]]></summary>

Recovering from this high would become a personal struggle for the remainder of the year.
Elden Ring dominated my life. When I wasn’t playing it, it was the only thing I wanted to do.

PlayStation has not announced the new titles coming to the Extra and Premium tiers, but says that they'll be "announced soon." You can read the full blog post here.
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a notable inclusion because its sequel, Jedi: Survivor, is set to come out in March. This PS Plus offering is an ideal opportunity for players to check out the first before visiting the second. If you played the game at launch, this is also a chance to check out the updates that introduced upgraded graphics and performance for PS5, as well as updates that added New Journey+ and challenge modes. You can read our original review here.
This is also a friendly reminder to claim December's PS Plus titles: Divine Knockout, Biomutant, and Mass Effect: Legendary Edition. They'll all be available until January 3, the day the new games are added, so be sure to grab them before that.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking back over an entire year of RPS reviews and, well, we've written a lot. Over the past twelve months, the RPS treehouse and our merry band of freelancers have reviewed 168 games in total - and that includes early access reviews, PC-port reviews, group reviews, reviews-in-progresses, and your common or garden fully-fledged reviews. 168! Damn. Even though game releases are still suffering from pandemic pushbacks, 2022 has been a busy year for games. There wasn't a huge number of big name releases - although the ones that did come out were plenty big enough - but, as always, we've had a wealth of wonderful indies releasing all year round, and we scooped up as many of them as we could.
Out of all the games we’ve given any kind of review treatment throughout the year, only a handful of them recieved RPS’s coveted Bestest Best badge; just 23, to be exact. I've gathered them all in one big round-up bundle below (there are round-ups of our favourite bits from other sections of the site, too), and they make a great collection of games. Have a scroll and click on any that take your fancy for the full review. Enjoy!

Its minigame-centric fights and awkward movement were damning, but it also lacked the silly, over-the-top violence Mortal Kombat is known for – a sad reality for appeasing license holder Warner Bros. Batman can cripple impoverished criminals, but he can’t be cut in half by Tarkatan blades.
It would have been disappointing to end on an ill-fated crossover, but Midway’s untimely demise could have made that so. Layoffs, uncertainty, and publisher implosion aren’t how franchises live; it’s how they die. But the then-newly formed NetherRealm Studios reinvigorated the entire franchise after its darkest period with one of its most beloved entries: the 2011 reboot, Mortal Kombat 9. Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trombone Champ is a good joke. I played it once, chuckled along with its simulated tooting, and haven't felt any compulsion to return. 

I will click on any Trombone Champ video I come across online, however. Armed with some community-made modding tools, creative players have added custom songs to the game, with custom models and backgrounds. At their best, these videos turn a good joke into a complete comedy sketch. And the person making them at their best is Gloomhonk.

I have vague memories of seeing a TV commercial for the original PlayStation game when I was young and remember playing the game’s first few hours in a friend’s attic between Mat Hoffman’s Pro BMX sessions. It wasn’t until much later, when I found an inexpensive green label copy at a Circuit City, that I gave it another shot, but, again, I only made it through the first few hours. When Square Enix released it in such a way that I could play it on my PlayStation 3 and move it over to my PSP, I made it the furthest. I left Midgar, saved my game, and turned off my PSP, fully lying to myself that I would pick it back up again soon. That was more than 10 years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you walked into an arcade in the 1990s, it undoubtedly had a Street Fighter II cabinet. If you went at the right time, you probably even saw a crowd gathered around it. As one of the most profitable games in arcade history, Street Fighter II drew more than its fair share of quarters and tokens during the arcade heyday. But the franchise transcends that one moment in time. To say that Street Fighter has sparked multiple revolutions in its genre throughout its history is not far-fetched.
Arcades aren’t omnipresent the way they once were, but the Street Fighter name has endured the ever-shifting grounds of the games industry. The fierce fistfights made the leap from mall game rooms to the living room, the internet, and even tournaments broadcast to massive, international audiences. As the franchise turns 35 years old, we met with the people involved to understand the series’ origins and how it remains relevant three-and-a-half decades later. Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft’s road to acquire Activision Blizzard has been a rocky one, to say the least. The most recent (and significant) roadblock comes from the American Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which filed a lawsuit a few weeks ago to prevent the deal from going through. Now, Microsoft has fired back with a response, saying the FTC is violating their fifth amendment rights to due process. 
The full document (which you can read here) claims that the deal should be allowed to go through for several other reasons as well, stating that Xbox and Activision Blizzard are “just two of hundreds of game publishers.” The claims that the FTC violates the constitution are listed on page 34 and are just a handful of defenses against the lawsuit in a list of two dozen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The story of Cuphead is indie gaming legend. Brothers Chad and Jared Moldenhauer worked for years, risking their finances founding Studio MDHR and hiring a host of talented artists and animators to bring their tough-as-nails run ‘n’ gun game to life. The gamble paid off in spades. Inspired by both 1930s animation and classic games like Contra and Gunstar Heroes, Cuphead has sold more than six million copies, amassing critical acclaim, legions of fans, a TV show, and multiple world records along the way.
With Cuphead’s staggering success, it’s not too surprising the team at MDHR wanted to deliver one more serving of sharp shooting excitement and aggravation. Opting for DLC as opposed to a full-on sequel, the Cuphead developer set about outlining The Delicious Last Course, released in June 2022. Early in production, MDHR decided that a boss concept from the original game, one scrapped due to time constraints, would be the perfect starting point for this newest outing.

I joined team Arpus all the way back in February, and to say the last 11 months have been a whirlwind is a bit of an understatement. In less than a year I’ve made just under 90 videos covering a wide range of topics from major releases to international gaming events and brand-new hardware. My first year at RPS has been busy, basically. So when Katharine asked me to pull together a few of my personal highlights, I was kind of stumped. It's hard to pick favourites! It's even harder to celebrate my own achievements, but that's beside the point.

I’d probably also tip a hat to Warhammer 40K: Darktide, but Alice0 already nabbed it for her honourable mentions, and frankly there’s enough shootybang stuff here as it is. But, also: toilet build quality testing, pushing Nazis into cement pits, and more than a hint of 70s funk. Check ‘em out.

I did, however, play a few hours with both Dani and Ryan, two very different survivors that add their own flair to the story of this zomb-pocalypse. 
I came out of this cover story trip convinced Dani is the survivor for me, but Ryan was great, too. And there are still the other four survivors I didn't get to play. Nonetheless, I want to tell you about Dani, and Dambuster Studios does, too (read about Ryan here).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though it’s a remake of a game released in 2013 for the PlayStation 3, The Last of Us Part I is, in most respects, the same game as the original The Last of Us. Players first experiencing the game through the remake will understand the plot in much the same way. They follow the same story to the same conclusion, meeting the same characters and feeling many of the same feelings. They experience the same vision of a post-apocalyptic United States, where one traumatized man, Joel, reckons with his inability to part with his surrogate daughter, Ellie.
But even a remake sticking as close to the original script and general design of its original as Part I is, ultimately, a new game in its own right. By making a game look “better” than it did before, it’s changed into something else. Whether in small or large ways, it is altered. Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guides work is a very strange beast, and one that we don't talk about as often as we maybe should. By its nature, we here in guidestown can feel a bit isolated from the rest of RPS. Our guides aren't very visible to our regular readers. No one hops onto a website like this and says to themselves, "Well now! I wonder what guides have been written today that I can spend my time reading through!". The vast majority of people who read our guides come straight from a Google search into something specific like "Can I romance Yennefer and Triss at the same time?" (spoiler alert: you can, but it may not end well for you).
Because we operate so much behind the scenes, it's easy to miss some of the amazing stuff that the team did in guidestown this year. It ain't easy, writing a walkthrough or how-to that's useful for the reader while simultaneously appeasing those nebulous and mercurial SEO gods. But 2022 has been a stonkingly good year for guides, and I'd love to take a little bit of time to shine a light on some of the things we're most proud of having achieved this year - and to toast what will hopefully be another smashing year for guides in 2023!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Radeon RX 6700 XT is an excellent 1440p graphics card, offering strong rasterised performance, a good image upscaler in FSR 2 and relatively cool and quiet operation. The card is much stronger pound for pound than its closest Nvidia competition, the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3070, with the latter remaining at surprisingly high prices due to the ultrapremium RTX 4080 and 4090 Team Green has launched so far. 
Today, the best price we've spotted for the RX 6700 XT is for a Gigabyte Eagle model, selling on Amazon UK for £389.99. That's nearly 40% below its RRP and an overall great value for this level of performance.

His will be different, he says, because he's "taking the approach of changing and evolving the world of Death Stranding in a way that suits film well".
He also says there's "no real need" to turn games into films, which is a true and enjoyable acknowledgement from someone who is doing that.

Not to be confused with Silent Hills P.T. (it's like… the exact opposite of that), Captain Spirit is free to play, takes two to three hours to complete, and manages to perfectly encapsulate the Life Is Strange experience without giving anything away about the main (read: paid-for) games in the series. It also features possibly my favourite LIS protagonist in adorable wannabe superhero Chris, which is quite a high bar to clear, considering how much time I spend banging on about what great characters Chloe and Sean are.

They say "Putnam" will be the first non-Adam to ever see the code behind the curtain. Cue the Indiana Jones face-melting gif.
An update yesterday also added Steam trading cards, as well as giving you the option to flick between classic and premium graphics.

It is interesting to consider that I could try to wipe the website, delete loads of articles, do something to burn down my job. I don't particularly want to, but the coiled potential to do it exists, because I am unsupervised. There is no other member of staff between me and all of you. The great filter is removed. Any typos are on purpose. How you doin'?
This gives me a great opportunity, because I get to have, in a sense, the final word on RPS this year. There are a lot of posts coming up (if we include the Advent Calendar posts that have already gone, we have 50-ish bits of hashtag seasonal hashtag content this year, which I think is the most I've had to schedule for a Christmas break yet), but almost everything after this point is a scheduled post, made of time travel words written days or weeks ago. I'm live and uncensored, baby. I'm going to fire up Among Trees. Let's go and be alone together. But don't worry, I take my responisbility seriously, so I'll make sure the final word is a joke.

We weren’t planning on blogging between last week and Christmas, but then Sean Hodgins went and made this, and it would be unseasonably churlish of us not to share, especially given how much personal danger he put himself in while developing this project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!
Published in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. 
A new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.
Solve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!
Our reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are pleased to announce that ScummVM now supports Adibou 2, a popular educational game developed by Coktel Vision in 1996.
Designed for children from 4 to 7 years old, the world of Adibou is warm and full of surprises. It offers an intelligent and appealing introduction to essential knowledge like reading and math.
Whether you have young kids in your family, or are keen on reliving your childhood memories for a while, fetch the latest daily build of ScummVM, your own copy of Adibou 2, and start learning having fun with Adibou, Plop, Robitoc and Kicook!
You must copy the content of your Adibou “Environment” CD into the game directory added to ScummVM. Then, for any Adibou Application you want to add, just copy the content of their CD into a freely named subdirectory of the main game directory.
Only Read/Count 4-5 years, Read/Count 6-7 years applications are supported for now, but we hope Science, Music and English will come soon.
Currently ScummVM is aware of several Adibou versions in French, German and English, let us know if you own any language/version not yet registered. Please also report to the issue tracker any glitch you may encounter.
