GSC Game World has quietly updated the spelling of its upcoming FPS, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl. 
The subtitle on the game was previously spelled “Heart of Chernobyl,” which features the Russian spelling of the location where the game takes place. However, likely as a result of Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine (the studio has been vocal about its support for Ukraine), GSC Game World has changed “Chernobyl” to “Chornobyl” to reflect the Ukrainian spelling of the word, as reported by PC Gamer. 
The change reportedly happened on March 14 by way of a Steam name update. The new spelling is visible in both the standard Steam entry and the title’s description and Steam-related entries. PC Gamer points out that the original spelling can still be seen on some promotional art and other listings, though. 
GSC Game World has not publicly addressed this name change, but the studio is also based in Ukraine and has made it clear it is focusing on keeping its employees safe above all else, opting to sideline the development of Stalker 2 while the conflict continues.
For more about Stalker 2, check out the latest look at it. Read about the game studios that have shown their support for Ukraine amidst Russia’s ongoing invasion of the country after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Tour begins.
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the most popular game on Switch, the very definition of an 'evergreen' title. Aside from the Battle Mode and a few minor changes, however, devoted fans have been playing the same content since the Wii U original with its DLC content, a scenario that finally changes with the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe-exclusive Booster Course Pass.
Wave 1 has landed and generated plenty of excitement, and there's certainly a thrill in booting the game up and being presented with two new Cups to enjoy — Golden Dash Cup and Lucky Cat Cup. The mix of courses reminds us that this is the equivalent of the 'bottom row' of the original line-up, with a range of retro and — for the first time — Mario Kart Tour tracks included in the eight new offerings. It's a solid initial selection though, especially as this is the first batch and therefore presumably the 'easier' Cups in what will become a whopping 48-track package.

In the lower-end dedicated web server rental space, budget web hosting, and similar personal / small office server space, AMD Ryzen processors can prove more than capable. Already some dedicated server providers are offering AMD Ryzen powered servers and more are expected to come soon -- especially with even more server-minded wares for Ryzen expected next generation. In looking at this space, we have been testing a number of AMD Ryzen processors recently compared to Intel Xeon E class competition for looking at the performance and value in the low-end dedicated server space.]]></summary>

Final Fantasy is a staple in JRPGs and video games as a whole. It might have more entries in it than any other series out there and it won’t be slowing down anytime soon. On top of that, thanks to its anthology-like nature, if one Final Fantasy game doesn’t click for you, there’s a good chance another one will. As a result, ranking the Final Fantasy series can be highly contentious. Everyone has a lot of love for the first entry they played, and then there are heavy hitters like Final Fantasy X and VII, too. 
However, the staff here at Game Informer did the seemingly impossible: we ranked all 19 mainline numbered Final Fantasy games, including their direct sequels, from worst to best. As a reminder, this ranking is t…]]></summary>

It contains almost no in-game footage, mind you, but it contains hints about companions, romance, character start points, a new dialogue persuasion system that aims to improve on Oblivion's, and Bethesda returning to their old school RPG roots.

And here at Nintendo Life, with the release of Kirby and the Forgotten Land fast approaching, we’ve decided that it’s time someone picked the 20 best and made a list of them, darn it. After all, it’s the least we could do after three long decades of HAL’s versatile hero.
Don’t see your favourite here? Well, variety is the spice of life, after all – sound off in the comments! Unless your favourite is Cutter or something similarly boring, in which case please don’t bother (jokes!). Anyway, enough chirping – let’s get down to business. As Kirby always says: “Poyo! Hiiiii!!

Pokémon cards continue to grow more and more popular, with pack pulls becoming ever so popular on Twitch and YouTube. However, another facet of Pokémon card collecting remains popular: buying extremely rare ones at auctions. 
For example, a rare Illustrator Pikachu card sold for nearly $1 million last month. Now, the latest rare Pokémon card sold at auction is making the rounds in the trading card community: a Snap Magikarp card, one of 20 known to exist. First reported by Nintendo Life, these Snap cards were given to winners of a Pokémon Snap competition held in Japan decades ago. If you were a winner, your winning Pokémon Snap in-game photograph was turned into an actual Pokémon card, so not only are these rare right off the bat as a result but only 20 of each was made.
Nintendo Life reports that one of 20 Snap Magikarp cards was recently sold at a Japanese auction for 5 million yen, or roughly $136,000. You can watch this video about the card below, uploaded by smpratte, the person who appears to be the winner:

With this one sold, there’s another 19 out there somewhere. Perhaps people safely own those other 19, or maybe, they’ve been lost to time. For now, they remain as elusive as a Magikarp doing its best not to bite the bait on an Old Rod (ok, maybe they’re a little more elusive than that). 
For more, read about the Illustrator Pikachu card sold last month and then check out the upcoming Pokémon Go trading card packs being released in stores soon.

First revealed as Secret Legend way back in 2015, Andrew Shouldice's Tunic is now out, with a surprise day-one launch on Xbox Game Pass yesterday. It's also available on PC, and regardless of where you decide to play, it's well worth your time – it's a Game Informer must-play title, after all, receiving a 9.75 out of 10 in our review. 
Today, Game Informer's Tunic reviewer, Jill Grodt, and Game Informer video editor Alex Van Aken are going to take you through Tunic's opening hours on the official Game Informer Twitch channel this afternoon at 2 p.m. Central. Alex will be on the sticks, discovering everything in-game for the first time, and Jill will be there to point out any must-see secrets and dole out combat tips along the way.

It's sure to be a great time, and we hope you join us. Tunic, with its beautiful and charming visual style, is worth checking out, and what better way to do that than by watching Alex and Jill play through its opening hours? However, be cautious. Part of the magic of this game is discovering things for yourself. So, if you want to go in blind, bookmark this page and come back after you've thrown a few hours into the title. 
If you enjoy our livestreams but haven't subscribed to our Twitch channel, we highly recommend it because it not only gives you notifications when we go live, but it gives you access to special subscriber-only emotes, too. Plus, you'll be given entry into the official Game Informer Discord, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, movies, TV, food, and so much more.]]></summary>

If you think we're joking... well, we mostly are, but from February's rumour mill winding up, and Rick Astley declaring James Bond's N64 outing is his favourite video game, to the Xbox digital re-release rumours in January, it seems everyone is desperate to get their hands on either that cancelled Xbox 360 GoldenEye remaster a more basic re-release of the world's best-known spy's best game.
Danjaq LLC, the company that owns many trademarks and licenses for the Bond franchise, was granted an extension to use the trademark just two days ago, on 15th March. The franchise's 60th anniversary is this year, and with these updates and rumours swirling around for the past year, it's surely a case of 'if' not 'when'.

Delta Squad is slowly coming back together through Hasbro's awesome Star Wars: The Black Series line of action figures. GameStop today revealed that the expert hacker known as Fixer (or RC-1140) is the next to suit up again, joining the ranks of Boss. Delta Squad is best known from the Star Wars: Republic Commando video game, a first-person shooter that originally released in 2005, yet was recently reissued on PlayStation 4 and Switch.
This Fixer action figure is a GameStop exclusive and is a part of Hasbro's Black Series Gaming Greats line, which has given us action figures for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic's Darth Revan and Darth Nihilus, and even Jango Fett from Star Wars: Bounty Hunter. Boss launches on April 6, and Fixer won't be far behind him, but he doesn’t have an official release date yet. You can preorder the figure now, however.

Delta Squad won't be complete until all four of its recruits are together again. Odds are we'll see announcements in the months ahead for Scorch and Sev to join The Black Series. Which other video game Star Wars characters would you like to see added to this line of action figures? I'm still hoping KOTOR's HK-47 gets his time to shine, but also wouldn't mind seeing some of the creatures from Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order added to the mix.
Speaking of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, GameStop also revealed a 13th Batallion Trooper from the Star Wars: The Black Series line of action figures. Here's a look at it:

It is also available now for pre-order.

The long-awaited indie, Tunic, just released, and it’s one of Game Informer’s best-reviewed titles of 2022 so far. Part of the game’s magic stems from its cryptic nature, and even the simplest things, from where to go to how to use items, can be puzzling. So, having beaten the game and uncovered many of its hidden secrets, I’m ready to dish out some specially constructed hints. These spoiler-free suggestions won’t rob you of the satisfaction of figuring things out for yourself but may just help you avoid pitfalls.

I chose the Astrologer class and used sorceries galore to effortlessly steamroll through almost every boss. Nothing could compete with my trusty staff, so I didn’t need to use spirit ashes for my first 100 hours or so. I was fine by myself, like any good romcom protagonist at the start of the movie.
As I walked into the final boss arena, I had unwaivering confidence. I strolled in, staff at the ready and prepared to win. Then, my string of easy victories came to a shocking end. I got walloped and decimated for about 10 hours and eventually announced my defeat. Elden Ring was a game I just couldn’t finish. Fortunately, love had other plans, and I entered into a whirlwind romance with the Mimic Tear Ash.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers now have access to three additional titles, this time all Sega Genesis games: Alien Soldier, Super Fantasy Zone, and Light Crusader. 
Announced in a press release, these retro games are now available to download and play if you’re a subscriber to Nintendo’s premium Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service, which gives you access to not just Sega Genesis games, but Nintendo 64 titles as well. Here’s what to expect with each of these three Sega Genesis games:
Alien Soldier
“In Alien Soldier, the acclaimed developers at Treasure invite you to take on the role of a bird-man with steel wings in his fight against 25 bosses. In this challenging game, you can learn new tactics with every defeat…or take advantage of that handy Rewind feature to perfect your run.”
Alien Soldier is a run-and-gun action game first released for the Genesis in 1995. In the U.S., it was only available via the Sega Channel cable service. The game was re-released on the PlayStation 2, and years later, it was released again on the Wii Virtual Channel and Steam. 
Super Fantasy Zone
“Super Fantasy Zone has you powering up the ever-appearing Opa-Opa across eight colorful planets.” 
Super Fantasy Zone launched on the Sega Genesis, or Mega Drive, in Japan in 1992. It wouldn’t hit the U.S. until 2008, when it was released on the Wii. 
Light Crusader
“In Light Crusader, also from Treasure, let nobility light your way through a lovingly crafted action-RPG.” 
Light Crusader arrived on the Genesis in 1995, before it was re-released on Steam 15 years later in 2010. It combines elements of RPG, action, and platforming in one package.

Interestingly, in a clear breakaway from previous narratives, the series will take place in the near future in 2036.

Matthew clues us in on what it was like to work for a secret shopper company, and Nate tells us about his repeat of his annual Eat Every Thing In Lord Of The Rings watch-along. Will this result in his daughter blocking memories? Only time will tell.

Monaco: What’s Yours Is Mine lets players live out their movie heist fantasies either alone or in a group when it launched in 2013. The newly announced Monaco II enlists fans back for one more job nearly a decade later.
Monaco II features procedurally generated 3D environments emphasizing verticality. During today’s Humble Games Showcase, creator Andy Schatz discussed the design by saying players can now break into buildings by scaling their walls or tunneling underneath them. You can even repel from the ceilings of some rooms Mission Impossible-style. Monaco 2 remains a top-down isometric game, but improved camera mechanics will seemingly provide more angles on the action.

Monaco II has only been confirmed for PC for now and has no release window. Schatz also announced that fans can follow the game’s creation by watching developer PocketWatch’s weekly Twitch streams to maintain transparency. 
We’re excited to see how Monaco II shapes up, especially since it builds upon the winning foundation of its entertaining predecessor. Monaco: What’s Yours Is Mine scored an 8.75 out of 10 from us, with reviewer Matt Miller writing, “Whether you’re all on the same couch or meeting up online, Monaco offers a multiplayer experience unlike any other game on the market.”
Are you excited about Monaco II, and what did you enjoy about the original game? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A sequel is coming for excellent cooperative heist game Monaco, publishers Humble Games announced today. Jim Rossignol's Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine review in 2013 was pretty straightforward: "This is one of the most important independent games this year, and might well end up being one of the best-loved games of the decade." I don't think it panned out quite that way, partially because indie games grew so larger and more mainstream than expected across the decade, but the IGF Grand Prize winner is still a cracking game. And Monaco 2 looks pretty.

Last December, creator Daniel Mullens announced the beta for a mini-expansion to his acclaimed deck builder Inscryption called Kaycee’s Mod. The mode would allow players to indefinitely replay the game’s cabin section in a roguelike fashion but accessing it required players to (intentionally) jump through some hoops. After months of tweaking, Kaycee’s Mod is complete and readily available. 
Now that Kaycee’s Mod is fully unlocked, players will receive it via a free update on Steam, as well as the Epic Store and GOG versions of the game. The mode has you battling Leshy in increasingly difficult levels. Applying skulls to runs modifies its conditions, and conquering levels unlocks new cards and additional challenges. For fans of Inscryption’s story, the mod also unlocks developer logs written by Kaycee Hobbes that document her discoveries of the disk’s secrets.

To mark the occasion, Inscyrption currently has a 30 percent discount, which is a nice bargain for one of the best games of 2021. For more on Inscryption, be sure to check out our review, then find out which of its many twists rank among our favorite moments of the generation.]]></summary>

Netflix has released a trio of bloody posters for its upcoming live-action Resident Evil series alongside news that the horror show will hit the streaming service this July. 
More specifically, the series, which is simply called Resident Evil, will hit Netflix on July 14. The posters reveal this release date and unfortunately, for those looking for some more story details, that’s about it. However, the three posters are very nice to look at thanks to their minimalistic (and still bloody) design.

As you can see, one of the posters features the title underneath a bubble of blood, another a vial of blood with the T-Virus pathogen inside, and the third poster highlights a yellow and red pill that says “Joy,” seemingly created by the Umbrella Corporation. Here’s Netflix’s description for the series: 
And here’s a look at the cast for the show: 
Been dying to announce this. Get ready to enter New Raccoon City with the cast of RESIDENT EVIL: LANCE REDDICK / ELLA BALINSKA / TAMARA SMART / SIENA AGUDONG / ADELINE RUDOLPH / PAOLA NUNEZ. #GeekedWeek pic.twitter.com/ULKEFuYdAr
June 11, 2021
As for what this show is about, beyond the description for the series above, not much else is known. However, we don’t have to wait too much longer fortunately because it will hit Netflix in just a few more months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GPU-based upscaling has proven to be one of the most useful additions to gaming PC tech in years. Big performance improvements in exchange for only a minor drop in visual quality, if any at all? Yes please and thank you. Nvidia’s DLSS has established itself as the gold standard of upscalers, outperforming AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR), but the Radeon makers are now readying two new offerings: FSR 2.0 and Radeon Super Resolution (RSR).


FSR 2.0 looks to be a straight upgrade on the current 1.0 version, promising sharper picture quality with “optimised anti-aliasing” to better compete with the built-in, AI-assisted edge smoothing of DLSS. It will still need to be implemented in games by their developers, though – unlike RSR, which aims to work with just about any game by applying its upscaling algorithm at the GPU driver level.

Cozy, rustic, slow-going living with a touch of the magical has a certain appeal all its own, and as the recent announcement of Songs Of Glimmerwick proves, EastStud don’t intend on shaking up that brand any time soon. This is a wonderful thing for me because their previous outing and namesake, Eastshade, is not only one of my favourite games of all time, but also such an important kind of game in the terrifying, nightmare world we find ourselves in today.

Heroes come in many different forms, and stepping into the role isn’t an easy decision. Sometimes it’s done out of necessity, while other times, it comes down to a person’s honor and virtue. In some instances, even greed and fanfare drive these desires. No matter the reasoning, it takes great confidence and courage to take up the mantle, and sometimes finding those attributes is what makes a hero’s journey so interesting.

Escape rooms have become increasingly popular over the last decade, but not everyone has one in their area or the time/friends to complete one. Escape Academy brings the concept home as a co-op puzzler.
Revealed during today’s ID@Xbox showcase, the game comes from publisher iam8bit Presents and tasks players, either alone or with one other partner, to become the ultimate escape artist by unraveling a variety of puzzling locations under a time limit. The reveal trailer shows off locations such as a “mundane” office rapidly filling with gas to something as elaborate as an American Ninja Warrior-esque obstacle arena. Since you control a student attending an escape room-centric academy, you can explore the puzzle-laden campus and meet its colorful faculty members. Co-op is both local and online, with the trailer showing off split-screen gameplay.

With Arceus Legends and the surprise announcement of the late-2022 Scarlet/Violet versions, it’s easy to forget that Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl launched last Fall and are still going strong. The Sinnoh region remakes are teeming with content for its dedicated trainers, from special Easter eggs to other fun, miscellaneous gifts. Yesterday, a new Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl update followed suit, enabling trade with strangers. Moreover, two Mythical Pokémon can be encountered and caught for any players looking to fill out their ever-expanding Pokédex.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move befitting a game about immortal beings who live out countless repeating lives on artificial islands powered by human sacrifice, Paradise Killer is getting a re-release. Sort of. It's coming to next-gen consoles today, with all platforms (including PC) getting some extra bits added for free that weren't in the original 2020 release. Not bad for a game that Kaizen Game Works creative director Oli Clarke Smith thought would only really sell to "a niche of freaks". If you're not one of those freaks, I'd heartily recommend becoming one. Playing Paradise Killer is like going to a seaside cosplay party where police procedurals play on loop and cocktails are snorted in a dehydrated powder form. It is a meticulously authored murder mystery with a cast of freaks.
When I sat down to talk to both Clarke Smith and technical director Phil Crabtree about Paradise Killer's new update, it turns out that niche has already become quite large. Even Crabtree's dad has played Paradise Killer, though Crabtree isn't sure he really understood it. Crabtree also tells us he sometimes get messages from friends saying someone they know just played Paradise Killer and was talking about it. "It just seems so weird that that there is this audience there that we never expected, and it doesn't seem that far away," he says. "Like, it's not this mystery group of people, there always seems to be some connection that's quite close to you."

Many games pay their respects to the blonde lawn mower and his absentee princess, but few have such fondness and understanding of the exact feelings those adventures conjure up, the precise sensation of exploring, the nook-scavenging, and the meticulous internal mapping that happens when you play Zelda's brand of wundergame. Tunic might have sacrificed some of its own identity in hitting every Ocarina note so perfectly, but when the result is such a capable homage it's hard to complain.

Tunic brilliantly captures the feeling of that special childhood title that made you fall in love with video games. Using a virtual simulation of an old-school guidebook, the game masterfully balances telling players almost nothing with giving them all the information they need. The result is a game brimming with genuine, triumphant discovery.
With its every pixel stuffed with reverence for gaming as a medium, Tunic revels in its historically inspired design. Players steeped in the hobby’s traditions will find following their instincts richly rewarding as they quest…]]></summary>

Digimon Survive has been floating around the digital ether for a few years now, and while there’s still no release date in sight, a new teaser trailer introduces us to the cast. 
Though the video premiered earlier this month during Digmon Con, today’s trailer is an English version of it. Digimon Survive is a tactical RPG that stars Takuma Momozuka, a student who gets transported to the Digital World during a school camping trip. He befriends fan-favorite Digimon, Agumon, and sets out to save the world from danger. He’s not alone though. A party of fellow youngsters and their respective Digimon partners accompany Takuma and Agumon, who you can meet in the trailer below.

Digimon Survive’s battle system consists of turn-based strategy on grid-based playing fields. Outside of combat, you’ll engage in choice-driven gameplay that leads to multiple endings, and the storytelling unfolds through a blend of visual novel-style conversations and fully animated cutscenes. 
It’s good to see even small glimpses of Digimon Survive (which was originally slated to launch in 2019) and hopefully, we’ll finally get to play it sometime this year. You can find the game on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Bethesda released the second episode of its Into the Starfield series today. The developer diaries provide glimpses into the game’s development with discussions from the designers about what the game entails while sprinkling concept art and even some light game footage. 
You can catch the first episode of Into the Starfield here. This second installment sees game director Todd Howard sit down with design director Emil Pagliarulo, lead quest designer Will Shen, and lead artist Istvan Pely to discuss Starfield’s open-world design and how it gives players the freedom to carve their own path. Accomplishing that relies in part on how players can interact with the game’s factions as well as individuals, with the team chatting up Starfield’s more sophisticated persuasion system. Check out the full video below.

Bethesda has slowly rolled out information on Starfield over the last several months, but a gameplay trailer remains elusive. If you haven’t been keeping up, Bethesda has thus far divulged details of Starfield’s lore and backstory and shown off a few locations. All of that has been helpful, but we’re anxious to see how it all comes together in-game. 
Starfield launches November 11 for Xbox Series X/S and PC and launches day one on Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has revealed that it will not be holding its usual EA Play Live event this year, which is traditionally an event the company uses to reveal new games and share more info about existing games, typically held during the summer. 
This news comes by way of IGN, which reports that rather than hosting an EA Play Live event like in previous summers, the publisher will instead reveal more about its projects “when the time is right for each of them.” Here’s what an EA representative told IGN in a statement sent to the publication: 
EA Play Live events have basically become EA’s own E3-like showcase, with the publisher even opting to hold it usually around the same time as E3. It’s been doing EA Play Live since 2016. Before the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the event was a live in-person event where players could play things shown during the showcase and more. However, as a result of the pandemic, the event became a steaming one, akin to something like a Nintendo Direct or PlayStation State of Play. 
This news comes just a few months after word that E3 would not be held as in-person event this year dropped. However, Geoff Keighley’s own E3-like event, Summer Games Fest, is happening this year as usual. 
While waiting to see what EA shows throughout the year, check out the latest footage of its Dead Space remake. Read about how EA pledged total freedom to its studios with game development, including Dragon Age, Titanfall, and more last year after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who knows what the hell is happening with E3 this year. An official E3 reportedly will happen as an online-only event, but the vast scattering of unaffiliated not-E3 summer games events... ah, no idea. One thing is now clear: EA will not be holding their traditional 'EA Play Live' showcase to market their whole upcoming lineup, instead planning to talk about individual games across the year "when the time is right for each of them".

Elden Ring has been out for just 20 days and already, it’s sold a meteoric 12 million copies, making it the best-selling From Software Soulsborne game yet. 
Comparatively, Dark Souls 3 took a couple of months to sell 3 million copies and even years later, as of 2020, it has sold 10 million. That Elden Ring surpassed Dark Souls 3’s sales (as of 2020) in less than three weeks is quite the feat. This news comes by way of a new press release From Software released, praising the game for selling 1 million of those 12 million just inside of Japan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's nice when good things make big numbers, so it's nice to hear the boast that Elden Ring has sold 12 million copies. Considering the latest game from the makers of Dark Souls launched less than three weeks ago, it's an impressive big number indeed. They also mention plans for "more of Elden Ring as an IP [. . .] in hopes of expanding beyond the realm of games," which I guess could mean anything from a novelisation to hats. Yes, please do clothes. Make Fashion Souls real.

PlatinumGames first foray into making a live service is otherwise a mess, with repetitive missions, dull combat, confusing stats and loot, and more problems besides.

Publishers and co-developers Square Enix aren't giving up, however. They've launched a survey asking how they can deliver a "better game experience", but it's the graphics they're focused on.

Sources say these departures are partly responsible for Crystal Dynamics being drafted to work on the game late last year.

Over the past two decades, Rockstar Games has emerged as a force to be reckoned with in the games industry. Rising up from quirky Scotland-based developers with a taste for pulp and crime fiction, Rockstar evolved radically, shifting into innovators and provocateurs, creating some of the industry's most influential and blockbuster titles. In the lead up to the eagerly anticipated Red Dead Redemption 2, we came together as a staff to rank every single game that Rockstar developed (this means we excluded published titles like L.A. Noire and Smuggler's Run). From the humble top-down beginnings of Grand Theft Auto to the blood-soaked streets of Manhunt and the beautiful jaw-dropping vistas of Red Dead Redemption, you’ll find every single title put in its proper place in terms of influence, importance of innovation, and just plain fun.
With all that in mind, let’s steal a ride and roar down this road to hell. Read more...]]></summary>

Ghostwire: Tokyo launches in just over a week, and PlayStation 5 players will have a lot to consider in terms of getting the most out of the spooky experience. That’s because the game sports not one, not two, but six graphical and performance options.
We’re reviewing Ghostwire: Tokyo and have listed each mode along with their in-game explanation. However, the game only lays out what the two primary modes do, which are:  
Quality Mode: A high-fidelity rendering mode with ray tracing enabled. 30 FPS limit
Performance Mode: A high-framerate mode designed for the smoothest gameplay. 60 FPS limit.
Additionally, a category labeled HFR (High Framerate) is described as having "an uncapped framerate and tweaks to graphic quality that allow for an even higher-framerate experience." It contains four options without descriptions, but Video Games Chronicle expounded on these which we’ve shared below:
High Framerate Quality: Quality mode with an uncapped framerate between 30-50 FPS.
High Framerate Performance: Performance mode with uncapped framerate over 60 FPS.
High Framerate Quality (VSync): Same as High Framerate Quality but with Vsync enabled. 
High Framerate Performance (VSync): Same as High Framerate Performance but with Vsync enabled.
Games with multiple graphical/performance options have become the norm in recent years, but Ghostwire: Tokyo may take the cake, and figuring out which one is “best” will depend on several factors (such as your monitor) as well as personal preference. 
Ghostwire: Tokyo launches March 25 on PlayStation 5 and PC. You can watch us tour its haunted streets in this episode of New Gameplay Today.

GhostWire Tokyo, one of our most anticipated horror games of 2022, is incredibly stylish. Developer Tango Gameworks' open-world environments are as ambitious as they are unsettling, as twisting hallways and shifting rooms give way to dreadful encounters with Yōkai – wayward spirits inspired by Japanese folklore. In this episode of New Gameplay Today, I sit down with Blake Hester to share our preview impressions from the second chapter of GhostWire Tokyo. We're accompanied by footage from my hands-on gameplay session, which I captured via PS5 performance mode.

Halo: The Series is set to premiere on Paramount+ next week, on March 24, and to prepare viewers for the journey ahead, a new two-minute trailer has been released. 
The trailer features voice-over by multiple characters we’ll likely learn more about in the series, including what sounds like Dr. Halsey and others. It, of course, features plenty of the Covenant, including an Elite with a sword, and a handful of very-cool Master Chief moments.

As you can see in the trailer above, the narration that plays over it is all about the costs of protecting what’s sacred. As for what “sacred” is, it’s likely different for everyone involved. For Master Chief? It’s completing the mission, whatever it is. Like the trailers before this one, the series is looking great, and fortunately, we don’t have to wait long to watch it because it begins streaming on Paramount+ next week. 
In the meantime, watch the first teaser released for Halo: The Series and then read about how it’s already been renewed for a second season. You can also read about the decision to reveal Master Chief's face in the show.

The second batch of Xbox Game Pass games for March has been revealed. Weird West leads the pack as a very promising supernatural western twin-stick shooter from some of the minds behind the Dishonored series. Shedders is a radical snowboarding game you may remember from Xbox’s E3 presentation last summer. Crusader Kings III is bringing its medieval simulator wackiness to consoles for the first time as well. You can read our reviews for applicable titles to help decide whether or not a game is for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Platform:
        Switch, PC
				
Publisher:
      Capcom
			
Developer:
      Capcom
      
Release:
                      	March 26, 2021
			(Switch), 	January 12, 2022
			(PC)
            
In a presentation this morning, Capcom revealed plenty of new details on the upcoming Monster Hunter Rise expansion Sunbreak, including the announcement of its release date.
Sunbreak, an expansion Capcom has repeatedly described as being "massive," will release on June 30 for both Nintendo Switch and PC. The digital edition of the DLC will be available for preorder today, producer Ryozo Tsujimoto revealed. Along with the base edition of Sunbreak, existing Monster Hunter Rise players will have the option to purchase a deluxe edition, which comes with additional cosmetics like Layered Armod, hairstyles, poses, and gestures. Preordering will net hunters a pair of adorable Palamute and Palico Layered Armor that make the animal companions look closer to their real-world pet counterparts.
Those who are new to Monster Hunter Rise, but want the whole experience when Sunbreak releases can purchase the Monster Hunter Rise + Sunbreak Set which bundles the full base game and the expansion together into one tidy package.
Announced to be released alongside Sunbreak is a new trio of Monster Hunter Amiibos. The set of three includes new Elder Dragon Malzeno and a Palamute and Palico each donning armor based on Malzeno. Using these Amiibos with the Switch version will grant players new Formal Dragon Layered Armor to use in-game.
A patch will be coming for all Monster Hunter Rise players on June 30 regardless of Sunbreak ownership status. The update will require about 13GB of storage space and will accommodate for weapon balance changes and new content coming to the game with the release of Sunbreak. This patch will be required for online play moving forward.
If you're interested in trying out Monster Hunter Rise with Sunbreak looming on the horizon, Nintendo is offering a free trial for Switch Online subscribers this week.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re unfamiliar with Redout, it’s an anti-gravity racer inspired by the likes of F-Zero and Wipeout. And if you’ve not played any of those before, then imagine a pod-racer from Star Wars belting it down Mario Kart’s Rainbow Road - except, hang on, there’s a mysterious white powder caked on the bristles of Mario’s mustache. The sheer speed of the first game made it pretty popular among race-heads, but a bit of a daunting prospect for those used to a traditional “wheels on the ground” racing experience.
Redout 2 doubles down on the speed element, that's for sure. But there's definitely an added air of approachability to this anti-grav racer, making the transition from Geforce to g-force a little less bruising than before. AI presets, added customisation, and more generous modes help make this a racing game you should keep up with.

Despite spending the last two decades building mobile and browser games for the likes of Disney, Nickelodeon and Zynga, their heart has always resided with the PC. "There wasn't a lot of game development in Winnipeg, so we tried to figure it out ourselves and spent a few years trying to build a PC game," says creative director Noah Decter-Jackson. Fresh out of college, Complex's first project was a third-person hand-to-hand action prototype that they pitched to publishers at E3 2003, an endeavour that Decter-Jackson describes as "phenomenally unsuccessful".
This led to Complex remodelling as a work-for-hire outfit, and their long track-record making mobile games. But in 2015, Complex launched The Horus Heresy: Drop Assault, a fast-paced tactics game in conjunction with Games Workshop. In the wake of Drop Assault's success, the studio saw an opportunity. "We had been wanting for a long time to return to our PC roots," he says. "So we pitched a core idea for a game to Games Workshop, because Drop Assault had been quite successful... and that's essentially how Chaos Gate: Daemonhunters came to be."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First unveiled last week, Ship Of Fools is an upcoming seafaring roguelite where you and a fellow co-op pal take on hordes of horrible beasties as you sail the high seas. Depending on your choice of player two, it's also likely to be an apt description of how you'll feel playing it.
Having waded through an early preview build of its opening Forgotten Waters stage this week, this is one co-operative cannon fest that seems destined to see friends and family not so much walk the plank after an untimely defeat as get absolutely spanked by it. Imagine the visual chaos of a game like Overcooked combined with the frantic, tactile ship management of Lovers In A Dangerous Spacetime and you're pretty much there, albeit with several more barnacles, bug-spewing mosquitoes and laser-firing totem poles in the mix. The jangle of Davy Jones' locker is never far away in this storm-stricken archipelago, so beware, fools. You will not be suffered gladly.

Publisher:
      Square Enix
			
Developer:
      Platinum Games
      
Release:

Rating:

Babylon’s Fall, the latest from PlatinumGames and Square Enix, did not pan out well critically, with a 42% on Metacritic for PlayStation 5 versions and an even lower 37% on Metacritic for PC. 
It’s one of PlatinumGames’ worst-reviewed titles ever, but it seems Square Enix isn’t ready to give up on the live-service title just yet. That’s because the publisher has reportedly sent out surveys to players asking them how the game can be improved, as reported by Eurogamer. More specifically, the survey recently sent out is all about the graphics and visuals of Babylon’s Fall, and finding a way to “bring everyone an even better game experience.” 
Eurogamer reports that the survey asks players about their thoughts on the visuals of characters, equipment, NPCs, enemies, locales, battle effects, the UI, and the overall oil painting “brushwork” art style of Babylon’s Fall. The survey concludes by asking survey-takers what specific element of Babylon’s Fall’s visuals would need to be changed before they’d consider recommending the game to someone else. 
However, as anyone who’s played Babylon’s Fall or has read reviews for it know, there are multiple problems beyond the visual elements that make it hard to recommend. Perhaps Square Enix will canvass players about all of the elements viewed more negatively in the game and then fix each one so that with all of the fixes together, people might be able to recommend the game to someone. That remains to be seen, of course. 
If you’re curious about checking the game out yourself, you can do so thanks to a free PlayStation demo for Babylon’s Fall that’s available right now. For more info about the game, check out Game Informer’s Babylon’s Fall hub.

I'm not very good at it, to be honest, so recently knocked it down to easy difficulty in order to stomp on robot heads with greater efficiency. Good ol' Aloy.

The Rune Factory series, a spin-off of Story of Seasons, combines action/RPG combat with its sibling’s farming and social elements. Now, almost a decade after Rune Factory 4’s debut on 3DS, a new Rune Factory game is just around the corner as a Switch exclusive on March 22. We chatted with director Shiro Maekawa to give you an idea of what you can expect, from the fun festivals to powering up Link Attacks with other town members.  
It’s been a long road to Rune Factory 5. Many fans were worried about the series’ future, especially with Neverland closing. Can you discuss the journey to get this long-awaited entry off the ground?

As the world watches this historical and terrifying event unfold, efforts have begun to aid civilians and organizations on the ground floor and those displaced, like the Ukrainian Red Cross. Many of these efforts have come from studios within the video game industry, some in the form of charity drives, others with public displays of support for Ukraine.

Forspoken, the upcoming title from Luminous Productions and this month’s cover story, largely takes place in the magical world of Athia. Unfortunately, the realm has seen better days, as a creeping corruption has flooded the once-prosperous land. The Break, as the destructive fog is known in the game, has the power to corrupt anything it touches. Humans become hostile and mindless, animals morph into monsters, and even the land itself takes on a bizarre appearance.
While there have been several trailers for Forspoken, much of them take place in a dry, desert-looking region. This land is just outside Cipal, the last d…]]></summary>

Here’s a roundup of all the studios that won, and their winning title, in each category:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you can’t get enough of everyone’s favorite blue blur, or Tails and Knuckles, as they’re depicted in Paramount Pictures’ movies, then we have some good news for you: there’s a “pre-quill” comic book for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 coming out later this month. 
As reported by Sonic Stadium, this prequel comic will lead into Sonic the Hedgehog 2 before it hits theaters on April 8 and part of it will be helmed by the movie’s own Dr. Robotnik, Jim Carrey. That’s because the comic book isn’t one big story but rather, five stories about different characters from the movie spread across 40 pages. One of these five stories will be centered on Dr. Robotnik and according to Sonic Stadium, Carrey is “spearheading” it. 
However, it’s important to note that Carrey does not have a writer’s credit in the comic solicitation so it’s likely that he simply helped out with the narrative, or shared ideas with the comic’s writer, Keil Phegley. 
“Catch up with Sonic and friends, if you can, in this exclusive prequel to 2022’s most anticipated family film,” the comic book’s solicitation reads, according to Sonic Stadium. “Life is good in Green Hills for Sonic the Hedgehog…maybe too good. He’s starting to get bored, and when Sonic gets bored, things become a lot less boring for everyone else – fast. Quicker than you can say, ‘Chili Dog,’ the Fastest Thing Alive is saving the day and causing all sorts of chaos along the way. Plus, new and returning characters starring in the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 film take the lead in stories of their own.” 
For more about Sonic, check out this awesome poster for the movie, and then watch the final trailer for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 released today. Read about Sonic Frontiers, which drops the blue blur into his first open-world game, after that.

System Shock 3 has quite the troubled development history, chronicled in Part 3 of Game Informer’s Games Stuck In Development Hell feature, and it seems the game has been pushed even deeper into development hell. 
In a new interview with VentureBeat, Deux Ex creator Warren Spector gave what sounds like will be his final comments in regards to System Shock 3, especially now that his studio, OtherSide Entertainment, is working on a new IP. When asked if OtherSide Entertainment’s work on the threequel had come to an end, Spector said there’s not much more clarification he can give at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a YouTube channel I’m fond of called Virtual Japan, where a 4K camera serenely glides through gorgeous Japanese hotspots: Sapporo in the snow, Christmas lights in Tokyo, residential back streets in the pouring rain. You hear nothing but ambient city sounds and the tromping of a cameraman's feet. You could be watching a HUD-free FPS, albeit with incredi-graphics. Finally, in Ghostwire: Tokyo, someone has made a game of it, albeit with occasional ghost zapping.

Hogwarts Legacy, the mysterious and long-awaited RPG set in the Harry Potter universe, will finally get its first gameplay showing in a new State of Play airing this week. 
PlayStation tweeted the news this morning stating that the presentation airs Thursday, March 17 at 2 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern. There’s no word on how long it will be, but the tweet refers to it as an “extended look,” so that hopefully means we’re in for a deep dive on everything Hogwarts Legacy entails.

March 14, 2022
Hogwarts Legacy was first announced during the PlayStation 5 showcase in 2020. The open-world action RPG casts you in the role of a Hogwarts student and is being developed by Avalanche Software. Author J.K. Rowling has not been directly involved in the game’s development, which had been a concern to some fans in the wake of her controversial statements regarding the transgender community in recent years. Hogwarts Legacy was initially scheduled to launch in 2021, but in January of that year, it was delayed to 2022. 
Although Hogwarts Legacy has mainly been shown on PlayStation stages and is coming to PS5 and PS4, it’s also launching on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

In listing out the status of their own games, Microsoft say that Psyconauts 2 is "Verified" - meaning it's fully supported - while Sea Of Thieves is merely "playable" and Halo Infinite isn't supported at all due to its anti-cheat.

Hopefully those games will be better supported in future, but, Microsoft say, "It's up to our studios how they fit Steam Deck integration for their games into their busy schedules."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Made public this week was the Spectre-BHB / BHI vulnerability and while only Intel and Arm processors are currently believed to be impacted, in the course of that research the folks at VUSec discovered AMD's current Retpoline strategy for Spectre V2 mitigations is not adequate. This has led to a change in behavior for AMD processors and is already applied to the Linux kernel. Here is a look at what it means for desktop and server performance due to the change in return trampoline handling.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can't remember if I've mentioned this to you, dear readers, but I am currently mid-emigration. In about two weeks I'm moving to Ireland, which means for the past four months my live has been hellish. The paperwork the move involves, especially now we have from our European womb been untimely ripped, is a Kafkaesque nightmare. To ship my stuff without incurring importation tax I need to prove I'm going to live in Ireland and not just sell a bunch of second hand cutlery and old bras (one of those two things would probably be pretty lucrative, in fairness). This is all complicated even furtherer by the fact that I only found a flat to move to yesterday, and still don't have the tenancy agreement for it, which means no proof of address. Life, oh life.
I don't really have the option to have a piece of toast and watch the evening news, because when I'm not scanning my passport or estimating what worth to attach to my towels for the purposes of the shipping company's insurance, I am packing said towels into boxes, along with everything else I own. Basically the only free time I have is my lunch break. And what I am doing in my lunch break is making huge, virtual jigsaw puzzles in Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams. It's either that or go and sit in the toilets and have a little stress-cry. And as the move date approaches, the size of the puzzles has increased. On Thursday I started one that is 6k pieces. This may have been a miscalculation.

It launched in May 2021 in a sorry state and, while developers Frontier have been fixing it up, it's still a mess now. This week Frontier announced that to help focus their efforts on fixing Odyssey, they're cancelling the yet-unreleased console version. Good news for us on PC, I suppose, but oof! "This was not an easy decision to make, but it was made with the long-term future of Elite Dangerous in mind," Frontier frontman David Braben said.

I'm glad I did. Aztech No Colon Forgotten Gods starts with its weaker foot, showing rough edges right away, but that’s overshadowed by its entertaining movement system. During its opening, a quest prompt tells you to go home to sleep, as though they didn't just give you a magical power arm that's also a goddamn rocket.
My home was a short walk away. I didn't get there for 40 minutes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve have gathered up some crucial Windows drivers for the Steam Deck, improving performance for those who want to ditch the default SteamOS and replace it with Windows 10. GPU, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers are all available from Steam Support, so early Deck adopters looking for a change can get the requisite downloads all in one place.


These drivers come with caveats, mind. Audio drivers are still a work in progress, so only USB-C, 3.5mm, or Bluetooth headphones can output sound on Windows, and Valve’s post explains that dual-booting support still isn’t ready yet. Installing Windows, then, is an all-or-nothing switch that involves wiping SteamOS entirely.

Their 'updated' version was worse than the 1995 original, with blurry sprites, ugly menus, an incongruous font, and other problems. But they fixed it up a lot with patches, and now, almost four years since the last patch, they've applied a fresh coat of polish with another welcome update.

Shadows Of Forbidden Gods is different. It's all about building the power of your evil god under the radar until it's too late for anyone to defeat you. The more I've played it, the more I start to suspect that this concept will always suffer from being gamed by player who'll seek the most efficient paths. Any system of influencing and manipulating characters will necessarily be abstracted, and at some point subtlety becomes just another numerical value.


I suppose what I'm saying is that SOFG is more fun if you revel in scheming and causing chaos, and given the choice between effective and interesting, will always do the right thing.

This has now changed with the news that the creature wearing the skin of Atari has bought MobyGames, the extremely good video games database. No, creature, please don't touch things I use and care about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This episode of the Electronic Wireless Show podcast is all about our favourite mounts in video games - as in, animals that carry you around in games. Not cars. Machines don't count as mounts, I think we can all pre-agree on that. We discuss a lot of different horses, and some things that are not horses, from a bunch of different games. This is an unfortunate crossover with our 'best horses' special, which I forgot we had done. Also, Nate and I get angry at Metal Gear Solid.
There are some traditional digressions, although there's no substantial Henry Cavill update this week. We spend some time discussing which dinosaur we would most like to ride as a mount, and whether we would rather fight one The Rock sized spider, or 30 spider sized The Rocks. This week's Cavern of Lies is WoW-themed, and if you'd like to listen along to Latvia's Eurovision entry this year then here's the link. Be warned that it is NSFW.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Social media sucks doesn't it? You sign up for a feed of dross that never stops, like you've paid for a rotten Fruit Winder that simply won't stop unwinding. Others who've bought into the same Fruit Winder exchange thoughts on its sour taste, until yet more, who quite like the flavour, come to its defense in droves. A war of words ensues over whether the Fruit Winder tastes nice. And it's not even a Fruit Winder, it's an app called Facebook, or Twitter, or Instagram, for goodness sakes.
Admittedly, there is something gratifying about popping off on social media. Even just getting a few likes for a dumb joke can make you feel alive. So, I say you swap Twitter for Elden Ring, a superior social media platform: You leave players helpful messages or total dross, it gets appraised, you feel great. Invading other worlds is a more interactive way of making friends and/or enemies too – it's perfect.

After a swim I'd stare longingly at the snacks I couldn't afford then stand on tip-toes before the game I couldn't afford to play, waggling a joystick and mashing buttons to pretend I was controlling the attract mode demo. Appealing to this sort of nostalgia, Konami have announced they're releasing a collection of 13 vintage Ninja Turtles games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article contains spoilers for Lost Ark's main questline.


Lost Ark is a very silly game, but not in the way it initially seems. For its first 15 hours or so, Smilegate's ARPG is like someone described Lord of the Rings to the developers through a door, an overblown yet generic riff on Western fantasy tropes with overdesigned yet underwritten characters, all of whom talk about the game's plainly ridiculous lore with the gravity of a neutron star. The game's ignorance of its own absurdity is funny, but the story itself is not much fun.


This begins to change once you approach level 50. After completing the continent of East Luterra, Lost Ark suddenly explodes in scale. It gives you a ship, and sets you off on a massive globetrotting adventure, with around a dozen other continents to explore, and dozens more tiny islands, each with their own little questlines. Your first destination across Lost Ark's ocean is an island called Tortoyk (pronounced like "Tortoise", but with a K), and it's here where the game stops pretending to be a serious high-fantasy adventure, revealing itself to be something much more entertaining.

With the right tools, then, you can plug into a monitor, add a mouse and keyboard, and get playing as if it were a (somewhat) conventional gaming rig. But how well does the Steam Deck work as a desktop PC, really? Valve’s use of the Linux-based SteamOS alone makes it less of a 1:1 equivalent to a Windows system, and its AMD APU was designed to handle the onboard display’s 1280x800 resolution – not 1080p and above.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Valhalla enters its endgame phase with its final DLC Dawn Of Ragnarök, the very concept for which is kind of a big honking spoiler, so consider yourself forewarned.
The series as a whole is still electing to carry on with that subplot about super-advanced precursor god-people, like a chill friend who you ask to party knowing that they will, univited, bring along their mate who is really into a specific genre of sci-fi and will not stop derailing conversations to talk about it. In Valhalla this manifests as protagonist Eivor, Viking raider and big blonde buff meat sculpture, being the reincarnation of Odin, one of the aforementioned god-people. Dawn Of Ragnarök is Eivor dreaming that they are Odin for about 35 hours of adventuring and son-saving in the magical realm of Svartalfheim. That's a pretty intense nap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heardle maintains many of the hallmarks of Wordle: it offers just one test a day; it's the same for everyone; and you've got six guesses to get it right. The twist is that you're trying to identify a song, with each guess revealing an extra few seconds from the opening bars. It's got me in its (melodic) hooks - and you can play it in your browser now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not sure how I feel about the term "boomer shooter". Given that it refers to new first-person shooters which evoke games from the '90s, shouldn't they be millenial shooters? Fresh from killing napkins and mayonnaise, here come millenials to kill Shub-Niggurath.

This is clearly me fighting a losing semantic battle, but in any case, Humble's Boomer Shooters Bundle has a lot of great games, including Dusk, Amid Evil, Ion Fury, HROT, and more for £9.05/$12.

As your flying metropolis expands, you have to apply propulsion machines - fabric wings, gigantic oars, pedal-powered rotors - to make sure it doesn't tip dangerously this way or that. 

It's delightful, and after a year on Epic's game store, the Epic Games Store, it's available on Steam.

These colourful JRPGs have been hiding some of the deepest and most satisfying levelling systems in all of gaming behind the world's most obnoxious anime characters for years now.

The next brutal gauntlet is Disgaea 6 Complete, with a newly announced released date of June 28th. There's also a new character trailer below, which sets out its stall. Can you survive it?

Not to mention their little pressure plates - god they're satisfying aren't they?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Built by two longtime RTS fans, The Fertile Crescent rekindles the age-old torch of elaborate strategy titles. Its combat and economy chains build on each other, a feat uncommon in the real-time strategy space. Despite taking cues from beloved franchises like WarCraft and Age of Empires, TFC carves out a niche with an unlikely ally: pomegranates. The Fertile Crescent trades the ol’ berry bush for pomegranate trees, a native of Western Asia.


Developers Anders Groenningsaeter and André Read from Wield Interactive looked to the past as they refined The Fertile Crescent’s economy. “Since childhood, André and I have been equally fascinated by RTS games and the Bronze Ages,” Groenningsaeter explained to me. “How we’ve been inspired by history has shaped the game. During the Bronze Ages, the usage of coins hadn’t taken root yet. It was still to a large extent a barter economy, and food played an important role.”

It was a Lands Between where "try jumping" wasn't some evil trickery, and "illusory wall ahead" meant discovering a hidden passage.
Since the game's release, the player messages have taken on a different complexion. Before, I trusted in our small community trying its best to get by. Now I must treat every message with caution as they fight amongst themselves. The world is awash with trolls and their terrible craic, but I'm not sure I'd have it any other way.

Australia's classification board last week gave RimWorld a rating of RC—Refused Classification. As a result, the game is no longer available to buy on Steam in Australia, though folks who already own it can still play.
