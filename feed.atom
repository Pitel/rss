With roughly one day left in the planet's defense campaign, all players now have access to the MLS-4X Commando Rocket Launcher, and it's glorious. 


The advanced weapons lab on X-45 held some incredibly powerful technology. A rocket launcher that's capable of firing four projectiles at once, annihilating anything in a Helldiver's path, and it's absolutely free for a limited time. Players in Helldivers 2 have, quite rightfully, lost their minds a little over this new development because it finally gives them a way to fight back against the game's most brutal enemy faction with an insurmountable weapon.

You might wonder why Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess has an Okami collaboration, and it's because this latest title is, in many ways, a spiritual successor. As a result, Capcom has created two stunning costumes and weapons for players to unlock and use in the latest title, but the entire community must work together to unlock them first. Otherwise, these items won't be available for anyone to use and will just be a distant What-If at launch.

The firmware update includes games like Stardew Valley, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, Celeste, and Grand Theft Auto 3.

This novel from Rachel Gillig marks the first in the new The Shepherd King series.

I’ve read many fantasy books and watched a lot of fantasy shows that feature magical schools. From this experience, I’ve learned to judge a magic school by how well it incorporates its world’s magic system into its curriculum. There’s a magical school for every flavor of fantasy buff, but here are the ten that, in my opinion, stand above the rest.

There's sci-fi fantasy, grimdark sci-fi, sci-fi romance, and even specific books similar to The Expanse. If you're out for an adrenaline-filled time, though, you need military sci-fi. 


Military sci-fi books look at futuristic wars. They don't have to be incredibly advanced. Even just a traditional war set in space can squeeze into this genre. But that makes it pretty bloated because any sci-fi book with a fight scene involving military technology could technically be placed here. However, you don't want to have to read every book in this sub-genre just to find the good ones, which is why I've put together this list of my picks of the best.

For centuries, writers constrained themselves to literary drama and kept clear of mythology but for a few allusions here and there. And then came Professor Tolkien, a linguist with a knack for names and an even greater gift for the imaginative, who, in his toil, started a movement that reconciled literary fiction with mythological storytelling and set the foundations for much of what we today refer to as speculative fiction.


Over the decades since the release of The Lord of the Rings, many writers have picked up the gauntlet and put their own spins on this ever-evolving genre. Picking 10 out of dozens and dozens of these brilliant words…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Naruto franchise has made a name for itself across the globe. It's one of the biggest anime titles in the industry, and it comes as no surprise that it has received numerous adaptations across different media — from light novels to video games. Justifiably so. After all, we're talking about ninjas here.


Among its numerous spinoffs, a number of them come in the form of manga. If you're wondering what those spinoffs are, read on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It seems like a no-brainer to me to turn many of the really good sci-fi books into video games, not just your regular old RPGs. There is so much scope for multiple genres pulled from the pages of some of the best-loved science fiction books, with the right direction.


Science fiction books that should be video games


One or two of these may have already inspired video games, either obscurely or directly. However, they usually go in the wrong direction. There really aren't many science fiction novel adaptations to games out there. Not successful ones, anyway.

On top of its "new" seasonal format being nonsensically time-gated - again - there are some other concerns, too, like the new Vanguard Ops playlist.


Not the playlist itself, mind: Vanguard Ops has generally succeeded in what it was trying to do! It's a comprehensive one-stop-shop for anyone eager to just play a few PvE missions in Destiny 2. You open it up, kickstart the matchmaking, check up on your current Pathfinder, and start gunning down the enemies of humanity. Y'know, the good stuff. No, this is all well and good; precisely what we needed and a logical evolution of the previous Destiny 2 Strike playlist(s).

The genre works well in pretty much any setting, and that appears to be exactly what Folder Dungeon is trying to prove. 


As you might guess from the name, Folder Dungeon is a roguelike dungeon crawler in which you battle through a computer's operating system. You've got to slash or backslash your way through enemies, grab powerful upgrades to help you hit more of them harder, and get to the exit folded before your time is up and the computer overheats and shuts down.

Many of us have come to resent certain tropes — even if they're well done — from the sheer amount of exposure to them. Here are some of the worst offenders that are found everywhere.


Do note that tropes are tools, so if you're creating a fantasy story, don't shy away from these tropes. Just make sure to do them well, else you'll likely receive a lot of sighs from your work.


The death subversion trope


Something I personally find that cheapens any fantasy work is the subversion of death. A cherished character killed? No matter! They'll just be brought back to life!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we look back over authors telling of the future, the importance of serialisation and the novella must be noted in science fiction. The short-form medium of some of the earliest works of sci-fi helped give the genre the legs it needed to stand on to become the shelf-filling genre it is today.


Humble beginnings


Of course, going back to the earliest days of science fiction, we have complete novels such as Frankenstein. However, when looking at later authors, we see the emergence of science fiction as periodicals and novellas. Both Jules Verne and H.G. Wells released a number of their works as either bite-sized weekly installments or short, quick-to-read novellas.

The game's gacha mechanic revolves around earning Master Tapes to pull for them from banners, but the odds are never really in your favor. Once you have them, you can promote them, but it's not a simple process. 


Every Agent you unlock in Zenless Zone Zero has levels. As you might expect with any game with RPG elements like this, leveling up those Agents strengthens them and improves their combat skills. Eventually, you'll need to promote them as part of an in-game objective, for a trophy on PS5, and because you won't get very far unless you push them to be better. Doing so is a complicated process, though, mainly because of the nature of the resources required.

For completing the 66 FATEs needed to complete Rank 3 in Shaaloani, you’ll be rewarded with the opportunity to swap your Bicolor Gems for Turali Barding, among other things. 


How to shared FATEs work in Dawntrail?


Screenshot by Destructoid


If you’re expecting to do 88 FATEs in each area, mainly because you’re scarred from the grind in both Shadowbringers and Endwalker, then you’re in luck. The total number of FATEs in each area has been reduced by 20, and completing Rank 3 only takes a total of 66 FATEs now. I know this doesn’t seem like a lot, but trust me, it helps. 


Here’s how many FATEs you’ll need to complete to complete each Shared FATEs Rank:



Rank 1 (6 FATEs)


Rank 2 (20 FATEs)


Rank 3 (40 FATEs)



Completing each Rank will unlock further items at the local Bicolor Gemstone vendor, and Gemstones are earned through completing FATEs - you’ll receive a minimum of 16 for each successfully completed FATE, though this number goes up depending on bonuses or appearances by the Forlorn or Forlorn Maiden. 


Where is the Gemstone Trader in Shaaloani?

The local Gemstone Trader for Shaaloani can be found closest to the Hnusatahwi Aetheryte. You’ll find all of the Gemstone goodies for sale from Mitepe (X:28.6, Y:30.8). 


Here are all of the items you can eventually purchase from her, along with how much they cost and which Rank you’ll need to complete:

While I'm sure this was meant a bit of a joke, players have ended up taking these sci-fi phishing efforts quite seriously.

With this latest tactic, the Automatons are attempting to breach Super Each security systems and, presumably, figure out where we're being deployed next so they can flank us and take more galactic territory. The messages we've been given as examples are fun and mock the basic phishing scams of the early internet, but the thing is, they're actually working in a weird way.

To thank every player who's downloaded Zenless Zone Zero since it was released, miHoYo is offering each and every one of us 1,600 Polychrome. However, it's not a reward you can get for just downloading the game and launching it once.

The working week is over and it's time to settle in for the weekend. Welcome back to another edition of What Are You Playing!
What's been going on in the world of Nintendo recently, then? Well, we got a boatload of NSO drops as Nintendo served up a whopping seven additions to the NES library including Donkey Kong Jr. Math, Urban Champion, Golf and more. We also ran down all of the discounted delights in North America's 'Recollection Collection' eShop sale, checked out more Nintendo lawsuits and shared our games of the year so far (because somehow we're already halfway through 2024).

During Nintendo's '84th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders', company president Shuntaro Furukawa was asked about how Nintendo deals with "cases on social media where Nintendo IP and games are used inappropriately" when the "behavior poses the risk of damaging the value" of its brand.
While Furukawa didn't want to comment on any "individual cases", he did mention how "appropriate action must be taken against any behaviour that undermines" the Japanese company's policy to "bring smiles through entertainment". It will also "continue to make every effort to ensure" that its "consumers are not made to feel uncomfortable" when coming into contact with Nintendo's IP "not only" in its games but also "anywhere" else "they come into contact" with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After more than a decade of litigation in Germany, last year key questions in Sony's lawsuit against cheat device maker Datel were referred to Europe's highest court. If the Court of Justice's judgment ultimately favors Sony, the implications are likely to reach far beyond a device designed to interact with a game console discontinued a decade ago. For the greater good, it's a case that Sony must lose and for once in a copyright lawsuit, things are headed in the right direction.

Despite its story and extra 10 levels spanning dozens of hours of playtime, that’s apparently been ample time for players to complain loudly enough about one of the expansion’s brand new jobs - so much so that Square Enix have already announced a set of incoming changes planned across the game’s next run of patches.

It’s a “fast-paced, juggle-based” 2D metroidvania that stands apart for a couple of reasons. Firstly, your character’s magic sword is also your means of illumination, and the levels are gloomy. And secondly, the whole “juggle-based” thing.

Much to our shame, it took approximately 30 seconds of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom reveal trailer for us to start thinking about the dreaded timeline.
In the weeks since, we'd wager that a similar thought has appeared in the minds of most Zelda fans out there. Whether that was a happy thought or an "Oh god, here we go again" will depend on how deep you are in the trenches of Hylian chronology. For some of us at Nintendo Life (eg. this writer — hello!) it landed firmly in the former camp and so, after an intense period of digesting, research, and trailer breakdowns, we think we're just about ready to get into things.

A house on which garden gnomes have either settled, like the avian hoodlums in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, or from which they have erupted, like the malignant mushrooms of Annihilation.
A hundred clay and plaster eyes catch yours, unblinking; a hundred figures seemingly freeze in the act of pushing a toy wheelbarrow or smoking a pipe. The tune you were whistling dies in your throat as you hurry past into the reassuring shadow of the relatively gnomeless bungalows to either side. Gardening sim Horticular is like that, but with an even greater sense of contrast, because it asks you to resettle a desolate planet. There is no generic urban scenery to hurry onto, here.

During Masahiro Sakurai's most recent YouTube video, the legendary creator delves into the requirement for online updates and patches in modern video games.
It might seem fairly obvious, as consumers, as to how patches can be beneficial, and Sakurai himself states that he is "very grateful" for them. However, the way in which he breaks it down may still provide an opportunity to further appreciate the additional work that developers put into their games.

Saying goodbye to an old console can be a difficult thing. One day, the device that brought you so much joy reaches a state beyond repair and you have to let it go. Or you could turn it into a cereal bowl. That's another perfectly good solution.
Before you start wondering, no, we didn't come up with this idea ourselves. It was brought to our attention by visual artist Evan Rolston on Instagram, who is still putting his old, broken GameCube to use every morning — just don't expect it to run Luigi's Mansion any time soon.

2024 has been a challenging year for the video game industry and it seems Japanese developer Tose (a team that's worked on countless Nintendo projects since the Famicom era and also helped out Square Enix over the years) has experienced some financial losses due to multiple projects being cancelled.
The co-development studio, which has been involved with the Switch versions of Paper Mario and Crisis Core, reported a nine-month loss of ¥367 million (about $2.28 million) in its Q3 earnings report (from 1st September 2023 until 31st May 2024) due to clients cancelling projects because of "policy changes" and "other factors".

It’s the dogeared Fighting Fantasy from a carboot sale kid in me, I think. Something about reading worldbuilding snippets organised into numbered tables just hits in a way a novel doesn’t. Such tantalising ephemera is the name of the game in Microprose-published CrossOver: Roll For Initiative.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom spat a little squirt of news bile on us yesterday, like a hideous zombie vomiting up demos and release dates. One of the smaller chunks was a brief comment by Resident Evil 7 director Koshi Nakanishi, who confirmed that a new Resident Evil game is in the works. That's not too much of a surprise - big franchise gonna franchise - but still, it's nice to hear.  "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7," he said, "but I found it. And to be honest it feels substantial."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fear & Hunger games are pitch-black horror RPGs quite unlike anything else I’ve ever played, taking aspects of JRPG, survival horror and adventure games and distilling them into something I’d be tempted to call bleakly nihilistic if they didn’t display so much evident love for their craft. They also both start with a content warning listing “extreme violence, gore, sexual violence, and drug usage”. You’ll want to take this seriously, and just to be clear: the third item on this list does manifest in some tasteless, albeit brief, ways in the first game. It’s a frustrating blemish on what is otherwise an incredibly evocative and creative series, though you can download a mod to censor the more egregious bits. You will miss the full effect of critically severing an ogre’s massive schlong, however.

That's because he played Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess, the upcoming action strategy game about defending a maiden from colourful monsters and recruiting villagers to cleanse demonic defilement. Developer Capcom released a demo for the game yesterday, ahead of its July 19th release date. So now the rest of us can join Edwin in becoming entranced by the swirling colours of this sword-swinger.

The Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, presumably named so to differentiate it from the 2016 HD Remaster, now looks to be shambling ever closer to full remake territory if the new footage Capcom shared as part of yesterday’s NEXT showcase is anything to go by. Also, it’s coming to Steam! I’ve checked with the rest of the treehouse, and this means it’s also confirmed for PC. Get in!

      <p>Capcom Next was a more succint affair this summer. It focused on providing updates for only three titles: Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, and the iOS/Mac port of Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. Here's a brief summary of each announcement, which includes the smallest of teases for the next Resident Evil title. </p>

<p>With just four days in Seoul, South Korea, I filled my maps app with pins of restaurants, Buddhist temples, must-see attractions, scenic parks, market streets, and more to visit. I clocked around 10 miles of walking daily and think I saw as much of this massive city as possible with my allotted time. My journey from east to west, north to south of Seoul was only possible by the city’s expansive public transportation network of buses and trains.

"Don't turn off your system when this symbol is displayed," goes the message seen often while booting up a game (or some other version of these words). The implication is clear. The saving process is delicate and if you interrupt this invisible ritual the data that's being written to some folder deep in your PC's innards will become corrupted, wrecked, banjaxed. You will lose all your progress, all your precious swords and accomplishments.
But is this true? How likely are you to really suffer a catastrophic loss of shotgun shells? To find out, I decided to spend a very annoying afternoon of turning my gaming rig off and on again during multiple games. Was this a good idea? I don't know. I'm a gamer, not an ideas man.

The first lawsuit accuses Modded Hardware of violating the DMCA by selling mod-chips and MIG devices, as well as shipping modded consoles with pirated games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The developers of speedy first-person shooter Selaco have dropped a big patch for the retro blaster, adding new weapon upgrades and mutators that can change the game's difficulty in piecemeal ways, like making enemies stronger for an added challenge. There's a heap of other fixes and changes but among them lies the admission that something has been missing. "We fully understand people want a dedicated kick button for all weapons," the developers say. But wait, isn't there a slide kick in the game already?

Some say it's a "boss rush" with a world that lets it down. Having spent 90 minutes with it myself, I'd like to add my ferocious take to the pile: you play monke = is good. But no seriously, I think no matter if it's a bit Soulsy or not, my key takeaway is one of relief. There's a lot more substance to back up the style than I thought there would be, alongside it feeling a lot more compact than the behemoth I envisioned in my head. All good signs for the complete package, which strikes me as living up to the crushing pressure of its number one Steam Wishlist spot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's said that every time Deus Ex is mentioned, someone reinstalls it. If that's true and you read RPS, it's possible you've reinstalled Deus Ex around six hundred times by now. 

That's where the comprehensive Randomizer mod comes in, which remixes the immersive sim's levels to make the experience fresh every time. It's also just received a major update which, among several other additions, lets you pet the game's dogs and cats.

Still, talk to one of those players and you'll find all is not well with Valve's shooter, which is apparently regularly overrun by bots and cheaters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mika and The Witch's Mountain appears to be an unofficial video game adaptation of Kiki's Delivery Service, which is a Studio Ghibli film about a witch who decides to go postal, but not in the Running with Scissors sense. Created by developers Chibig and Nukefist, it's a "mini open world" game about carrying packages by broomstick while investigating the titular mountain, flying through hoops a la Pilotwings, and savouring the balmy inconsequentiality of an island that reminds me of Super Mario Sunshine. It also now has an early access release date, 21st August, and a charming new trailer.

If memory serves, when they ran that particular trailer I was busy sponging swampwater out my eyes after writing up South Of Midnight, while Nic had become so vociferously agitated over the debut of Doom: Dark Ages that he was no longer solid and tangible enough to operate a keyboard. Graham had long since absconded with Joanna Dark to Immersive Sim Land and Matt, poor Matt, had fallen into a Locust sinkhole while "omnimanouevring" around Black Ops 6. But if one of us had been free and willing we might have had enthusiastic thoughts about this "evolution of JRPGs", in which you must thwart a self-serious artist who is about to magically murder everybody over the age of 32. It is, alas, too late for me.

Two hours being the length of the free Dragon's Dogma 2 trial that is now live on Steam. For context, this is approximately how much time Capcom gave me to preview their latest action-RPG, many headline cycles ago. During that brief window, I managed to become the worst wizard in Dragon's Dogma 2, but I know you can go further. I'm so confident of this, in fact, that I'm going to start feeling all insecure and hurt in anticipation. How could you trample on my feelings so?

In the latest episode, they're discussing their (relatively new) Boston studio and how it's spearheading the as-yet-enigmatic sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. There's a lot of middle-managey chit chat but one thing that stood out was one developer's earnest remarks about what he considers some of the sci-fi RPG's shortcomings. 
"I see that we didn't push the envelope far enough in some places, for instance," said Paweł Sasko, Associate Game Director at CD Project RED.  "Like, let's say the homeless crisis... when I look at it, I'm like, we weren't far enough in '77. We thought that we were dystopian, but... we just touched the surface."

There’s no rush, of course. It runs until the 11th of July. Still, to help you navigate the meatily chummed waters of Sales Lagoon, Horace has decided to reward our combined years of service with a crisp ten bob note each to spend on games. We’ve been bringing up the whole “getting paid” thing for ages, so this is a real win for us. Here’s how we’re all spending that tenner in the sale.

It's interesting then, that FromSoftware's president Hidetaka Miyazaki sees Elden Ring as "the limit" for FromSoftware in terms of project scale (cheers The Guardian for the interview, and PCGamer for the spot).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kim Dotcom's latest bid to prevent the New Zealand government from handing over his hard drives and passwords to the FBI has failed. In 2022, the High Court said the devices could be sent to the United States to assist in Dotcom's criminal prosecution there. Following Dotcom's inevitable appeal, the Court of Appeal has now dismissed the proceedings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed fans “can be excited about some remakes” of the older games in the open world series, permits generous soul Yves Guillemot, via one of those odd promotional things disguised as a conversation.

And last week, we traveled to California to go hands-on with the game. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/26/concord-feels-like-destiny-meets-overwatch">You can read&nbsp;<em>Game Informer's</em>&nbsp;full Concord preview thoughts here</a>, but in short: it feels great and we're excited to play more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have a lot of questions remaining about the game's progression, seasonal content, narrative emphasis, and more, but if the handful of hours we've played of Concord are any indication, developer Firewalk Studios has, at the very least, created a fun and great-feeling shooter. In today's New Gameplay Today, host Wesley LeBlanc talks about his visit to PlayStation's HQ to play the game with Kyle Hilliard and how he felt after checking out 10 of the game's 16 heroes and three of its gameplay modes.&nbsp;</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Besides giving The First Descendant the ol’ benchy marks on desktop, I was curious to see how this gleaming looter shooter would run on the less flexing hardware of the Steam Deck. The answer: it didn’t, at first. Luckily, a semi-quick fix was enough to get me in, where I found a game that for all its ray tracing inclinations, is comfortable with life on the Deck. Reasonably. Most of the time.
With any luck, my issue could be purged completely by the time The First Descendant releases on July 2nd. Partly because I was using a technically non-final preview build, and partly because the problem itself was a silly one: launching was blocked by a case of missing Visual C++, something that the Steam Deck’s Proton compatibility witchcraft usually takes care of. Come on, Proton lad, you’re kinda dropping the ball here.
If this ever happens to you, in The First Descendant or any other game, I heartily recommend YouTuber JD Ros’ video tutorial on fixing it. The method boils down to installing the latest C++ versions via the Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode, then adding their executables to the game’s launch options. This worked a treat for me, and I didn’t suffer any further compatibility headaches from there on out.

      <p>Frostpunk 2 has been delayed. Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.</p>

<p>Developer 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:</p>

<p>“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.</p>

<p>11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/05/27/breaking-the-ice">here</a>. </p>]]></summary>

Metaphor: ReFantazio, the first (going by the colon usage) in a new series of RPGs helmed by Persona series director Katsura Hashino, is no exception. It might be set in a medieval fantasy realm, a relatively straight-laced world of square masonry and parchment maps, but it portrays bread-and-butter RPG fixtures with much the same flair as its strutting high school cousin.

It’s a ponderous, pained roll, creaky and ancient. If it has i-frames, the ‘i’ stands for “I would like to not do that again for at least five minutes, please.” Each time you roll, or sprint, your character wipes beads of sweat from his brow, and you can tell the exertion is genuinely taxing. My man is exhausted. Also, surrounded by fish, both symbolic and literal.

That's because said area is a woodland that's been steeped in shadow and chaos for so long, large goats don't dare clop their hooves. What I hadn't expected was that relying on my own two trotters would be so... revelatory. It's made me reconsider exploration in Elden Ring's open world, and conclude that using Torrent as a taxi service contributes to a feeling of disconnection.

Then, the bitter chaser: both Deadzone and Tribes 3 will go on the backburner, while Ultra Strikers becomes the studio’s main effort.

The aim, NEXON tell me, is in motivating players to try out different approaches to combat rather than relying on flat progression.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age: The Veilguard consultant and former Dragon Age executive producer Mark Darrah has published a Youtube video addressing the question: "why do AAA games take so long?" It's a tidy 25 minutes or so, and gets a fair way into the weeds of a variety of topics, from the current enthusiasm for live service "forever games" over 'finite', narrative-led affairs, to the "misleading" announcement of highly-demanded sequels years before they enter full production, in order to pump up a publisher's brand during a dry spell.
One thing I wanted to fish out and drop on your plate is Darrah's discussion of what he terms "the fidelity death cult" - that is, the desire for ever greater levels of lifelike visual detail and "intricacy".

      <p>Capcom has revealed Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, a remaster of the Xbox 360 game that first launched in 2006. Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Revealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/dead_rising_triple_pack/b/playstation4/archive/2016/08/09/dead-rising-re-releases-confirmed-for-september-launch.aspx">the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017</a>. Regardless, we're stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check out the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster teaser trailer for yourself below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

The more than 100 games included at launch was far from stingy, with an extra dozen being added in a free update at the end of last year. Now the collection will add almost 40 more games in an upcoming ‘Expanded Edition’, taking its total game count to over 150.

Truly a proto-Instagram-era Nostradamus. Almost ten years after the first game came to PC, and upsettingly close to 20 years from its debut, the original Dead Rising is coming back in a fresh remaster.

Prior to being the guy who has to push a boulder up a hill for all eternity, Sisyphus was a crafty Ephyran tyrant who used to murder his guests for kicks, and who once fathered children with his own niece in a bid to depose his own brother. Charming! The Ancient Greek gods were outraged both by the king's violation of the norms of hospitality, and by his general insistence on being too clever by half - and I feel a similar way reading the Xitter feed of Bashir "ManliestDev" Kashalo, who is making a game in which you play as Sisyphus after his eventual demotion to Hell's chief stone-shover.

If you liked Townscaper for simple seaside town tinkering, or enjoyed the forest-dwelling demo of Tiny Glade's homely castle creation, you might get a satisfied sigh out of this. Dystopika is a cyberpunk build 'n' chill where you place down skyscrapers, apartment blocks, factories, and imposing ziggurats straight out of Blade Runner. There's no goal, no big number to hit or yammering town mayor to appease. Just some low tempo music, straightforward building controls, and the ability to insert your own cat pictures on the sci-fi billboards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don’t dislike The First Descendant. It has a good grasp of the numbers-go-up-yay appeal behind looter shooters. Sometimes you get to grapple onto a vast robot crab. The first evil alien overlord you fight is named Greg. Not bad, not bad. It’s also, wholeheartedly and unapologetically, a big graphical show-off, complete with multiple ray tracing modes and shinier power armour than if you fed the entire cast of Warframe through an industrial car wash.
Happily, this doesn’t necessarily translate into chugging performance on low-end PCs, or even handhelds like the Steam Deck. But judging from its final preview version, which has just closed prior to the July 2nd release date, feasting on The First Descendant’s finest visuals will definitely tax your rig – and it has its share of technical quirks on the side.

Nor does the idea of a digital society. There's networked communications tech, but it consists of signals between bodies in deepest space, light years apart, of lonely video terminals in cramped dockloader apartments, and of maniacally collaged CCTV feeds of Marines getting their asses kicked, man. There's no ocean of online interactions, corroding the everyday from all directions, just 1-to-1s through boxy, retro-futurist screens that are so dingy and inadequate it feels like Ripley and Burke are peering at each other through a letterbox. Small wonder, given that Aliens was released in 1986, when what would become the internet was still mostly the province of universities and the military.

After eating some fridge fruit, I prepare an ambush by flicking off the lightswitch, then hide behind a desk. When they break in, I bravely sneak up behind them and put the frying pan I picked up to work. The sound effects tell me this a quality bit of cookware. Probably cast iron. Barely a dent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I finished my review for Soulslike Lies Of P, the devs released a patch not long after that nerfed bosses and made things for ol' Pinnochio easier overall. Sod's Law struck that day… and it's returned with a smirk. Shadow Of The Erdtree has just been patched, making its Shadow Realm Blessings stronger from the off, and in turn, things a little easier for everybody. Such is the life of a reviewer, eh.

In a much-edited statement on Xitter yesterday, Beahm confessed that, yes, he messaged an "individual minor" via the Twitch Whispers chat service in 2017, characterising the messages as "casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate, but nothing more".

Ye olde games shoppe, GOG.com is selling the 1996 survival horror classic as a digital download, so you don't have to go rummaging through eBay auctions to find an original physical copy anymore. It's going for £9/$10. But the smile-raiser is the revelation that its sequels, Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, will also be getting reanimated in their original polygonal glory.

How, then, to interpret my visceral repulsion to the most disgusting Shadow Of The Erdtree build yet seen? So gross, in fact, that YouTuber SYROBE has managed to beat the Elden Ring DLC’s infamously ridiculous final boss in a mere 13 seconds. Here’s the video. Massive spoilers, obviously.

If you haven't played it, you should buy it quick - because it's being delisted from digital storefronts later this year, and its DLC disappears from sale today.

      <p>As part of the character creation process for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, players will have to select both a class for their player-controlled Rook and a faction. After customizing much of your Rook's body, including things like a Qunari's horn type and material, for example, with the hundreds of options available in Veilguard, it will be time to pick said class. </p>

As Nic wrote earlier in the week, a portion of the negative feedback is aimed at the expansion's difficulty, which is certainly a Thing To Hear after years of being told by kindly gamers that I only hand out low review scores because I can't press the buttons in the right order.
As publishers Bandai Namco have sweetly observed, struggling players are perhaps forgetting that you can raise your overall power level by gathering Scadutree Fragments, a system of collectibles designed to ensure a tough challenge even for endgame players, while giving you the option of effectively rebalancing the expansion through exploration. The downside there, as a few people have pointed out, is that some players don't want to hunt for collectibles before they can topple the bosses.

Word on the reviewvine is that it's jolly decent, offering free movement around a real-time 3D reinvention of the original point-and-clicker's shimmering archipelago, with its many murals of crushed and scattered civilisations. There’s still a demo on Steam at the time of writing, a relic of long-ago Next Fest 2024. Demos tend to be removed once the game hits shelves, so I thought I’d rush you a quick post based on 30 minutes with the remake over lunch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The co-operative clambering of Chained Together is easy to understand. It's like Fall Guys in the fiery pits of hell, with a tower of fiendish platforming challenges. It brings to mind the mind-shattering failures of Getting Over It and a previous short-lived clamber sim called Only Up. Also, you are chained to your teammates. Every time you fall in this fiery multiplayer de-motivator, you are taking your pals with you, usually right back to the start. At RPS, we are not fazed, this should be straightforward. Nic, Edwin, and Brendan are all disciplined people. Yes, they are bound together in unbreakable irons. Yes, Nic does sometimes leap into the abyss without warning. Yes, they remain divided on precisely what obscene act the giant demon in the game's background is performing with his idle hands. But none of this means they can't work together to escape the inferno. Right?

      <p>Remakes tend to be more exciting than remasters because the improvements often go beyond mere bumps in resolution or framerate. At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware.&nbsp;</p>

Geoff Keighley's show has become an anchor of sorts for the whole thing, but there is plenty more happening just generally nearby.

      <p>Developer Mojang has revealed that a native version of Minecraft is finally coming to PlayStation 5. It's currently in a testing phase, but if you own the PlayStation 4 version of the game for your PS5, you can take part in the preview right now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though Minecraft has been playable on PS5 for years, it's always been the PS4 version; this native version, however, is a new build of Minecraft made specifically for PS5, which means it will theoretically perform better on the console.&nbsp;</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)
