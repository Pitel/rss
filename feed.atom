Happy Saturday, my children, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? You join us at the start of March, which brings the staggering truth that we're already entering the third month of 2023. It's been a pretty hectic start for this turn on the ol' merry-go-round. But hopefully, this month brings us and our backlogs a bit of a breather, with only a couple of major hitters swinging for the fences. It should be a little chiller.
After all, one of these titles is only a remake of one of the most beloved games of all time.
I hope that the year has been a great one for you so far, and that you've gotten out of the starting blocks in fine fashion. And if not, that's absolutely fine. Neither have I, really. The year is long, and there is still plenty of time for …]]></summary>

It should be out by now. I'll bet it was supposed to be out by now. The Royal Rumble deal? the SNL sketch? the Korean rating? C'mon. Still, I'm not complaining about the fact that Capcom's Street Fighter 6 is still four months away, no sir. And that's because it's shaping up to be an incredibly promising release. This is what happens when you allow something to bake to completion, something that Street Fighter V was most definitely not allowed to do by its fateful launch.
It's all good, as the drip feed of information has given eager fight fans the opportunity to check out the game's 18-strong launch roster, performing vital reconnaissance on their personal World Warriors of choice.

Welcome, one and all!
It's been another reasonably busy week here at Nintendo LIfe. We started off with a Pokémon Presents showcase which, according to you fine people, wasn't all that good. The biggest highlight was undoubtedly the announcement of the Scarlet and Violet DLC, which will come in two parts and is officially called 'The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero'.

It's been six years since Nintendo launched its hybrid device known as the Switch. While many fans of the system remember the launch for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, there were some other unique offerings available.
One of these other titles was Super Bomberman R. Konami at the time launched the game exclusively on Nintendo's system. Now as part of the six-year anniversary celebrations, the third-party Japanese developer has taken a moment to acknowledge this particular entry while also teasing how there's "more in store" for the Bomberman series.

The popular online multiplayer game Warframe is getting its next big piece of content next month. The Duviri Paradox expansion for Warframe arrives in April, bringing its own style of experience to the sci-fi game.
As premiered during today's March Devstream, a teaser showed off some more of the theme and vibe for The Duviri Paradox. The story follows the Drifter, stuck in a shifting and changing world, going up against the Child King ruler Dominus Thrax.
Publisher and developer Digital Extremes is billing this as a roguelike-inspired Open World experience, which will be accessible to both new and old players. You can get a glimpse of what that looks like here:

Expanding on everything that made Battle Clash great, Metal Combat: Falcon’s Revenge is a sequel in everything but name. I have no idea why. It’s not that Battle Clash is a great name, but changing the brand and then attaching a subtitle makes it sound unrelated. I guess we should be happy that they didn’t change over to the Japanese nomenclature for Battle Clash. They called it Space Bazooka. That’s just what I’d call the Super Scope if I was trying to make fun of it.
If you didn’t read my article last week, Battle Clash was a game for Nintendo’s space bazooka, the Super Scope. Nintendo decided to follow up the success of their ubiquitous NES Zapper by severely overcompensating. The Super Scope was absolutely a space bazooka.

This effectively should resolve a long-standing issue with modern Android devices, in particular those running Android 11 and above, whereby users could not properly access the game data folders or the save game files in the external storage.

Epic Games has revealed the next title that it will be offering up to its customers free of charge over on the Epic Games Store — A delightful choice this time around, users will be able to pick up Raw Fury's period piece adventure Call of the Sea from March 9, for the grand price of Nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w39ml-My7qM&ab_channel=Xbox
Developed by Out of the Blue and released in December 2020, Call of the Sea is a narrative-driven, first-person puzzle adventure, set against the fashion-forward backdrop of the 1930s. Players pick up the role of Norah Everhart, who ventures into a mysterious, uncharted island in the South Pacific in order to locate her husband Harry, who has vanished while on an expedition to uncover a life-changing new medicine.
As Norah explores the island, she will meet a party of strangers — friendly or otherwise — solve puzzles, negotiate traps, and piece together the mysteries of the island, its inhabitants, and the fate of her beloved. With luscious, classic comic artwork, a heartfelt narrative, and some pretty durn tricky, (borderline obtuse), puzzles, Call of the Sea is well worth a look for any puzzle adventure, and could prove to be a fine way to while away a coming weekend or two.
Oh, and be sure to check out our own CJ Andriessen's review.
Call of the Sea will be available to download from Epic Games Store from March 9 until March 16. Until then, players still have the opportunity to bag current freebie Rise of Industry, before its removal on Wednesday.

This card normally retails closer to £50, with a stated UK RRP of £55, but it has dipped as low as £37.99 for a few days over the past year. 
Still, this is a very reasonable price for a memory card that's good for up to 130MB/s sequential reads and meets the A2 requirements for random performance.

The British Academy of Film and Television Arts has released its nominee list for the 2023 iteration of its BAFTA Game Awards, which are scheduled to take place later this month — And Sony Santa Monica sequel God of War Ragnarok is leading the way, with a record-breaking 14 nominations.
The critically acclaimed, and multi-award-winning fantasy adventure is nominated in the majority of the year's categories, including Best Technical Achievement, Narrative, Music, Multiplayer, Game Design, Artistic Achievement, and, of course, Best Game. Additionally, Christopher Judge is up for Performer in a Leading Role for his portrayal of Kratos, while Danielle Bisutti is nominated in the Performer in a Supporting Role category for her portrayal of the troubled witch, Freya. It seems highly unlikely that the smash-seller will not walk away without a fistful of gongs — at the very least — come the big night.
Aside from the God of War Ragnarok nomination sweep, plenty of great releases from 2022 are also hoping to take home a coveted BAFTA award. Titles such as FromSoftware's Elden Ring, Guerilla Games' Horizon Forbidden West, Team Asobo's A Plague Tale: Requiem, and Annapurna Interactive's Stray have also all received nominations, alongside smaller-sized hits including Half Mermaid's FMV mystery Immortality, Finji's Tunic, Massive Monster's Cult of the Lamb, and Poncle's compelling mobile title Vampire Survivors.
The BAFTA ceremony will take place on March 30.
You can check out the full list of categories and nominations over on the official BAFTA website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yosuke Matsuda, president and representative director of Square Enix, is stepping down after 10 years in the position. 
The official announcement states that he’ll be replaced by the relatively new Takahashi Kiryu, a company director who joined Square in 2020, as part of an organizational restructuring. The proposed change will be voted for approval at the 43rd Annual Shareholder’s Meeting in June. Square Enix’s reason for the change is as follows:
Matsuda became president in 2013, succeeding Yoichi Wada as part of a massive restructuring. His time at the top could be viewed as a bit of a rollercoaster. He pushed for innovation in Square’s flagship franchise, Final Fantasy, and voiced commitment to remaking and re-releasing popular titles from Square’s back catalog, such as Final Fantasy VII. The MMO Final Fantasy XIV also became a global phenomenon under his watch, though the company as a whole has largely struggled to land a massive success outside of the franchise. In recent years, high-profile Square Enix-published titles such as Marvel’s Avengers and Babylon’s Fall had disappoitning releases, with the former ceasing development this year and the latter shutting down this week. 
Perhaps most infamously, Matsuda was also at the front of Square’s tumultuous relationships with its North American third-party publishers, namely Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal, whose titles such as the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy, Deus Ex, and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy were often deemed commercial disappointments. That came to a head last May, when Square Enix sold off these studios and their IPs to Embracer Group.
In recent times, Matsuda was also a vocal advocate for NFTs and blockchain gaming. In January, he published a letter detailing upcoming company initiatives, including making games that incorporate blockchain technology.]]></summary>

The next step in the Pokemon animated series is on its way. With the latest trailer, we're getting a look at the new series leads that are taking up the mantle.
Liko and Roy look like our two new leads, each with a mysterious new artifact. Liko carries a strange pendant, while Roy has an oddly designed PokeBall. I imagine the series will probably highlight their search to uncover the meaning behind both of them.
We also have Friede and my personal new favorite character, Captain Pikachu. If you were worried that Ash's impending retirement would mean less Pikachu, that does not seem to be the case. We even get a Pikachu with a cool hat!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAav4UAT7zk
Paldean starters Fuecoco, Sprigatito, and Quaxley all make an appearance here too; it looks like Sprigatito is Liko's Pokemon, while Roy has Fuecoco. Also spied in today's trailer: Fride on a Charizard, a Cerueledge, and an Oshawott just hanging out in the background of one shot. Rad!
Setting off on a new journey
Following after Ash's big championship win, this new series will see the longtime protagonist hang up his hat and let a new batch of eternally-young Trainers take the lead. It's a pretty big step, considering how Ash has been at the center of the Pokemon animated series for quite a long time.
It leaves a lot of weight on this special to deliver, but I'm keen to see how the show evolves with Liko and Roy in the lead. The new series premieres in Japan on April 14 with an hour-long special.
Meanwhile, if you're keen for more in the world of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, there's plenty on the way this year. The Pokemon Company recently confirmed two pieces of DLC are scheduled for this year, with one arriving in the fall and the second arriving winter 2023.

But I'm a little more interested in something Yoshida said in an interview with Gematsu. During that interview, Gematsu's Sal Romano asked whether or not FFXVI would feature any lighter diversions from the seemingly quite heavy main storyline—something like Final Fantasy X's blitzball.

The chance to add these to your library will be gone for good soon and, for one reason or another, these eShop-exclusives are close to our hearts.
Today, Ollie nominates Nano Assault EX, an excellent shmup from the folks who brought you Fast RMX and The Touryst.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty remains the key factor in deal completion
According to global news conglomerate Reuters, the European Commission is considered likely to approve the acquisition of publisher Activision Blizzard by Microsoft. The regulatory body held a hearing over the stalemate sale last week, where Microsoft pleaded its case for the $69 billion purchase.
Citing anonymous sources, Reuters reports that the EU commission is satisfied with Microsoft's promise to leave Activision's military shooter franchise Call of Duty as a multiplatform IP, rather than make the billion-dollar series an exclusive for Microsoft's own Xbox platform. While there are many factors pertaining to the sale — from a company, franchise, division, and employee standpoint — Call of Duty and its future remains one of the key elements on which the entire purchase rests.
"[Microsoft is] committed to offering effective  and  easily  enforceable solutions  that address the European Commission's concerns," said the publisher in comments to Reuters. "Our commitment to grant long-term 100% equal access to Call of Duty to Sony, Steam,  NVIDIA, and others  preserves the deal's benefits to gamers and developers and increases competition in the market."
Regardless of the EU's final decision, which must be disclosed before April 25, 2023, Microsoft still has to face down a lawsuit from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which is scheduled to go to trial this summer. The losing party will also have the right to appeal, essentially setting the tone for a long and extremely drawn-out process before the acquisition is finally settled, one way or another.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're cleanin' the earth, Cloud
The glowing city of Midgar is looking a little dirty these days. So it's apparently up to a band of intrepid powerwashers to party up and grind their way through the grime. The Final Fantasy VII-themed PowerWash Simulator Midgar Special Pack is available now.
This Final Fantasy VII DLC for PowerWash Simulator launched on March 2, and is available free for all owners of the game. This spans all platforms, from console to PC, as well  as those who have PowerWash through Xbox Game Pass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUHoEHiur0
There are five levels to clean of dirt, grime, and Makoe Residue, which is apparently a special type of mess for the Midgar levels. They take place across locales you might fondly remember from Final Fantasy VII and the FFVII Remake. They are:
Hardy Daytona and Shinra Hauler
Scorpion Sentinel
Seventh Heaven
Mako Energy Exhibit
The Airbuster
Cleaning up the energy
Alongside the new levels and new residues, there's also a mini-campaign where Final Fantasy VII characters exchange texts with the player. Tifa Lockhart, Reeve Tuesti, and Heidegger will all chat with the player, same as NPCs do in the main PowerWash Simulator.
It's nice that this pack is free for all players, so you won't have to buy anything but the base game to clean up Midgar. While PowerWash Simulator isn't the first idea I would've considered for a Final Fantasy VII crossover, but the more I see it, the more I dig it.
Seeing Midgar through a new, albeit murky, lens is pretty cool. The chill co-op nature of PowerWash Simulator seems like it would make for a good hang-out game for a group that digs Final Fantasy. So go ahead and cast Waterga on the Seventh Heaven bar counter if that sounds like your jam.

But that's partly why I'm enjoying EA's approach for advertising the Skate. reboot. Footage from the open-world skateboarders’ playtest leaked last September, and EA have since responded by releasing their own janky videos. These clips give us a taste of the whacky ragdolling happening right now, and it's probably the most entertaining way of marketing a game while simultaneously sucking the air out of leaks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recommended a pretty wide variety of genres over the years, but I didn't expect a brick breaking game to surprise me like Destructure Colon Among Debris. It's not that I dislike them. They've just never really made much impression (possibly because I don't see all that many)
Destructure blends in a hint of shooting, resource management, and leans into the sheer fun of destruction, replacing bricks with "structures" that aren't meant to be anything specific, but give the whole feeling an impression of combat, an assault you're carrying out rather than a reacting, abstract geometry game.
Also it feels and sounds great to hit stuff. That's probably the bigger reason.

The Switch has been out for a whopping six years today! Can you believe it? We're not sure what the more mind-blowing fact is here, the idea that we haven't had anything new from Nintendo for over half a decade or the realisation that 2017 was six years ago...
Either way, making it to a sixth birthday while still churning out top-notch content like Fire Emblem Engage, Metroid Prime Remastered, and (okay, maybe we're getting a little ahead of ourselves here) The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is pretty good going any console. At this point in their respective lifecycles, the dear Wii U was dead in the water and even those that people look back on more fondly like the GBA had long been sidelined by their successor.

Capcom has announced that it will hold a Capcom Spotlight live stream presentation next week, offering news and updates pertaining to the publisher's upcoming slate of radical releases. The stream will take place on Thursday, March 9.
Making an appearance during the 26-minute presentation will be the sci-fi dino fighter Exoprimal, the hugely successful adventure title Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection, and quirky puzzler Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective. The main spotlight will be held by the highly anticipated remake, Resident Evil 4, which launches on PC and consoles on March 24.
https://twitter.com/CapcomUSA_/status/1631465882235936770?s=20
Conspicuous by its absence is any reference to Street Fighter 6, though fans can hope for a surprise trailer drop, or maybe even a date for an open beta. It seems odd that the title does not get a namecheck, but now that the entire launch roster has been revealed, it's all over bar the waiting.
You will be able to check out the live stream for yourself over on the official Capcom YouTube and Twitch channels. The action kicks off at 14:30 PT / 17:30 ET / 23:30 BST, with a brief pre-show scheduled 15 minutes beforehand. Of course, we'll be sure to bring you all of the hot scoops from the stream right here on Destructoid.

It's been 15 years since I last visited family in Yokohama, and my last memory is one where I'm miserable and I'm staring out of a cab window going back to the airport. I didn't want to leave. It sounds corny as heck, but I can't wait to sucker punch that memory with a swing that's been building for 5478 days, then jab it full of happy ones. Really, I imagine what will happen is I'll get weirdly emotional as the plane touches down and my mate Simon, who I'm going with, will be like, "Get a hold of yourself you buffoon".
I got LINE recently -  a Whatsapp equivalent that's big in Japan - to arrange some meetups with friends and family. Those arrangements have happened, which brings me great joy. But in a surprise plot twist, it meant I got back in touch with a guy called Sam. Now Sam, he's a good bud and we go a long way back. All the way back to the original Gears Of War days. And I think we've arranged, as is custom, to play Gears 6 whenever it arrives. Such is the bizarre way of things.

It was an insightful look at the nuts and bolts of game dev, so I’m glad Ninja Theory are returning to the concept for the spooky action sequel Hellblade 2: Senua’s Saga. The first episode takes a look at Iceland - the sequel's setting - and the team's painstaking commitment to recreating it as realistically as possible. The photogrammartry tech on display is seriously impressive, and following the team to Iceland feels like watching a British travel series, without the crude humour.

Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is going to put a lot of action veteran's skills to the test. Like Sekiro, there's a lot of focus on parrying and timing, which not everyone is keen on. The good news is that Wo Long's block mechanic is extremely strong, and you can use it to your advantage to cut down on the need to parry every single attack. Here's how it all works.

The Last Worker, a first-person narrative adventure from developer Wolf & Wood and writer/director Jörg Tittel, has been on our radar for a while now and it's finally got a release date — 30th March.
With a star-studded voice cast including (hello to) Jason Isaacs and the brilliant Zelda Williams — a certified 'top pal of Nintendo' if ever there was one — it's shaping up to be a slyly hilarious take on an automated, dystopian future that many people may find alarmingly familiar already.

Here's another look at the three characters introduced in today's trailer: 

Strangely, this trailer wasn't released during the Pokémon Day showcase, which aired earlier this week. There, The Pokémon Company announced a new stop-motion animation series coming to Netflix, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC, a re-reveal of Pokémon Sleep, and more.

We are gradually nearing the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie and we are increasingly learning more about what to expect from this fresh take on the classic video game characters.
One of the film's most drastic changes appears to have come in the shape of Princess Peach. Formally the helpless damsel in distress of the early Mario games — being passively moved from castle to castle before being snatched from the jaws of defeat at the last minute — the film appears to be taking a very different approach.

A lengthy personal essay about an attract mode clip? Can my cat get a review? First off, yes. Captain Waffles is a visceral tour-de-force that no fan of the genre should miss. 10/10. Secondly, you should know that Immortal Empires is, as far as Total War: Warhammer goes, the game mode. More importantly, this ridiculously expansive, years-spanning grand-strategy project exists as tangible proof that sometimes, the limitless hubris of man is actually rad as hell, despite what the ancient Greeks said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed that Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers can jump into Metroid Fusion when the game is added to the NSO library on March 8. 
After surprise releasing Metroid Prime Remastered last month, Metroid fans have another game from the series' history to play through, this time in the Game Boy Advance game first released in 2002. Once Fusion is live with NSO, players can finally experience Samus Aran's full 2D series journey on the Nintendo Switch, starting with the original Metroid game all the way through Metroid Fusion and 2021's Metroid Dread. 
Check out the Metroid Fusion Nintendo Switch Online trailer announcing the news below: 


"In Metroid Fusion, interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran is attacked by an X parasite while exploring the mysterious planet SR388," Nintendo's description of the game reads. "This organism is not only deadly, but it can mimic the abilities of any creature it infects – including Samus herself! Saved from the brink thanks to an infusion of Metroid DNA, the X parasite's only natural predator, she soon discovers that the parasite has spread to the research station orbiting SR388. Weakened and out of options, Samus must do whatever it takes to destroy the X threat before it's too late." 
Nintendo says Metroid Fusion contains "a multitude of secrets" for players to experience that links Super Metroid to Metroid Dread. 
Speaking of Metroid Dread, read Game Informer's review of it to find out why it was one of our favorite games of 2021, and then read Game Informer's Metroid Prime Remastered review. Check out our list of every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Sega Genesis, and GBA game on Nintendo Switch Online after that. 
Metroid Fusion hits Nintendo Switch Online next week on March 8.

There have been some strange uses for Switch Joy-Cons over the past six years of the console's existence. We've strapped them to our legs to kick footballs in Nintendo Switch Sports, held them vertically to milk virtual cows in 1-2 Switch and let's not forget the discovery that they can be used as a stand-in Wii remote sensor. But no game has come up with quite as weird a use for them as the recently released Give me toilet paper!
Instead of waving the remote around or holding it at a funny angle, this new title from publisher Takahiro Miyazawa requires you to pop a Joy-Con inside of a roll of toilet paper and roll it around to control the movements of a virtual toilet tissue on screen.

The Metroid franchise is having something of a moment right now. With the recent release of the highly praised Metroid Prime Remastered, I feel like the internet has been abuzz about the adventure of Samus Aran. I haven't heard this much chatter about gaming's favorite galactic bounty hunter since Metroid Dread dropped to widespread praise in 2021. Metroid has long been my favorite franchise from Nintendo (depending on the day of the week you as me) so the more I get to talk about it, the better.
For anyone who has missed out on the earlier games in the series, there is some good news. Metroid Fusion is coming to Nintendo Switch next week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o-1bhvB1qk
Originally released for the Game Boy Advance–on the same day Metroid Prime released for the GameCube—Metroid Fusion is the sequel to the critically lauded SNES masterpiece Super Metroid. The game finds Samus fighting for her life after being attacked by a parasite known as X. To save her life, doctors inject Samus with Metroid DNA, officially fusing her with the creature she once hunted to near extinction. But her recovery is cut short when she discovers a doppelganger known as SA-X is wreaking havoc on a Biologic Space Laboratories ship.
Play the other games too
Metroid Fusion will become available on Nintendo Switch on March 9 through the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack subscription plan. If you're a complete newbie to the franchise, the first three games in the series—Metroid, Metroid II: The Return of Samus, and Super Metroid—are also available on Nintendo Switch Online.
For those who'd rather own a copy of Metroid Fusion rather than rent one through the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack subscription, there is still time to buy the game on the Wii U Virtual Console before it gets taken offline later this month. You do still have your Wii U, don't you?

The Pokémon Company has today revealed a new trailer for the upcoming Pokémon animated series (above) which will see the recently-introduced Liko and Roy stepping into the lead role that was formally held by Ash for the past 25 years.
As well as reconfirming the series' Japanese release date of 14th April, the latest trailer also announced that the opening episode is going to be an hour-long special. We can't help but think that this is a good move. After all, when you have journeyed with one hero for almost three decades, it's going to take more than a 22-minute introduction to settle in with the new faces.

The film doesn’t have any talent attached right now, but the two companies are currently looking for a director and a screenwriter. Blumhouse says, "it’s imperative we find someone who appreciates and loves the world as much as we do, to help us bring the game to the big screen".

It’s unlikely, though, that Bezos and the gang have been secretly funding R&D into an all-new line of PC gear. As Tom’s Hardware spotted, the Amazon Basics Computer Cooling Fan appears to simply be an existing budget cooler, the Cooler Master Hyper H410R, without the CM badge.

With the Super Mario Bros. Movie speeding towards its launch on April 5th (or at some point in April or May, depending on where you live), the cast is currently out doing the rounds to promote the upcoming release.
During an appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show for NBC, actors Chris Pratt (Mario), Charlie Day (Luigi), Keegan-Michael Key (Toad), and Jack Black (Bowser) spoke at length about the movie and how they created the voices for their respective characters (we imagine Chris Pratt probably just spoke the words in his normal voice - heh).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Changing of the guard
Square Enix has announced that Yosuke Matsuda will be stepping down from the role of company president and representative director, to be replaced by current company director Takashi Kiryu. The changeover is expected to take place this June, following shareholder approval.
Matsuda, a veteran of the games industry for many decades, has held directive roles in companies such as Taito Corporation, before becoming president of Square Enix Co. in April of 2013, eventually being named as president of Square Enix Holdings later that year. Matsuda has overseen Square Enix' direction for the past 10 years, throughout its highs and lows. These include the release of some lucrative and successful titles, but also the sales of various subsidiary developers and, most recently, the absorption of Luminous Productions.
Most recently, Yosuke Matsuda has led the company's adamant push toward the blockchain/NFT market. In a letter to the company at the start of the year, Matsuda further cemented the company's desire to capitalize on the controversial technology, despite the market's plummeting interest and profit.
Square Enix released a brief statement, noting that the changeover was part of a reshaping the developer/publisher's management team.
"Under the rapid change of business environment surrounding the entertainment industry, the proposed change is intended to reshape the management team with the goal of adopting ever-evolving technological innovations and maximizing on the creativity of [Square Enix Holdings Co. Ltd.]’s group in order to deliver even greater entertainment to its customers around the world."
The change is expected to be finalized at the 34th Annual Shareholder Meetings this June, with Kiryu expected to step into the presidential role soon thereafter.

Fortunately, this day has arrived and it means Metroid fans across Europe, Japan and other locations like Australia & New Zealand can now get their hands on a hard copy of the game.

This particular title has Samus (and players) evading the SA-X - an "unstoppable X mimicking Samus" - until they are eventually powerful enough to take it on.

I’ve held water for Ninja Jajamaru-kun for some years now. I remember picking up its plum-hued cartridge and deciding it was worth the $5 just to see what was on it. My hunch was correct; it was indeed worth $5. While it’s a rather basic arcade-style title, it feels like the perfect encapsulation of the pre-Zelda Famicom market. It’s distinctly Japanese and already made to feel antiquated by Super Mario Bros., which was released a couple of months prior.
I often refer to the Ninja JaJaMaru series as “almost-classics.” They always seemed to be a few steps behind whatever was popular at the time. A follower, not a leader, and it's hard to tell if the games were an earnest attempt at being anything more.

Panic is hosting a new Playdate Update next week, to share news about its crank-based handheld. The showcase will be held on March 7, airing at 9 a.m. PT / 12 p.m. ET.
The Playdate. if you're not familiar, is Panic's specialty handheld. It's roughly similar to the Game Boy, but with a literal twist: its crank. On the right-hand side of the handheld, there's a crank that can be manipulated, and that Playdate developers have used to create some pretty wild games.
This new Update will specifically share news about the Catalog, Panic's curated on-device and on-web store for Playdate. The company will also be sharing some news about new games.

A new twist
When the Playdate launched last year, it was an interesting concept. The hardware twist wasn't the only one Panic had for the Playdate; the game rollout for the Playdate was also fairly unique. It rolled out new games to Playdate owners as part of its "season," with a new game hitting the device each week after purchase.
It's cool, but obviously users will look for more games once they're finished with the initial roll-out. A good community has sprung up around creating games, hosted on sites like Itch.io, where they can be purchased and then side-loaded. Panic has also kept the Playdate a fairly open platform, with tools like Pulp making it easy for aspiring developers to tool around with making their own creations.
All that said, I'm now curious to see what Panic has in store for the future of Playdate. I like the handheld, even though I haven't picked it back up in a while. It's the sort of specialized electronic device that feels rarer and rarer these days, and the community backing behind it gives its catalog a certain charm. We'll see what Panic's got in store on March 7.

The key point of discussion is her arms, which depending on how far away from the torso they are and relation to the large shoulders, could have troubling indications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Light up Hollywood
The long road to Dead Island 2 is nearing a launch date. Ahead of that, Dambuster Studios and Deep Silver have published a new extended gameplay trailer, highlighting all the ways in which you can thin out the zombie horde in Dead Island 2.
Much like the first game, Dead Island 2 is a first-person zombie game that looks to have a similar mix of ranged and melee combat. As the player ventures through the infected streets of in-universe Los Angeles, you can see how the different systems interact.
It looks like elemental effects still play a big role, as both environmental hazards and weapon accoutrements. I mean, if you're taking down the undead, why not add a little electricity or fire to the situation?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHOqRtA4OK8
Dambuster also showed off a bit of its grisly dismemberment and flesh-tearing tech. It certainly looks like all the undead slaying will be gruesome, if you're looking for that.
The dawn of the dead looms
Dead Island 2 has been in development for quite a long time, as it's moved around dates and studios alike. Next month, though, that road seems like it will be coming to a close, as Dambuster and Deep Silver look to finally get the zombie action out the door.
And honestly, after watching today's deep dive, I'm more intrigued than I initially expected. I played the first Dead Island and had a decent enough time with it. Where other zombie games have opted for parkour or co-op action, there was something about Dead Island's weapon-crafting and pseudo-RPG concepts that gave it a little bit of a different feel.
So maybe I will craft my own flaming axe of destruction and set out into "Hell-A" next month. Get acquainted with some of the Slayers you can play as in the new game here, before Dead Island hits on April 21.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The world is not prepared for my genius
Assemble Entertainment has announced today that Odyssey Studios’ film studio management game Moviehouse will launch April 5 for Windows and MacOS.
Moviehouse is a management game that starts you out in your humble trailer and has you drive your capitalistic art venture into a fat stack of cash. You hire the cast, plot out your movie, and even cover the marketing. There appears to be location scouting, expanding your lot, and even reviews from disgusting critics.
[embed]https://youtu.be/jUBDAfv_jkw[/embed]
I was hoping for The Movies, but Moviehouse looks more like Game Dev Story. That may sound like a complaint, but I love Game Dev Story. There’s just a big The Movies-sized hole in my heart that needs filling. I actually spoke to Mark Webley and Chris Knott before Two Point Campus released, and I asked them why we can’t buy The Movies on Steam anymore. Mark Webley looked a bit sad and basically replied that he didn’t know but, “wished that [he] could still buy it.”
Despite it looking like there won’t be stitching an actual viewable movie together, Moviehouse looks like it’s right up my alley. I love this style of management game, and the tools that are given to you look like they leave a lot of room for creativity. Yeah, I think I’m on board.
I’ll have to wait until April 5, 2023 for its release, however. Moviehouse is coming to Windows and MacOS via GOG and Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Babylon's Fall: born on a Monday, buried on Sunday
Alas, poor Babylon's Fall. The game has finally fallen down its final flight of stairs. As we reported nearly six months ago, the game's end of life arrived at the end of February, but folks are just now noticing that the studio published patch notes for it.
Available to peruse publicly on Steam, the Version 1.4.0 patch notes simply state:
End of service
The last patch the game hosted was all the way back in November of 2022, where the team reminded players that it would be the final update. Before that the team distributed a launch patch, a minor update shortly after release, and patches in April, May, and July of that same year. The "live service element" of the game essentially lasted from March 2022 until a few months later in early September.
We hardly knew ye, Babylon's Fall
As someone who actually played Babylon's Fall from birth (the beta) to death, it's sad to wonder about what may have been. Had it not been conceived as a live service game, and if the powers that be gave it a bit more time in the oven, it could have been a cool stylized action romp from Platinum. The team could have moved on instead of spending time developing post-launch seasonal content (before or after launch), and a standalone release definitely wouldn't have scared off so many people from buying in.
Maybe The Suicide Squad game will meet the same fate? Stay tuned!

The world of Wild Hearts is getting even more in March. Koei Tecmo and Electronic Arts have teased a new Kemono arriving in Wild Hearts in March, alongside more content.
This new beast to hunt seems to be fire-based, according to the teaser posted on social media. The "torrid inferno" and volcano emoji certainly brings to mind some smoldering concepts for a new Kemono to hunt through Azuma.
https://twitter.com/playWildHearts/status/1631090551645667328
More content is expected to arrive in March, though today's teaser doesn't specify if that means more Kemonos or other content. Regardless, it does look like speedy Wild Hearts players will have even more to tackle in the coming month.
Hearts young and wild and free
It hasn't been all that long since Wild Hearts landed on newer consoles and PC, back on February 17. Still, it sounds like players have mostly enjoyed Omega Force's return to the monster-hunting format, with lots of building and action to go around.
With content already slated for March, it looks like support will be here for at least the short term. For the hunting fans at home, I hope it's a sign of a decent lifespan on this game. February was an absolutely stacked month, with way too many games for any one person to get around to. But Wild Hearts certainly seems like it's been worth it to check out, for anyone who likes to take down big monsters and gradually gear up as they do so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Movie: The Game: The Movie
Behaviour Interactive's asymmetical multiplayer horror game, Dead by Daylight, will soon hit the silver screen courtesy of Blumhouse and Atomic Monsters. There currently is neither a screenwriter nor director signed to the project, so that’s more or less all we’re getting for now in terms of concrete information.
“In Dead by Daylight, the Behaviour team has created a love letter to the world of horror, building an incredible environment teeming with atmosphere and terrifying villains — perfect for a scary cinematic adaptation. We’re big fans of the game at Atomic Monster, and are thrilled to be teaming up with Blumhouse to bring this frighteningly visceral world to the big screen,” says Atomic Monster Founder and CEO James Wan.
Dead by Daylight is a constantly expanding title that has grown to absorb characters from other video game and movie franchises like Resident Evil, Scream, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. As James Wan pointed out in his PR quote, the game is a love letter to slasher movies. That kind of makes me confused about why it needs to be adapted into a movie. It’s strength is emulating movies already, so you’re essentially making a game about movies into a movie.
[embed]https://youtu.be/JGhIXLO3ul8[/embed]
I guess it’s a brand recognition thing here. Everything’s about branding.
Still, it’s a largely empty foundation to build a narrative on, so it could be really good. It certainly has the studio power behind it, even though we don’t have any idea what the creative force is going to look like.
In the opposite motion, Blumhouse just recently announced that they’ve established a video game studio of their own, so I look forward to a game based on the Dead by Daylight movie.
Dead by Daylight was released in the halcyon days of 2016. It’s currently available on PC, mobile, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Please continue to check with major retailers for availability"
In case you missed it, Metroid Prime Remastered (or remake, depending on how you see it) dropped digitally on February 8, and physically on February 22 in the US. Well, it was supposed to arrive physically on February 22, but many retailers didn't get shipments, and folks who wanted a copy found themselves inundated with sell-out runs from bots and scalpers. It's the latest in a string of Nintendo physical release drama, but there might be light at the end of the tunnel for this story.
Metroid Prime Remastered will continue to be stocked
Nintendo of America actually provided a statement to the outlet Nintendo Life, who noted that they're aware of the issue and intend to keep the game in stock (at least for the near future). Here's the full statement, courtesy of Nintendo Life:
"We will do everything we can to meet the strong demand for the product. Please continue to check with major retailers for availability. If the Metroid Prime Remastered game sells out at various retail locations in the U.S., we will work to provide more units as soon as possible."

Obviously Nintendo wants to make money, so they'll do everything they can to sell as much as they can; including stock that still needs to be shipped. But the "soon as possible" bit implies some form of urgency, which could help your case if you're still in the market for a copy. It also insinuates that this isn't an extremely limited one-time run, so you should have another chance to grab it if you're perking up right now and realized you want a copy.
As for me, my launch-ordered Amazon copy still hasn't shipped, but is slated to come in around March 7 through March 9. That's a few weeks after the aforementioned physical release, but at least it's semi-locked in!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's coming this year, and a giveaway is live now
Zelda: Breath of the Wild may outlive us all, if the merch train has anything to say about it.
This time we're getting a First 4 Figures...figure, of everyone's favorite Goron Champion Daruk. Of course, it's gonna cost ya. This figure has an early-bird MSRP of $159.99, going up to $169.99 after 30 days from now (end of day on April 2, 2023). To that end, First 4 figures is running a lengthy giveaway, which you can access here.
Here's everything you get with the statue:
"Exquisitely detailed" PVC statue of Daruk
Pose inspired by official artwork
Sheikah Eye symbol featured on the base
Two (2) Light-up LED modes (Static and Animated) for the base
Limited edition numbering on the bottom of the base and packaging
Authentication Card
Rechargeable battery with USB-C Cable
Special Premium deluxe box packaging
Estimated to be out in Q4 of 2023, the figure does look fantastic, and I adore Daruk's goofy grin. But like most things gaming-statue-related, I won't be picking this one up for multiple reasons (the price and the space!). Power to anyone who does, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My beloved monster and me
Meg’s Monster, a narrative-focused JRPG with art inspired by Mother 3, has launched today. Meg’s Monster is developed by Odencat Inc., who has previously graced us with Bear’s Restaurant and Fishing Paradiso.
You play as Roy, the eponymous monster. He’s an indestructible pile of beef, but the real challenge comes from protecting the also eponymous Meg. She has a tendency to throw tantrums of apocalyptic proportions, so it’s in everybody’s best interest that she does not get hurt.
There’s an obvious Undertale vibe here, as you can befriend defeated enemies. Each battle has its own distinct mini-games where you have to keep Meg from throwing a fit. The end goal is to reunite the girl with her mom.
[embed]https://youtu.be/T7rp819leWg[/embed]
It’s amazing the amount of influence that Mother 3 has had on games, and yet Nintendo still won’t localize it in English. Of course, Meg’s Monster is from Japan where Mother 3 doesn’t need localization. Still, it’s just amusing and frustrating that there’s an entire design philosophy focused around this one game, and Nintendo just sits on it. Heck, it hasn’t even been re-released within Japan.
In any case, even though Meg’s Monster looks right up my alley and is described as a “short” experience, my playlist is absolutely crammed right now. I keep saying I’m going to circle back to some of these titles, but that list keeps growing every day I do this job. So do me a favor and check it out. I always have time to live vicariously through someone.
Meg’s Monster is available right now on PC, Switch, and Xbox One. There is a demo available if you want to sample its bouquet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Both the new and returning creatures
Just recently during a Pokemon Day presentation, Game Freak confirmed that there would be not one, but two DLC releases for Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, similar to the rollout seen in the last generation. Thanks to some info directly from the game's official site, we have a bit more knowledge on what that exactly entails.
Of course, the two new legendaries (Ogerpon and Terapagos) are the big reveals, but three new Pokemon have been announced for The Teal Mask (Part 1), including Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti. The latter trio are apparently "beloved by the people of the village as heroes that protected the land of Kitakami in the past," leading them to create "stone statues in their likeness to express the people’s gratitude toward [them]." A group of protectors eh? I like where this is going.
You can find a full list of confirmed Pokemon (both new and old) below.
[gallery link="file" columns="5" size="large" ids="366692,366693,366697,366694,366695"]

Ogerpon (Part 1: The Teal Mask)
Okidogi (Part 1: The Teal Mask)
Munkidori (Part 1: The Teal Mask)
Fezandipiti (Part 1: The Teal Mask)
Terapagos (Part 2: The Indigo Disk)
Returning Pokemon in the Scarlet & Violet DLC ("over 230" confirmed):

Are there Pokemon Scarlet & Violet DLC leaks yet?
It's Pokemon, so of course!
There is also a leak of allegedly returning Pokemon, which you can view at your own risk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The overlap of Powerwash Simulator fans and Final Fantasy VII diehards hits in full force today, thanks to the launch of a free DLC pack for the popular sim. You can use your high-pressure hose to blast dirt and grime off of popular locations in Midgar, and the best part is that the experience is totally free.
The Midgar Special Pack is available now for all versions of Powerwash Simulator. It adds five new levels, including Tifa’s Seventh Heaven bar and the Mako Energy Exhibit. Additionally, you’ll be cleaning up vehicles and mechs such as Cloud’s Hardy-Daytona motorcycle, Shinra Hauler, the Scorpion Sentinal, and the Airbuster. The pack also adds new dirt types, such as bio-residue. 


This DLC was created in collaboration with Square Enix, with Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura writing in a press release, 
“When I heard about the proposal for a collab, I was quite busy with various other collabs and reviews, but I was especially excited about this one. I had just been playing PowerWash Simulator and was daydreaming about cleaning things from my titles. My immediate response was, 'let’s wash the entire Shinra building.' Unfortunately, that seemed to be a bit difficult, but the final line-up is exciting, nonetheless. This is something I have been looking forward to a lot, and hope everyone has a great time!”
This pack follows a Tomb Raider-themed expansion that launched in January. This is a pretty neat trend, and see other video game properties added to the game that are in need of good clean-up. 
Powerwash Simulator is available now for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Now though, this 3440x1440 165Hz gaming OLED has dropped in price by a sizeable 26% or £310. That brings the monitor well into three-figure territory at £880, still pricy but a reasonable value given that this Dell monitor is head and shoulders above its IPS, VA and TN opponents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Also, well, you're already [fit]
I never would have expected a fitness-based Fist of the North Star game to release in 2023, but here we are! The Switch continues to surprise me in just how many developers are willing to create games for it, many of which are of the "how did this happen, wait it doesn't matter, I'm glad it did" variety.
Here's a full description of what to expect, beyond getting fit: "Punch your way through the many enemies that stand in your way and aim for victory in boss battles. The Fitness Boxing series is a boxing exercise game that uses the Joy-Con controllers to let you throw different punches to a beat like a rhythm game, all while receiving directions from in-game instructors voiced by popular voice actors." Yep, I couldn't make that up. I'm so into this, and I hope it's good!
Other than that it's a fairly low key week for the Switch eShop, sandwiched in-between Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe's release recently, and a few weeks before Bayonetta Origins comes out. For now, enjoy punching the screen until you're tired.

More specifically, the showcase will air at 9 a.m. PT on March 7 and during it, Panic will reveal new Playdate games and more. The presentation will run for 13 minutes and will also include an update on Catalog, which is Panic's "own curated, on-device and web browser storefront for Playdate software." 
For the uninitiated, Playdate is a piece of handheld hardware that began shipping to customers in April of last year. It's a small device with a black and white screen and a unique crank on the side of it. This crank is integrated into many of the games you can play with it.
Since last April, more than 25,000 Playdate units have shipped to customers. Playdate is not yet availabe on demand for would-be purchasers but you can preorder the device to receive one in the next wave. 
The Playdate Update showcase will air on the official Panic YouTube channel.

I don't think I've minced my words when I've talked about my distaste for fantasy settings. Whether it is a lingering effect of growing up in a religious household where magic was the creation of the devil, or just not finding it interesting, I've never been able to find an interest in fantasy worlds. So when I was approached with a preview build of Age of Wonders 4 I was apprehensive. Thankfully though I accepted, and for the first time I was enthralled by the fantasy world that stood before me.
So what was so great about the world that Triumph Studios built? Even though the world had some form of procedural generation built into it, each world was brought to life by not only the landscape but also the kingdoms and cities that inhabited your world. Like most 4X games,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somehow, it's been almost a decade since the last numbered Age Of Wonders game. Despite dipping their toes into the sci-fi realm with Age Of Wonders: Planetfall three-odd years ago, developers Triumph are now returning to their fantastical 4X strategy roots with Age Of Wonders 4, due out on PC in just a couple of months on May 2nd - and what a homecoming it's shaping up to be. I've spent the better part of a week and half playing an early build of AOW 4, getting to grips with its enormous array of customizable factions and hero types in its generous crop of single-player realm maps. 


There's a heck of a lot to get through, but rest assured: this is Age Of Wonders through and through - and thanks to the addition of those new, customizable factions, it's also the most RPG-like entry yet, which is good news for budding D&D-ers looking for a grand, 4X strategy game to sink their teeth into. Heck, I'd even go as far as saying it could be one of this year's biggest and most exciting fantasy games outside of Baldur's Gate 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Give it a try
Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope kind of came and went for a lot of folks, but it made a good impression all the same. Odds are you were either on the fence about it or just had a lot going on four months ago (I know most of us on staff did with all the games that were being dumped!), but now you'll have a chance to check it out for free.
As of now, a demo is out on the Nintendo Switch eShop. The demo itself is fairly meaty, providing a glimpse of the intro to the game, as well as a chunk of the first area (Beacon Beach). This game still has life in it yet, as the Tower of Doom DLC is actually out today. More DLC is on the way too, including a Rayman add-on later this year.
If you do decide to pick it up as a result of the demo, you also have the benefit of post-launch patches, which have smoothed over some of the game's bigger glitches (including a progress-halting bug for 100% completion).

We now know when to expect developer Deck13’s latest, as the team have announced a May 16th date for PC and consoles. Publisher Focus Entertainment say a gameplay reveal trailer is “coming soon”, but for now we can enjoy a couple of new screenshots.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reminder: You'll do this in the Splatnet 3 app within the Nintendo Switch Online app
Nintendo has slowly been distributing QR codes for Splatoon 3 players, which grant some form of free in-game bonuses. Today's code includes a new banner, which is accessible below or on the official Japanese Splatoon Twitter account. Neat!
Splatoon 3 is still chugging along, as it recently got its first DLC in the form of a remaster (of sorts) of the original game's hub. Weirdly it's identical to the new hub (and even sells the same gear), but I'm sure folks will enjoy the oddity and the nostalgia. Besides, the real meaty DLC is coming eventually anyway, this is just the prelude.
As a note, you can't just directly scan the QR code. Instead, you'll need to scan it in the Splatnet 3 app, which is actually an app within an app inside of the Nintendo Switch Online app. Not so neat! At the very least once you get the process down, it's not so bad. Also it's an excuse to dig out the Nintendo Switch Online app, which I barely use these days.
For instructions on how to scan Splatoon 3 QR codes as well as a full list of current codes, check out our guide here. Don't forget to redeem them at the terminal!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given that Dead Island 2 has been in development for the better part of a decade, it’s understandable to have some trepidation about its quality (and general existence). Developer Dambuster Studios hopes to convince players that Dead Island 2 is not only close to finished but is a worthy follow-up by releasing an extended gameplay walkthrough that provides the rawest look at its action. 
The guided demo follows Irish punk rocker Dani, one of the game's six playable characters, and shows off a lot of the moment-to-moment action across various locales. The gory F.L.E.S.H. system is on full display, as is the wacky makeshift weaponry, including electrified Wolverine-esque claws. We also get a look at the card-based perk system and one strange sidequest involving pizza. 


Dead Island is slated to launch on April 21 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. We recently featured the game on our cover and you check out a month’s worth of exclusive features by visiting our coverage hub.]]></summary>

As Rock Paper Shotgun's Resident Resident Evil Liker, I took it upon myself to obsessively study each individual frame of this video file to uncover its hidden secrets. Surprising even myself, I was able to extract 17 new details about Leon's refreshed holiday to rural Spain. That's one new thing for each minute of the footage! That wasn't intentional!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Half-Life mod adds raytracing to Valve's venerable first-person shooter, a shiny slap of 2023 lighting technology in a 1998 game. I normally think such anachronistic upgrades look awful but this one works for me. Rather than just slam fancy modern tech into an old game, the mod wants to change the whole look. And it succeeds in a surprising way: by making the rest of Half-Life look older.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Jedi: Survivor director Stig Asmussen of Respawn Entertainment wants the series to be a trilogy. 
This news comes from a new IGN Unfiltered interview with the director, which is where Asmussen revealed that even before the release of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in 2019, the team was already discussing sequel ideas. For Asmussen, Cal's story has always been a trilogy in his head. 
"We were already talking about the second game," said Asmussen. "I mean, frankly, we were talking beyond. And these are conversations that, when we're breaking this story with Lucasfilm, it's like: 'Well, where are we going with the second game?' I always wanted to see this as a trilogy. How can we take Cal and the crew to new places beyond what we were doing in the first game." 
Asmussen continues, stating that Respawn had a good idea of where Survivor, which is due out April 28, takes place in terms of the Star Wars timeline. The team also knew what the stakes were going to be, what the tone was going to be, what Cal was going to be up against, and how his crew was going to be factored into all of that. On top of that, Respawn thinks about the ideas "that we could do beyond that as well." 
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was originally due out March 17, but was delayed to April 28. While waiting to get your hands on the game, watch Game Informer's interview with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan, and then check out our exclusive preview of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor for new details about the story, exploration, and combat.

I'm not the new one in sheep’s clothing, because they haven’t released anything yet. Like many, I was especially drawn to The Wolf Among Us, a neo-noir murder mystery set in the same universe as the Fables graphic novels. It would have been quite poetic to return to the series ten years after its debut, but that’s not going to be paw-sibble, as new TellTale have announced that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed out of 2023. There’s no new release window, but maybe it'll be ready in 2024. Hopefully.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's easy to label Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty as a Soulslike that's basically Nioh and Sekiro mashed together. To some extent, that's true. But I think Wo Long is Team Ninja having sanded off some - not all - of the edges from the overwhelmingly complex Nioh, to craft an action RPG with even crisper combat than its predecessor. And crucially, it's more approachable as a result. Clever ranks and meters reward, whether risk-taking is your jam or you're more of a careful type. It may still be a tricky venture filled with demonic, titanic cows that'll want to pound your skull into the dirt, but this is Team Ninja's most encouraging effort yet.

Team Ninja has earned a reputation for crafting some of the most satisfying action games around, nimbly transitioning from the high-octane action Ninja Gaiden series to the Soulslike thrills of Nioh. Its latest effort, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, is an unforgiving but deeply rewarding showcase of freneticism that lives up to this lineage. The smooth swordplay, brilliant boss fights, and novel systems further prove Team Ninja’s ability to craft unrelenting experiences.

You know the drill: it’s a regular PlayStation 4 inside, but the case would be a new colour, or there’d be a fancy faceplate with a game’s logo or piece of art on it.

        <updated>2023-03-01T20:44:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has announced a new collaborative initiative called PlayStation PlayMakers. The console giant will partner up with celebrity fans of the brand to “celebrate their passion for gaming and PlayStation” by creating unique experiences for players. One of those famous names is NBA superstar LeBron James, who helped design a limited-edition PlayStation 5 accessories.
The special console plates and DualSense 5 controller were co-designed by James and will release in select countries. The hardware is adorned with artistic elements (including obligatory crowns) and personal inspirational messages by LeBron. There’s no word yet on the prices, but you can only pre-order these items through direct.playstation.com. sometime this year. You can read LeBron's thoughts on the project by visiting the PlayStation Blog. 
Other big names involved with PlayStation PlayMakers include country music star Jimmie Allen, actor and comedian King Bach, and other professional athletes such as BMX’s Nigel Sylvester, WNBA All-Rookie NaLyssa Smith, NFL stars Ja’Marr Chase and CeeDee Lamb, French football freestyler Lisa Zimouche, and Belgian football star Romelu Lukaku. The initiative feels similar to McDonald's recent push of celebrity-branded menu items, so who knows what to expect from these names and others in the future.
Are you interested in grabbing LeBron James PlayStation 5 merch? Let us know in the comments!
Editors Note: a previous version of the article incorrectly stated that Sony revealed a LeBron James PS5 console instead of console accessories. We've updated the article with the correction.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/03/01/the-wolf-among-us-2-has-been-delayed-out-of-2023"/>
        <updated>2023-03-01T20:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Telltale Games has announced that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed and will now arrive in 2024. In a statement to IGN, the team explains it wants to avoid crunching the team and releasing an unfinished product as it moves development into Unreal Engine 5.
Telltale released a brief message on Twitter announcing the delay, but CEO Jamie Ottilie shares more context with IGN. Ottilie discusses the challenges of relaunching the studio in 2019, which were then compounded when the COVID-19 pandemic began the following year. That includes announcing the game when the studio was still staffing up to help secure early funding. Despite those early hurdles, Ottilie states that development has been going well since then, but the team recently decided it wants to adopt Unreal 5 to take advantage of the engine’s new features. Unfortunately, that meant having to redo a lot of the work that had been created in Unreal 4.
With such a big change, Ottilie explains that the only way The Wolf Among Us 2 could still arrive this year would be either to launch it in a less-polished state (which the team wants to avoid given its high expectations) or to overwork the staff. Given that the old Telltale was infamous for crunch and burnout, Ottilie is adamant about avoiding the same practice with this iteration of the studio. 
"I've done [crunch], and I don't want to do it again, and it's not fair to ask it," Ottilie tells IGN. "You can't plan a business around it. So yeah, part of it is about maintaining a healthy work culture. We don't want to burn out our good people.”
The Wolf Among Us 2 was announced at the 2019 Game Awards and will be an episodic title like its predecessor. However, Telltale is developing each episode at the same time, so the entire series will be complete when the first installment launches. You can watch the first full trailer from last year here. The studio’s other project, The Expanse: A Telltale Series, is still slated for this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“I was deranged,” says Half-Life writer Marc Laidlaw of his decision to publish the plot of Episode 3 as fanfiction. “I was living on an island, totally cut off from my friends and creative community of the last couple decades, I was completely out of touch and had nobody to talk me out of it. It just seemed like a fun thing to do… until I did it.” 


Laidlaw first discovered that community in the mid 90s, in the office of Valve, where Gabe Newell and team were already hard at work on Half-Life. “I’d seen bits and pieces of the levels they were working on, but as soon as I heard the name, I just got this amazing buzz,” Laidlaw says. “I could see the whole world they were aiming at somehow, and I felt it was a collective vision. This is one reason it’s so weird to me when people try to attribute authorship to me that I’ve never felt. It was all there when I got there, in embryo.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a sometimes hard to define line between a game that effectively establishes and embellishes its fiction (good, righteous), and one that has "lore" (tedious, lowly). It's a delicate art that warrants close consideration. It also warrants some good examples, which brings us to ΔV: Rings Of Saturn. Which, as it gets closer to release, I'm going to be nice to and call either Delta V or Rings Of Saturn. Even though Triangle Vee Colon Rings is more fun.
It's also fun, having played it, to keep up with how it’s doing in early access, not just because I'm looking forward to seeing it take off, but because its dev has spent the last few years writing delightful patch notes in the style of in-world news bulletins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deck 13, makers of The Surge and Lords of the Fallen, have announced their next big action RPG, Atlas Fallen, launches in May. The game was revealed during last year’s Gamescom and centers on players manipulating sand to explore and survive in a fantastical desert world.  
The game supports single-player and two-player co-op and takes place in a massive sand-covered world filled with monsters and gods. You’ll take them down using shape-shifting weapons born out of the sand and other customizable magical abilities. You can check out the cinematic announcement trailer from Gamescom 2022, and a batch of new screenshots, below. 


                  

Atlas Fallen will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

The world’s five explorable regions – Kehjistan, Scosglen, Fractured Peaks, Dry Steppes, and Hawezar – offer their own flavors of topography, cultures, quests, and, of course, monsters. Blizzard is going to great lengths to ensure these regions are not only fun for players to explore, but feature more narrative cohesion and a stronger sense of place. 
Diablo veterans have explored regions of Sanctuary before, but this time they’re more than one-note areas highlighting a single climate or element, such as snow or desert. Each of them is biodiverse in its own right, with multiple biomes and threats exclusive to them. These realms also blend more naturally together; the lush green of one area gradually withers…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electronic Arts has reportedly laid off more than 200 quality assurance testers at its Baton Rouge office in Lousiana. 
This news comes by way of Kotaku, which reports that EA laid off these workers, who worked primarily on the publisher's battle royale Apex Legends, during a surprise Zoom call yesterday. The publication reports that its three sources were able to confirm the news, which began making rounds on Twitter when both current and former QA testers at the Lousiana office began to share what they had learned. 
EA just fired its entire Baton Rouge studio, which is essentially their entire Apex Legends QA staff.
February 28, 2023
Kotaku reports that around 8 a.m. CT, QA testers were invited to an unscheduled but mandatory Zoom call with Magnit Global, which is the contract agency that manages the workers. It was during this meeting that the entire QA team at the Lousiana office was "disbanded," according to Kotaku. 
The publication reached out to EA looking for a response to the mass layoffs, but the publisher opted not to directly address it, instead stating that as "part of its ongoing global strategy, we are expanding the distribution of our Apex Legends testing team and ending execution that's been concentrated in Baton Rouge, Lousiana, impacting services provided by our third-party provider." Be sure to check out Kotaku's write-up for the full statement from EA and additional context surrounding the layoffs, the Lousiana office, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the best things a survival game can do is make you want to share your latest experiences with your family and friends At this, Sons Of The Forest succeeds in grand fashion. Often I found myself pausing the game so I could go find my brother and tell him about the latest Big Thing that had just happened. Some of the time, it's even for the right reasons. Perhaps I'd spotted a group of cannibals adopting some startlingly intelligent behaviour. Or maybe one of my NPC companions had just done something particularly endearing in front of me.
Or, more likely, I'd witnessed another example of the incredible jankiness which, like the island's flesh-nibbling denizens, loves to raid and pillage its way through nearly every aspect of the game. Perhaps I'd just cut down a tree and watched it soar high into the air, glitching all over the place like some demonic new type of tree mutant. Maybe Kelvin had just taken my instruction to gather logs a bit too literally, and deconstructed the entire west side of my house while I wasn't looking.
Sons Of The Forest's great strength is its ability to utterly transport you into its threatening, unsettling, but genuinely beautiful world. It quickly builds up the player's trust until they're ready to wholeheartedly buy into what at times feels like the next generation of open-world survival and crafting games. But then, at least in its current Early Access state, it breaks that trust just as quickly with a melange of unintuitive systems, game-breaking bugs, and a painful lack of content that makes one of the most gorgeous environments in games feel awfully hollow after a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve paid any attention at all to Final Fantasy XVI, you likely already know how action-forward this game is. It’s easily the farthest a mainline Final Fantasy game has ever been from its traditional turn-based roots, with FFXVI being easily the most action-heavy yet. That’s not surprising, though, considering the game’s combat director is Ryota Suzuki, a former Capcom developer with nearly 20 years of experience designing the action in games like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Devil May Cry 4, and most recently, Devil May Cry 5. 
With such a personal connection to Devil May Cry, I couldn’t resist asking: Who would win in a one-on-one fight: FFXVI protagonist Clive or Devil May Cry 5 lead Dante? Suzuki had to answer this question with two of his bosses right beside him – FFXVI director Hiroshi Takai and producer Naoki Yoshida – so perhaps we should take this answer with a grain of salt. But I don’t know, having played both Devil May Cry 5 and two hours of FFXVI during a recent hands-on preview (read about that here), I’m inclined to believe him. 
His answer, with a sly smile and a laugh: Clive. 
Suzuki says Clive’s Eikonic abilities, which allow him to tap into the power of Eikons like Phoenix and Titan, give him the ultimate edge. And just for fun, I asked who would win in a fight between Clive and Nero. 
“Clive.” 
There you have it, very specific fans of both Final Fantasy and Devil May Cry 5 like me; Clive wins.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After previewing Final Fantasy XVI for roughly two hours, which you can read about here, I’m left most interested in the different styles of combat happening throughout the game. Clive has his own style of Devil May Cry-esque combat, party members controlled by A.I. up the ante, Clive’s dog Torgal can attack enemies, Clive can fight Eikons, and there are even Eikon vs. Eikon fights. It’s a lot for one game to juggle, and after my relatively short preview, I feel that the team is confident in this balancing act. 
But I wanted to learn more, so I asked FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, director Hiroshi Takai, and combat director Ryota Suzuki how the team manages so many unique combat experiences.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In today's New Gameplay Today, your hosts Wesley LeBlanc, Kyle Hilliard, and Prima Games' Jesse Vitelli discuss Final Fantasy XVI after going hands-on with it during a recent preview. In this specific segment, you'll see protagonist Clive exploring a castle in search of Benedikta. Along the way, Clive runs into plenty of enemies to take down, some minibosses, and one big boss at the end. Enjoy!


As you can see, Final Fantasy XVI is looking to be the most action-heavy mainline game in the series. But traditional Final Fantasy mainstays like magic, potions, and, of course, Cid are still part of the formula. For more, you can read Wesley's full Final Fantasy XVI preview thoughts here. And you can read Jesse's thoughts over at Prima Games here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI is the most action-forward mainline Final Fantasy game in the series yet, and that’s in no small part due to the person behind its action: combat director Ryota Suzuki. After nearly 20 years at Capcom working on combat for games like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Devil May Cry 4, and most recently, Devil May Cry 5, Suzuki decided he was ready for something new. 
That "something new" turned out to be FFXVI. The game’s director, Hiroshi Takai, and its producer, Naoki Yoshida, offered Suzuki a role at Creative Business Unit III, leading FFXVI’s combat design. And now, on June 22, players will be able to feel what I felt during a recent hands-on preview of the game: it’s very Devil May Cry meets Final Fantasy, in the best way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Final Fantasy series’ numbered entries haven’t been turn-based RPGs for quite some time. With each new game, the series moves further away from its classic turn-based roots toward a more action-oriented combat system. Combat has never been further from being turn-based in a Final Fantasy game more so than in Final Fantasy XVI, which is the most action-based game in the mainline franchise yet. I recently played about two hours of the game to dive deeper into the combat system’s mechanics, and you can read my preview thoughts on that here. 
But after playing some of the game, I spoke with the FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, director Hiroshi Takai, and combat director Ryota Suzuki about this continued shift to deep action and whether Final Fantasy will ever return to its turn-based roots. A…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm still not entirely sure if I'm playing Phantom Brigade right. According to its internal clock, battles usually take less than a minute. That time is divided into five-second chunks during which you're shown what the enemy will do, and must use that to coordinate your own mechs, placing their orders on a visible timeline. You finish your turn by hitting a button that makes everyone go at once for a few explosive moments.
In practice, behind those few seconds are an eternity of theorising, testing, and tweaking. There's probably a metaphor in there somewhere about writing, video editing, or catering. The result is a game that's taken me absolutely ages, but whose numbers suggest I'm supposed to be blasting through without a care.
I am enjoying it a lot, despite some frustration.

But during this preview, I was also able to participate in a group interview of FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, the game’s director Hiroshi Takai, and its combat director Ryota Suzuki. 
One facet of FFXVI’s development I was especially interested in is how Creative Business Unit III, the internal studio behind the upcoming game, is able to balance creating this new title while continuing to develop its extremely successful MMO, Final Fantasy XIV. Yoshida, who is FFXIV’s producer and director, says it’s not as different as you might think.

One question asked was about why the game returns to the series’ high fantasy roots, and why it has such a different tone compared to recent Final Fantasy games. 
According to Takai, it all started with summons. 

“So when the project started, I was one of the first people that [Yoshida] came to first and he said, ‘Okay, we have this project called Final Fantasy XVI.

Star Rail's turn-based battles and JRPG leanings might be a bit of a departure from Genshin's open-world adventuring, but it's definitely, 100%, without a doubt, anime as heck. Oh, and very gacha. There's a lot of currencies. So many currencies. Still, I think it's shaping up to be a decent time.

I’ve probably waved off multiple fun secrets, mistaking them for lore I didn’t understand or a questline I haven’t gotten to. So, my pea-sized brain enjoyed this video of game designer Steve Lee interviewing the devs behind Skyrim and Fallout as they reveal some dev secrets behind those games - including a cool egg.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know we’ve been bleating on about PC system requirements lately, but the spec demands of Kerbal Space Program 2 also demand a special, visibly uncomfortable mention. This game, fresh into early access and the sequel to one that needed a mere 512GB of VRAM, lists the formidable RTX 3080 among its recommended hardware. That’s a £600-plus graphics card, and for the bare minimum of Low quality at 1080p? That’ll be either a GTX 1070 Ti or a Radeon RX 5600 XT. 


Consternation at the star-high starting specs prompted Private Division community lead Michael Loreno to pen a forum post explaining the requirements, suggesting they were subject to change as further optimisations are added and that "the game is certainly playable on machines below our min spec." Sadly, I’ve been finding that several of the most-used GPUs among Steam users – including the immensely popular GTX 1060 – are likely to face serious performance woes in KSP2’s current state.

If my need for plants were a child, it would have been born. I had a decent pot plant called James Plant back in the UK, but when I moved I bequeathed James Plant to Graham - and, now that I think about it, Graham hasn't told me how James Plant is doing, so I should probably check in on that.
I know that digital plants do not replace real plants in a physical sense - i.e. I am getting no oxygenating benefit from them - but the little plants in Garden In! make me happy. And I've just realised the name is a pun, too.

At this point in the game, roughly five hours in according to FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, Clive has little control over Ifrit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the release of Forspoken earlier this year, Square Enix has announced that the game's developer, Luminous Productions, will merge into the company. 
It's a strange announcement, given that Luminous Productions was already a studio under the Square Enix umbrella. But now, it seems that Luminous Productions as an individual entity will be no more and, thus, won't be seeing its name appear on future titles.
"The merger is part of the Company's efforts to bolster the competitive prowess of the Group's development studios, a goal set forth under its current medium-term business strategy," a press release reads. "Square Enix has developed numerous AAA high-definition (HD) games and possesses a wealth of intellectual property (IP) and content. Luminous Productions Co., Ltd. is meanwhile equipped not only with AAA title development capabilities but also technical expertise in areas such as game engine development. Combining the two entities will further enhance the Group's ability to develop HD games." 
As you can see, it's not that Luminous Productions' developers are no longer with Square Enix; it's just that the team has been merged into the wider Square Enix umbrella. As for why remains unclear. Perhaps it's the result of Forspoken's mixed reception at release, but that's speculation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are plenty of great games based on books, but I’ve never seen an adaptation as unconventional as The Forest Cathedral, a dramatic reimagining of Rachel Carson’s science book from the ‘60s, Silent Spring. Carson’s book investigated the pesticide known as DDT, its harmful environmental impacts, and the misinformation that allowed companies to indiscriminately use it. The Forest Cathedral reimagines this series of events as partly a first-person walking sim across the woods and partly a 2D platformer set inside scanning equipment. So, yeah, not exactly a one-to-one adaptation.

Since the reveal of Final Fantasy XVI in 2020, my questions about the title have continued to grow. Mind you, my questions are firmly planted in the fascination of everything surrounding this game, like how Final Fantasy XIV studio Creative Business Unit III is developing the title with Naoki Yoshida in the producer role or how former Devil May Cry 5 and Marvel vs. Capcom 2 combat designer Ryota Suzuki is the game’s lead combat director. Will FFXVI feature the storytelling prowess of FFXIV? Will its combat go full stylish action?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a few days after the one-year anniversary of Elden Ring's release, developer From Software has revealed that an expansion for the game is currently in development. 
Revealed by the official Elden Ring Twitter account, this expansion is called Shadow of the Erdtree. Not much is known about the expansion, but those familiar with the game's lore (especially those that have completed the game) might be able to piece together what this new adventure will consist of. Alongside the news, From Software has released what appears to be a piece of concept art for the expansion. 
Check it out for yourself in the tweet below: 
Rise, Tarnished, and let us walk a new path together.

February 28, 2023
This is exciting news for fans of Elden Ring, but given that From Software has only revealed the expansion is in development, with no release date or window in sight, it might be a while before our return to the Lands Between. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Elden Ring review to find out why we gave the game a 10.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh no, poor Kerbal Space Program 2. The extremely anticipated sequel to everyone’s favourite rocket-building space exploration game is a hot mess. A list of bugs longer than a Saturn V reads like a terrible medical diagnosis: quivering periapsis, unpredictable methane leakage, late-stage separation anxiety, loose payloads, non-stop burning, and sensitive nodes.
The developers, smiling bravely in circumstances presumably beyond their control, describe the launch as like dropping a kid off for their first day at school. Well the kid forgot their lunchbox, their uniform, their books and their pencil case. They showed up at the wrong school, on a Saturday during half-term. If you were stranded on a desert island and had to recreate Kerbal Space Program from memory using nothing but coconuts and string, it would look something like Kerbal Space Program 2. The game is nowhere approaching finished, it barely resembles the promotional videos, and it isn’t ready, even by Early Access standards.

This new animated series is the first collaborative production between Netflix and The Pokémon Company and features a decidedly different direction from previous animated adventures in the Pokémon universe. 
The narrative, which is told through stop-motion animation from Dwarf Studios, stars Haru. a concierge a the Pokémon Resort, and Psyduck. The stories that unfold center around her interactions with the various Pokémon that pass through the resort. 
"Netflix is looking forward to delighting fans in Japan and around the world with Pokémon Concierge, an entirely new visual and storytelling experience featuring groundbreaking stop-motion animation set in the Pokémon world in close collaboration with The Pokémon Company," vice president of Netflix content in Asia Minyoung Kim said in a press release. "We're also excited to reveal this new series on Pokémon Day and provide fans with even more things to look forward to on this special holiday celebrating the popular franchise."
Ever since spring 2020, Netflix has been the exclusive home to the Pokémon anime in the United States. While those seasons have continued the story of Ash Ketchum and Pikachu, Pokémon Concierge represents a completely new focus within the world of Pokémon.
We don't know much more about this new series, but we did receive a teaser trailer, which you can see below.]]></summary>

After he left Square Enix in 2003, Sakaguchi opened his own studio and worked on turn-based adventures like Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey - games that arguably matched his genre-defining classics - but PC gamers have been largely unable to experience them, until now. Maybe. Sakaguchi recently took part in a Q&A (reported by IGN Japan, translated by VGC) where he expressed the desire to bring his Apple Arcade exclusive Fantasian to PC.

The overarching tale, which unfolds over the course of two parts, is called "The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero." The first part, titled "The Teal Mask," begins with a school trip to the land of Kitakami, which features a big mountain with people living at the base. The Pokémon Company describes Kitakami as a "place of tranquil expanses featuring rice paddles and apple orchards." While there, the students can experience a festiv…]]></summary>

It’s also an unexpected remaster, redoing and fine-tuning everything from companion AI and facial animations to weather effects and dynamic lighting. It’s an enticing prospect for a game that never previously counted visuals as its strong suit, though there will be a catch: the Spacer’s Choice Edition will have significantly higher PC system requirements than the 2019 original.

What's happened here is: I've come away with thoughts, but they're thoughts on one of three modes that's the least useful one to have thoughts on. The other two - the bulk of the game - weren't playable. Still, what I did play was simplistic fun that valued chaos over stealth, with middling results. Unless the other two modes wrap up its action in more interesting ways, I'm unsure whether I can see Crime Boss racking up the cash when it releases next month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most RPGs set you off on some kind of grand quest, a hero's journey filled with danger and peril as you track down some legendary sword to defeat a world-ending evil. Boots Quest DX, however, has much humbler aspirations. You are a mere boot enthusiast on an adventure to find the very bestest best boots known to man (or blobs, I genuinely can't tell what provenance these rotund creatures hail from), and nothing else will deter you from achieving your lifelong goal. Find a honking great sword on the beach? Trash. A pirate's cutlass? Get in the sea, literally. If it's not a pair of boots, you're not interested - and it all makes for a brisk, anti-RPG adventure that's incredibly refreshing.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/02/24/nintendo-confirms-that-its-skipping-e3-this-year"/>
        <updated>2023-02-24T18:11:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has confirmed that it will not participate in E3 this year. This comes in the wake of a recent report stating the three console makers plan to skip the annual event entirely this year. Sony and Microsoft have yet to confirm any formal attendance. 
In a statement to IGN, Nintendo say E3 didn’t fit into its plans but will continue to support the event alongside its organizer, the ESA. 
"We approach our involvement in any event on a case-by-case basis and are always considering various ways to engage with our fans. Since this year’s E3 show didn’t fit into our plans, we have made the decision to not participate. However, we have been and continue to be a strong supporter of the ESA and E3."
Although Nintendo was the first of the three console makers to stop holding live E3 press conferences in favor of pre-recorded Direct videos, it was also the last one to have a booth on the show floor. Up until the last traditional show in 2019, Nintendo still had a large, often elaborate area filled with demos and a stage where it broadcasted its Treehouse Live stream. Xbox moved its booth out of the convention center to the Microsoft Theater next door in 2018 (though it was still part of E3); PlayStation pulled out of the event entirely in 2019 and hasn't returned. 
E3 2023 is being organized by ReedPop, the company responsible for overseeing PAX and Star Wars Celebration. It will be the first in-person show since the 2019 edition and only the second to take place since the COVID-19 pandemic started (the 2020 and 2022 shows were completely canceled, while 2021 was a virtual event). E3 runs from June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center and will have dedicated attendance days for industry and fans. The show has no exhibitor list yet, but Ubisoft recently confirmed it will attend E3 if it happens. Xbox head Phil Spencer has expressed support for E3's success but also alluded to Microsoft holding a separate event around the same time in Los Angeles.

I am saying "jank" several times upfront, not because Spacebourne 2 is particularly janky, but because it is a bit, and I want to temper your expectations so you're not unfair on its flaws if you try it after I bang on for the rest of this article about how impressive it is.
There's a dream space game we all imagined, where you pilot a ship freely around the galaxy, landing on planets and space stations and running around them doing stuff, finding things, maybe having a fight, then get back into your ship to launch into space, where you can stop at any time and do a little space walk. Maybe walk around on an asteroid, just because.
Spacebourne 2 isn't the dream. But for a game made, as far as I can tell, by one person, it is an astonishing effort to capture that spirit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“At some point," says Joel Jordan, "Animal Crossing poses the question to you with alarming force: how do you want to spend your time?”


Allow me to open with the scoundrel’s refuge that is a seemingly weighty dichotomy: I reckon there’s two really special types of indie games. Those that work wonderfully despite their smaller scope, and those that work wonderfully because of it. It’s that second kind - the particular and peculiar voyages into the miniature and mundane - that really spin wonders. Games like Unpacking, PowerWash Simulator, and Dinkum. Games humble enough in scope, and curious enough in outlook, to be uniquely capable of framing everyday experiences so that their inner oddness and strange magic - unfairly dulled by familiarity - shines. 


So, when Jordon - solo dev on the upcoming Time Bandit - brings up the question: how do you want to spend your time? I’m left pondering it for far longer than I think I otherwise would, thinking about it in context. The obvious answer here is: playing an videogame, please. But Time Bandit’s free demo doesn’t take long to make me almost uncomfortably aware that there’s more than one way to play something. I don’t even need to be anywhere near the PC. I might actually be playing it more when I’m not [X-Files music, but also I’m going somewhere with this].

In a clip pulled from Warner Bros. Discovery's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call yesterday, Warner Bros. president and CEO David Zaslav states that “...there’s lots more to come, including the highly anticipated Mortal Kombat 12 and Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, games also set for release this year with ambitious launch projections.” You can watch the clip in the embedded tweet below.

Developer Netherrealm Studios has yet to announce anything on its end. Yesterday, studio head and Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon cheekily tweeted, “so who has heard the news about Injustice 3?”  referencing the fact that for years, Netherrealm has released an Injustice game between Mortal Kombat entries, so technically, that would be next if it maintained that pattern. 
So who has heard the news about INJUSTICE 3 ?
February 23, 2023
Fans will have to wait for a flashier reveal, but a Mortal Kombat 12 launch would be huge for a year that already has Street Fighter 6 and potentially Tekken 8 on the schedule. Last October, Neththerrealm revealed Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a role-playing mobile game also slated to release this year. 
Mortal Kombat 11 launched in 2019 to positive reviews (here’s ours). A story expansion called Aftermath arrived in 2020.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom revealed three more fighters coming to Street Fighter 6's roster last night: big lad Zangief, Union Jack-wearing Cammy and newcomer Lily, a descendant of T. Hawk's famous Thunderfoot tribe. Before we talk about anything else, though, can we please just take a moment to appreciate Zangief's enormous bod? The Street Fighter wrestler was always a force to be reckoned with in earlier games, but holy heck, I bet you could fit four Marcus Fenixes into those biceps and still have room left over for his son and fellow Gears Of War slab JD. Come and see what I mean in the new trailer below.

Oh, by the way, there's a reason why all these spaceships are now empty. Well, mostly empty.

Game announcements are accompanied by million-dollar trailers, teased with reveals of reveals, and some fans tiptoe online to avoid the spoilers of a debut trailer. Meanwhile, films are often first revealed haphazardly through an excel sheet five years before they hit, or mentioned casually in an earnings call - which is exactly how Warner Bros. Discovery announced the existence of Mortal Kombat 12.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was excited to play The Settlers: New Allies. Not so much because it's the first Settlers game in thirteen years, but because the last game by developer Ubisoft Blue Byte was Anno 1800, the best city-builder this side of Cities: Skylines. With an evocative depiction of its simulated industrial revolution, including some delightfully chewy production-line wrangling, Anno 1800 was a treat, and I was keen to see what the Dusseldorf-based studio would cook up next.
The answer, unfortunately, is a big bowl of strategy gruel. I'm not sure what has gone wrong in the last five years, but Blue Byte clearly left whatever magic Anno 1800 had in the nineteenth century. The Settlers: New Allies is a dismal strategy affair, confused, anaemic, and achingly dull.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Sony State of Play included a new trailer for Street Fighter 6, which served to introduce three characters joining the roster – the last ones we should expect to join the launch game line-up.
The arrival of Zangief, the professional wrestler, comes as little surprise, since he’s been a part of the line-up for so long. He holds onto old standby moves like his Screw Piledriver, but gets some new moves on display in the trailer, like the Tundra Storm counter throw.
Likewise, it seemed only a matter of time before Cammy was revealed. We learned that the Heavy version of three of her signature moves – the Spiral Arrow, Cannon Spike, and Hooligan Combination – are being enhanced to “allow a delay which results in altered properties for some big damage,” according to a press release that went out concurrent with the trailer.
Lily is the one new addition to the fighting roster. She’s a descendant of the Thunderfoot tribe, the same cultural group that produced T. Hawk, a fighter who appeared in Super Street Fighter II. Lily’s a smaller fighter who appears to regularly speak to the spirits of nature. Her moveset includes titles like Condor Dive, Condor Spire, and Tomahawk Buster, and she pulls out war clubs to inflict damage in her attacks.
Street Fighter 6 is headed for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PC on June 2.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's that time of year again: today was Sony's first State of Play of 2023. While it showcased many indie games and an extended look at Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, the presentation started with a look at five new games coming to the recently released PlayStation VR2 headset. If you missed the live stream, here's a refresher.
  



      
												
Foglands
Described on the PlayStation Blog as a "western sci-fi roguelike," Foglands was the first game shown at the livestream today. Developed by an indie studio called Well Told, the game has you fighting monsters, grabbing loot, and trying to escape from danger before you're swallowed by the Fog. Foglands releases later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony showed a new trailer for Resident Evil 4 at the most recent State of Play live stream, and it's great. Now, the trailer is below the next paragraph, and I know you want to skip right into watching it. Which you should. However, let me give you the quick hits.
Luis is present in way more of the game now – he's shown with Leon in the minecart section (also we see the minecart section) – we get a brief look at the Krauser fight, more detailed views of combat, the late section of the game that goes full Call of Duty (which is and has always been good), some brief glimpses of Ashley's sections, and a tease for Mercenaries. Okay, the trailer is below. There's a lot more I didn't type out because you aren't reading this, and I do not blame you. Have fun, friends. The game looks great.

        <updated>2023-02-23T21:29:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accompanied by a somber cover of Radiohead’s “Karma Police,” Bungie rolled out a new look at Lightfall during today’s Sony State of Play presentation, and shared the expansion's launch trailer.
In this latest trailer, we get several new glimpses of the narrative that lies ahead in the expansion. If the trailer is any indication, we’re heading into a pretty bleak moment for the characters we’ve been following in this universe since 2014. Across the course of the trailer, we see the approach of The Witness, as it methodically seems to tear through Earth’s defenses and demoralize its defenders.
It’s no surprise that things are looking especially dire. In the long-running storyline of the Desinty universe, Lightfall is set to be the penultimate storytelling chapter of the current saga, ahead of next year’s The Final Shape. It won’t be a tremendous surprise if the events of Lightfall set up a seemingly insurmountable dilemma for humanity that can only be resolved with the story arc’s conclusion next year.
We won’t have long to wait to see the scope and direction of Lightfall’s narrative; the expansion is set to release next week, on February 28.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a touch of poetry to the way Wild Hearts carves so liberally from Monster Hunter. After all, Monster Hunter is a series about an unknown newcomer toppling ancient beasts, chopping up their best bits to create weapons and armour. Forget sleeves, Wild Hearts wears its inspirations as a complete set of clothing crafted from the bones, fur, and teeth of Capcom’s increasingly popular series. Inevitably these materials may feel lesser than the whole from which they were harvested, but they are worn proudly and with confidence nevertheless. 


Besides, as a rare challenger to Monster Hunter, Wild Hearts is clearly aware of the difficulties involved in trying to pull off something new. Perhaps this is why Omega Force’s monster battler is so welcoming to newcomers. Finally, here is a game that is willing to teach a player why this long-running genre is held in such high regard. Wild Hearts is the perfect entry point for anyone who has ever dreamed of being a Monster Hunter Liker. A bombastic, brilliant good time that’s held back by frequent, frustrating performance issues on PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know it’s a great turn in The Pale Beyond when only five of your crew are freezing, two have frostbite, and one has scurvy. After all the struggles and dangers I’ve been through trying to keep my ship’s crew alive in the bone-biting cold of the arctic tundra, that’s definitely a success in my book.
It’s easy to describe Bellular Studio’s survival sim as just ‘Frostpunk on a ship’, but in some ways that’s pretty accurate: you’re the leader of a group trying to survive in a harsh frozen wasteland. But it’s also a comparison that falls short in plenty of other ways. Sure, the engine of this survival sim might run the same as Frostpunk’s, but it’s buried deep in a handcrafted hull. With an overarching story that deals with the drama and despair of survival, together with a cast of underdog characters whose personalities and flaws fuel your determination to keep them alive, The Pale Beyond is much more human than its steampunk counterpart.

Fans were less than happy with the end result, pointing toward technical issues, randomness in the endgame, and a lack of crafting systems, which Fatshark are hoping to fix in today’s update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Breaking news: OpenTTD 13.0 is now available! Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)

        <id>https://www.scummvm.org/news/archive/#2023-02-03</id>
        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20230203/"/>
        <updated>2023-02-03T18:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Soldier Boyz
GLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)
GLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)
Obsidian
Pink Panther: Passport to Peril
Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink
Driller/Space Station Oblivion
Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
As usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!
Speaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!
