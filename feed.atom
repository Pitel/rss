        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Hero Talents being one of WoW: The War Within's main features, it's natural to want to unlock them as soon as possible. If you're jumping into new expansion now, here's everything you need to know about the process.


How to get Hero Talents in WoW: The War Within


When you enter the game with the expansion enabled, if open your Talent Tree, you'll see a third new tree in the middle of the screen. These are your Hero Talents, but they are locked until you meet two key conditions, neither of which are difficult to achieve. 


To unlock them, make sure you have The War Within purchased and have begun the new campaign questline.  The campaign takes you to the ancient lands of Khaz Algar, and you're required to go there to unlock your Hero Talent tree.

After that, all you need to do is reach level 71, and the new talents will automatically unlock. Simply questing in The War Within should provide more than enough experience to get you there. As you level up from 70 to 80, you’ll earn one Hero Talent point per level, which can only be used on the Hero Talent tree of your choice. 


Unlike previous new systems in WoW, there’s no additional questline, trigger, or condition needed to unlock these talents, which is a bit surprising. Still, by following these two straightforward steps, you’ll be able to fully enjoy the new Hero Talents. Like normal talents, Hero Talents can be respecced free of charge, so feel free to play around with and experiment with your class's new powers.

The Master System was mired in difficulties, but almost through sheer marketing, it was able to make a sizeable dent in the North American market with the Sega Genesis in 1989.


Mine was a Nintendo household growing up. But surprisingly, in my youthful days on the schoolyard, we never really argued about what was the better console between the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. I don’t know why. It just didn’t matter at my school. Besides, I was spending a lot of time on my cousin’s Genesis right around the corner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pet collectors of World of Warcraft have a relatively unique way to earn a new pet starting today. All they have to do is stream their World of Warcraft adventures to their friends in Discord. 


After 15 minutes of streaming WoW to their pals, players will be eligible to claim this pet. This promotion is running until September 8.


For those who haven't seen these before, Discord has a quest system that lets you claim rewards for certain games. It's a fancy promotional tool, but one that can let players nab unique rewards. In Discord, you can view Quests under the Discover tab; find the quest you want, and select Accept.


Once you've accepted the quest, stream World of Warcraft to at least one other person for 15 minutes. Once you're done, you can claim your reward from the quest page. In this case, it's a unique pet. Parrlok is a chunky little cyclopean ogre with a distinct sort of charm. It's a one-of-a-kind pet, as the only other like it is a recolored pet named Garrlok. That one has only been offered in the Trading Post, so there's currently no way to get it unless he cycles back in.

Parrlok isn't just for looks, though. He's a potential new member of your Battle Pet team as well. He's a humanoid with decent health stats, and comes with "Cute as a Button." It's a rare skill for Humanoid battle pets to have, increasing their dodge chance to 33% for 2 rounds. Combined with "Stoneskin," he's quite the little tank.


World of Warcraft: The War Within is available for early access now, and releases on August 26 worldwide. You can check out all of our continuing guides and coverage here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After almost two years, the sandbox adventure game Core Keeper will finally come out of Early Access. With its full launch, there are plenty of new features to behold, unraveling the secrets of the ancient Core. We're here to dig into Core Keeper 1.0's release date and unveil upcoming content.


Core Keeper 1.0 release date and features


Core Keeper 1.0 will be released on Aug. 27, 2024. This date also marks the game's official console debut, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. According to the Nintendo page, the title will also launch on the Switch on Sept. 17, 2024.


The Core Keeper 1.0 content reveal trailer confirms a new and customizable world generation feature, allowing you to explore your favorite biomes. Plus, you can try out the two new combat styles: Warlock and Mage. Explore a unique magic system that requires the power of mana and unlock additional skills for character builds. You'll also uncover a new talent tree for Magic and Summoning, which helps with attack damage and mana regeneration. 




The developer, Pugstorm, has given us the deets on Core Keeper's co-op and cross-platform availability. While online multiplayer continues to be worked upon, there are no plans for local co-op or cross-platform support. On the other hand, multiplayer will be revamped for PC crossplay as the team looks into the new PlayFab Party.


If you've played Core Keeper in Early Access, Pugstorm recommends starting a new world to make the 1.0 experience run smoothly. Any old worlds will be renamed as "Classic," indicating that it is an unsupported version for the full release. You can still access these builds afterward, but they won't include 1.0 content.

Once Core Keeper 1.0 arrives, more updates will roll out to expand the magical universe. That means you can anticipate new content and quality-of-life improvements in the near future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Liberty Falls cinematic unveils an exclusive first look at Edward Richtofen's return, bringing the Wunderwaffe along for the ride. 


The cinematic begins with a nightmarish series of events as Richtofen horrifically dreams about death and destruction. If you've been a longtime fan of the Black Ops series, you'll likely notice the familiar voice talents of Nolan North. Although his role hasn't been confirmed yet, fans are already buzzing in the comments about his return. His comeback isn't too surprising, given that North has been teasing Richtofen's comeback. 




Once Edwards wakes from the nightmare, we return to the early '90s and step into the upcoming Liberty Falls map. Like all Zombies storylines, things go haywire when a mysterious entity threatens the world. The classic Wunderwaffe makes its grand appearance here, as Richtofen uses it to electrify the undead. This sneak peek confirms at least Wonder Weapon for Black Ops 6, but there will undoubtedly be more.


As a longtime Black Ops fan, seeing Edward Richtofen through the lens of modern graphics is certainly a sight to behold. And having Nolan North voice him again makes it even more epic, bringing me back to the days when I first saw the character in Origins.


While Richtofen looks to be the "hero" of the Liberty Falls cinematic, the Terminus Team, the playable crew of Black Ops 6, think otherwise. The Terminus trailer indicates that Edward will be the main target of the BO6 Zombies saga as a plot to seek revenge. He has done plenty of wrongdoings in previous entries, so now his past is finally catching up to him. 


There's still a lot of mystery surrounding the Black Ops 6 Zombies story, but fortunately, the upcoming CoD Next event offers more insight into this. So, if you want some more Richtofen, tune into the event on Aug. 28 to get ready for BO6's Beta release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trading Posts or Trade Outposts in No Man’s Sky are present on planets in all star systems with lifeforms. They serve a variety of purposes and are a good pitstop to buy and sell items using a Galactic Trade Terminal, like the one you find in Space Stations.


However, trading posts are not useful if you need resources in bulk, as you won’t find as much quantity here as you would at a space station. However, rarer resources will be found at a Galatic Trade Terminal here, as compared to the ones on a Space Station, and for a lower price to boot.


With seven Landing Pads available, Trading Posts may serve as a decent spot to go starship-hunting and finally stumble upon an elusive S-class starship which you may have been tirelessly looking for in the game.


Image via Hello Games


You may find Trading Posts by simply exploring a planet and discovering it from a distance, but that’s down to pure luck since planets in No Man’s Sky are massive. A much simpler and more effective way is to install an Economy Scanner in your starship, which lets you access the quick menu when in the starship to find a nearby trading post on the planet.


There are other ways to find a Trading Post, but the Economy Scanner is the only guaranteed way to locate them. If you cannot build an Economy Scanner, you can use a Planetary Chart (inhabited outpost) or a Signal Booster, but both will reveal information on any kind of structure, making them a trial-and-error method.


One more sneaky suggestion: Sometimes, you may find starships in a planet’s atmosphere that are not heading out towards space. If you follow these starships, they may also lead you to a trading post.

How to do the Brotherhood in the Skolzgal Wood questline for the Sojourner of Isle of Dorn achievement


One of the steps for the Sojourner of the Isle of Dorn achievement in The War Within is to complete the Brotherhood in the Skolzgal Wood questline. Despite the Isle of Dorn being the first zone in the expansion, and accessible at Level 70, you can't actually do this quest until you are the next max Level of 80.


Once you reach Level 80, head back to the Isle of Dorn, and more specifically the Crossroads Plaza at coordinates X: 55.36, Y:55.80 and you will see an Earthen citizen named Dornogal Citizen who has the quest A Sassy Arathi. This is the start of the Brotherhood in the Skolzgal Wood questline, and how you can complete it and unlock the Sojourner of Isle of Dorn achievement.


All Brotherhood in the Skolzgal Wood quest


In total there are a dozen quests you will need to complete to fully finish the Brotherhood in the Skolzgal Wood questline for the Sojourner of the Isle of Dorn achievement. Here are all of the quests in order that you will need to complete:



A Sassy Arathi


An Oddball in Dornogal


Found Around the Unbound


The Pillage of Freywold Village


The Abductors' Obstructors


Holy Fire in Rambleshirie


A Time to Kill at the Lumber Mill


Ungirthin' the Earthen


Concealed in the Weald


A Lamplight for the Shipwright


Up to No Good Down in Silkwood


Best Friends Same Ends



Upon completing Best Friends Same Ends, you will complete the Brotherhood in the Skolzgal Wood questline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skydevilpalm has announced that the long-anticipated racing game Victory Heat Rally, finally has a release date. It will be out on PC October 3, 2024. And also mobile via the Crunchyroll Game Vault if you’re into that sort of thing.


Victory Heat Rally is a high-speed arcade racing game based on Sega’s quasi-3D super-scaler games like Power Drift. It’s also, last I checked, absolutely fantastic. I played the demo about a year ago. I came away several steps above impressed; somewhere in the realm of “enthusiastic.” It’s fast, colorful, and packed with personality.




It’s been a long time coming. It had a successful Kickstarter campaign back in 2020, but development was a bit slow. It’s a small team, and the primary developer had a child, leading to them trying to adopt a healthier work/life balance. A release window was announced for Winter 2024, so it's going to be a bit early. But what can you do? Game development can be unpredictable.


I’m happy to see its impending release. There is a complete dearth of arcade-style racing games these days. Some are arriving that cop a feel from Saturn and PS1 games. However, pre-3D racing games are among my favorite takes on the genre. I’ll be really jazzed if someone makes a new cross-country title like Rad Mobile.

As if that wasn't enticing enough, we now have confirmation that one of the prior games' protagonists is coming back: Scar!


That's right: STALKER: Clear Sky's playable character, Scar, appears not to have been zombified at the end of the original STALKER's standalone expansion pack and narrative prequel. Instead, he's quite lively in STALKER 2, as depicted in the latest trailer released by GSC Game World. Although this particular trailer won't be quite as fascinating to franchise newcomers as some of the other ones might've been, it is just the sort of thing veterans will be on the lookout for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Development in key in Madden 25's Franchise mode, and that's true for your players and staff members alike. 


Just like your players, your staff members can also be improved as the seasons progress. You can use Staff Points to unlock new abilities . Now there's plenty of options, but it's always more efficient to pinpoint your choices. This will not only save your resources, but your staff members will improve faster. 


Best coach abilities to unlock in Madden 25


It's important to first note that all abilities have specific use-scenario. No ability that you unlock after an upgrade will be useless, but some are just better than the remaining ones. 


Ability
Effect




Secret Stuff
Decreases the time required to heal multi-week injuries


After School Tutoring
Access additional focus player for weekly strategy


Steady Hands
Increased XP gamins for WRs in training


The Final Piece
All players count as scheme fits in training


Iron Nerves (OC)
Boost QB's ability to throw under pressure


On Line One (Player Personnel)
Guaranteed trade package for current user pick during draft


Quite the Sales Pitch (Player Personnel)
Non X-Factor players will be valued at higher development trait than actual


Scheme Fits (Player Personnel)
Free agents who fit team schemes will have increased interest to sign for your team






Most of the head coaches will already have some nodes either fully unlocked or requiring partial upgrades. In my save with the Houston Texans, both the Offensive and Defensive coordinators come with practically clean slates. Hence, they're the ones who will require more upgrades and Staff Points.


Do note that even some of the relatively basic abilities can be very useful. Some of them have two or three tiers which will make them even more efficient.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Catch 'em all, all the time.
By this point, auto-catchers aren't new to the Pokémon GO community. These generally pocket-sized devices catch 'mon and spin PokéStops while your mind is on other things, leaving you to focus on the Battles, upgrades, and Raids whenever you return to the app.
Niantic has its own range of companion devices like the catchily-named Pokémon GO Plus+, but the third-party market is huge, with each developer working to add another gimmick to make its product the very best (like no one ever was).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the best things about Fields of Mistria is the fact that you’re never short of something to do, a new challenge, or something to find. One of the things you’re going to be collecting a lot of while exploring is Bugs, and none are more rare than the five Legendary Bugs. 


As with Legendary Fish, there is a specific Legendary Bug which spawns in each season. As well as this, there’s one Legendary Bug which can spawn during Spring, Summer, or Fall, although that doesn’t make it easier to find. 


Advice for catching Bugs in Fields of Mistria


Unlike with Fish, Bugs don’t tend to have specific locations where they spawn. They can show up pretty much anywhere in the overworld of Mistria and you need to keep your eye out for them during times when their spawning conditions are met.

They each work a little differently, so it's important to know your odds to avoid disappointment. Here’s an overview of all event banner types in Genshin Impact and their rules.


In addition to event banners, Genshin Impact also has a permanent standard banner. This doesn’t rotate, but it occasionally receives additions to its prize pool. If you're new to Genshin Impact's gacha system, you might want to start by learning about the standard banner.


Genshin Impact pull currencies


All event banners use pink/blue Intertwined Fates as their pull currency. One Intertwined Fate equals one pull on any of the event banners. You can also use Primogems to pull on event banners, either by converting them …]]></summary>

How to beat the Yellow Wind Sage in Black Myth: Wukong


To start off, it’s highly recommended to complete the Drunken Pig’s quest. At the end of it, you’ll be rewarded with the Wind Tamer Vessel. It can replace the Fireproof Mantle that was obtained from the previous chapter.

Playtonic Friends and SkyDevilPalm's retro-style racer Victory Heat Rally was originally set to launch simultaneously on PC, Switch and mobile this winter, but, in a new statement from the publisher, it looks like that is no longer the case. While the game will be coming to PC and mobile (via Crunchyroll Game Vault) on 3rd October, the Switch version will now follow "at a later date".
According to the statement, the Switch delay came about due to "some unforeseen difficulties with development", though the publisher promises that a Switch announcement is "not far behind", so keep those engines running.

Pilestedt left his former position as the CEO to take up a more hands-on approach to developing Helldivers 2 as the new CCO. While the game hasn't really made good on all of its promises from that point onwards, Pilestedt has remained one of the community's favorite Arrowhead developers due to his penchant for discussing upcoming content and explaining the reasoning for why Helldivers 2 is going in the direction it's been going.

Even if you do really like it, it's certainly a far cry from what Todd Howard (and, indeed, Bethesda on the whole) was pushing for in terms of the next big thing from the Skyrim studio.


However, the team is sticking with it, and the first major DLC for the game is coming soon. Shattered Space  (which launches September 30) will have a shorter, more focused narrative, while also leaning towards a horror vibe and, according to a recent post from Xbox Wire, it'll be akin to "classic Bethesda."




While we should always be cautious when it comes to marketing hype, it's been suggested that the DLC will be more in line with the likes of the expansions for E…]]></summary>

All thanks to the efforts of the Aleph One team, we now get to enjoy classic Marathon without any fuss.


Whereas Marathon and Marathon 2: Durandal at least pretended to be simple, straightforward run-and-gun shooters at face value, Marathon Infinity throws any pretense of common sense right out the window with its ridiculously broad, time-hopping main narrative. It's phenomenally weird, and now that Infinity is properly available on Steam, you, too, get to try to make sense of the game's hard-hitting final screen. It's an absolute hoot, I promise you that.

Trailered this week at Gamescom 2024, it's the fifth installment in the hitherto mobile-focussed Nikki series and it's seemingly going down a storm, with over 12 million pre-registrations so far (albeit, many of them motivated by the prospect of collectively unlocked in-game bonuses). It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns. Here's that trailer.

That discussion was back on my mind as I sat down to play Reignbreaker, a new action-roguelike from Studio Fizbin, at Gamescom 2024 – slightly wary of its self-described medievalpunk styling. However! Turns out you’re trying to kill the queen. Yep, that’s, uh, that’s pretty punk.

Who remembers MySims? The spin-off to Maxis' hugely popular The Sims series, MySims saw you play as a cute little avatar attempting to restore and redevelop a run-down town. It launched on Wii and DS in 2007 before making the jump to PC and phones the following year.
Well, it sounds like MySims could be making a comeback. Spotted by ResetEra user --R (via GamingLeaksAndRumours subreddit), listings for a Switch version of the game have appeared on European retailers Virtex and World of Games along with a 19th November 2024 release date.

Nintendo is ramping up the marketing for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom ahead of its 26th September launch. The latest teaser serves as a whistle-stop tour of the Faron Wetlands region, giving us a closer look at the new location.
You might remember this region making an appearance in Nintendo's earlier 'Traversing Hyrule' trailer, where we learnt that the area was home to some hungry Deku Scrubs — though that was about all we saw. Today's look (shared to Twitter by @NintendoUK) doesn't contain any new information, per se, but it does give a closer look at the environment and some new footage of the beasties we can expect to find there.

Now, I might have to start again, even if going out of my way to grab the tapes added in its developer's commentary mode is going to be extra tricky. Ah, but will being able to chuck the recorders at my enemies for a point of knockback afterwards make up for it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my formative video game moments is the final mission of Psygnosis cyberpunk flight sim G-Police. (It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - "metaphor" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.
The technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins all have one thing in common: they've got a Discovery mode, which replaces murdering with learning. You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh "Friar Tuck" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).
This is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.

We've heard of some fun development stories over the years, but we think this might be one of the best ones yet — Nintendo created an internal social media-like platform to help streamline development on the absolutely massive The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. (Thanks, GamesRadar!).
Speaking at the Computer Entertainment Development Conference in Japan (via GameWatch, translated by Automaton) director Hidemaro Fujibayashi and engineer Kenichi Hirose spent a portion of their presentation of the production flow for Tears of the Kingdom. And during this section, the pair spoke about the "Rupee Bulletin Board", where Rupees were used in place of likes.

The square brackets are part of the title, yes, and they're also calling it "punk rock" - a combination of factors that fills me with a rage so obliterating, I can barely perceive the announcement trailer, below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another Switch-dominated week.
Famitsu has shared the latest physical gaming charts from Japan, this time comprising the last two weeks and it has been yet another monster one for the Switch.
The Japan-only Powerful Pro Baseball 2024-25 knocks it out of the park once again, staying at the top of the pile with an additional 32,372 copies sold. It's mostly familiar faces elsewhere, with the likes of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Nintendo Switch Sports padding out the top 10, but That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime ISEKAI Chronicles makes its debut at number four with a perfectly respectable 21,270 sales.

If a park sim based on Tim Burton’s 1996 B-Movie homage Mars Attacks wasn’t on my bingo card, it’s because I’ve recently binned it and replaced it with a bobble head that simply nods in amused acceptance at whatever videogames decide to do next. And conceptually, Jurassic World Evolution with captive humans instead of dinos isn’t not a potential winner, is it? Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that Mars Attracts, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game. But then I realised that I’d never thought to check before, which might go some way to explaining the lack of them. Do you reckon they did the pun then worked backwards from there? Respectable, honestly.

Even almost 14 years after it was first released, it still hasn’t really set in that Deus Ex creator Warren Spector’s first game after a six-year break was not only a Mickey Mouse platformer, but one exclusively made for the Nintendo Wii after years of being a PC-only developer. To make matters even wilder, it was a pseudo-edgy re-imagining of decades of Disney iconography with forgotten mascot Oswald the Lucky Rabbit as a central antagonist.
And yet Epic Mickey happened, and what’s perhaps even more unbelievable, given the complications of re-releasing licensed games, is that 14 years on we’d be getting a remade version of the game. But, following the remake of the certified banger Spongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom, Purple Lamp is taking the helm of an updated edition of Mickey Mouse’s Wii adventure.

My turn to puff out my cheeks and look not angry, just disappointed: why haven't we covered The Stone Of Madness prior to the below Gamescom 2024 story trailer? I mean, it's only a real-time tactical stealth game set in a cursed 18th century Jesuit monastery, developed by the people behind gorgeously gross metroidvania Blasphemous. It's only got isometric art inspired by Goya and a sanity/trauma system redolent of Darkest Dungeon. Sounds like an automatic RPS write-up to me.

Well, some of the minds behind Unravel are working on new game called Hela. This time it's less about yarn and more about being a small mouse who does parkour. Still, it does retain some of the bodily gymnastics of its predecessor. Namely the use of tongues as bungee ropes.

Tripwire Interactive and Blasphemous developer The Game Kitchen have revealed The Stone of Madness, a new tactical stealth adventure for Switch set in 18th century Spain.
Launching early 2025, the game focuses on the lives of 'five forsaken inmates', who must work together to escape the confines of a monastery that is said to be both a prison and a madhouse. United to overcome corruption, violence, and the threat of their own fears, the five characters will need to solve puzzles, obtain clues, and work to maintain their sanity.

Whether plundering the earth in SteamWorld Dig 2 or mucking about with magic in SteamWorld Quest, these are solid and approachable adventures that enthusiastically embrace whatever theme the developers have decided upon. Cowboys? Sure. Wizards? Why not. It barely matters, as long as it results in some good puns. As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders.

The Shattered Space expansion, out on September 30th, probably won’t refurbish the RPG’s reputation as an overall miss – but it does ditch the proc-gen planet bloat for a single handcrafted hellhole, a true Bethesda speciality honed by years of Fallouts and Elder Scrollseses. And, if its - sadly hands-off - Gamescom showcase is any indication, it might just double down on Starfield’s own strengths as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[StrangeRPG Things.
Publisher Twin Sails Interactive popped up at last night's Future Games Show to reveal that the gorgeous Persona-inspired turn-based JRPG Bloomtown: A Different Story will be adventuring onto Switch on 24th September.
Developed by Lazy Bear Games and Different Sense Games, Bloomtown looks like a perfectly cosy affair on the surface. You get to explore a slice of 1960s Americana, make friends, do a light bit of farming — it's all very sweet. But there's a darker side to the idyllic Bloomtown (literally), with a world of demons and other nasties growing beneath the surface, snatching the town's children.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve apparently never written about Atomfall, an oversight I’m now all too happy to correct, having played a promising forty minutes or so at Gamescom 2024. In development at Sniper Elite makers Rebellion, it’s a "survival-action game inspired by real-life events" – specifically the Windscale fire, which in 1957 coated much of northern England in radioactive fallout. Atomfall’s alternative history makes Britain’s worst nuclear disaster even more disastrous, plunging the realm into full-on post-apocalyptica and leaving your good amnesiac self to dodge death with nothing but a cricket bat and whatever you can scrounge out of sheds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never really understood the charm of ultrawide monitors. I dare boldly to maintain that there is such a thing as Too Wide, a point beyond which the extra visual estate becomes a waste of electricity, unless you watch the screen in pairs. I can only assume people who use ultrawide monitors live in constant terror of flanking manoeuvres and demand the maximum amount of peripheral vision. Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.
If you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable "cinematic aspect ratios" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view. It's one of several PC-specific flourishes they've just blogged about. Have a look.

In this case, it's the demo for Cupiclaw, which is possibly the first ever "roguelike deckbuilding claw machine game". You know how Balatro made you feel about Joker cards? Well, this game wants to make you feel the same about claw machines. It's a terrible turn of events, frankly. I'm sorry for inflicting yet another potential bingeplay upon you. Here's a trailer.

Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.
Tips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now, I never played quite as much as our Brendy did of the original Splitgate. But I had a fun time with its mixture of Halo-esque trigger pulling and portalling around! So I was intrigued to give the alpha version of Splitgate 2 a go and see if it had a little more substance to it than its initial reveal, which gave off a, "it's Splitgate but with more money" feel. 
Well, I think it's… a bit serious? It certainly has more polish and some extra additions, yet I didn't come away from it thrilled by its more competitive, class-based FPS leanings. I think it just needs a bit more time, perhaps, for a portal to open and some silly rocket launchers and baseball bats and zombies to come tumbling out of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arc Raiders was announced back in 2021 as a free-to-play co-op third-person shooter, and has been delayed several times since. That's partly because Embark Studios' other in-development game, The Finals, progressed faster than planned and stole its momentum. It's also because it was re-tooled at some point as a PvPvE extraction shooter.

Now it's back again, aiming for release next year, and it's been re-tooled a little more: it's no longer free-to-play.

You know, something to really convey the flow of the game, rather than the admittedly impressive but nonetheless very fragmented snippets we’ve gotten so far. Now to sit back and…oh, wait. Hang on. It’s just actor Troy Baker telling me about all the great acting he’ll be doing. It is great, by the way. He’s doing a fantastic job. Maybe just, you know, a crumb of acknowledgement or elucidation over the whole ‘interactivity’ part?
Anyway, don’t mind me. I’m just an old fool who likes to press buttons. And, to be fair, it's not like Machinegames don't have a great track record. Anyway, here’s some good news: The game releases December 9th this year. Have a release date trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Little Nightmares DNA runs strong in Tarsier Studios’ new game. So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.
It’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.

It's called Herdling and it's nothing to do with sailing across a decaying universe, but very much to do with alpine expeditions and friendly beasts. Very unexpected.

So that'd be a bit like Alien and a bit like The Thing, then. Sorry, human colonists!
Directive 8020 was teased at the end of the last Dark Pictures instalment, 2022's The Devil in Me. A trailer also leaked back in November 2022. Now, we have an official announcement video.

"To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the Dying Light 2 Stay Human Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC." That's nice! 
This seems like an odd one. I’m only tangentially familiar with the Dying Light games, but I was under the impression that the model here was releasing a single game, then updating and expanding it for years. Whether standalone adventure Dying Light: The Beast represents an attempt to course correct after Dying Light 2’s mixed reception, then, I’m not entirely sure. But if nothing else, it does share something in common with all the other adverts at Gamescom tonight: it is a game that exists, and will presumably be playable at some point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision have just screened an abbreviated video of Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 campaign level “Most Wanted”, in which you and a buddy infiltrate a US fundraiser to save returning character Adler from Bad Dudes. Good news, people who like Call Of Duty: this looks like Call Of Duty. It’s got a homing knife, an exploding remote-controlled car and a big chap in full face armour with an overcompensatory minigun. Catch the full video below.

That's lovely. Thanks videogames.  And if - as we surely must - we judge the eagerness of these adverts to spend time with us by how quickly they appear on our screens, then FPS sequel Borderlands 4 surely loves us the most.
Do we love it back? Who knows. But it does exist, and it isn’t using a subtitle. That’s got to count for something, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced at this year's Geoffcom, RoadCraft is a new game courtesy of the vehicular bods behind MudRunner and SnowRunner. This means it's very much a simulation game where you're fighting terrain with tyres, except this time you aren't just driving about, but managing a fleet of machines to carry out heavy construction work. Think a mixture of logistics, cars, cranes, and paving some lovely new roads from a once dilapidated junk heap.

You could make the same argument at the opposite end of spectrum, of course. Cosy games seem locked in a perpetual arms-race to twee each other into the dirt, chopping their rival’s dog-petting hands off and taking a sparkly tinkle on their pastel corpses. But hand-drawn RPG Heroes Of The Seven Islands feels more authentic than all that. It’s bedroom antifolk by way of chill dungeon synth, by way of an antelope sorcerer named Jean-Pierre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our Black Myth: Wukong review hails the game as "a generous Soulsy adventure hybrid that works within its limitations and delivers a beautiful challenge to be unpicked with a magical toolbox". Reviewer Edders went so far as to find the world more engaging than that of Elden Ring - proper defying-the-gods level rhetoric. Players seem to agree. The game launched last night, and has already accrued a concurrent player peak of 1.44 million - Steam's fourth highest ever, exceeded only by Counter-Strike, Palworld and PUBG. By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.
All that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other "content creators" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of "trigger words" like "Covid-19", no talk of "politics" or "feminist propaganda", and no mention of "China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc".

Magically, it’s also a tactics game for people who love them like nothing else. It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.

They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.
According to director Hiroshi Takai, it was "impossible" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no "existential risk" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

In my testing the past several weeks these professional graphics cards have been working out with NVIDIA's Linux driver stack -- including their open-source kernel modules now the default with the R555 driver series and later. While there is that previous article looking at how their open-source kernel drivers are at parity to the former proprietary kernel modules, today's article is looking at how the NVIDIA RTX 2000/4000 Ada Generation performance stacks up against the AMD Radeon Pro competition.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill has a messy, up-is-down relationship with time and history, so let's go about this hands-on with the Silent Hill 2 Remake in a messy, up-is-down way. Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative "Unreal Engine 5" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.
It begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve likely mentioned hitting Lovecraft fatigue so often that it’s now evolved into a second phase of Lovecraft-fatigue fatigue. This is not the same as Lovecraft refreshment, no matter how much I might want to return to the days before old one plushies and Cthulhu children’s books terrorised the internet en masse. There’s not quite enough information about “story generator” sim Marry a Deep One: Innsmouth Simulator for me to confidently say it’ll cut through my exhaustion with all things tentacular and horrifically be-gilled. But it is beguiling, isn’t it? There’s all sorts of little widgets and details shown off that remind me of everything from Sid Meier’s Pirates to classic adventure games, and maybe even a little Rimworld? It’s a heady soup, although one I’d recommend against quaffing, given where the water comes from.

Twitchy slashfest Dead Cells received its final major update, introducing new enemies, fresh weapons, and a few mutations. Unfortunately, all this new stuff is very cursed. In other words, it all toys with the game's "curse" status effect, a hex that causes you to be killed if you take even a single hit. You'll probably die a few times as a result of this update, which in some ways is a fitting finalé for this fast-paced jar smasher of a game. You can see the new features in the trailer below.

The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.
Still, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it.

You can see where this is going. Trombone Champ: Unflattened transports that 2022 tooting into 2024 virtual reality.

The complaint followed the familiar 'repeat infringer' format, with damages for works in suit worth over a billion dollars and everything on the line. A joint filing this week reveals that the lawsuit has been dismissed with prejudice, never to see the light of day again.

We had moderately high hopes for it before the early access release - I personally enjoy the fairytale setting, with its pop-up Pucks and magic umbrellas, but I also think I've raised enough hovels on procedurally generated maps for one lifetime. Still, I'd quite like it to come good, if only so I can justify op-eds about Lewis Carroll, and I'm somewhat encouraged by what I've heard of the game's forthcoming Realms Rebuilt update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black Myth: Wukong is an action RPG that leans a bit into the Souls camp and a bit into the adventure camp. And either way, it's a spectacular journey that works for mostly everyone: those after challenging fights against Chinese mythological creatures, and those after the same thing, but with a little less challenge than your typical Soulslikes. What separates Black Myth from the crowd, though, is its slick presentation and a sense of generosity. You're to witness the most lavish, cinematic worlds and its creatures. And you're to enjoy battering everything with your staff as a highly athletic monkey with copious spells at his furry follicles and fingertips. It's been a while since I've played anything quite as impressive as this.

The strategy game’s 5.2 update is on the horizon, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the team teased in June. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC. They’re also focused right where Immortal Empires needs them the most: depth, rather than width. In the dawi’s case, quite literally.

Both the stakes and the poly count were low. Happy news then, that it is getting a snowy sequel.

Last time I checked in, it was school trips to other dimensions. Now, it's Cosmic Storms. Due for release alongside the Stellaris 3.13 Vela update on September 10th, these are a paid "mechanical expansion" (priced at a rather chunky £11, $13 or €13, and available as part of the current season pass) that builds upon the game's existing Space Storms, "providing a deeper experience with strategically meaningful gameplay and beautiful upgraded visuals". Wash that down with new civics, precursor narratives, anomalies, archaeology sites, techs, edicts, a new Ascension perk, and new galactic community resolutions.

Some readers characterised this as a familiar species of cultural hypocrisy regarding video games - emphasising violence is A-OK, but for the love of god, don't mention sex. Good news, those people: Dread XP's latest horror signing The Lacerator has both. It casts you as hirsute 1980s porn star Max - surname not given in press release, but presumably something like Jackin' or Girth - who has been abducted by a large scary individual called the Lacerator.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over 2000 hours spent in various factory games makes me a bit of a purist, I suppose. In theory, I should then be the ideal reviewer to enjoy Shapez 2. But I'm also the ideal reviewer to tear it apart over the most minor hiccups and defects. I'm the Anton Ego of factory games. I don't like food, I love it. If I don't love it, I don't swallow.
Ah, you needn't worry. This is by far the most fun I've had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I've never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life. But 40 hours into my save file, I've often found myself yearning for a bit more creativity in the challenges, a few more curveballs sent in my direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s an oddly Halloweeny summer week for games, this one. Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s October 31st release date leaked earlier, Steam have put together a Summer Fright Night bundle featuring RPS fave Hauntii, and I’ve got a strange urge to gorge on Haribo and mini Double Deckers until blood comes out of my eyeballs. What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.
The idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.

The new system, which will be enabled by default but can be toggled off, aims to “help potential players make informed decisions about the games they are considering purchasing by understanding the attributes of the game that other players like or don't like.” Ah, so a sort of ‘review’, if you will.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the unlikely event that there's anyone left in the UK who hasn't been completely desensitized to the perils of IPTV, here's another case to strain the nerves. After being raided five years ago, two brothers from Ilford in Essex have been sentenced to prison. Whether both will actually see the inside of a cell is unclear; one turned up to face the music, the other failed to appear. The reason for his absence is unknown and just the start of a long list of other unanswered questions.

Today is their day. We have lined up these racing games on a starting grid and are interested to see how things shake out. Will the realism-obsessed driving sims take the lead with their sublime physics engines? Might the futuristic combat racers simply destroy the opposition with explosive rockets? Or perhaps a nippy arcade crowd-pleaser will soar to the finish line, propelled by the sound of roaring cheers. It's all to play for here at our incredibly messed-up grand prix with a worrying lack of rules or regulation. Start your engines, everyone, these are the 11 best racing games on PC. 3! 2! 1! ...

If you never watched the Adam and Joe show, they used to do home movie recreations of famous films like Titanic and Saving Private Ryan using stuffed animals and action figures. I found these "Toymovies" hysterical as a kid - I suspect they are less so now. Probably, they are full of jokes we might tentatively class as "of their time". The point is, Reptilian Rising is sort of Toymovie: The Game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Crimson Diamond is a proper old-school style puzzle adventure. It's 2D pixel art, with a limited colour palette as in EGA games, and you control it with a text parser, like King's Quest or one of them other Sierra adventures old men like Graham remember. It's important to mention this up front because it's very possible that, despite The Crimson Diamond's tale of betrayal, murder, and mineral rights in 1914 Canada, the text parser element will be a Rubicon you instantly can't be arsed to cross. A not unreasonable stance - though I think the text parser in The Crimson Diamond is fantastic. Such beef that I have with this adventure game is down to the specificity required to solve some of the puzzles.

The titular arena is a large room in which you, a large man, bash a large amount of enemies. You have to punch a gong between waves to trigger the next, and this struck me as a nice pre-emptive nudge that every problem you face in Kiborg can be solved by rapidly moving your fist towards offending objects, which turned out not to be too far off the mark.

Since then, we've heard nary a peep about it, with developers Obsidian focusing on Pillars Of Eternity successor Avowed and their ace survival game Grounded, which left early access in September 2022. According to Obsidian's studio head Feargus Urquhart, the project is rubbing along nicely. But it was not ever thus: during the opening years of the Covid pandemic, there was apparently "talk of 'do we stop Outer Worlds 2 and just throw the whole team on Avowed'."

The Deck’s long-promised dual booting capability, on the other hand, sounds further down the to-do list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been looking grim for Super Earth recently. I mean, not really. Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.
“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns," reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.
Whether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.

Back when I was OXM's online editor, "free Xbox games" was one of our golden Google pillars, the other two being "Minecraft Xbox 360 update" and "Skyrim something something". Well, uncle Valve has just rudely torpedoed that ancient investigative initiative by adding a Trending Free tab to the Steam frontpage, encompassing prologues, demos, free-to-play games and that most treasured of jewels, a full free game with no monetisation elements, such as Grimhook.
Do not cry for us pitiful electronic scribblers, crowded on our melting internet icebergs. Play free games instead! Thanks to that new tab, I've just discovered a demo for neato wide-format tower defender Frontline Crisis. Hah, that'll keep the awareness of steady livelihood erosion at bay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aside from being a game where you run around a shopping mall murdering the living dead, the original Dead Rising from 2006 is a clownish satire of sleazy tabloid photojournalism. It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn "Prestige points" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: "Brutal" scenes of characters being slain; moments of "Horror", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical "Outtakes", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of "Drama", such as people reacting to discoveries; and "Erotic" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.
The Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't "a response to a changing cultural climate", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not "an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck’s competitors, whether they’re the old guard Ayaneo family, the luxe Asus ROG Ally X, or the shapeshifting Lenovo Legion Go, usually share the same attack line: they can play more of your games. The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.
Unless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.
