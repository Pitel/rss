        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Normally we see a straight doubling in RAM module sizes. Around the turn of the millenium, 1GB sticks were commonplace, and by doubling that amount over time we've gradually worked our way up to 8GB, 16GB and 32GB sticks of DDR4 and DDR5 being common sizes. Now though, DDR5 manufacturers are also producing an intermediate 24GB size, allowing for 48GB kits of two sticks each.
This new capacity requires a BIOS update for most motherboards, but pricing on it can be quite good - and that's what we're seeing today, with extremely rapid DDR5-6400 CL36 RAM available in a 48GB capacity for $130 after a $18 price drop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes I open with "I hate x" because it's funny (and I'm right), but sometimes it's because I'm not sure if that's the source of my mixed feelings about a game. Verne Colon The Shape Of Fantasy is, at least in part, an adventure game, and weaker for it. Taken as 'pure' interactive fiction, it'd be shorter and simpler, but might allow its premise, atmosphere, and intriguing world to shine the way they ought to.


The premise actually takes some explaining. Jules Verne himself takes the place of Aronnax, the protagonist of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Seas, and instead of mere hermitry, his new submarine home/prison is devoted to a guerrilla war against The Nation, a Prussian-ish empire you might be able to stop using a techno-magical gubbins that allows you to edit reality. Intriguing, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gunbrella is exactly what it sounds like; you shoot enemies with a gun that’s also an umbrella. It’s the second action title from Gato Roboto developer Donksoft and we now know it’s coming on September 13. 
A new trailer provides a new look at Gunbrella’s explosive, retro-inspired action. Players control a woodsman seeking revenge for the death of his wife, with players using their weaponized umbrella to blast apart foes or as a platforming tool. For example, you can use the umbrella to glide, swing, or slide around levels, among other uses.


We went hands-on with Gunbrella’s Steam demo and walked away impressed. You can watch us give it a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today. 
Gunbrella will be available on Switch and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thank the Gods of Silence; you can mute those talking flowers in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. That damned “onward and upward” that one spews at Mario is locked in a very painful spot in my mind. It’s like having a grain of sand between the folds of brain, slowly aggravating everything around it in small but significant ways.
Thankfully, Nintendo’s own Japanese blog has shared a screenshot that reveals a setting specifically for the “Talking Flower Voice.” While it doesn’t specifically say what settings are available, I’m going to assume that if there is a setting for “voice,” then there is likely one for “no voice.”
What’s funny about Nintendo’s post is that it seems to assume that people are going to want the flowers to talk to incessantly spew their insipid hints in their sharply saccharine voices. They suggest that their voices will make a lively adventure even more lively.
[caption id="attachment_401076" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Nintendo[/caption]
Listen, Nintendo. I don’t know how to describe it, but these talking flowers have very punchable voices. They talk like a dude who is trying to impress a single mother by talking to her child. Their voices drip with cartoonish insincerity that makes me want to ruin their day by telling them the saddest story in my arsenal. If someone stepped out of a cafe and spoke to me in that voice, I would intentionally spill their drink on them, snatch the donut from their hands, and consume it right in front of them.
So, thankfully, you can turn it off.
Super Mario Bros. Wonder is coming to Switch on October 10, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week I attended a hands-off preview for Owlcat's forthcoming CRPG Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, which is shaping up nicely, inasmuch as there's anything "nice" about a Warhammer 40,000 game. Rogue Trader is a party-based affair in which you play a sort of Warhammer East Indies Company, tasked with flipping outlying worlds to the Imperium. In order to carry out this goal, you're granted a lot more individual license than most human residents of the 40K universe. You can, for instance, recruit ungodly xenos to your grimdark troupe, operate a private armada, and even colonise planets and turn them into your own personal piggybank. Just watch you don't push the whole "heresy" thing too far.


I'll have more for you on the subject soonish, but here's an interesting advance snippet from my interview with Owlcat's creative director Alexander Mishulin, in which we discussed what really distinguishes a CRPG from other kinds of role-playing game. According to Mishulin, it's all about designing for choices with consequences that genuinely run the entire length of the game, without (somehow) getting lost in the narrative undergrowth.

BG3 player GoldenThane has made the rounds a few times now, showing off a strategy that's let them one-shot some beefy bosses with the power of money. Where some players have fought tooth-and-nail to Eldritch Blast their way to victory, GoldenThane has devised a means of using one weapon's special action and a whole boatload of cash to annihilate some of Baldur's Gate 3's toughest bosses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gotta go back in time
Futurlab has announced a new crossover endeavor for the instant classic PowerWash Simulator. This time, you’ll be tasked with cleaning the grime off of the ‘80s hit movie Back to the Future.
After finally clawing its way out of the muck of Early Access in 2022, PowerWash Simulator has crossed over with a number of properties. This includes games like Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy VII remake and, most recently, Spongebob Squarepants. There’s even a Warhammer 40K crossover lined up.
Released in 1985, Back to the Future is one of the most recognizable ‘80s movies. It involves teenager Marty McFly being stranded in the distant past year of 1955. If you want to see anyone over 30 fall to pieces, just remind them that if Back to the Future was made today, Marty would travel back to 1993. Hold on, I… I need to sit down for a second.
https://youtu.be/AWWr1MrrjtA?feature=shared
The Back to the Future DLC will include “Doc Brown’s van, the Time Machine, Hill Valley Clocktower, the Holomax Theatre, and Doc’s Time Train. Plus, there are ten new achievements to collect in-game.” Damn, I was kind of hoping to hose off a J.C. Penney sign.
In any case, the Back to the Future DLC will arrive for PowerWash Simulator sometime in 2023. The bad news is that it will cost money. Specifically, you’ll need $7.99 USD for the privilege of cleaning off the DeLorean. That’s not something I expected to be writing today.

        <updated>2023-09-01T15:10:25.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not long ago, we spoke about rumors of a new handheld gaming PC from Lenovo that could potentially best Valve's Steam Deck. Well, it turns out the Legion GO is actually happening, and it's coming out at the end of October.
In a recent report from GamesRadar+, The upcoming Lenovo machine will be launching this Halloween (literally October 31) and judging from the hardware, it could topple the Steam Deck. However, as always with these more premium gaming devices, there's the price to consider.
https://youtu.be/BLD-dg1C_XU
According to the report, the Legion GO will set you back $799. But hopefully, that extra dosh will be going towards something that can rival the best mobile gaming PCs around.
What's under the hood?
While it will sport 16GB of RAM, similar to the Steam Deck, the overall hardware of the Legion GO looks a little more impressive. For example, the former boasts an AMD RDNA 2 graphics chip, but the latter will utilize the more up-to-date RDNA 3. The GO also comes with 512GB of storage and an SD slot that can hold up to 2TB. Again, similar to the Deck, but that's only if you pay for the more expensive version of Valve's device.
Lenovo's machine will run on Windows 11 as opposed to it being a Linux-based system. It's up to you to decide whether a mobile PC using Windows is a good thing or not, but at least you can be more confident that games will be compatible out of the box.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you thought Diablo 4 would be a nail in the coffin for its mobile-focused counterpart Diablo Immortal, think again. In an interview with RPS, Diablo 4 executive producer Rod Fergusson explains that the popularity of Diablo Immortal has only increased since the release of DIablo 4.
"One of the things that we were kind of nervous about initially was that when Diablo 4 landed it would sort of cannibalise Immortal, and that everyone was just going to be, 'Oh we're just playing Immortal until Diablo 4 comes out'," Fergusson told RPS at Gamescom. "In fact, it was the opposite. With each beta we did for Diablo 4, the more people started playing Immortal. Then once D4 launched, the same thing. Immortal continues to be successful, so we found that because that idea of playing on my couch in my living room or at my desk vs I'm playing on my phone in the car or while I'm waiting for my coffee or whatever, there was a place for both games to co-exist and they co-exist well.""

The first part of this isn't much of a surprise. It makes sense that players hyped for D4 would be looking to play a similar title as the release approached. But what is shocking is that even after its launch, the popularity of Immortal has continued to increase.
Are players happy with Immortal or unhappy with Diablo 4?
Personally, Immortal was way too gimmicky and cash-grabby for me. That being said, it's hard to argue that gameplay-wise it felt better than I had expected for a mobile title.
Immortal also recently released the first new class in the Diablo franchise in over a decade. I have to admit, the class looks fun and unique, so part of the uptick in players for Immortal is people trying the new class.
In all fairness though, this may be more attributed to players current unhappiness with the state of Diablo 4. Hopefully, we continue seeing improvements with D4 with Season 2, Season of Blood, which starts on October 17.

It's a shame that Capcom hasn't figured out how to do that yet, but in the meantime, the 1993 original still holds up.

It's incredible how often Mega Man X comes up in regular conversations with my peers (you're talking about retro platformers all the time too, right?).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield modding has already begun. If you thought the PC community was going to rest on its laurels and just play the vanilla release (the very idea!), think again. Some people have been waiting in the wings for this day, and now we can enjoy the start of something quite special.
A quick look on Nexus Mods reveals that the Starfield community is already hard at work. At the time of writing, there are currently 59 mods for the game. Bear in mind, Bethesda's brand-new title hasn't fully released yet, only becoming available to Premium Edition purchasers very recently.
[caption id="attachment_400970" align="aligncenter" width="640"] Image via FrancisLouis/Nexus Mods.[/caption]
At the moment, there isn't anything new in terms of fan-made content. But you'll find an array of tweaks (mostly of a graphical nature), translations, and new menu backgrounds.
If you build it, they will mod
For example, user Scottyus1 has released a Starfield reshade mod, which "adds more detail to the world making all them textures pop and stand out more," while FrancisLouis goes the opposite direction and makes the game "potato" quality, with PS1-style visuals.
Probably one of the most impressive mods so far comes from LukeFZ. They've managed to make it possible to replace AMD's upscaling tech (FSR2) for Nvidia's DLSS or even Intel's XeSS. Given that Starfield partnered with AMD, this particular mod could be a welcome one for those who don't use Team Red's hardware.
As time goes on, we're only going to see more and more custom modifications come out of the woodwork. Some are anticipating Starfield to keep with the Bethesda tradition of being a buggy mess, so a community patch is also in the works.

At the time I thought it was a bit of a duff pretender, honestly.
But a good chunk of time with it at this year's Gamescom has swivelled my head back in its direction. Having clacked through some dingy streets, fired blue gloop from my arm, and fought the literal King Of Puppets, I've come to realise it has the potential to be a magnificent Soulslike in its own right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rayman is raving.
2017’s Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle had one of the best DLCs we’ve ever seen a game starring Mario receive. The Donkey Kong Adventure story expansion saw Donkey Kong and Rabbid Cranky team up with Rabbid Peach to take on tons of reworked enemies and tons of tight, tactical challenges. It proved Ubisoft knew how to make a quality DLC. Thus far, this quality hasn’t extended to the DLC releases for the sequel, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope – while both the Tower of Doooom and The Last Spark Hunter gave us more of what made Sparks of Hope great, they were just that: more of the same.
We had high hopes for the final DLC expansion titled Rayman in the Phantom Show. Not only have we not seen Ubisoft’s platforming poster boy in quite some time, but it looked like it might follow in Donkey Kong Adventure’s footsteps. However, after clearing the regrettably short story, it mirrors Sparks of Hope’s other lacklustre DLCs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a week since the successful launch of Armored Core 6, and already the internet has been flooded with some of the most amazing mech creations. Some issues have also unfortunately arisen, and they could potentially affect your save game.
https://twitter.com/fromsoftware_sp/status/1697091028241793386
FromSoftware recently sent out a Tweet acknowledging the issue. A translation of the Tweet reveals that the studio is aware of a bug that causes data to not be saved properly under certain circumstances. While the issue is being sorted, the studio advises you to close the game before putting your PC to sleep.
[caption id="attachment_400948" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid.[/caption]
FromSoftware is investigating the issue
This isn't the first time FromSoftware has struggled with save file issues. When Elden Ring launched in 2022, some players experienced save issues on PS5 and PC, though the studio did release a fix. Elden Ring unfortunately had other issues on PC that affected performance, and they also needed to be addressed by patches.
Some Reddit users on the Armored Core subreddit have complained about the game not properly saving their progress, suggesting the problem isn't exceptionally rare. The problem is worsened by the fact that AC6 doesn't have multiple save slots, leaving you reliant on one precious save file. This makes it even more important to follow FromSoftware's advice until the bug is patched out.

He goes on to say that the Starfield – and Bethesda in general – fanbase contains "gaming’s smartest fans," adding that the long-awaited sci-fi RPG has been a "labor of love" for him and his team.
Maybe we CAN explore space together
Read Howard's message however you want. Some may chortle a bit about how he refers to gamers – especially Reddit users – as being smart. We've long known about the divides among the community and some of the questionable opinions of a vocal minority. But Starfield's director evidently sees through that. We obviously don't know how sincere Howard was when he wrote that message, but given his passion for the new Bethesda game (especially considering he pitched it in 2013), the man's allowed to gush a little.
The reviews for Starfield are coming in all the time. But for those of us who have to wait until September 6 to play it, we might want to avoid social media for the next few days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A quick heads-up for those of you hopping aboard the Starfield interstellar express today: there is a non-zero possibility that one of the game's elevators has a shark in it. That's according to Bethesda's head of publishing Pete Hines, who encountered the displaced piscine trouble-maker while playing the game before release. He's "almost positive" the shark isn't there any more - and just like that, my understanding of Starfield has been transformed. This isn't a 150 hour RPG treadmill of resource extraction, artefact investigation and base-building, wherein you give spaceship tours and put +5% on your accuracy, or what-have-you. It's an extremely slowburn horror game, with every innocent elevator potentially housing a Great White jumpscare. All of which, Hines feels, is true to how Bethesda "embraces chaos" in their games, though he does feel the company's popular association with jank and bugs isn't "particularly fair".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the Steam Deck and the Asus ROG Ally, it’s Lenovo’s turn to have a go at handheld gaming PCs with the newly-announced, Windows 11-powered Legion Go. It’s a chunky lad compared to its peers, weighing 854g and packing an 8.8in display, but promises a bigger battery and – most interestingly – a pair of Nintendo Switch-style detachable controllers.


These are partly intended to simply give your wrists a rest, setting the Legion Go down on its (also Switch-esque) integrated kickstand while you play with the loose controllers. The right pad, mind, also includes an optical sensor on the bottom, so you can swish it around a desk like a vertical mouse. Potentially a difference-maker for FPS games? We won’t need to wait long to find out, as the Legion Go is launching on October 31st. It’ll cost a surprisingly un-spooky £699 / $699.

Super Mario Bros. Wonder has a wacky design compared to your average Mario game, and while the new Elephant power-up has been welcomed with open arms by fans, Mario's creator wasn't quite as convinced when he first saw it.
As part of the latest press rounds promoting this upcoming Switch exclusive, the game's director Shiro Mouri mentioned how there was an earlier phase during development where Shigeru Miyamoto questioned the look of Elephant Mario, but it was mostly because the design hadn't been finalised.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The co-op sandbox survival of Wizard with a Gun officially has a launch date. The gunslinger from developer Galvanic Games thankfully didn't get the spotlight in the recent Devolver Delayed showcase, so look for this one to launch on October 17.
Those who pre-order can lock in the exclusive Noble Wizard Pack. The gear within includes Wizard King and Jester outfits, as well as a bonus hat. Wizards wouldn't be wizards without hats, after all. You can see more in the new trailer below and check out a demo for a limited time.

Wizard with a Gun was first revealed back in June 2021 during Devolver's typically madcap E3 showcase. Customization is the name of the game as you attempt to survive in a magical wilderness alone or with some friendly online assistance. The biomes—from deserts and swamps to open prairies—are procedurally generated and can be reset from your tower. If fashion is your thing, well, saddle up, pardner. Devolver shared a quick peek at the aforementioned bonus gear:
[caption id="attachment_400869" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Devolver Digital[/caption]
Playing off that customization, it sounds like experimentation is going to be a major component. Spell combinations affect enemies and the world in different ways. Trying out new things will either lead to great success (and destruction) or utter failure. Success is alright, but failure is always funny. 
Galvanic Games previously released titles like Gurgamoth and Some Distant Memory. We'll get a chance to take aim at Wizard with a Gun when it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam on October 17 for $24.99.

Long Gone Days has a mix of narrative story, turn-based RPG battles, and an almost Silent Scope-esque sniping minigame that all blend for a pretty different kind of RPG. You can see all of this in action in the new trailer out today:

Long Gone Days will launch digitally at a price point of $24.99.
Days gone
This particular game is one I've had my eye on for a while now. It's been around in some form for years, either as a demo or in Early Access on Steam. Seeing This I Dreamt team up with a publishing partner and get the ball rolling on a launch is the perfect excuse to share with y'all just why I'm interested in it.
If the setting and idea didn't draw you in, Long Gone Days is a wartime RPG that's critical of war. The game's interests keenly lie in ideas like language barriers, conflict, and its effect on civilians. Plus, it's got a nice side of slice-of-life chatter to break up its tactical combat. Everything about this RPG is different in a way that's really appealing to me, as someone who already plays a ton of RPGs.
We haven't been hurting for good RPGs this year, and Long Gone Days will hopefully keep the streak going. We'll find out which way the war goes when Long Gone Days arrives for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One on October 10.

However, this thing’s limited to streaming games installed on your PS5 or PS4, which makes its use cases niche to say the least. For those that are interested in it, though, we finally have a release date for the Portal nailed down.
As shown in a new trailer on the PlayStation YouTube channel, the PlayStation Portal will launch on November 15. If you want to watch a montage of people holding the device and smiling at it on their couches, you can check out the video yourself.

I’m roughly 23 hours in, so I still have many galaxies ahead of me, but read Game Informer’s Starfield review for in-depth thoughts on the overall package. With years of build-up and anticipation, I, like many Bethesda Game Studios fans, let my imagination run wild with what this new open world RPG could be. Now that I’ve played a decent chunk of it, it’s quite different from the studios’ Elder Scrolls and Fallout series in some ways. Those two franchises are significantly more open world than Starfield. In fact, Starfield feels more like a great sci-fi theme park with exciting points of interests rather than an open world adventure.

Developer AstralShift has shared the debut trailer for its horror adventure RPG Little Goody Two Shoes — which looks cute and dainty on the surface, but there's a sinister root running through this forest.
Published by Square Enix Collective, Little Goody Two Shoes is the prequel to AstralShift's cult RPG Maker title Pocket Mirror — which is available on itch.io. Inspired by fairy tales (we're getting The Red Shoes and Little Red Riding Hood, here) you play as Elise, a young girl who dreams of becoming rich. One day, she finds a pair of shoes in her garden, but these shoes seem to bring her more than just a fashionable spring in her step...

https://twitter.com/indieexchange/status/1697306636464042101?s=20
The MIX Games and Wallride have announced Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland for consoles and PC. Although it has the distinct palette and 8-bit look of the NES, that is not one of the “consoles” that they are talking about.
When did Rugrats last air? 2004. I guess the ‘90s are slow to die because we’re getting a new game in 2024. It’s kind of a weird choice to make it look like an NES game since the cartoon started airing in 1991; the year the SNES was released.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atlus and Vanillaware have announced that the time-traveling mecha epic 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim has cleared one million sales.
According to Gematsu's translation, this accounts for both digital sales and copies shipped. The ambitious visual novel/real-time strategy hybrid debuted in Japan on November 28, 2019, before steadily launching elsewhere in 2020. In March of 2021, 13 Sentinels hit the 400,000 sales milestone. Originally, the Vanillaware title was a PlayStation 4 exclusive before receiving a Switch port in 2022.
[caption id="attachment_400816" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Atlus[/caption]
Defying Fate
Describing 13 Sentinals is difficult beyond its genre mash-up, but it is a fantastic game. A few hiccups blending the genre, unfortunately, work against its potential as perfect. The climb to the one-million-milestone may have been a longer journey than expected, too. Though 13 Sentinals launched at a weird time, debuting worldwide as next-gen consoles were coming out.
Vanillaware is an accredited developer known for creating gorgeous 2D games, but their biggest projects were historically sidescrollers. Making a visual novel with RTS elements exclusive to consoles sounds odd, but the concept rocks when you give it a shot. 13 Sentinels' selling point has always been its story, however. With 13 protagonists in a time-travel story with outlandish twists, it remains compelling the whole time, and that's a feat in itself.
13 Sentinels is one of my all-time favorite games, and the genre mishmash, coupled with the slower public uptick, made me worried when I first picked it up. I've been a Vanillaware fan for a few years, and the concept was still a hard sell. Strategy games have never been my favorite, but thankfully, the studio won me over here.
Anyway, congratulations to Vanillaware for hitting the milestone!

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. 
After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up.

The announcement of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which acted as the grand finale of June's Nintendo Direct, caught many off guard. Not only is Nintendo moving away from the well-worn tread of the New Super Mario Bros. franchise for the 2D side of the series, but it is taking Mario in new directions with a larger roster of playable characters, unprecedented gameplay conventions, and all-new power-ups. The result provided us with a trailer that not only garnered a massive reaction online when our favorite Italian plumber turned into an elephant, but also had us watching the footage on repeat in an attempt to ascertain as many details a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deadly moves are on the menu with Street Fighter 6 DLC character A.K.I., who launches on September 27. Capcom revealed the launch date along with a new gameplay trailer showing off her poisonous powers. 
A.K.I. certainly seems to fit her lethal theme nicely. From the eccentric dialogue to her serpentine movements, she looks like she's in it for the thrill of the kill. You can see her in action in the preview below. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_871izU8Fpg
Mortal combat
A.K.I. takes inspiration from her master F.A.N.G., who we first met in Street Fighter V. Many of her moves are poison-centric, from the long-distance Serpent Leash to the poison puddle known as Orchid Spring. Her story reflects this, as well, with more insight available in World Tour mode. There you'll be able to help her track down herbal medicine in new location Tian Hong Yuan, while learning about her interest in the Shadaloo organization. If you also dig a deadly touch, you can add her moves to your custom avatar. Will you be able to slither like a snake, too? Anything is possible if you believe in yourself. 
[caption id="attachment_400754" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot via Capcom[/caption]
A.K.I. will be available for Deluxe Edition, Ultimate Edition, and Year 1 Character Pass owners. Those who prefer to try before they buy can take A.K.I. for an hour-long spin with a Rental Fighter ticket, which you'll need a Fighting Pass to secure. 
A.K.I. was first announced alongside the first wave of Street Fighter 6 DLC characters back in April. Following the launch of Rashid in July, next up after A.K.I. will be Ed and Akuma at some point.

The news first broke on X.com, with several employees posting that they had been let go and that the studio was no more. In an official statement on the studio’s website, Volition states that Swedish holdings company Embracer Group, which acquired the studio in 2018, has forced it to cease operations as part of Embracer's company-wide restructuring. Volition’s full farewell post reads as follows:
Embracer’s restructuring is the result of the disastrous collapse of a proposed $2 billion partnership with Savvy Games Group, a Saudi Arabian-funded organization, who backed out of the deal in May. This caused Embracer’s share value to plummet, forcing the mega-corporation…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't remember this at the time, but there were complaints about Skyrim's map when it came out, because it was just an extreme zoom out on the world. It wasn't dense with information; the map markers were often kind of an "it's in this area" guideline that were even less helpful if what you needed was in a barrow or otherwise underground. Starfield raises the bar by taking the bold step of having a map that is almost not a map.
I'm referring here to the planet surface map. The starmap is, like a couple of things I've experienced since being hustled through quite an accelerated inciting incident (Starfield's equivalent of Patrick Stewart dying in a sewer after he's charged you with saving the world), reminiscent of Mass Effect. You can select different galaxies, which have one or two solar systems in them, and then can zoom down and select specific planets or moons or whatever to warp to. Once you're wombling about on the surface being a naughty little space captain - or whatever, I don't judge what you're up to - well baby, I hope you like blue voids with a bit of topography.

Well, the future is now because Larian just dropped Patch 2. It includes an extrapolation of Karlach’s character arc.
Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 2 is available right now. My Steam clocks it at 580.6MB. Its marquee feature is Withers' Wardrobe of Wayward Friends, which allows you to dismiss co-op partners from your party. It also touts the expected performance upgrades, as well as reduced save file sizes.
In particular with Karlach, BG3 Patch 2 adds another scene to her ending. It also delivers some new choices regarding how you guide her through her arc and additional dialogue bits to flesh out her perspective on story happenings.
Beyond that, there are also a number of UI tweaks that will help you navigate your inventory a lot better. You’ll also find a huge laundry list of fixed bugs. Considering how expansive Baldur’s Gate 3 is and how complicated RPGs like it typically are packed with a variety of weird glitches, Larian has been pretty quick to plug a lot of its holes.
Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 2 is available now. You can find the full patch notes (including spoilers) right here.

It means the opening hours of the game can be particularly confusing, but the tips below, gathered by the Game Informer staff, should help alleviate at least some confusion you might be experiencing early in the game.
Stay On The Main Path, At Least For Awhile
Starfield lets you loose pretty quickly, and it is tempting to just start planet hopping right away, but you will do yourself a favor by sticking to the main path for at least a few hours. Our suggestion is that you play at least enough Constellation missions to find a mysterious temple. It may feel restrictive to hold yourself back, but you will be grateful to give yourself the time to learn…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the course of reviewing Starfield, I logged almost 100 hours. I spent them building outposts on exotic planets in distant star systems, and rising the ranks at my corporate "desk job" at Ryujin Industries in the cyberpunk-like city of Neon. I romanced Sarah, developing a relationship and—I think—getting married on a paradise planet, with beautiful and accurately orbiting moons looming above.
I have a strange history with Bethesda Game Studios titles. Like many people, I'm a fan of the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series. But maybe less like most people, I've never completed any of them. It has nothing to do with the quality, but these games were just always missing some sort of hook to dig into me personally, to keep me playing.
It might be easy to recommend Starfield because it's a Beth…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brought to you by the teeming brains behind Snake Cave and Eat Shit With Divine, Starfield is an experience of almost bewildering scale that defies easy summary, but I will do my best. In this much-anticipated sci-fi action epic, you step into the spaceboots of Prince Starfield, a fully customisable, unvoiced protagonist who must battle a cosmic menace in the course of a familiar, but thrillingly woven narrative with unabashed political dimensions.
Not to be confused with NickTitle’s rather more contemplative game of the same name, to say nothing of Kenneth Nietfeld’s swashbuckling romance Rick Starfield: Hero of Space and Time, or indeed Starfield from Graek Tarmikos, an avant garde reinterpretation of Breakout, joeAmerica Gayms’ Starfield is a straightforward but engrossing blend of action and customisation elements. It’s the same heady brew of role-playing possibilities we’ve come to expect from the resourceful creator of Abandoned Bog.

Even in the increasingly crowded marketplace of big, expansive games, Starfield stands out. Leveraging the gameplay Bethesda popularized with The Elder Scrolls and Fallout games, Starfield expands the breadth of exploration to a galaxy of solar systems, planets, and ships. It populates those environments with a rich palette of activities and missions that tap into the outer space fantasy. It’s a staggering span of content to wrap one’s head around. At times, that scope threatens to impair the focus and pacing, and moment-to-m…]]></summary>

This collection packs in all six of the base games (including the adventure titles) as well as all their add-on content. The pack will be available September 1st, 2023.
To be more specific, Borderlands Collection: Pandora’s Box contains Borderlands, Borderlands 2, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Tales from the Borderlands, Borderlands 3, and New Tales from the Borderlands. That’s a lot of Borderlands. More Claptrap than you can tolerate, which in my case is very little.
The base price of the package is $149.99. That’s savings… probably. However, Borderlands Collection: Pandora’s Box will be available for a limited time at $59.99. That’s 10 whole bucks …]]></summary>

A Badge system that lets you equip new abilities? Yoshis riding Yoshis!?

The latest Japanese charts have come in from Famitsu (via Gematsu) and Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon has managed to pluck Pikmin 4 from the top spot and end the Switch's dominance of the top ten.
Pikmin 4 has had strong little legs since its launch in July, and it's taken until FromSoftware's return to mecha to take it down. The PS5 version of Armored Core VI sits at the top, with the PS4 version right behind it in second place. In total, the game has shifted 163,342 physical copies.

They’re not the best in terms of features, but rather in terms of sheer quantity and the depths they’ll dive to pull up even the most unmarketable of games.
Ten bucks isn’t too bad for an old arcade title when you think of it on an individual level, but then you see it add up. Released last year, Taito Milestones was a decent way to pick up 10 of the titles with a bulk discount. Specifically, ones that were published by Taito. This year, they’re back with Taito Milestones 2. Both collections have been rather eclectic compilations of some rather obscure titles, but this year is complete madness.

The Super Mario Bros. Wonder Direct today shared details on the games online multiplayer, but one big surprise is that it doesn't have traditional online co-op, really.
While you can play co-op locally with up to four people, Mario Wonder's "Online Play" is completely different, encouraging you to create rooms for friends and participate in Friend Races. In these rooms, you can see what levels your friends are currently playing, and play those same levels — you'll appear as a live shadow that can revive them or give them items.

The console does not include a copy of Wonder, mainly because it hits store shelves a couple of weeks beforehand on October 6. Super Mario Bros. Wonder, meanwhile, launches on October 20. Still, if you're a passionate Mario fan looking for an excuse to upgrade to an OLED model, this version will set you back $349.99.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Mario adventure is on the way, and a special console is arriving just a few weeks prior. A Mario Red Edition of the Nintendo Switch OLED is set to debut on October 6, 2023.
Shown off during today's Super Mario Wonder Direct, the special edition Nintendo Switch OLED is decked out in solid Mario red. While the outside may seem simple enough, it's the accents that give this Switch a bit more of a Mario touch.
In the corner of the dock, you can spy a little Mario logo. The silhouetted form of Nintendo's plumber-platformer sits right on the edge where the back panel separates out.
[caption id="attachment_400635" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Nintendo[/caption]
And behind that, the internals have some coins hidden away. Kind of a fun little surprise detail. Usually I'd say this is a bit too understated, but I think I like the overall simplicity, at least for the dock.
The Joy-Cons, on the other hand, are a little less intriguing. They're red, uniform with the dock, and don't have any noticeable accentuations or details. Compared to other special editions, like the excellent Animal Crossing one, it's a little lacking.
Full of Wonder
Today's showcase also showed off all the wonder coming in Super Mario Wonder a few weeks after this Switch debuts, on October 20. While buying the special Mario Red Edition of the Nintendo Switch OLED won't net you a copy of Super Mario Wonder, it does at least set the mood well.
But Wonder looked pretty fun, in my own view. I was only a little interested going into today's Direct, but strangely enough, what sold me was the multiplayer. The race mode and sheer chaos made it all seem like a good way to play Mario with pals. Sadly, we didn't get any news about other peripherals or goodies, so my dreams of an Elephant Mario amiibo are still just dreams.

However, today's showcase was packed to the brim with gameplay reveals and new details, and now we've got a much clearer picture of what this game will look like. Wonder no longer: here's everything we learned from the Super Mario Bros. Wonder Direct.


The game starts when Prince Florian, ruler of the Flower Kingdom, has his castle stolen by Bowser. After fusing with a Wonder Flower, the king of the Koopas is able to fly over this new land, populating it with his chaotic cronies. As always, it's up to Mario and friends to save the day, but this time around, he's got more buddies than usual. In addition to Luigi, Peach, and a pair of Toa…]]></summary>

This month we’ve been pondering Aperture Desk Job: a "playable short" Valve created as a Steam Deck accompaniment, yet still manages to squeeze in some deliciously ironic character beats and at least one mantis-based tragedy. We’ll be discussing it in the liveblog below from 4pm BST, and we want to know your thoughts too. Liked it? Loathed it? Have design feedback for the toilet turrets? We wanna hear ‘em, so join us by posting in the liveblog widget’s comments bit. See you in an hour, ish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the vast world of Square Enix gacha games, Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis is undoubtedly one of them. The Final Fantasy VII mobile spinoff has attracted ample curiosity since its original announcement, given that it aims to functionally remake the original game alongside the “compilation of” titles. But with Ever Crisis’ latest trailer, Square Enix reminds us that the upcoming RPG will add some new lore too.
The big feature here is CG footage of an undoubtedly boyish-looking Sephiroth. With the text “We still don’t know Sephiroth” flashing on the screen, it appears we might see a more heroic side of the iconic Final Fantasy villain. Take a look for yourself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given the current hype surrounding Starfield, you're never too far away from a discussion of all things related to Bethesda, including The Elder Scrolls 6. We all know that it's likely years until the Skyrim follow-up sees the light of day, but at what stage of development is it currently at?
According to an interview on the Spanish website Vandal with Bethesda's head of publishing Pete Hines, the studio has actually started work on TES6 proper. Right at the very end, when asked about whether the upcoming RPG was still in the concept phase, Hines confirms that development on the game is underway.
https://youtu.be/OkFdqqyI8y4
However, there's always a proviso. He goes on to say that it's in "early development" (according to translation by GameSpot) which pretty much confirms what many of us suspected anyway.
Probably won't hear much else for a long while
A little further up in the interview, Hines makes it clear that while there have been people working on TES6, the focus for Bethesda right now has been Starfield. As such, it's possible that resources may shift to the long-awaited Elder Scrolls game once the latter is out, though that's pure speculation on our part.
It's nice to know that development has begun, even if it's still in the early stages. However, there's a good chance we won't hear much about it for a while. But then, we have sort of grown accustomed to that by now.
It's been five years since the studio announced The Elder Scrolls 6, originally showing the above teaser footage at E3 2018. We've heard pretty much nothing since, but hopefully things will move a little quicker soon after Starfield's launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rune Factory 3, which debuted in 2009 on DS (wow!), is getting the remaster treatment for Switch. It's out on September 5, and will bring the farming/combat hybrid series back into the fray. So what's new? Well, there's a "newlywed mode," which entails standalone quests based on the 11 people you can marry in the game; as well as a "hell difficulty" setting. Given how much there is to do in the game already, that's not a bad deal. Chants of Sennaar is also out, which has a wild premise and an interesting art style.
You can find the rest of the eShop offerings below! It's a pretty standard week on that front.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lord Of The Rings: Return To Moria is a survival game that certainly shares something in common with both Valheim and Deep Rock Galactic: you and a few buds sink pits and set out on expeditions to mine ore, batter monsters, and push further into the darkness. Having watched its game director Jon-Paul Dumont steer me through a 30-minute demo, I’ve come away with the impression it’s far more than just a cheap LOTR pretender. The game strikes me as a real competitor, with well thought out story beats and crafting treats to make Moria’s restoration a hearty adventure… or, if you'd prefer, the equivalent of a Powerwash Simulator.

When A.K.I. joins the fight next month, she’ll be the 20th playable character in Street Fighter 6, following the first DLC fighter, Rashid, who hit the game in July. Like Rashid and all future DLC fighters, players will encounter A.K.I. across all three modes of Street Fighter 6: World Tour, Fighting Ground, and the Battle Hub.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past week, dataminers have been rifling through Baldur's Gate 3's code and have discovered a dragon's hoard of alleged "cut content". It's hard to specify what they've unearthed without accidentally sounding the Major Spoilers trumpet and initiating Armageddon, but the supposed buried offerings include additional areas, swathes of dialogue, storylines, cutscenes, characters, romance opportunities and even deities. Given just how much Larian's gargantuan RPG gives you to play with, I am kind of thankful for a generous amount of stuff being "left out" - certainly, I don't need any more romanceable NPCs, I'm already fending them off with a broomhandle. But the news has gone down badly with a few players, and especially those who feel the game's overall quality takes a dive in acts 2 and 3.


Developers have come to Larian's defence, amongst them David Gaider, former Baldur's Gate 2 and Dragon Age writer, who is nowadays creative director of Summerfall Games, creator of the very earwormy STRAY GODs: The Roleplaying Musical. "Not surprised to hear of the amount of stuff apparently cut from BG3," Gaider wrote on Twix. "BG2 had a mountain of stuff cut over its development, some early and some even after lots of work had gone into it... almost every game does. Every DA game did. Heck, even Stray Gods had some considerable cuts."

This is Holstin, a Polish survival horror experience in which you merrily rove an isolated town that, based on 14 minutes of fumbling around in exactly one very unwelcoming house, already seems a match for Silent Hill in terms of existential squalor. A public playtest is underway, and I've got a trailer for you through the jump.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 will make use of Modulate's ToxMod AI to help moderate voice chat in multiplayer, Activision have revealed. The system won't detect offences in real time, nor will it be able to kick you from games for effing and blinding. It just submits reports of bad behaviour, with Activision staff making the final call on enforcement actions, which might involve reviewing recordings to work out the context of an outburst.
You can turn off voice chat in Call of Duty to avoid being recorded, but it doesn't look like there's a way to opt out of AI voice moderation in the current/new Call of Duty games at the time of writing. The tech is being beta-tested from today, 30th August in Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone in North America, with the English-language worldwide release to land alongside Modern Warfare 3 on 10th November.

Set to hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC for $49.99 with a scaled-back approach and a much shorter runtime, Ubisoft indicated it was using Mirage to return to the series’ roots, serving as a spiritual successor to Altair’s adventure that started it all. 
However, Mirage wasn’t always its own game; it started as DLC to 2020’s Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. 


“At first, we were working on Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and the DLC, and the idea came up to create a specific expansion for Valhalla and go back to the Middle East,” Mirage creative director Stephane Boudon tells me in the Ubisoft Bordeaux office. “We want…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-08-30T16:20:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Sony announced the next slate of monthly games for the month of September. It also revealed that each subscription tier of PlayStation Plus is getting a significant price bump.
The PlayStation Blog reveals that September’s free games will be 2022’s Saints Row, Black Desert - Traveler Edition, and Generation Zero. They’ll become available on September 5 and can be downloaded until October 2.
On September 6, 12-month subscriptions for PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium will be raised to the following prices:
Essential - $79.99 (from $59.99)
Extra - $134.99 (from $99.99)
Premium - $159.99 (from $119.99)
You can read this article for a refresher on the benefits of each subscription tier, which will not be changing. Current 12-month subscribers will not see these prices take effect until their next renewal date occurring on or after November 6. Changing your membership (such as buying more time or upgrading/downgrading tiers) on or after September 6 means paying the new prices, though. Sony also states that the new prices remain at a discounted rate compared to the single or three-month options. Sony has not revealed the new monthly/quarterly rates.
In the blog post, Sony explains the changes by stating, “This price adjustment will enable us to continue bringing high-quality games and value-added benefits to your PlayStation Plus subscription service.” It’s worth noting that, for now, Sony has not announced any new, additional benefits following the pricing updates.
The move comes at a time when several streaming and subscription services have raised their fees, so it’s not entirely surprising. But if you’re looking to sign up for PS Plus or extend/change a subscription, now would be the time in order to save some money.]]></summary>

Enter the Chronosphere feels like one of those games. Devised by Melbourne, Australia-based Effort Star, it sees you assembling a crew of alien roughnecks to breach and despoil astral "gigastructures" in top-down view. These gigastructures consist of tightly-packed disc-shaped labyrinths with distinct colour schemes, vegetation and screwy spacetime dynamics. 


One of the PR bulletpoints calls on you to "choose between stabilizing your wounds, or reality itself." You'll also get to "plunder paradoxes" and kill people with wasps. Quite the spread! Let's have a look at the trailer.

The second game, Daymare: 1994 Sandcastle, launches today. It casts you as Dalila Reyes, a special agent of Hexacore Advanced Division for Extraction and Search, aka H.A.D.E.S., and - wait a minute, I know this vibe! That annoying acronym? The washed-out, cadaver-on-concrete set dressing? The gimmicky ice-gun and scanner mode puzzles? The not-so-subtle undertones of Monolith and Midway? Characters with big glowy gadgets on their backs, so you can track them through poorly-lit warehouses?


For all the 90s setting, this looks to me like a homage to shooters of the early/mid noughties, when every action game took place in an office block, prison or garage, featured some kind of paranormal auxiliary ability, and owed a few cinematic chromosomes to the Matrix. Get a load of that trailer.

Front Mission 1st: Remake hit last November, and now, nearly a year later, we finally know when Front Mission 2 will arrive.
That date is October 5, following a delay from it's previously announced June 12 launch. Front Mission 2’s revival is significant because it has never been released outside of Japan, originally hitting shelves in 1997. Set 12 years after Front Mission 1st, it stars Ash, an O.C.U. soldier who tries to escape the nation of Alordesh after its overrun by a revolutionary group, only to discover a broader conspiracy. Check out its story trailer below. 


The remake’s features include improved loading times (addressing a big criticism of the original version), free camera movement, a revamped soundtrack, new coloring/camouflage options, and additional language support. 
Front Mission 2: Remake will be available for $34.99. To keep up with every major upcoming remake, be sure to visit our complete list of them here.]]></summary>

I won’t pretend to completely understand what the exact measure of the game is, but I'm both excited to see more and a tad worried it could end up being a disjointed, overstretched mash of things that don't form a cohesive whole.

These remasters were revealed last September, packaged into the same collection and given a release window of 2023 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam. However, that was the last time we heard of these games. Yesterday evening, Konami gave us an update, stating they had been delayed out of 2023.

“Regarding the planned release of Suikoden I & II HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, we have reached the conclusion that despite the very best efforts and our dedicated development staff to release the remasters in 2023, additional time is needed to ensure the quality performance and gameplay experience our users deserve,” the update reads. “The entire Suikoden team is renewing our efforts to bring Suikoden I & II HD Remaster to release as soon as is possible.” 
Konami says it will share further release information as soon as it becomes available on official channels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Destiny storyline opened following the collapse of a vast Terran civilization at the hands of an invading, amorphous Darkness and its various alien accomplices - an advance stymied only by a benevolent Big Dumb Object known as the Traveller. It cast you as an ancient warrior, resurrected by a flying robot to reclaim humankind's old dominions together with their antique, storied weapons and gear. So much of its appeal for me, back in 2014, was the mystique of that reclamation process, bolstered by alternately zany, obnoxious, fragmentary and/or intriguing writing that expanded upon the viral mythological element in Halo. 


Fast-forward nine years, and Destiny 2 has turned the destruction and loss of history wrought by the Darkness into a seasonal - or as it's shortly to become, "episodic" - content "cadence" (a term that stems from the Latin word for falling) of erosion and restoration, with areas, weapons and quests stripped periodically from the game due to a mixture of technical pressures and commercial priorities. It's sort of become the very thing you're fighting, but where the Darkness aims to engulf and extinguish the Guardians of the Light, Destiny wants to keep you engaged.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Far bet it from me to complain about Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot: The London Case introducing more incongruous eye candy, after my previous conniptions over Hot Hipster Poirot with his ankle-grazer trousers and his sexy egg-shaped head, but tick tock, it's himbo Hastings o'clock. Released on Steam this week, The London Case takes young Poirot to, err, London, charged with protecting a famous painting along with a representative of the insurance firm. Naturellement, the painting is stolen from an apparently locked room under everyone's silly noses, and thus begins Poirot and Hastings' first puzzle caper together (for who else is our insurance representative?).
Technically, of course, they met in The Mysterious Affair At Styles, when Captain Arthur Hastings was on leave from the front during WW1, but one of the things I like about this series is how it takes what it wants and gently buffs away the rest. If you're going to adapt, then adapt! Like The First Cases, which came out in 2021, the game itself is largely a process of pointing and clicking through crime scenes to find clues, and then joining them in a big mind map akin to what you'd find in a Frogwares Sherlock Holmes game. But having Hastings along does make it a bit more fun, because his role is to be a bit of an idiot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before Diablo 4 came out, Blizzard had concerns that their latest ARPG would tank the popularity of their most recent entry in the series, Diablo Immortal, Blizzard's franchise general manager Rod Fergusson tells RPS. Immortal, which launched last year as a free-to-play MMO game, left quite a bad taste in our mouths when it launched on PC, especially when it came to the prohibitively high cost of its various microtransactions. Despite this, though, the game's continued to enjoy great success over on mobile, but even Blizzard weren't sure whether its popularity would last once Diablo 4 arrived.
"One of the things that we were kind of nervous about initially was that when Diablo 4 landed it would sort of cannibalise Immortal, and that everyone was just going to be, 'Oh we're just playing Immortal until Diablo 4 comes out'," Fergusson told me at Gamescom. As it turns out, they needn't have been so apprehensive. "In fact, it was the opposite," he says.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was announced a few years back, the general response was "who on Middle-earth would want to play as Gollum". I'm wondering if Atari and Graphite Lab's "creative sequel" to Pong will face a similar reception. Released in the 70s, the original Pong was videogame tennis. In this reinvention - which, confusingly, is also a sequel to Stuffed Wombat's Qomp, with the Pong branding sort of ladled on top - the homely pixel ball has shattered one player's paddle and escaped into an Axiom Verge-esque labyrinth of spikes, energy beams and floating T-Rex heads. Filing this premise somewhere on the "what if" spectrum between the Edge line about talking to the monsters in DOOM and people demanding to land on gas giants in Starfield. Find a trailer through the jump.

Now, one year later, and a little over one month before the game hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, it’s getting the Game Informer spotlight on our latest cover! We traveled to France to speak with Ubisoft Bordeaux, a relatively new studio in the worldwide company’s massive stable of studios. After opening its doors in 2017, Ubisoft Bordeaux has worked mainly as a support studio to others in the Ubisoft umbrella. But after leading development on Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s Wrath of the Druids DLC, the team was given a chance to create a full game.

The Radeon gang’s long awaited answer to DLSS 3 finally got a proper reveal, showcasing how its frame generation feature – called Fluid Motion Frames – could triple performance in supported games. And, while it was revealed alongside two new GPUs – the Radeon RX 7800 XT and RX 7700 XT – AMD general manager Scott Herkelman suggested that FSR 3 will work "on any graphics card" once it launches.

Munich, Germany-based independent developer Mimimi Games have announced that they're closing doors following the release of Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, which RPS only recently described as the studio's best work yet. The developer plan to support Shadow Gambit with patches and additions, but are otherwise ceasing development and will "slowly ramp down" in the coming months. Founders Dominik Abé and Johannes Roth are even now trying to relocate the studio's few dozen employees, who will be paid a bonus taken from Shadow Gambit profits to ease the transition.

Beginning at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET the Direct will run for about 15 minutes and, hopefully, peel the curtain back on Wonder’s new features and power-ups. The game's biggest change centers on the Wonder Flower, which transforms stages into trippy versions of themselves laden with mind-bending effects. More than anything, however, we’re excited to see more of Mario's new elephant transformation as well as the elephant versions of his friends.
Join us for an in-depth look at Mario's latest 2D side-scrolling adventure in the livestreamed Super Mario Bros. Wonder Direct!

Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the next 2D sidescroller in the legendary franchise. Mario is joined by Luigi, Peach, Toad, Yoshi, and Daisy in an adventure that can be enjoyed with up to four players. The game is slated to launch on Switch on October 20. Most recently, we learned that Mario's long-time voice actor, Charles Martinet, has retired from the role and does not voice Mario in Wonder.]]></summary>

That's right folks, I may not have laid my hands on big Todd's mega RPG Starfield, but I've actually tasted its universe, in the form of a promotional drink handed out at Gamescom. It’s composed of cinnamon and stardust, with the boundless expanse of space taking on the form of a grey liquid goop. I’ve got to admit, I think it makes for an excellent beverage, and could perhaps have elicited more excitement from me than the game itself will on release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may have noticed a mounting squabble between Starfield fans and detractors concerning the game's planetary maps, triggered by some leaks or fake leaks over the past week. Said skirmish has now escalated to "-gate" status, with "Tilegate" doing the rounds on forums and even creeping into search results, presumably much to the alarm of innocent, unaligned ceramics company Tilegate Trading Llc in Florida. The nub of the dispute seems to be thus: some people claim the procedurally generated tiles that comprise many Starfield environments actually glue together into complete globes, so that you can see and walk from one to the other and, indeed, all around the equator, while others claim they're discrete maps with invisible walls, similar to those of the astonishing "dreamable" space sim Noctis. 


Who knows, we might have an under-embargo Starfield review in the works that will lay matters to rest. In the short term, the uncertainty about whether Starfield's planets are actually planets puts me in mind of comparable celestial angst in Bethesda's Elder Scrolls games, where planets are more properly described as planes of existence, conjured by immortal beings, which sort of orbit the mortal world of Tamriel. I've been revisiting how Bethesda's mainstay fantasy games thought about outer space in the run-up to Starfield, and while I'm intrigued by the new game's portrayals of celestial mechanics (latest discovery: the Starfield starmap represents stellar and planetary gravity as dimples on a kind of galactic tarpaulin, as in old Stephen Hawking documentaries), I'll be very surprised if it offers anything quite as wonderfully bizarre.

They're almost constantly aware of everything that you're doing. So much so, that they can even get a little bit creepy about it, as was made plain in my hands-off demo session.

So, I was rather excited when I had a chance to play it for all of ten minutes in one demo, then around 40 minutes at this year's Gamescom.
Blazing fast mental arithmetic puts my total time with the game at around 50 minutes... with a catch. The two demos were identical, though, so all of my time was dedicated to smashing the same large skeleton and large rock man. I got to know them and it's battle system intimately, I suppose, so while I can't speak for the quests, but the fights? Gloriously chaotic.

As you may have heard by now, Diablo's Season Of The Malignant didn't exactly go down all that well, with much of the hissing and fang-bearing directed toward its nerf-heavy balance patch that arrived a couple of days before the season started in earnest - a series of events that Blizzard's franchise general manager Rod Fergusson describes as "a perfect storm of a couple of situations" when I sit down to talk with him at Gamescom. 
"Season one was exceptional, because we did something we'd never do again," says Fergusson. "As part of listening to players wanting to carry over their renown, we had to put the patch out a couple of days before the season. The intention is that a season and a patch would go [live] the same day, so at the time we make a balance change and you start a level one character, it feels differently to go through the progression with the new balance."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's the first derelict and/or abandoned (but is it really abandoned???) spaceship you ever visited in a videogame? I'm struggling to pin it down through the growing white noise of early middle age - as with much else in my life, everything blends into a gritty soup of Metroid and DOOM beyond the turn of the millennium - but I suspect it might have been a level from Rebellion's amazing 1999 Giger 'em up Aliens versus Predator, which I now recall only as screenfuls of fangs illuminated by Smartgun fire. 


Does Sonic 2's Flying Fortress Zone count as abandoned, given that almost every NPC aboard is robotic? Blargh. I'm more confident picking my favourite space derelict, which would include choice excerpts from the debris field of trashed starcraft you traverse in the otherwise-questionable Dead Space 3. I'm hoping for more of that kind of thing in Starfield, in which you'll encounter a wide range of scuttled vessels plus still-crewed, decidedly hostile "Legendary" ships that could play a part in the hotly upcoming Bethextravaganza's capacious endgame. There's fresh news on this front from senior level designer Zach Wilson, who has been waxing lyrical online about "the tragedies and perils of space travel".

As a decades-long fan of pro wrestling and RPGs, WrestleQuest is my dream premise. A game that distills the best traits of classics like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI and injects them with a hefty dose of sports entertainment? Sign me up. However, what begins as a great idea on paper falls apart thanks to a botched execution that sees the game stepping on rakes any time it tries to pick up momentum.

While we were at Sega learning about Sonic Superstars, we had the opportunity to sit down with social media manager Katie Chrzanowski to hear the story of how this visual novel murder mystery came to be.

        <updated>2023-08-28T16:54:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield is almost here. Bethesda announced the new IP way back in 2018 and after more than five years of waiting, it’s set to launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC next week, on September 6. Based on what Bethesda’s revealed about the sci-fi RPG, it looks set to be the developer Bethesda Game Studios’ biggest game yet. Hitting up its hundreds of planets while fighting space pirates, marines, and more will also require a decent PC build. 


Here are the PC specifications for Starfield: 
Minimum: 
OS: Windows 10 version 21H1 (10.0.19043)
Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X, Intel Core i7-6800K
Memory: 16 GB RAM
Graphics: AMD Radeon RX 5700, NVIDIA GeForce 1070 Ti
DirectX: Version 12
Storage: 125 GB available space
Additional Notes: SSD Required
Recommended: 
OS: Windows 10/11 with updates
Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 3600X, Intel i5-10600K
Memory: 16 GB RAM
Graphics: AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080
DirectX: Version 12
Network: Broadband Internet connection
Storage: 125 GB available space
Additional Notes: SSD Required
As you can see, not only is Starfield a large game, needing 125 GB of free space, but it will also require that much space on an SSD. And you’ll want a pretty powerful graphics card and processor to run it at its best, too. 
Starfield hits Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on September 6. However, if you preorder the Digital Premium Edition, the Premium Edition Upgrade (which you can purchase if you plan on playing the game through Game Pass), or the Constellation Edition, you can hop into the game up to five days early, starting August 31. 
While waiting for the game to launch, check out the Starfield Direct from earlier this summer for more than 40 minutes of footage and check out this special edition Starfield Xbox Series X console wrap afterward. 
Are you picking up Starfield early or jumping in on September 6? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many attempts have been made to recapture the JRPG's glory days. In Tokyo RPG Factory, Square Enix founded a whole studio dedicated to the craft, and more recently Squeenix's "HD-2D" style has come to define both their own retro work and that of others. But it's arguably the RPGs from outside Japan that have been doing a better job of propping up the SNES nostalgia tent. Last year's Jack Move and Chained Echoes were both infinitely more refreshing to me than the slightly tired Bravely Default and Octopath Traveler sequels, for example, and now we have The Messenger studio's latest, Sea Of Stars, which is probably one of the few Japanese-inspired RPGs I've played in the last decade that's even come close to bottling the mighty Chrono Trigger and lived to tell the tale. If you're the sort to cry, 'They just don't make 'em like they used to anymore', well, you can dry your tears, because Sea Of Stars is the one that is.

The news was announced last night. Sorkin’s credits span numerous sitcoms and other TV series throughout the ‘80s, but her biggest break came in the launch of 1992’s Batman: The Animated Series. Creator Paul Dini wanted to introduce a new character to serve as the Joker’s one-off sidekick. After watching an episode of Days of Our Lives featuring a dream sequence of Sorkin playing a medieval court jester, Dini found his inspiration and contacted Sorkin with the intention of having her play this new villain for a single appearance. Her now-iconic portrayal of Harley Quinn resonated with fans, and she became the breakout character of the show. Harley…]]></summary>

Sea of Stars is like a great genre film by a skilled director. It looks and feels familiar; you basically know what to expect and can probably even predict the major beats, but it doesn’t hinder the experience. The intention is so well-executed that I was eager to soak it all in and, in this case, swim in the stars. I dreaded Sea of Stars’ conclusion not because I feared the worst but because I didn’t want to leave the world and stop playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[But you know. In a good way. My waking hours are, currently, beset by stress and anxiety from a number of different directions, and I've only had time to play about about an hour of Mediterranea Inferno so far. It's quite a short game, though, and I'm sort of transfixed. It's about three men in their early 20s who, pre-pandemic, were the toast of their party scene in Milan, and after a couple of years apart enforced by a lockdown they're reuniting for a summer mini-break. Having blazed through my early 20s I no longer really remember that unique, potent mix of feeling simultaneously fragile and invincible, but it's captured in this almost occult, yet hyper-real visual novel.
I may be playing on a Steam Deck on a rainy day, but the bold colour contrasts and the desperate enthusiasm of the dialogue really get over the feeling of a too-hot summer, of trying to force fun and recapture a friendship when you all want different things. The most intense segments of Mediterranea Inferno are the Mirages, visions that merge past and present and metaphor, giving explicit form to each character's wants and anxieties. It's unreal and yet a distillation of reality. It's quite an intense ride so far, but it's a good one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like Warframe, Digital Extremes’ shockingly enduring free-to-play action RPG, but I do find its sci-fantasy direction a bit much. The mashing together of tinted alloys and astral flame, the blend of over-the-shoulder shooting and swordplay, the environments that occasionally look like GPU boxart on steroids – it’s impressive, but a lot to digest. 
The Canadian developer’s new project Soulframe has the same sense of swagger, with menus consisting of beautiful, quasi-medieval illustrations decorated with scrolls and dancing figures. But it’s a quieter thrill, a stately and absorbing world of hazy forests and sun-pierced catacombs, which calls to mind both Dragon’s Dogma and the overlooked tiny MMO Book of Travels. After catching a hands-off presentation in advance of this year’s Tennocon, I am pretty keen to play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings, Tenno! This message comes to you from that primeval epoch known as "Last Wednesday", when Digital Extremes treated RPS to a preview screening of the Warframe update announcements planned for this year's Tennocon - a special Tennocon indeed, coinciding as it does with the game's 10th anniversary and the studio's 30th. Alas, "Last Wednesday" was a regular Dark Age, and we dusty ancients were granted only a partial glimpse of the promised new areas, weapons, cosmetics and story content, Digital Extremes having reserved some of the key reveals for a happier period, "Today" - which, according to our most trusted seers, will be an era of understanding and transparency. Fickle are the winds of history! Still, even with the limited insight of our time, we grasped at some sense of the offering's magnitude. Read on, if you dare.

Some criticism also fell upon its four classes, who lacked the 'career' subclasses of its developer's previous game, Vermintide 2.

Darktide's classes will therefore get an overhaul October 4th, when an update will introduce skill trees for each class.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 will feature a familiar face in actor Shawn Ashmore. While movie/comic fans likely know him best from his portrayal of Bobby Drake/Iceman in the X-Men film series, Remedy fans were previously acquainted with Ashmore as protagonist Jack Joyce in 2016's Quantum Break. 
Ashmore will play a character named Tim Breaker. Who is Breaker? He’s a sheriff, but that’s all we know for now. However, the fact that he shares a name and occupation with Bright Falls sheriff Sarah Breaker from the first Alan Wake seems more than coincidental. In a video message posted to Twitter by Alan Wake 2 creative director Sam Lake, Ashmore expressed his excitement to work with Remedy again and to play the sequel as an Alan Wake fan himself. 
The brilliant actor and our good friend, the legendary @ShawnRAshmore plays Tim Breaker in ALAN WAKE 2. We have wanted to work together again ever since Quantum Break. Now it’s happening!! So good to have you in this, Shawn! 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️🕺🕺🕺 @alanwake @remedygames pic.twitter.com/LQ9lnjA0gx
August 25, 2023
“I’m very excited to be part of the game with my friends at Remedy Entertainment," says Ashmore in the video. "Our last adventure was Quantum Break, and me personally, I’ve been waiting to play Alan Wake 2 ever since I finished the first game I don’t know how many years ago. I’m sure there’s a lot of people out there that are as excited as I am. So please stay tuned. We’ll release more details about my character, Tim Breaker, and I hope you enjoy playing it. I know I will."
Alan Wake 2 is set to release on October 27, having recently been pushed back from its previous October 17 date. The game stars dual protagonists Alan Wake and FBI agent Saga Anderson, with the former fighting to escape The Dark Place while the latter investigates a murder mystery in the Pacific Northwest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're in the midst of an unspeakably good couple of months for game releases, even if you ignore the boring corporate ones that we'll never hear the end of. The downside of such a bounty is there are even more gems getting overlooked than usual, because nobody has the time even when we're aware of them. Like, for example, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk.

It absolutely is the Jet Set Radio tribute it looks like, and it's a delight even if, like me, you never really liked the originals. Inspired by, rather than tracing over the rail grinding, spraypainting, all-dancing classic. It plays a little smoother, it clocks in shorter, and runs a little faster, but it's undeniably dancing to the same beat.

Well, not a habit exactly, but it's happened three times now, which is enough to make it a thing. Fugue In Void, by Moshe Linke, is technically and literally a walking simulator, in that you are going for a walk and that's all you do in it, but what it simulates you walking through is kind of a surrealist nighmarescape of raw concrete. I know I'm supposed to be making this game sound like something you'd want to play. Honestly, it's very good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consistent with the spirit of the game, Baldur’s Gate 3’s first “major” patch notes are too large to even fit into Steam’s usual text character limit. Developer Larian instead published a portion of the patch details on a Steam blog and the rest on their forums, which were briefly  down - probably either due to an online traffic jam or just, again, the patch’s sheer size. Regardless, we have well over three thousand words worth of details on today’s patch, which addresses around one thousand bugs and graces us with “Short King Summer” before it’s too late. But beware: there are some spoilers in the patch notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco have announced a substantial 2.0 patch and the first DLC pack for their rollercoaster management game Park Beyond, both of which are dropping on September 29th. Prefabs and ride sharing are the big new additions coming with the free 2.0 patch, alongside the option to discover other player’s creations across platforms. Countdown to fiding the first penis-shaped coaster starts now.
The game already encouraged designing borderline cruel rides that pushed health and safety regulations, but the upcoming DLC Beyond eXtreme takes things one step further with contraptions that shake punters around like a fizzy drink, among new maps, rides and scenery items. On a side note, I’ve thought the game’s previous trailers were quietly creepy and the latest is no different. Maybe it’s the playground jingle in the background, or maybe I’m just sensitive to enthusiastic announcer voices. Take a look.

That has to be taken into account when we think about the development of the game, and it could be why, after 20-minutes spent exploring a bit of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl's irradiated world, I'm unsure what to make of it.
Maybe I played a very early build, but while the world itself looks every bit the eerie post apocalyptic survival wasteland you hope, NPC interactions aren't in as great shape. Chats with friendlies are unclear, and in firefights the enemy AI is shonky - to the extent that I think it'll be more useful as a preview to just tell you exactly what happened to me as I played.

While its one-hit-kill combat was fast, flashy and infinitely more appealing than some of the other neon lambs being led to the cyberpunk slaughter in the back end of 2020, its precise platforming and marksman-grade enemies made it a hard game to love while you were actually playing it. But having sat down for 45 minutes with Ghostrunner 2 at this year's Gamescom, I'm pleased to report that this is a sequel done right, building on everything you know and (probably) love about the first game, while also ushering in new, optional concessions to help make its still wonderfully gory swordplay much more approachable for old two-left-thumbs-McGee over here. Then there's the motorbike, which… phwoar. Let me tell you about the motorbike.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this summer, developer Jump Over The Age revealed Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector, a sequel that occurs “some time” after last year’s Citizen Sleeper. Today, Jump Over The Age and publisher Fellow Traveller revealed the sequel will launch on Xbox Series X/S and hit Xbox Game Pass on day one. 
The game will also be available on PC and through cloud gaming via Game Pass. Jump Over The Age also released the first-ever look at in-game footage of Citizen Sleeper 2, showcasing a new location called Hexport. Check it out below: 


“Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector will take players to a new location and once again put them in the body of a Sleeper, an escaped corporate-owned android trying to build a new life for themselves,” a press release reads. “This time, however, players will have a ramshackle ship and a crew they’ve recruited, both of which they will need to steer through a system-wide crisis.” 
This sequel will feature the same dice-based tabletop RPG mechanics of the first Citizen Sleeper, with new systems and mechanics “that will provide more depth, complexity, and challenge.” 

If you want more Citizen Sleeper right now, you can check out the Helion Dispatches, text-based narrative transmissions from the Pilgrim Seed, a refugee ship. These dispatches expand on the series’ lore, set up the narrative of the upcoming sequel, and bridge the gap between the first and second games. These dispatches are released every month and will continue to be through mid-2024. 
There’s no release date for Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector yet. 
In the meantime, watch the Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector announcement trailer and then read why Citizen Sleeper was one of our favorite games of last year.

Baldur’s Gate 3 has been perhaps the biggest surprise hit of 2023 – we gave it one of the highest scores of the year – although Early Access players have been singing the RPG’s praises for a while now. It launched on PC earlier this month and is due on PlayStation 5 next month. Earlier this summer, Larian said it wants to launch Baldur’s Gate 3 on Xbox this year but might push into 2024 due to parity issues between Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.

My approach to games is pretty unruly is what I’m trying to say, but there has been one game that tamed my rampaging ways and that was Cappybara Games’ Below.
Below is a game that’s best played slowly. You’re tasked with reaching the bottom of an island’s subterranean caverns, trying to survive against monsters, traps, starvation, and dehydration. Each layer is shrouded in darkness meaning that you only have the small ring of light from your torch to watch carefully where you step. Charging through these levels is the quickest way of getting sliced and diced, and when you die, you begin back on the beach right next to the boat you arrived on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jusant is a meditative climbing adventure by Life is Strange developer Don't Nod. First revealed during Summer Game Fest, the game stars a nameless protagonist and his cuddly, water-like pet as they set out to scale a great mountain. The game mimics realistic climbing and physics, and players control each character's arms to pull themselves up and over ever-changing surfaces and obstacles while thoughtfully using a rope to extend their reach. Along the way, you'll explore the ruins of a lost civilization that once called the mountain its home. What happened to these people? What awaits at the summit for our hero? Jusant invites you to strap on your climbing gear and find out.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they explore a slice of Jusant's early chapters and provide a hands-on impression of this enigmatic adventure. Jusant is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC on October 31.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[October is already the most stacked month for releases, and Mike Mignola’s Hellboy: Web of Wyrd joins the pack. The upcoming brawler based on the popular comic series kicks off Halloween month with its arrival on October 4.
The game was first revealed during last year’s Game Awards and features an original story by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. The late Lance Reddick voices the titular half-demon. Web of Wyrd evokes its paperback origins with an art direction that faithfully replicates the look of the original comics. Players travel to The Wyrd, a brutal world teeming with supernatural threats, in an investigation to locate a missing member of the B.P.R.D.. The journey takes Hellboy and his allies to the Butterfly House, a location with a mysterious and likely sinister legacy. 
Web of Wyrd is a pure brawler, with players using Hellboy’s powerful fists to pummel foes while dodging and parrying incoming attacks. His gun, on the other hand, helps keep distant foes at bay. Developer Upstream Arcade also states that the game has roguelike elements. 


If that sounds up your alley, you can pick up Hellboy: Web of Wyrd on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Nacon has rolled out a new trailer for RoboCop: Rogue City while also announcing a November 2 release date in a press release (a delay from its original September window). First announced in 2021 and based on the original film trilogy, players step into the metallic boots of RoboCop to protect Detroit from its criminal underground. 
Actor Peter Weller reprises his role as the titular hero, and a new trailer provides a glimpse into the game’s supporting players. We see Murphy team up with his faithful partner Anne Lewis while being introduced to police psychologist Dr. Olivia Blanche. 


Naturally, gameplay involves riddling targets with bullets as you march through levels like the walking tank that RoboCop is, but you’ll use investigative features to uncover clues and pinpoint suspects. Rogue City also presents a number of dialogue options to let players decide how to tackle missions. Developer Teyon is behind the project, the team behind Terminator Resistance. 
RoboCop: Rogue City will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Lil Gator Game launched last December, it captured our hearts as a fun, cozy adventure that drew obvious inspiration from the Legend of Zelda franchise. The low-stakes exploration, vibrant environments, and charming cast of characters all made for a cute, low-stress adventure that we couldn't help but enjoy (read our review here). Today, developer MegaWobble and publisher Playtonic Friends announced a new content update for its well-liked title to entice players to give it another go.
The free update, which arrives today on both versions of the game, adds new content as well as additional languages. If you've beaten the game (which doesn't take long), you can now access New Game Plus. This lets you carry your upgrades from you completed save file directly into the new game, giving you more exploration and customization options right off the bat. It also adds Baby Mode, which allows you to play the entire game as the baby version of Gator. Finally, the game is now playable in French, German, Brazilian Portuguese, and Latin American Spanish.
Lil Gator Game is available now on Switch and PC. For more on the short-but-sweet adventure, check out our review.]]></summary>

I’ll find the time to raid mines with big-bellied friends anyway, though.

As I’ve been finding out, it’s also a fine fit for the Steam Deck: performance issues are few, controls translate comfortably, and it won’t hog too much space on a microSD card. Handheld life is good for Fires of Rubicon, even if it likes to keep yours brutish and short.

But this year I got to spend a good 30-minutes in a match against other players and have come away… pleasantly surprised. I like the way it eschews the sometimes slow, methodical pace of other extraction shooters in favour of a faster-paced team deathmatch. While it's way too early to make big judgement calls like, "the entire game will be good", it might have more of a chance at launch survival than I thought.

At its core, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk wants to remind you how cool other games were. Specifically, Jet Set Radio, Jet Set Radio Future, and a tiny bit of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The problem is, by choosing nostalgia as its sole focus, Bomb Rush lacks an identity of its own – it only reminds me of why I'd rather play those other games instead. 
Bomb Rush attempts to right one of Sega's great crimes: the 21 years we've gone without a new Jet Set Radio game. For the uninitiated, Jet Set was an action sports series that put you in control of a gang of rollerbladers terrorizi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Playstack and developer 2Awesome have revealed that AK-xolotl will hit consoles and Switch this September. More specifically, the top-down roguelike shooter about a cute but deadly-with-a-gun axolotl will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 14. 
The team announced this release date during today’s Future Games Show presentation with a new trailer showing more of the amphibious creature’s violent stroll through the animal kingdom, and it looks great. It features a fun retro throwback visual style and plenty of arcade-like action in combat. 
Check out the AK-xolotl release date trailer for yourself below: 


To coincide with today’s news, a new extended AK-xolotl demo is now live on Steam. Playstack vice president of publishing Rob Crossley says the game’s previously released demo hit almost 70,000 downloads and with player feedback from that demo, 2Awesome has “really managed to expand on some ideas and add a few new really cool features as well.” Some of those new features are present in the new demo, but Crossley says some are being held for the final release. 
AK-xolotl features five unique biomes, each with a variety of enemies, as well as dozens of weapons and power-ups. There are “tons of Axolittles to find and raise” and bosses you’ll love to hate, Playstack says. 

AK-xolotl hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 14.

Now, the team has returned to this year’s Future Games Show with a new trailer for The Gap and an October release date. 
The Gap will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 19, and preorders for the game are now live. Today’s new trailer is about Maria, who seems to be either the wife of protagonist Joshua Hayes or his daughter. In The Gap, players must explore Joshua’s memories, both of the joyous and heart-wrenching kind, to find a solution to his family’s affliction thanks to a new rare genetic disorder. 
Check out the latest trailer for The Gap for yourself below: 


“Delve deep into the human psyche in The Gap, a psychological thriller that seamlessly weaves together the realms of memories, emotions, and corporate intrigue,” a press release reads. “The game revolves around Joshua Hayes, a dedicated neuroscientist, whose life takes a sudden turn when his family becomes afflicted by a rare genetic disorder. As memories fade and sanity slips away, Joshua is faced with an unimaginable challenge: finding a cure before his family’s essence is forever lost.” 
Here are some screenshots from The Gap:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 8/31/23:
Sony officially unveiled the PlayStation Portal remote play device earlier this month and now, we know when it's launching. Sony says the PlayStation Portal will launch November 15. As previously revealed, it will cost $199.99 and you can preorder it now from PlayStation Direct. 
The original story continues below...
Original story, 8/23/23: 
Earlier this summer, PlayStation revealed a dedicated handheld remote play device that puts one half of a DualSense controller on each side of an LCD screen. However, it stopped short of revealing its name or a price. Today, PlayStation has revealed it’s called the PlayStation Portal and will cost $199.99 when it’s released later this year.

The PlayStation Portal remote player includes the features you’d expect from a DualSense controller like adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. But wedged between the two controller halves is an 8-inch LCD screen capable of 1080p/60FPS playback. PlayStation says the device is “for gamers in households where they might need to share their living room TV or simply want to play PS5 games in another room of the house.” 
The PlayStation Portal will connect remotely to your PS5 over Wi-FI, and can play supported games installed on your console. The device includes a 3.5mm audio jack for wired audio, although the new PlayStation Pulse Elite headset and Pulse Explore earbuds will connect to it wirelessly via new technology the company is calling PlayStation Link. You can read more about these two new audio devices here. 

PSVR2 games, which require the headset, and games streamed through PlayStation Plus Premium’s cloud streaming are not supported, however. 
PlayStation Portal will launch later this year for $199.99. There’s no release date yet for the device, but PlayStation says it will have more details soon on when preorders begin.]]></summary>

Diablo IV Season of Blood begins on October 17. As a reminder, the game's currently ongoing Season of the Malignant wraps up on the same day.]]></summary>
