        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a report by Deadline, the 2021 film reboot Mortal Kombat was successful enough to warrant a sequel.
Moon Knight lead writer Jeremy Slater has been tapped to write the script for Mortal Kombat 2. Slater has also been involved with the James Wan produced adaptation of Stephen King’s The Tommyknockers, and helped develop the graphic novel series The Umbrella Academy for Netflix. Outside of Slater’s involvement, not much is known about the greenlit Mortal Kombat 2 quite yet.
Mortal Kombat was released simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max in April 2021, raking in $22.5 million its opening weekend, an impressive number in the early months of moviegoers returning to theaters during the ongoing pandemic. However, that strong start was a significant portion of the $83 million total it grossed worldwide after a sharp decline in the following weeks. The film stars Lewis Tan as series newcomer Cole Young along with, Jessica McNamee (Sonya Blade), Josh Lawson (Kano), Joe Talsim (Bi Han/Sub-Zero), Mehcad Brooks (Jax), and Hiroyuki Sanada (Scorpion).
Who do you want to see in the next Mortal Kombat film? Should Johnny Cage be introduced? Should there be a road trip to the other underrepresented realms? Let us know in the comments!.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-01-26T23:50:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The reviews for Pokémon Legends: Arceus have started to hit today, and if you haven't read Brian Shea's review yet, give it a look right here. Legends: Arceus is a significant change to the traditional Pokémon formula, which is a big deal for a series that hasn't strayed far from its roots in over 25 years. Instead of a fairly focused JRPG adventure, where you stroll from town to town, catching and building teams of Pokémon to challenge Gyms and eventually the Elite Four, Legends takes another route.
Legends: Arceus is very different, in fact. It lets trainers explore large open areas and catch monsters in the wild, a years-long dream of mine when thinking of the future of the series. I couldn't stop grinning when I first saw the player character sneaking up on an unsuspecting Wurmple and tossing a Pokéball at it. I had the same reaction when Game Freak showed you could start Pokémon battles by choosing which team member to toss out towards the target, just like Ash Ketchum would in the anime. Then I found out that gathering and crafting would be a big component of the game, and I was relieved the last few years of mastering a similar loop in Monster Hunter seems like it's going to pay off nicely. 
There's a whole host of notable changes potentially coming to the Pokémon series if Legends: Arceus is successful. So, let's talk about the experimental aspects packed into the newest Pokémon entry and whether they work or don't. I'd like to know what you think is the most influential change or new feature in Pokémon Legends: Arceus that you'd like to see in other mainline games moving forward? Is it the semi-open world, the seamless battle and catching mechanics? Will the Strong Style and Agile Style attack modifiers make it to competitive battles and warp that system entirely? Share your thoughts in the comments below.]]></summary>

The report from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, which is what they're trying to get people to read, states that only 35% of Americans who are eligible for a vaccine booster have actually got it, and they're trying to increase that statistic. "Boosting helps us reduce our risk of transmitting to others," says the report, noting that children, seniors, and immunocompromised people in particular can benefit from reduced transmission rates.

Nathan Drake’s days of adventuring are over. As we watched him hang up his holster and rope to begin a new chapter in his life, Naughty Dog’s scribes doubled down on the message of “it’s over.” Video game protagonists rarely walk off into the sunset, but Drake’s farewell is as definitive as they come. Naughty Dog wrote Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End as a conclusion to Drake’s story, and it ended on a poetic and satisfying note. To bring him back in starring role would be foolish. It really is over. Is Drake’s name synonymous with Uncharted? He’s wonderfully charismatic and endearing, but we now know he isn’t the lifeblood of i…]]></summary>

Remember the Super Mario Maker craze, when a bunch of masochistic platforming-obsessed players would show off their near-impossible levels? And then, just days later, some even more masochistic platforming-obsessed player would post a video of themselves beating it?
Well, now you can relive those glory days with this incredible combination of Super Mario and Celeste, released as its own game and dubbed the "lovechild of two incredible platformers" by its creator, MarkAlarm. Imagine Mario, but he can dash, wall-jump, and overcome an anxiety disorder. It's what we've always wanted!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel reminded me that putting yourself out there is challenging. Whether you duel on the regular or are dusting off the deck for the first time in years, pouring your heart and soul into constructing a deck and pitting it against a stranger online is surprisingly nerve-wracking. What if my card synergy isn’t any good? Is my opponent snickering at me because my cards aren’t up to the hottest meta? What if … I lose? That fear can be surprisingly crippling and prevent you from enjoying the best aspect of the game: testing your skills against fellow duelists. Even worse, it keeps you from getting better.
Battling this mindset is something I’ve continually coped with. From 2003 to 2009, I was a competitive Yu-Gi-Oh! player. I never strutted into the hallowed halls of a world ch…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve wasn't joking a few weeks ago when it said that its upcoming handheld Steam Deck was going to hit current shipping targets. Today, the company announced the first batch of Steam Decks will start to be sold to customers on February 25 and sent out shortly after.
More specifically, Valve plans to send out emails to those lucky early reservation holders starting on February 25. From there, customers will have 72 hours to respond and confirm the purchase. If that process proceeds smoothly, a shiny new Steam Deck will be delivered to its new home starting on February 28. Steam Decks held for those who fail to complete the purchase within that three-day period will be available for the next reservation in line. Valve did make it clear that the model that you reserved is locked in as the one you'll have the opportunity to buy. There won't be a way to switch when the confirmation email comes through. 
Make sure to keep an eye on your inbox if you think you'll be eligible to buy the device close to launch. Valve says it plans "to release new order email batches on a weekly cadence." 
For those interested in how the Steam Deck handles, the same announcement came with some information regarding coverage and reviews. According to Valve, hardware review units will be sent to outlets shortly, and the embargo for final verdicts will also be on February 25. Considering the 72-hour grace period on confirming a purchase, this at least gives potential buyers the chance to inform themselves a little more before pulling the trigger on picking up the anticipated handheld PC. Other preview information may be allowed before the review embargo, but there are no specifics as to what or when.
If you have the Steam Deck reserved, but don't know where you are in line, check out the Steam Deck page in the Steam client or website.

The Grim Reaper’s scythe rarely falls upon treasure hunters. The earth collapses beneath their feet, arrows fly from walls, and giant boulders give chase, but these adventurous souls cannot be stopped until they locate an ancient secret. Their expeditions are brimming with rollicking fun, but their stories always end the same way: They live another day, and one less treasure is lost to the world. We know what we’re getting from these serialized stories, and we love them for it. But unlike Indiana Jones (who is still chasing myths and legends at age 73) and Lara Croft (who is turning back the clock), Naughty Dog has said Uncharte…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dying Light 2 Stay Human isn’t even out yet – it hits PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as PC on February 4 –and while the base game offers 500 hours of gameplay, Techland is already excited to share what’s next for the game after its launch. 
Techland has revealed that it has a five-year roadmap for the first-person zombie parkour game, meaning you’ll be receiving new DLC for it until at least 2027. While that’s quite surprising to learn, fans of Techland’s first Dying Light game are likely already familiar with the studio’s DLC commitments. 
As you can see in the image above, the first bit of DLC will launch in February alongside free Factions-inspired content. Then, sometime in March, Techland will release its first set of Dying Light 2 challenges, followed by a series of events featuring mutated infected in April. Fast forward to May, and you’re looking at another set of challenges coming to the game. Then in June, you can expect the first paid story DLC. 
The five-plus years of support include the following, according to Techland:
A second story DLC
New weapons
New enemies
New stories
New events
New free and paid DLCs
Dying Light 2 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 4. It will hit Switch later since that version was delayed.
While waiting for its release, read about how Dying Light 2’s main story will last about 20 hours (although completing every single thing in it will take upwards of 500 hours), and then check out how that 500-hour length compares to other notoriously long games. Read about the different performance and resolution modes in Dying Light 2 once you're done with that.

Aerial_Knight's Never Yield was a high profile Indie release in May last year, a runner with a distinct approach to storytelling and an excellent soundtrack. Though we appreciated its style and premise, in our review we felt there were a few shortcomings that held it back.
Its creator, Neil Jones, was following a lot of player feedback and - along with publisher HeadUp Games - has confirmed 'Da Update', which will be free and add all sorts of improvements; the game is also getting a mobile release. It's a substantial update and resolves some common complaints - it'll add an endless mode, leaderboards, and even more story content and music.

Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel is a complex game that throws you into the arena with barely a word of advice and a pocketful of cards you might not even know what to do with. The game has changed much since it’s debut in the late 1990s, and while there’s much to learn in Master Duel, there are ways to make that process much easier on yourself.
This guide includes the best tips for getting started, including how to get more cards and how crafting works, along with some recommendations for more advanced deck building using tournament-winning templates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To probably nobody’s surprise, Halo Infinite is a hit. Not only did it review well back when it was officially released in December – Game Informer gave it a 9.25 out of 10 – but many people played it. A quick scroll through Twitter would have told you that, but thanks to Microsoft’s second-quarter earnings call, we now know just how much. 
Video Games Chronicle reports that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who is likely still riding the high of acquiring Activision Blizzard, said more than 20 million players have played halo Infinite. Halo Infinite’s multiplayer was launched as a beta back in November before the campaign was released on December 8 on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC (and on Xbox and PC Game Pass as well).

That’s not all, though, as Nadella also revealed that Forza Horizon 5, the latest arcade racer from Playground Games, has been played by more than 18 million players since its release on Xbox consoles and PC last November. 
“The big bets we have made across content, community, and cloud over the past few years are paying off,” Nadella said, according to VGC. “We saw record engagement as well as revenue this quarter. Game Pass has more than 25 million subscribers across PC and console. We released AAA titles this holiday to rave reviews and record usage. Eighteen million played Forza Horizon 5 and more than 20 million have played Halo Infinite, making it the biggest Halo launch in history.”

Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is out on Friday, and it features remastered versions of Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy optimized for PlayStation 5. Honestly, I don't know if we really need this collection of games yet – the originals are roughly five years old and are still gorgeous – but being able to play them again in 60 frames per second on the PS5 is an absolute treat. We're showing off the second mission from Uncharted 4, my favorite game in the series, which takes place in a prison on the coast of Panama.
Please note the below Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection gameplay was captured internally on PlayStation 5 via Performance Mode.

Our Past Uncharted Reviews:
Uncharted 4:
"A Thief End’s is the best Uncharted yet, delivering a story I didn’t want to end, and an adventure that concludes with a hell of a payoff. The “wow” factor of the world exploding under Drake’s feet has diminished in the years following Uncharted 2, but those moments are still effective, and a true showpiece of the developer’s exquisite craftsmanship for world and gameplay design. All four of Naughty Dog’s games culminate in A Thief's End in a fitting and cohesive way that fans should appreciate." – Andrew Reiner

Read the full review.

Uncharted: The Lost Legacy:
"Given just how fully featured this adventure is, Lost Legacy could have easily been Uncharted 5. Where Naughty Dog goes next is anyone’s guess, but I would love to see Chloe and Nadine return for another hunt, as they’re every bit as engaging as the Drake family. They make a hell of a team." – Andrew Reiner

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week's The Book of Boba Fett episode is loaded with surprises and will surely delight fans who consume all of Star Wars' movies, shows, comics, books, and even video games. The focus of this article is just one of the surprises, which is relatively small compared to others in the episode, but still warrants a big SPOILER warning. I urge you all to watch the episode before continuing on, but if you have no interest in the show, or want to see if the surprise will make you watch, continue on.
It's been a big week for Respawn Entertainment. Yesterday, the developer announced three new Star Wars video game projects are in the works, including a follow-up to 2019's excellent Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The star of that game is Cal Kestis, a Jedi in training who just happens to befriend a little droid named BD-1. This new BD droid type was created by Respawn Entertainment and Lucasfilm and has since emerged in other Star Wars stories, including an issue of the Doctor Aphra comic book.
In the fifth episode of The Book of Boba Fett, we get our first look at a BD unit in a live-action show and it's as adorable and animated as in the game. This particular droid may be BD-1 and could point to a Cal Kestis cameo or appearance in a future episode or forthcoming Star Wars project.
You can see the BD droid of note below. It definitely looks like it's seen some action and is fairly old. What do you think of the cameo? Do you think it's BD-1 or just a random BD unit?]]></summary>

Since then, From Software and visionary game director Hidetaka Miyazaki have produced gem after gem, serving up dense atmospheric worlds, brutal challenges, enthralling environments, and incredible triumphs for players to experience. From the horrific nightmares of Bloodborne to the tranquil cherry blossoms of Sekiro, From Software has masterfully applied its core framework of systems to a variety of compelling adventures.

        <updated>2022-01-26T16:40:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who isn’t excited for Elden Ring? I mean, the Soulsborne enthusiast himself, Dan Tack, claimed that FromSoftware’s upcoming fantastical RPG will likely be 2022’s GOTY – and that’s just based on the various trailers and his experience with hands-on preview builds! But how long will players be exploring this alleged possible-GOTY sandbox? Well, according to a PCGamesN report, Elden Ring’s mainline story will take around 30 hours to beat, with side content adding in dozens more. Of course, it’s probably safe to throw another ten to twenty hours of “you died” overlays to that runtime, too. 
At the Taipei Game Show, Elden Ring producer Yasuhiro Kitao stated, “This will differ significantly by player, but in terms of the targets set during development, the idea is that the main route should be able to be completed within around 30 hours.” Kitao would later go on to say, “The game as a whole is quite massive, and contains many dozens more hours worth of gameplay, but if we are talking about the main route only, it shouldn’t take much longer than that.” 
I, for one, am happy that Elden Ring won’t be an overwhelming time sink – the notorious loop will likely be punishing enough to keep most players occupied well into the 50-hour range. PCGamesN notes that Elden Ring’s manageable scope mirrors From Software’s other titles. Apparently, Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2 take a little over 40 hours to beat, while the third entry clocks in at around 32 hours. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is the shortest game, with a less-than-30-hour runtime. 
Elden Ring launches on February 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. If you are looking for a time sink, consider Dying Light 2 Stay Human, as it supposedly takes at least 500 hours to achieve 100% completion.

This interaction is contained in a new trailer that I deem to be perfect. It sells me on this Final Fantasy action RPG, because it seems like I'll get to control someone as impatient as I am. Jack lives for crashing and bashing. The story is an inconvenience for him, the fighting is not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it any good?
In just two days' time, Pokémon Legends: Arceus launches exclusively on Nintendo Switch. Taking the series in an entirely new direction, the game is arguably one of the most exciting Pokémon releases in years, but also one that leaves us with plenty of questions.
Reviews for the game have gone live today, including our own, so we've gone ahead and rounded up a selection of quotes and review scores from a number of different outlets. Below, you'll see just how well the new title has gone down with the media ahead of this week's launch.

Paradox is calling this release an adaptation, rather than a port, because of all of the changes that have been made to, well, adapt the game for console play. UI, text, menus, and more have been overhauled to provide a more comfortable experience while playing this immersive strategy title with a controller. "The all-new control map lets players quickly and easily navigate the game’s menus via triggers, bumpers, and quick flicks of the analog stick," reads a press release sent to Game Informer. To utilize the console experience to its fullest, Crusader Kings III will sport faster loading on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, and controller features like haptics and adaptive triggers on the DualSense are supported as well.
Crusader King III was initially released for PC in 2020. This strategy title sets itself apart from others with its focus on emergent player-driven scenarios and entertaining drama of navigating war and diplomacy. Console players can join in on the fun and intrigue in March when this adaptation hits PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, which are available for pre-order today.]]></summary>

Navi is one of the biggest sticking points of the otherwise flawless Zelda: Ocarina of Time, so it's encouraging to learn that even Shigeru Miyamoto isn't a fan of the pesky fairy.
His admission comes from a 1999 interview which was originally part of a Japanese strategy guide but has now been translated into English and published online by the fine folks at Shmuplations.com (thanks, Eurogamer).

The game’s staying power is particularly noteworthy as several re-releases and a (leaked) remake continue to bring Leon’s action-packed journey through the plagued Spanish countryside to newcomers and old school players. Moreover, a Resident Evil 4 fan-made Remaster that’s been eight years in the making is slated to finally launch next month, as reported by Eurogamer. And based on the extensive trailer (seen below), it was well worth the wait.

It also has a big Totoro with an automatic gun, dinosaur Pokémon legally distinct creatures eating penguins, a big sky-whale, animals getting exploded, and then those same Totoros tied to hospital beds in a grungy hospital/torture room.

"Once again, when management is given a choice, they always seem to take the low road," the group said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although announcing three games at once feels a bit much, I'm really happy about the Respawn feat. Star Wars news. Respawn Entertainment always felt like one of those development studios that should have been shut down by a bigger studio circa 2015 because the people loved Titanfall but it wasn't, you know, Call Of Duty or anything. I turned my back for what seemed like but a moment, and suddenly Apex Legends exists and Respawn are one of the key players under EA, growing stronger from within. One day we'll be watching Andrew Wilson at an E3 showcase and realise it's actually Vince Zampella's eyes looking out at us. Everyone coming on stage to present is just Vince Zampella doing a voice and wearing a different baseball cap.
Point is, I'm mostly just pleased that Respawn are still around to make games featuring robots that surprise and delight us. And if they're not allowed to do Titanfall 3, Star Wars is at least a rich field to till said robots. Lousy with robots, is Star Wars. But honestly, if anyone is going to make Star Wars games (apart from BioWare, who have spent recent years making Dragon Age 4 and / or collapsing like a magnificent neutron star) then I'd root for Respawn. They may not make the Star Wars games you think you want, but they'll make the ones you need right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all live in a Pokémon world.
A century before it became the land of Sinnoh, the Hisui region was a dangerous place where humans and Pokémon didn’t share the close bond they have today. In fact, Pokémon were treated like dangerous creatures to be avoided, and in Pokémon Legends: Arceus it’s up to you and the Galaxy Expedition Team to document and — yes — catch 'em all for the first-ever Pokédex.
This game offers the first real open-world experience in the Pokémon series. Technically a spin-off from the mainline games, Pokémon Legends: Arceus takes place in a 'Ye Olde' version of the Gen 4 region first visited in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl on Nintendo DS — and more recently in the Sinnoh remakes Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl on Switch. The land of Hisui is split up into regions, each of which is filled with Pokémon native to that habitat. In order to document them for your Pokédex, you’ll have to catch 'em (obviously), but instead of your sole option being simply weakening the Pokémon and then picking 'Poké Ball' from a menu, you have the chance to throw it yourself this time.

Catching as many Pokémon as you can, learning more about them, and training them to be stronger in battle are the very foundations of Game Freak’s iconic RPG series, but few titles exemplify those core concepts as powerfully as this latest outing. Pokémon Legends: Arceus tasks you with exploring a bygone era of the Sinnoh region, then known as Hisui, and gives you more ways than ever to complete your Pokédex. While some elements don’t feel like their final forms, I love where this new direction takes the Pokémon series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thirty-four quality assurance employees formed a new union at Raven Software called the Game Workers Alliance Union. It became the first union at a publicly-traded video game publisher (and the first within Activision Blizzard). The union asked Activision Blizzard for voluntary recognition, but the publisher has revealed that it won’t do that. 
Raven asked Activision Blizzard for the recognition by January 25, and hours after the deadline, an Activision Blizzard spokesperson sent the following statement to Game Informer: 
As the statement above reveals, Activision Blizzard says it considered the Raven union requests and attempted to find a solution that was agreeable to both it and the union. Such a solution could not be found, as the publisher has opted not to recognize the Game Workers Alliance Union voluntarily. As the statement notes, the union will likely now call for a vote, and the National Labor Relations Board will oversee the election. 
The union will now need to receive 50 percent of the votes within its department, plus one more vote, to win the election. At that point, Activision Blizzard would have to bargain with the union based on election process rules. There’s no word at the moment when this NLRB election will occur.]]></summary>

The reveal trailer definitely gives us Metroid Prime 4 vibes, albeit with a little more detail than just the logo. For its part Crytek has made clear that it's in the early stages of development, and it'll also seek to engage its community throughout the process.

Of all Nintendo's leading protagonists, Link has to be right up there on the more badass end of the scale – although he's also somehow on the more lovably ditzy end, too. We'd argue Link's coolness can be put down to three things: his heroic, world-saving attitude; the way he cuddles cats in Zelda: Twilight Princess; and how he can bop a Bokoblin right between the eyeballs with an expertly-placed arrow while riding a horse. What a guy.
Sadly, though, we have some bad news. You see, Link's bow and arrow technique sucks.

Late last year publisher Serenity Forge confirmed that Death's Gambit: Afterlife would be getting a physical release on Switch; the good news is that it's out now, though the package has changed with a sticker sheet replacing an art book in the final offering. It should be available from retailers now, and the publisher also has its own storefront as another option.

Paramount has announced that a new trailer for the show will premiere this Sunday during the halftime show of the NFL’s AFC Championship.
If you’re planning to catch it live, the AFC Championship Game, which pits the Cinncinati Bengals against the Kansas City Chiefs, begins at 3:05 p.m. Eastern on CBS. 
Suit up Spartans, the wait is almost over. The official trailer for @HaloTheSeries lands this Sunday during halftime of the AFC Championship Game on @CBS and @ParamountPlus. #HaloTheSeries pic.twitter.com/8He8fqUjQN
January 25, 2022
Halo is a joint collaboration between 343 Industries, Showtime, and Amblin Entertainment. The cast includes Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief, Jen Taylor reprising her role as Cortana, Natascha McElhone as Dr. Catherine Halsey, and Bokeem Woodbine as Soren-066. It’s scheduled to premiere on Paramount + sometime this year; maybe this trailer will finally offer a solid release date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire Survivors is an action RPG boiled down to its core. You walk around, you kill monsters, you level up, you get stronger, you kill more monsters. In place of story, an inventory, or even the need to fire and aim your own weapons, there is pixel art spectacle. 

On my last life, I killed around 24,000 monsters in 30 minutes. I am hooked.

        <id>117054</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2022/01/25/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-is-working-on-a-video-game-movie-and-itll-be"/>
        <updated>2022-01-25T23:10:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, it’s about drive and it’s about power. He stays hungry and he devours, and today, it’s been revealed that he’s putting in the work (and the hours) to create another video game movie.
Johnson is no stranger to the silver screen, which is where his career resides these days following a great run in professional wrestling. In fact, he’s not even a stranger to being the star of video game adaptations on the silver screen, having starred in the 2005 Doom movie and 2018’s Rampage. In a new interview with Men’s Journal, Johnson said a video game adaptation he’s in will be announced this year, as reported by GamesRadar. 
“I can’t tell you which game in particular we’re doing, but there will be an announcement this year,” he said. “We’re going to bring one of the biggest, most badass games to the screen – one that I’ve played for years.” 
Alright, let the theory churn begin. Fortnite seems like a given, right? He plays The Foundation in it and has been heavily connected to the game for a while now. However, describing it as “badass” would be odd. Sure, Fortnite is a ton of fun and it features exciting gameplay, but it doesn’t scream “badass.” Perhaps he’s taking another shot at a Doom movie? A Call of Duty movie wouldn’t be surprising, either – it’s one of the biggest video game franchises on Earth and Johnson is one of the biggest names in Hollywood at the moment. 
Above all that, though, we’d like to see him in a Gears of War movie. He has the physique to play the larger-than-life characters featured in Microsoft’s Gears series and he already has a would-be costar willing and ready in Dave Bautista, who really wants to be in a Gears of War movie (and we really want to see that happen!).

However, there are quite a few Pokémon we can assume are in the game if their final evolution has been revealed or there is enough evidence for us to say we strongly think they will be included like the Sinnoh Gen 1 evolution cycle (Magmortar, Tangrowth, etc.). While we haven't laid eyes on them, we've included their names along with an asterisk. We will try to update this list as more information becomes officially available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld made us do multiple double-takes when it first came to our attention last summer. At first, it looks like any other Pokémon-inspired title. Cute, colorful, plenty of monster catching. And then the main character busts out a realistic assault rifle and starts wasting enemies alongside his adorable companions. In short, it looks amazing, and a new trailer reminds us of that fact.
The game comes from Japanese developer Pocketpair and is a multiplayer open-world survival game where players befriend creatures called Pals. You can journey together as equals or use them as transportation. You can also eat them, exploit them for labor, or force them to enact your destructive agendas. Pals can be captured and traded with other players, and you can breed them too. 
Palworld is harsher than it looks, sporting unforgiving weather conditions, scarce resources, not to mention illegal poachers. There’s also plenty of farming, crafting, and construction, with players able to build houses or even rocket ships. In a dark twist, you can even build factories and put your adorable critters to work assembling guns and other tools. Palworld’s combat features over-the-shoulder style shooting where you’ll mow down poachers as well as hostile Pals. Yes, this is a real video game. Check out the latest look at the game below.

Needless to say, Palworld looks bonkers, and we can’t wait to get our hands on it when it comes to PC sometime this year.]]></summary>

Some can be pretty intimidating to jump into as a new strategy player. There are resources to manage, armies to control, big decisions to make, many hours of gameplay, and more. However, once you dig into this genre, you’ll find some of the most rewarding gameplay the hobby has to offer. Every victory feels hard-earned. Every loss feels fair (okay, they don’t always feel fair). And failing becomes a chance to learn how you might play better next time. 
This year is fantastic for strategy fans and those looking to finally dive into the expansive genre for the first time. That’s because nearly a dozen great entries we’re excited about are on the way. Of course, there are more, but the following 1…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing video games and reading comic books for as long as I can remember. As anyone who knows me will tell you, I never stop talking about them, which is why I started From Panel to Podcast, a new weekly show that discusses all things comic book.
This podcast will tell you which comic books you should be reading each week, and also dives into the latest developments for comics in video games, movies, and television shows. We'll even discuss comic book collectibles and anything we think you should know about that pertains to this entertainment medium.
I'm joined each week by my dear friend Philip Hoff, who knows comic books better than anyone and has been collecting them with me for over two decades. We often go on comic hunts together, looking to complete runs and discover the next big series to gush about.
We found one such series recently and share our findings in this debut episode. We also dive deep into Insomniac Games' upcoming Wolverine game, and share thoughts on our favorite video games of all time.
You can listen to the first episode below. In the weeks ahead, new episodes will debut every Tuesday and will appear everywhere where podcasts are available.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azetch Forgotten Gods, the third-person action game that blends Mesoamerican culture with sci-fi trappings, arrives on March 10. Nintendo fans may remember the game’s debut during last April’s Indie World showcase, and it comes from the team behind Mulaka.
Aztech unfolds in a technologically advanced Tenochtitlan. Instead of lying in ruin as it does in real-life, Aztech’s version of the Aztec city never came into contact with Europeans, allowing it to flourish. That doesn’t mean it’s safe from harm, however; an ancient and divine threat looms, ready to strike. It’s up to Achtli, a cybernetically enhanced warrior wielding a giant mechanical fist called the Lightbringer, to protect Tenochtitlan. In addition to pummeling foes with the Lightbringer, the rocket-powered glove also lets you propel Achtili across environments meaning Azetch is as much about mobility as it is action. Check out the latest trailer below.

Slated to be a formidable rival to the Nintendo Switch, the Steam Deck boasts powerful technology, including an AMD processor, LCD screen, and a dock that allows it to connect to monitors, controllers, and mouse and keyboards. Moreover, Valve is adding a "Dynamic Cloud Sync" – a component that enables seamless save transfers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was cause for joy and concern alike when Intel revealed the Core i5-12400F, alongside loads of other new 12th gen Alder Lake CPUs. Here was a much more affordable, still gaming focused-alternative to the Core i5-12600K, yet it would lack the signature hybrid of fast Performance cores and flexible Efficiency cores that made that chip one of the best gaming CPUs ever made. 


Turns out, the concern was for naught: the Core i5-12400F is a cracking slice of silicon, both for the money and for games specifically. Although the sole reliance on Performance cores (or P-cores) puts it behind the Core i5-12600K for desktop multitasking, if it’s just the frames per second you’re after, this cheaper chip can match and sometimes even surpass its big brother.

Which is a good thing, because Firework is well worth checking out if you have an interest in either horror games or puzzle games. The horror isn't blood-chilling, but rather twisted up with grief and sorrow in how inevitable it is. Similarly, the puzzles aren't going to stump you for long, but they fit very well with the story. These two strands of the game weave together and create a nice, thoughtful experience that's worth the four or so hours of having it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to From Software producer Yasuhiro Kitao, Elden Ring can be finished in roughly 30 hours. That's a really nice amount of time. Long enough to feel substantial, but not too long that it'll feel like a massive slog. No bloat, more riding on spectral horse-goat, as they say.

Please make a game that is basically Strange Horticulture, but about a weird book shop. Possibly a book shop with a small coffee shop attached. I'm not going to be too strict about it, you know, I'm not a monster. It could, for example, be a library. Or maybe there isn't another business attached, or the business attached to it is a bakery instead of a coffee shop. This isn't just my personal hobby horse, either. I'm pretty sure loads of people would like that game. And please, for the love of God, tell me if the Mystery Book Shop Game already exists. I'd be disappointed if it does, because nobody has yet brought it to my attention.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The developer behind the Titanfall franchise, Apex Legends, and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is looking to expand upon the galaxy far, far away once again. EA and Lucasfilm Games dropped a press release this morning that announced Respawn Entertainment’s upcoming Star Wars IPs. Multiple titles are in the works, including the next chapter in the Jedi: Fallen Order universe, an FPS with Peter Hirschmann (executive producer on the original Battlefronts), and a strategy game via a publishing collaboration with Bit Reactor. 
The press release reads as follows:
“Game Director Stig Asmussen and his team at the studio are already working on the next game in the action adventure Star Wars Jedi series, and are joined by two new teams working to deliver additional unique Star Wars gameplay experiences across multiple genres. Leading the development of Respawn’s all-new Star Wars first-person shooter game is Peter Hirschmann, Game Director at Respawn, who has a long and accomplished history with the Star Wars franchise. The third title is a Star Wars strategy game developed through a production collaboration with the newly formed studio Bit Reactor, helmed by games industry veteran Greg Foerstch. Respawn will produce the new Star Wars strategy game while Bit Reactor leads on the development of the title.”

While Star Wars has always been a mainstay in the video game industry, it seems as if we’re ushering in a new age of exciting next-gen experiences for the franchise. In addition to the Respawn-led titles, Star Wars Eclipse looks to tell a darker story with the impressive levels of interactivity that developer Quantic Dream is known for.  Moreover, an open-world experience helmed by Ubisoft might be the exciting answer fans have wanted since EA VIsceral’s ambitious project was canceled back in 2019.

The team at Blackbird Interactive has watched the recent return of the classic RTS games with interest - vested interest, in fact. Tasked by Korean developer Smilegate with transposing their Counter-Strike-style shooter Crossfire to the strategy genre, Blackbird believes it has identified a hole yet to be filled. A nostalgic need to be catered to.
“I argue that in the recent resurgence, we haven’t yet come across an RTS game that offers players an experience comparable to StarCraft or Red Alert,” says game designer Maurice Grela. “We’re hoping to fulfill that gap.”

        <updated>2022-01-25T14:15:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There really is nothing better than pizza, and Epic Games has made it clear that this is true with a new Pizza Party box item that’s been scattered around the Fortnite island. 
Added with today’s v19.10 hotfix, Pizza Party boxes consist of eight “surprisingly nutritious” slices of hot and fresh Slurpshroom Pizza. These pizzas come courtesy of the new Pizza Pit in Tilted Towers, although who knows how their pizza ended up scattered across the entire island. 
“Find Pizza Party boxes scattered throughout the island, then throw one down for an instant feast with the squad – literally throw a party. These boxes of Slurpshroom Pizza contain eight surprisingly nutritious slices – eat them to restore Health and Shield simultaneously until you get 100 Health and 50 Shield.” 
You can also eat slices right from the boxes or save some to use later. This could be especially helpful for squadmates who are on their own or lone wolves ignoring the team play aspect of certain Fortnite modes. Pizza Party boxes can be found in chests, supply drops, loot llamas, and on the ground. You can also purchase some from Tomatohead using Bars.
Epic Games says these items are not currently in competitive playlists but could be after being subjected to an evaluation period, like most items introduced to the battle royale. 
News of this pizza party item comes as various rumors about the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles joining Fortnite continue to swirl. Perhaps this pizza is a way to lure them to the battle royale island or perhaps we’re just stuck in the land of wishful thinking (TMNT would be such a cool crossover, right?). Only time will tell.
For now, read about how an update earlier this month brought tornadoes and lightning to Fortnite, and then check out these dinosarus that made their way to the game alongside the return of Tilted Towers. Take a look at the new Hawkeye and Kate Bishop skins from Marvel’s Hawkeye now in Fortnite after that.

It seems an obvious scam, which can't be good for the game's image.

Kromě toho si pro vás organizátoři  připravili hromadu dalších interaktivních aktivit: protáhněte se během  online jógy nebo lekce tance; naučte se, jak správně připravit kávu  během živé ochutnávky pod vedením profesionálního baristy z pražírny Doubleshot; nebo se zapojte do simulované bezpečnostní výzvy Capture the Flag. Také pracujeme na vlastní 8-bitové mapě na platformě  WorkAdventure, která bude sloužit k socializaci s ostatními účastníky, přednášejícími a organizátory.

Jack Garland and his conquest to destroy Chaos has had us talking since we learned of it last June. We're less than two months from release, and after two betas and multiple trailers, I still don't know what is going on in Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin.
There's plenty of action shown off in the latest and apparently last trailer for the game, with Jack and Co. using various classes in battle to destroy hordes of enemies, including the multi-headed Tiamat, which apparently gets crystallized and shattered in the footage. We're also introduced to more big baddies like Lich and Kraken and the Final Fantasy 1 boss known as Marilith brandishing some fiery blades. 
We catch glimpses at Jack dressed in regal garb, speaking with Sarah, and gifting her a pitch-black egg-like object, while promising not to forget. Memory is brought up a few times, with one early mention from Jack expressing the opinion that "it's a mercy to forget." The trailer clocks in at almost five minutes and goes all over the place. From dark castles to bright virtual-looking rooms, and camera sweeps over golden fields set to Frank Sinatra's "My Way". I never thought I'd be hearing Ol' Blue Eyes on a Final Fantasy soundtrack alongside Limp Bizkit, but here we are. 
Whether you like it or not, Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin is set for release on March 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Behaviour Interactive has announced that in collaboration with Lionsgate Films, it is bringing more Saw content to the Dead by Daylight universe, including Jigsaw. 
This news comes by way of IGN, which revealed that Jigsaw will be featured in Dead by Daylight’s new Archives Tome 10: Saw event. This Tome will go live on all platforms where you can play Dead by Daylight on January 26. 
According to IGN, players will explore the memories of Amanda Young and Detective Tapp from Lionsgate’s Saw movies to unlock the “Book of Saw Collection.” Plus, players will be able to unlock new rewards in the form of outfits for Young and Tapp, and 60 new cosmetics for their own character. 
“Over and above our primary objective of providing our fans with fun and continuously renewed content, one of our goals when integrating a powerful movie franchise such as Saw is to invite a larger community into the Dead by Daylight universe,” director Mathieu Côté told IGN. “We’re truly grateful to our partner Lionsgate for offering us this opportunity.” 
What’s interesting about this is that Saw-related content has already been featured in the multiplayer horror game by way of the Pig killer. Perhaps this means Behaviour Interactive is going to double-dip into other horror franchises it’s collaborated with in the past. 
While waiting for Jigsaw to join the game on January 26, read about the most recent DLC, Portrait of a Murder, that hit Dead by Daylight back in November, and then check out the teaser for the upcoming chapter based on The Ring. Read our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Dead by Daylight review after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Respawn Entertainment released another Apex Legends: Stories from the Outlands short today called Judgement, and it’s all about Mad Maggie, who also happens to be the new Legend joining the battle royale. 
The story begins with what appears to be a court case for Mad Maggie. Of course, she wasn’t really doing anything too wrong – she just did some things the Syndicate is not happy about, like getting food to the starving and more.

We then see Maggie outside, cuffed and surrounded by security. Seconds away from death by way of a firing squad, Maggie is spared by the Apex Games, which is where she’ll be competing as a form of punishment. Maggie is quite alright with this, though, and it’ll be up to players to determine how she plays in the battle royale. 
The official launch trailer for Mad Maggie and the Defiance season that kicks off with her joining the game will go live on January 27. Respawn also revealed a new limited-time mode called Control that will launch with the start of the Defiance season. 
“For the first three weeks of Defiance, see whether you can handle the madness in the new Control mode,” the Apex Legends website reads. “Select your loadout and drop into a 9v9 experience where teams battle to hold control points with infinite respawn.” 
We’ll learn more about Control and Mad Maggie later this week when the Defiance season trailer is released on January 27. While waiting for that, check out our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Apex Legends review and then find out why it’s on our list of the top 10 shooters to play right now. Be sure to watch this Apex Legends Bangalore short after that.

However, Skydance also bills this as a standalone tale that newcomers can jump right into. Unfortunately, no gameplay details, release window, or platforms are known at this time.

The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners unfolds in a zombie-infected New Orleans. Players control the Tourist, who must fight their way through hordes of undead to reach a military bunker. Gameplay blends action and survival elements and the narrative can change gears depending on your choices. We recently included it on our list of the Top 10 Meta Quest games you should play right now. Last fall, it received the free Aftershocks content update that added new story missions and other goodies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Watch Dogs: Legion has seen its fair share of content rollouts. From an Aiden Pearce-focused DLC expansion to a zombie-based “Legion of the Dead” game mode, Ubisoft’s experimental player-controls-all adventure romp has seen a steady influx of exciting modes and missions since its Fall 2020 launch. However, a recent blog post on the official Ubisoft website has announced that there will be no more content updates. Additionally, the development team penned a thank you letter to the DedSec operatives around the world that continue to roam London's sleek, futuristic streets.
The letter opens with the designers reminiscing about the Watch Dogs: Legion content roadmap, highlighting the inclusion of multiplayer modes like Tactical Ops and the Spiderbot PvP arena as well as a bevy of new characters like Mina, Helen, and Darcy. Quality of life improvements also made the gameplay more streamlined and accessible for new and veteran players. Ultimately, the developers were proud of their accomplishments and the positive reception from fans. 
The 5.6 update that dropped last Fall is the last of its kind as Watch Dogs: Legion begins to transition to a Season cycle:
“...you can look forward to reward tracks in the Online Mode, containing both new and returning rewards. The current season 4 Rebels track, containing 80 ranks, will run until January 22, 2022, followed by Season 5 Stripes. After that, Seasons 3-5 will continue to cycle and return to the game, giving you the opportunity to acquire rewards you might have missed out on in the past. Some rewards to look forward to is a modified version of Aiden Pearce's jacket, and Jackson's mask and clothing set.”
The team ended the note directly referencing players and their past (and future) contributions to Legion: “We couldn't be prouder of the game we've created, and we appreciate all of you who've joined us on this journey in London over the year.”

I ended up going with Studio Pixel Punk's Unsighted in the end, but it was very nearly OPUS: Echo Of Starsong, a stunning visual novel adventure game from Taiwanese studio Sigono Inc. I'd seen a few other games journalists raving about it when it came out on Steam last September, and hey, over 3000 overwhelmingly positive Steam reviews can't be wrong either, so I took the plunge, and golly, it sure is something special.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft’s Rabbids franchise essentially serves as the publisher’s version of Illumination's Minions. The weird bunnies are equal parts cute and zany and have a tendency to screw up everything they touch, despite their best intentions. Now they have a chance to take their antics off-world in a new animated film coming to Netflix next month. 
Rabbids Invasion: Mission to Mars is a new movie that stars Beardie, a misunderstood Rabbid possessing genius intellect who dreams of traveling to Mars. Thankfully, his smarts land him a seat aboard a mission to Mars. The bad news: his sillier brethren also tag along. But when a sinister plot causes the mission to go awry, leading to the Rabbids being stranded on the red planet, Beardie will have to rely on his wits, his fellow Rabbids, and even aliens to save the day.

If the trailer looks like a good time for you and/or a tyke, look for Rabbids Invasion: Mission to Mars to hit Netflix on February 18. If Rabbids aren’t your thing, it’s far from the only video game property getting a Netflix series. In fact, The Cuphead Show premieres the same day as Rabbids Invasion and plenty of other video game series await on the horizon. Those who prefer to enjoy their Rabbids in games can look forward to Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope coming to Switch sometime this year.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-01-24T16:01:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Platinum Games, the studio behind Nier Automata and Astral Chain, revealed back in August that it was resurrecting a 30-year-old series with Sol Cresta. It was initially set to release back in December, but in November, Platinum’s chief game designer, Hideki Kamiya, revealed in a “Very Sorry Stream” that Sol Cresta had been delayed. At the time, a new release date was not announced, but now we know when we’ll be able to play this arcade-style shoot-em-up: February 22. 
Platinum confirmed the new release date in a “Sol Cresta Release Date Forum Live Stream” held over this past weekend, as reported by Eurogamer. Platinum said Sol Cresta will hit PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC next month on February 22. The game is priced at $40. 
When Sol Cresta was announced last year, it was revealed to be a successor to Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta, both vertical-scrolling arcade games developed by Nichibutsu. Like previous Cresta games, Sol Cresta will feature spaceships flying through galaxies, taking out enemies, and more classic, vertical-shooter arcade fashion. Like the original games allowed players to do nearly 40 years ago, Sol Cresta will enable players to to dock with allies. 
When Sol Cresta was first unveiled, Kamiya said, “we want to make all kinds of games…not just action games.” Kamiya likely said this because Platinum is best known for its action titles like Nier Automata, Astral Chain, and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, to name a few, but it seems the studio is using Sol Cresta to prove it can do other genres, like vertical shooters, too. 
Sol Cresta will hit PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC on February 22, 2022, and it will cost $40.

        <updated>2022-01-24T15:16:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi announced last October that he was departing from Sega, and today, his new NetEase studio, aptly called Nagoshi Studio, has been revealed. 
Twitter user Nibellion (perhaps more well-known as Nibel) posted a link to the Nagoshi Studio website, where they learned that Nagoshi is its CEO. It’s also where Nibel discovered that eight of the founding Nagoshi Studio members previously worked at Sega or Yakuza developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio. This is where Nagoshi previously worked before taking an executive role within Sega. 
Nibel notes that in an interview with Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, Nagoshi explains that he left Sega because he didn’t want to do the same thing repeatedly. At NetEase, there are fewer creative constraints on him. Plus, it allows him to be closer to actual game development again. 
In that same interview, Nagoshi said the studio hopes to announce its first game as soon as possible and that said game will have a “large” scale. The CEO also says the studio is focused on quality and appealing to both core fans and a larger audience while doing things he and the other developers there couldn’t do before (perhaps at RGG or Sega).
While waiting to learn more about Nagoshi Studio’s first title, read about how RGG has confirmed that a sequel to Yakuza: Like A Dragon is in the works, and then check out this interview with Nagoshi, where he reveals why Sega should have fired him in the 1990s. Read about why one Game Informer editor believes you should play more Yakuza right now after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. This week, we examine 343 Industries' first stab at the series with Halo 4.
Halo 4 was released on the Xbox 360 on November 6, 2012, and was a big return for Master Chief, who hadn't been seen since 2007's Halo 3. Development of the game wasn't perfectly smooth as Ryan Payton, of Metal Gear Solid 4 fame, initially pushed the team to experiment with Halo's sandbox. However, the game was still a massive hit. Join us as we talk about Halo 4's powerful story, the new Prometheans enemy types, Halo's obsession with the number seven, and what made the Spartan Ops multiplayer mode so disappointing.  
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves) and Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) and IGN executive editor Ryan McCaffrey (@DMC_Ryan) as we unpack the history and impact of the first Halo game from 343 Industries. And for more Halo, be sure to check out our definitive ranking of every Halo game.
Check out the rest of our podcast on the Video Gameography hub. If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga got an April 5 release date this week after spending years in development limbo. For a while, it seemed like the project was in peril, and, according to a new report by Polygon, those fears appear to have merit. The outlet talked to 30 current and former employees of TT Games (speaking anonymously out of fear of retaliation) who revealed TT’s lifetime history of crunch, a negative workplace atmosphere, and how The Skywalker Saga’s development suffered from it. 
The report highlights that after TT struck gold with its early Lego titles during the mid-2000s, it became a victim of its own success. The studio’s annual release cadence meant that overtime and crunch became not only normal but expected. Polygon’s sources described instances of studio leadership …]]></summary>

Windjammers 2 gives fans of the popular arcade game exactly what they want: more Windjammers. Outside of a sharp graphical facelift and some new competitors and arenas, don’t expect to find much to gnaw on after you’ve batted around the disc a few times. The sport remains a reflex-demanding delight, but the fun wanes after a few rounds on the court. 
Windjammers pits two players against each other in an over-the-top frisbee version of air hockey. You shoot the disc at each other, attempting to nail it through the goal on your opponent’s side; you can also earn points if the disc touches…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil is a classic video game franchise that’s been around for decades. And for good reason, too – whether you prefer the more hardened survival horror seen in the first few Resident Evil games (and the recent ones) or the more over-the-top action camp seen in later entries, the series has you covered. That’s probably what makes it such a beloved series: there’s a little something for everyone in it. 
You might be wondering what has us pondering the Resident Evil series today. Well, 24 years ago, Resident Evil 2 hit PlayStation 1 on January 21, 1998. You read that right: the classic Resident Evil 2 is 24 years old! One year short of being old enough to rent a car!
Happy 24th anniversary to Resident Evil 2, that shambled its way onto PlayStation 1 in January 21st, 1998.

Over the years, I’ve even formed my own little plan. Loot some local houses and then set up a base in the fire station on my street. They’ve got electric gates and metal fences to guard the perimeter, a renewable power source thanks to a wind turbine on the roof, and a really handy watchtower. I thought 11 years of The Walking Dead would’ve prepared me fairly well and I fancied my chances. So, I made myself in Project Zomboid. It turns out, everything I learned from The Walking Dead was useless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pupperazzi is a game about taking pictures of dogs. They are, as is traditional, very cute dogs. You go around several areas that increase in complexity and dog saturation, completing photo challenges and unlocking more and more complex areas. An extreme sports dog wants a picture of a dog riding a scooter. The old sea-dog at the beach would like a photo of any dog, as long as the lighthouse is in the background. In return for this you get golden bones as a form of currency to buy different kinds of film, or weird lenses, to kick your photography into the next gear.
It's cute. It's a really nice playground that facilitates the player's own creativity. You can pet dogs to make them happy, or find toys to make them do different things: turn on a radio and any furry pals nearby bust out some truly astonishing moves; throw a stick to initiate a huge game of fetch. You post your photos to a kind of dog-centric Instagram for likes and comments (possibly from dogs; possibly from humans). The colourful, chunky art, combined with deliberately stiff animation where nobody can move their joints, really reminds me of Playmobil toys. Despite this carefree, playful tone, I also find it unaccountably sinister.

Now there's a proper trailer for what's creatively titled Shenmue The Animation, which just like the original game sets Ryo on his path to avenging his father's death.

Perhaps more importantly than that, they released another patch.

So sure, expanding the game with DLC, sure sure, tell me about making what's already there better. Amplitude laid out some of their plans on that front, too.

We’re in the opening seconds of the round and only 20 minutes into my Midnight Ghost Hunt hands-on preview, which means I’ve yet to figure out important concepts like ‘where the hunters spawn in’, or nuances like ‘this button lets me hide in props’ as opposed to ‘this button telekinetically waggles props about like ectoplasmic dinner bells’. As ghosts we’re supposed to mostly stay schtum for the five minutes it takes to reach midnight, at which point we get to both metaphorically and literally flip the tables on the living. Instead: panic.

There's an excellent Cavern Of Lies this week, in which Nate hosts a game-themed episode of Through The Keyhole in character as Lloyd Grossman/a robot version of Matt Berry. We also have some great diversions and some opening chat about the time my friend was a real life suspect in a murder for a few days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dunno if you’ve noticed, but there’s been a whole lot of news lately. Too much news in fact. Growing up, we barely had any news. There was just one bit of news that we’d all have to share. A man would drive around our village with the news in the back of his van, and we’d all come out of our houses to watch as he slid open the doors and pointed at it, saying “well, here is the news”. And it was the same news, every day. The news about the hole in the ozone layer. And it was all the news we needed.


Not For Broadcast puts you in charge of all of the news. Set in an alternate timeline 1980s Britain in which an authoritarian far-left party has swept to power on a wave of populist policies, it casts the player as the lens through which the nation will view its new government. Seated in front of a bank of glowing screens, sliders and controls, you have the enviable power to switch between four live camera feeds, bleep out naughty words (and later subversive opinion), choose which ads to run during the break, and select which images are highlighted on screen during each news story.

A friend of mine has a positively ebullient front room full of lush, green darlings that have names like Hercules. My brother-in-law, absent any real space, has mounted glass spheres of water on his wall and grows little flowers and trailing vines from them. I, on the other hand, am a plant killer. Apart from in Strange Horticulture, when I run a spooky and ethereal plant shop in a town called Undermere, in an alternate-universe version of The Lake District. There, my plants are happy and weird, and with them I can save the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strategy games set in space are almost innately ambitious. The very concept of doing anything meaningful in an infinite void, let alone making it playable and entertaining, is a challenging one, and for every game that reaches for the stars there are countless kinds of... spiraling chaos orbitals.
Between its design flaws and unique ideas with semi-brilliant execution, the 2010 4X/wargame/economic/management simulation Distant Worlds: Universe has straddled those two experiences for a decade. It's needed a sequel for a long time. Distant Worlds 2 is that sequel, and it's almost upon us. Last week I attended a live demo and Q&A session with its producer and co-designer Erik Rutins. With only a hands-off demo to go on I obviously can't say for sure how it plays yet, but it's already looking very promising.

Windjammers 2 falls firmly into the latter category. After successfully resurrecting Streets Of Rage for another bout in 2020, developer Dotemu are up to the same old tricks, bringing Windjammers all the way back from 1994 (before I was even born) with a fresh coat of paint and some brand new ultimate frisbee-style action in this sequel.

I would say Happy New Year, but it's already the 19th January and we've had two of the biggest news stories of the year in the space of a week, so I think that means it's officially too late to keep banging the old New Year drum, isn't it? The sentiment remains, of course, even if I do now feel a thousand years old in the process.
Rather than reaching for the annual reset button, though, today I wanted to talk about some of the new and exciting things that are coming up on RPS this year. For starters, our tech team's just handed us a brand-new liveblogging feature, and we'd like you, our RPS supporters, to help us test it out tomorrow at 4pm GMT.

Sure, it's been done before, but it feels inherently charming. At least, it does in the trailer for newly-revealed Songs Of Glimmerwick, a new game from Eastshade Studios that promises to blend RPG, adventure, and gardening.
No specific release date is confirmed, aside from "next year". I have to give them credit for the name Songs Of Glimmerwick, which immediately lets you know that this will be about music and magic, and probably have an amount of tweeness. Specific tweeness levels unconfirmed but they're looking good from the trailer, where you can also clap eyes on some pretty cool-looking gardening, a tree telling you to stfu, and a man earnestly giving you a wooden flute as you head off to magic university.

There’s a joke there about him stepping down but the Chaos having remained, but I can’t figure it out. Anyway, what I’m trying to say is this: it’s been almost seven years since then. SEVEN! And I’m still head over heels in love with these games even now. Somehow, impossibly, that seems to be holding true for Warhammer 3 as well.
In a recent hands-on event, I was able to play something like eight hours worth of this final game in the trilogy from the comfort of my own spare room. Having not done a “digital preview” before now, this was something of a revelation to me. Wearing my comfortable clothes and with a steady supply of big mugs of tea, I booted up the game, hit ‘New Campaign’ and was greeted with the following screen.

A campaign group of employees known as the ABK Workers Alliance say the acquisition doesn't change their goals and there's still work to do.

Well, Extraction is a tactical FPS that builds on what made Outbreak great by repurposing Siege's PvP prowess into a moreish Left 4 Dead-like. Unpicking an alien hivemind with your mates is a real thrill, as is simply coming back from a mission alive. While it doesn't do anything to blow you away, it does more than enough to keep you coming back for a quick alien-busting session here and there.

Expeditions: Rome, a historical CRPG blending turn-based combat, strategic army management, and lots of dialogue, has a pretty rubbish character creation system. There’s bugger all you can really do to customise your Roman. and after the mammoth character forge of Pathfinder: Wrath Of The Righteous, for example, it all just feels very sparse and shoestringy. And that is a damned shame, because when it gets down to business, this is a seriously good - and lovingly detailed - romp through centurion times.

Wait, hang on. What. That's not what I expected when Xbox head Phil Spencer told staff he was "evaluating all aspects of [Xbox's] relationship" with Activision Blizzard. Microsoft plan to pay $68.7 billion (£50 billion) for the company, which will nab them games including Warcraft, Call Of Duty, and Overwatch. Jesus.

OlliOlli World is shaping up to be a good-spirited renovation of the 2D skateboarding series that has traditionally been quite punishing. This one's got a flashy third dimension, moon-faced cartoon characters, and a plucky story to match. We're told of Skate Godz who once appointed a human representative on earth. But she's about to retire and needs a prodigy to step forward to fill her Vans. The player is that potential new conduit between holy half-pipers and humanity. In other words, this is a quest to become Skate Pope. Caliph of kickflips. Dalai Slama. Having both popped and shoved-it through a heap of levels in preview, I'm happy to report you can all sit down. I'm the chosen one. It's me.

The World War 2 sandbox MMO is a persistent battle where weapons, vehicle, and building rely on resources gathered, processed, and delivered by other players, without whom the war machine slows down. Our boy Brendy called logistics "the real heroes" when he rode with them a few years back. But many are unhappy with the current state of their role, so they've formed a union.

This is a dungeon-crawler that lets you shapeshift into horses, bodybuilders, and ghosts in your bid to save the world, but it's a quest blighted not only by a Calamity, but by repetition too. Charming characters and clever mighty-morphin' combat succumb to numbers, which reduces what could've been a rich world to a rather hollow dash between dungeons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can I get a ‘woop woop’, or at least a ‘wololo’, for the spin-off strategy game? The Ensemble Studios swansong that was Halo Wars, an RTS so streamlined it was aerodynamic. The ballistic ballet of Gears Tactics, which piled extra biceps atop XCOM’s shoulders. Even when money has moved through the membrane in the opposite direction, it has resulted in projects that were - let’s not overstate this - endearingly experimental. Can I get an understanding nod for Command & Conquer: Renegade?
The strangeness of Crossfire: Legion’s situation is that you might not recognise it as a spin-off at all. That’s because the series is a big old blind spot for the Western world. Crossfire is an enormously successful Korean FPS that bears more than a passing resemblance to Counter-Strike - all right angles, assault weapons, and de_dust2 - but dwarfs even Steam’s most popular game for player numbers. With 690 million participants across 80 countries, it’s the biggest online FPS in the world. In China, where the game is a major cultural force, a coming-of-age television drama about two young Crossfire players has been watched 1.8 billion times. Bridger-what? Geralt of Where? The upshot of all that success is that Crossfire radiates money, and some of it is now funding new games from prestigious Western developers. Remedy is working on a campaign FPS in the classic COD style. And Blackbird Interactive is building an RTS named Legion.

It’s an intriguing new feature that could make some of the best graphics cards even better, and I’ve been trying it out to see if it performs as effectively as Nvidia claims.

Successfully rehabilitated and reimagined as father figures struggling to inhabit that role and accept their emotions, in some very good games to boot. Developers who were hot young guns in the 00s are now tired middle-aged dads themselves, and as a result the art they consume and, more to the point, the art they want to make looks radically different. I'm not having a go at that; that's just life, is what that is.
But what I'm asking is, what's the mum equivalent? Because I really want to see someone give a mum story the same big budget, fun epic treatment that Kratos got in God Of War. At the same time, I also dread this coming to pass.

While Square Enix haven't been bombed by the local mafioso, joined a murderous D&D cult, or discovered their dad is a serial killer and they too have the serial killer genes (thanks, Riverdale!), they did find such overwhelming success with Final Fantasy XIV that they temporarily stopped selling the MMORPG. They couldn't expand servers quickly enough to meet demand, see, leading to login queues and frustration. But now things are settling enough to to start selling it again, and they have big plans to expand servers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not sure I trust the Page of Cups. As imagined by Pamela Colman Smith and A.E. Waite in the 1909 Rider-Waite Tarot, he's a cocky young man in a floral tunic, standing by the seashore hefting a goblet. There's a fish peeking out of the goblet and the Page appears to be gossiping with it, perhaps sharing a joke about the artist, because honestly, what kind of artist paints a guy talking to fish. Or is he thinking about offering us the cup? The set of his jaw is ambiguous.
When drawn in an upright position, the Page suggests a flash of inspiration reeled from the mind's ocean, or a dazzling opportunity. In this guise, he's been a good friend to Ami Y. Cai, a game creator and illustrator from Kentucky - though in her first Tarot deck, Stephanie Pui-Mun Law's Shadowscapes Tarot, the symbolism has been flipped around a little, the Page depicted as a mermaid peering into a steaming bowl. “Sometimes sparks come to me through conversations, or while I'm doing something else,” Cai tells me over Zoom. “So when I see the Page of Cups, I know that a creative opportunity is coming my way.”

When very abstracted ones throw one in it's often an indulgence, or just an excuse to hang the aesthetics around something the devs happen to like. Blink Planets seemed like this at first, and that was fine! A little sexy hexy is all you really need if it's done right, after all. I cannot believe I just said that.


Partway through though, I realised Blink Planets isn't just about connecting things with lines of tiles. It really is about the urban planning its setting suggests.

The guitar arrived as promised; I am still waiting on the funk. Any day now. In the meantime, I’ve taught myself the riff for Valley Of The Fallen Star, better known as the Cosmo Canyon theme from Final Fantasy VII. I’m not sure if I can adequately put into words how the original composition of the track makes me feel, but I am certain I’m not the only one.It is sonic nostalgia for a simpler time, where following a talking dog’s weeble uncle to the projection of the cosmos he kept in his loft did nothing to shatter my emotional investment in a story.
