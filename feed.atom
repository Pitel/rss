        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the ESO 2024 Global Reveal livestream, Zenimax Online gave us a look at the upcoming Elder Scrolls Online expansion, Gold Road.


The new expansion will take place just east of the Gold Coast in the Colovian Highland and West Weald regions of Cyrodiil, which was last depicted in The Elder Scrolls Oblivion. The region contains the city of Skingrad, a location that was teased in the Greymoor Expansion. The map shown off in the post-trailer discussion shows that it’s filling in a vast region just West of the PVP region of Cyrodiil.




Forgotten Prince Ithelia, the Daedric Prince of Paths, is the central antagonist of Gold Road. The deity is said to have the ability to mess with fate and destiny, so Hermaeus Mora deleted the Prince from existence. They were only really mentioned in ESO, supposedly teasing their appearance here. Normally, Zenimax just worked with the schemes of existing Daedric Princes, but this is the first time they really invented a new one.


The Chapter is also going to add Scribing, which is a take on spell crafting from the core series. Spellcrafting was initially planned as a feature for ESO’s release, but it was shelved, assumedly because of how difficult it would be to balance. I know a lot of players who are going to be excited to see it arrive in some form. Though, really, it seems more like it's just skill customization. You will need to own the Gold Road chapter to be able to use this system.


Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road will be released for PC on June 3, 2024, followed by a release for Xbox Series X|S and PS5 on June 18.

We also learned that it’s launching later this year.

The adventure is called Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and stars Indy in his prime doing what he does best: solve puzzles, explore tombs, and pummel Nazis. Set in 1937 between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, Indy is chasing a stolen relic to solve an ancient, globe-trotting mystery.

Ryozo Tsujimoto, series producer of both Exoprimal and Monster Hunter, released a developer commentary video breaking down the collaboration of the two beast-battling titles. 




The highlight of the new content for most is likely the inclusion of Rathalos.  The wyvern is sort of the Monster Hunter mascot at this point. The monster has been in every game of the series and was even featured as a boss and assist trophy in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

Updated with the newly released Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. Enjoy!

The word 'Metroidvania' might rub some core gamers the wrong way, but it's a useful catch-all to describe a very specific type of game experience. Combining elements from both the Metroid series and Koji Igarashi-produced Castlevania titles, this broad platforming genre has you using an ever-growing skill set to open up new paths across an expansive, layered map. As you explore and find secrets throughout the environment, these games empower the player in a way that makes them extremely addictive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the Xbox Developer Direct Livestream, MachineGames showed off their upcoming Indiana Jones project, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle. Most importantly, it involves Harrison Ford('s likeness) and punching Nazis. Two awesome things.


Actually, there’s probably everything you’d expect from an Indiana Jones game. There’s a whip, torches, the Wilhelm scream, a travel montage, a female sidekick, and ancient (but still functional) puzzles. Interestingly, it’s mostly done in the first person, except when you’re doing more agile activities or looking at Harrison Ford in a cutscene.




Indiana Jones and The Great Circle takes place between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. In it, Indy witnesses the theft of an artifact from the College he works at. He follows its trail and discovers that it’s central to a deeper mystery.


MachineGames is trying to capture the look, feel, and sound of an Indiana Jones movie, and I’m convinced. I’m not sure if I mentioned this, but Harrison Ford is in it. They promise that you’ll be able to enjoy it, even if you haven’t seen the movies. That’s good because I skipped that last two.


Indiana Jones and The Great Circle is coming to Xbox Series X|S and PC later this year.

Oxide talked up its "living world," a procedurally generated map for players to create the society they want in Ara. As the developers say, it will change over time based on players' decisions. You can watch the presentation starting at the 25:00 minute mark. 


Ara's Prestige System pits players to build a nation better than opponents'. The game's score system awards points based on what kind of leader a specific player wants to be. An example, as detailed during today's live stream, is building "Triumphs," or famous buildings throughout history that give large Prestige bonuses.
Oxide is a Maryland-based studio founded in 2013 by former Firaxis developers. Its previous games include 2016's Ashes of the Singularity and Star Swarm. 
Ara: History Untold is expected to be released on PC and PC Game Pass in the fall of this year. However, Oxide plans to keep its "Insider Program" after release, implementing player feedback.]]></summary>

The action-adventure sequel will release on May 21, 2024 on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and as a Day One on Game Pass title.




That will put the sequel release just short of seven years after the release of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. Players will once again jump into the role of Senua as she attempts to overcome the barbaric and brutal raids of Vikings in a tyrannical Iceland. Like the original, Hellblade 2 will explore Senua's story in a cinematic way as she struggles to deal with psychosis which actually helps her traverse the brutal Icelandic landscape.


It's looking to be a great year for cinematic and story-driven games. Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 will add to that when it releases on May 21, 2024.

        <updated>2024-01-18T20:39:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's Xbox Developer Direct had a surprise guest appearance from a third party. Square Enix cut into the stream to show off more of its upcoming Visions of Mana, and confirm a Summer 2024 release window.


The unannounced guest made its appearance directly after Obsidian and Ninja Theory's presentations, to share new details about the next entry in the Mana series. This will actually be the first entry in the series to hit Xbox consoles, so today's appearance on the stream was a bit of a surprise, to say the least.


Much of Visions of Mana looks like Square Enix building on the foundations of its Trials of Mana remake. Fully 3D action-RPG combat, with a bright, colorful look is fitting for the Mana series, after all. But the show-stealer for me was the pikul, a dog-like companion the player can ride around on.




The pikul apparently started out as something of a mix, incorporating both Yorkshire terrier and a pangolin. I love the pikul, and will protect the pikul, and prevent any harm from befalling the pikul.

New visions


Square also talked a bit about its musical score, which will have 100 songs total, and adapt as the player enters combat. It's a really cool effect to hear in practice, and I'm really intrigued to hear it play out in the overworld once the RPG is out.


It's really cool to see the Mana series get this kind of push. A decade ago, the idea of a new Mana game getting shown alongside the likes of an Indiana Jones title and Avowed would've been wild. It really does seem like Xbox is courting a wider range of third-party developers. And man, Visions of Mana is looking solid.


We'll see if the series still has that action-RPG magic when Visions of Mana arrives in Summer 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Xbox Developer Direct, Square Enix made a surprise appearance to pull back the curtains on Visions of Mana, the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Square Enix also revealed Visions of Mana will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this summer.
Executive producer Masaru Oyamada discussed the franchise's history, noting there have been 17 entries across its 30 years of existence. He also points out that what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991. 


Mana series creator Koichi Ishii also joined this segment of the show to discuss how he has supervised the team on its work and implementation of taking what were originally pixelated monsters and converting them into the 3D monsters players will fight in the game. 
Notably, Visions of Mana is the first Mana game coming to Xbox. Oyamada expressed Square Enix's excitement about this first for the series while diving deeper into its real-time action combat. This real-time action combat is what originally separated Final Fantasy Adventure from the Final Fantasy series, which was strictly turn-based at the time. 
Visions of Mana's combat continues to look great, as does its beautifully vibrant world. Unfortunately, there's still a few months to go until PlayStation, Xbox, and PC players can play it because it's due out sometime this summer. 

While waiting for its release, check out the Visions of Mana announcement trailer from The Game Awards 2023 last month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obsidian has been working for years on Avowed, a first-person fantasy RPG set in the same world as its excellent Pillars of Eternity games. Unlike the isometric styling of those titles, Avowed is a first-person adventure more in the vein of something like The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or The Outer Worlds.
Today’s Xbox Developer Direct offered a deeper dive into several important aspects of the game, but the standout feature was an explanation of combat, which aims to be action-oriented but still tactically complex. Players are allowed to use customizable loadouts, including selecting different weapons or other tools for each hand. We saw combinations of swords, shields, wands, and spell usage, and pistols. Once in combat, the mix of various offensive skills with defensive capabilities like b…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox is laying out its road ahead with the Developer Direct 2024. Obsidian started the show today, sharing some new looks at Avowed as it heads for a Fall 2024 window.


Today, we got a deeper look at the first-person RPG from Obsidian Entertainment. Set in the same world as Pillars of Eternity, Eora, Avowed is a more action-oriented approach. And a decent chunk of the opening minutes of today's look covered the scrapping, from magic and swords to flintlock-style pistols. Heck, you can even wield a bunch of wands, if you want. More wands means more magic, after all.


We see some reptilian combatants wielding a breadth of equipment, including shields and ranged weapons. Obsidian says you'll be able to set loadouts for combat and swap between them, letting the player quickly swap around for whatever approach you need. It seems pretty customizable, though I'm not completely sold on it.

Part of Avowed also looks to involve some light mystery-solving. We see some segments of the player talking with various NPCs, trying to discern whether a private is telling the truth or lying, possibly even confronting him. Whatever the player chooses, consequences follow.


Fantasy lands await


We also got a look at the vistas and locales waiting in Avowed. There are lots of different biomes to explore, from forests to deserts, all falling under the general high fantasy umbrella.


As for news on a date, we just have the window of Fall 2024. It was good to see a little bit more of what Avowed has in store, though today's look didn't really hold surprises for those expecting a first-person fantasy RPG. I'm curious to see how Avowed will set itself apart when it arrives later on this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Ninja Theory appeared on Microsoft's Xbox Developer Direct stream to discuss its sequel, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II. The big news from the footage is the game finally has a release date: May 21. Microsoft also confirmed that the game will be a digital-only release.
The developer revealed it is in the final months of development and outlined some elements to expect from Hellblade II. Senua is not in as much fear of her voices as she was in the original game, but she is still a Celtic warrior who struggles with psychosis. Like the first game, Ninja Theory is working with professionals like Cambridge's Paul Fletcher to ensure Senua represents an accurate version of someone struggling with complex mental issues.
There are a number of new characters she will interact with. Some will appreciate her perspective and consider her an ally, but others will reject her and consider her an enemy. Like the original game, Hellblade II takes 10th century Iceland (which the developer visited for research), and she is fighting against Vikings who are enslaving her people. Ninja Theory is focused on making the game historically accurate but with an obvious layer of fantasy on top.
Combat has been overhauled for the sequel, with the game focusing on the fact that Senua is not a superhero. The goal of the combat is to make players feel like they barely survived each encounter, and the gameplay footage of the combat looks brutal.
Ninja Theory ended the stream saying it hopes to "craft life-changing art with game-changing tech." We will determine if the game lives up to that lofty goal on May 21.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Farmed robbery.
After getting a taste of the criminal life in Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion, the cheeky root vegetable returns in Turnip Boy Robs A Bank to, uh, rob a bank—multiple times. While the original game was a charming action-adventure title, the sequel takes inspiration from the likes of Enter the Gungeon and The Binding of Isaac to present an addictive roguelike experience with quick, simplistic gameplay loops and generous rewards to keep you coming back for more, despite some pretty severe performance issues on the Switch at launch.
For those who enjoyed Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion specifically for its jaunty spin on the classic Zelda formula, the shift over to a roguelike setup might feel a bit odd and offputting at first (and if you’re completely against the genre as a whole, then this isn’t for you). That said, its cute aesthetic and absurd cast of characters allows Turnip Boy Robs A Bank to make the transition relatively seamlessly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been hankering for a new tactical mech shooter, the first game from KEK Entertainment fits the bill. Armor Attack is in the works at a team comprised of former EA and Ubisoft devs, and it's due out sometime this year.


Armor Attack is billed as a crossplay game with PC, Mac, iOS, and Android listed as its starting platforms. A console release is planned for an as-yet-undetermined date, and you can see how it looks in action in the announcement trailer below. 




At a glance, customization is going to play a large role in the tactics at hand. Each vehicle has its own advantages and disadvantages, and you can tweak your loadout in different ways depending on the  desired playstyle. Abilities, weapons, talent systems, and other aspects will lend themselves well to certain objectives, and this combines with the different styles inherent to the three main factions. Naturally, everybody wants to rule the world, so these factions are all about trying their best to control the last remnants of a wartorn Earth. 


The key styles at play are defense, damage, and battlefield exploitation, the latter of which sounds like it might have something to do with the "game-changing mechanic" on each map. These range from changes to the overall layout to large boss enemies and the availability of vantage points that offer a competitive edge. KEK Entertainment CEO and co-founder Georgy Egorov says they want to offer the "ultimate mecha shooter experience for friends to enjoy across PC, mobile, and consoles without sacrificing caliber." We'll see how that pans out soon.

In this latest, gruesome escapade from Sparky Marky developers Clapperheads, you are a zookeeper working the night shift. Your job, initially, is to feed the incarcerated animals and clean up after them while giving them an occasional pat on the nose. But Something Is Wrong. Giraffes aren't supposed to have that many legs, or mandibles. Kangaroos aren't supposed to stick to the ceiling, or have several sets of teeth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year was a fantastic year for games, with standout triple-A releases like Baldur's Gate 3, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and great independent games like Jusant, Sea of Stars, and countless others. But in 2023 alone, more than 10,000 developers and people in games-adjacent industries were laid off. Plus, the unchecked rise of A.I. continued, and Unity burned developers with its controversial new game engine policies, not to name a few other not-so-great parts about 2023 – it was a great year for games but one of the worst for those who make them. 
Now, just as 2024 has begun, the Game Developers Conference has released its 12th annual State of the Game Industry report. Its data was collected from 3000 developers surveyed back in October of last year…]]></summary>

Where did the low-poly grape meme come from?


For a time after the initial release of Endwalker in December 2021, the grapes found in Labyrinthos became a source of player amusement because of their low-poly, blocky appearance. Although these grapes were soon updated, and their appearance brought more in line with the standard we know and love FFXIV for, the meme persevered.


With Patch 6.01, FFXIV developers explained that the low-poly appearance of the grapes was intended to alleviate system memory within the area, before going on to s…]]></summary>

It's safe to say that over the last few years, Square Enix has been pumping out games faster than Marvel sends its Disney+ shows out to die. Heck, we even tackled the company's insane cadence back in 2022 to try and figure out what on earth was going on at the Japanese firm.
As we head into 2024, however, a Q&A from Square Enix's financial briefing back in November 2023 revealed that it's now looking to slim down its lineup going forward to ensure higher quality (thanks, Genki).

Since then, it has failed to rise above 'Mixed' review rating on Steam, not helped by Starbreeze releasing a £15 DLC pack when many players were unhappy with the game they'd just bought for £35.

Today, Atlus and Vanillaware are sharing more details about the upcoming tactics RPG.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is now available, and if you’re a fan of games like Metroid, Castlevania, or Hollow Knight, and you don’t have it on your radar, that’s probably a mistake. The game is a thrilling adventure, with plenty of excellent combat, puzzle, and traversal challenges. Once you get far enough in the game, you’ll likely encounter one of the most challenging of them all; The Impossible Climb is a late-game platforming/traversal sidequest that demands careful timing, patience, and the use of nearly all the powers you’ve earned up to that point in the story. If you want to prove your mastery of The Lost Crown, it’s the sequence you’ll want to tackle.

It's currently unclear how many people 10 percent of the company translates, too, considering CI Games is a publisher that also owns studios like Lords of the Fallen developer Hexworks and Sniper Ghost Warrior developer Underdog Studio.

        <updated>2024-01-18T14:30:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just over a week ago, I mentioned how Nvidia was launching three GPUs in the new RTX 4000 SUPER range. Now, the first one of the bunch has been released, offering a bit of a performance boost compared to its predecessor.


The 4070 SUPER came out yesterday, and it already appears to be fairly popular. While sites like Newegg do have models from ZOTAC, GIGABYTE, ASUS, and more, there are quite a few that have sold out. Amazon UK appears to have limited stocks at the time of writing. A report from Videocardz points to a few brands that are already out of stock, so it seems like you might want to get in quick lest supplies run out.




Prices for the SUPER graphics card can be as low as $549 and as high as $759 (if not more), depending on where you get it from and which model you opt for.


Compare and contrast


Showing up to 14% improvement over the non-SUPER variant, the RTX 4070 SUPER is what you would expect from a somewhat souped-up version of a modern graphics card.


While it still retains 12GB of GDDR6X of memory – similar to the regular 4070 – it does boast more CUDA cores and a slight increase in its clock speed. It also has a higher TGP, now requiring an additional 20W of power.


It also appears as though the RTX 4070 has been given a price drop, so if you're not in the mood for a new-new graphics card from Nvidia, you could always go for the standard variant. The RTX 4070 Ti SUPER and RTX 4080 SUPER are due to release on January 24 and January 31, respectively.

The publication says those with knowledge of the situation at the studio said the layoffs only affected people at Behaviour's Montreal, Canada studio, with those 45 affected let go last week, between January 9 and 11. 
However, Kotaku notes it was also told layoffs at the company began in December. The layoffs reportedly included cuts in various departments at the studio. Last month, Behaviour Interactive announced it was working with Until Dawn developer Supermassive Games on The Casting of Frank Stone, a new single player game set in the Dead by Daylight universe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You don't need me to tell you how highly praised Baldur's Gate 3 has been since it dropped last August. It's won multiple awards and is currently one of the top-selling games on Steam right now. So let's talk about Star Wars for a bit.


Well, we're still in Baldur's Gate territory, but this relates to a mod for the game that brings some of Lucas' IP to Larian Studios' release. As spotted by DSO Gaming, Nexus Mods user Palmaman33 has given us the ability to wield a lightsaber in BG3's otherwise magical, fantasy-based world.


Image via Palmaman33/Nexus Mods.


The modder rationalizes their decision to mix fantasy with sci-fi by saying that "even in a world of dragons and wizards, nothing cuts through the darkness quite like a lightsaber." Indeed.


[Insert lightsaber sound here]


Palmaman33 goes on to say that the download grants you five color variants of the Star Wars weapon, as well as five variants: Legendary, Very Rare, Rare, Uncommon, and Common. They can be spawned via a tutorial chest from a separate mod or purchased from a trader.


Baldur's Gate 3 really does feel like one of those games that people are going to stick with for some time. Will it have the longevity of something like Skyrim? Who can say at this stage? It's a tall order, but someone's got to knock Bethesda's 2011 epic off its pedestal sooner or later.


And no, I still haven't got around to playing BG3 yet. Do you think if I keep mentioning that in my posts, my editor will give me a free copy? Xbox Series X if you're asking...

Toward the end of 2023, it was revealed that a Donkey Kong expansion would be making its way to Super Nintendo World in Universal Studios Japan. Now, thanks to some keen investigation from CoasterTalk (thanks, Gizmodo), some more information has been discovered regarding the site's new rollercoaster ride.
The ride, which is based on the mine cart segments of classic Donkey Kong Country games, is designed to send passengers flying into the air, simulating moments in which Donkey Kong would leap over broken rails in-game. To achieve this, the ride is operated via a hidden track, which holds the cart in the air to make it look like it's running on a visible track.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers may remember how much I liked Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion, principally because of how funny it was. It was an intelligent and somewhat loving take on a Zelda-y RPG - a small town hero gets a sword and goes on a rampage fighting some bosses - except the main character is a turnip. And also he tears up any paperwork handed to him. Turnip Boy Robs A Bank follows directly on from his Tax Evasion, and it's not quite as funny or as focused, but it's also an entirely different genre of game, and I have a huge amount respect for that.

That's where we're at now in Turnip Boy Robs a Bank, a sequel that delivers a heist both sprawling and suitably snack-sized.


Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion launched in 2021 as a cute and snappy Zelda-style adventure, clocking in at a breezy couple hours at best. It came off as both sendup and parody, frequently breaking the fourth wall in an almost "I'm a little nervous to be a video game" manner. Flash forward a few years and we're clearly working with a more confident team at developer Snoozy Kazoo. Turnip Boy Robs a Bank doesn't exactly turn the concept of the first game on its head, but it goes about its structure in a more novel …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another chance.
Our first big Switch exclusive of 2024 arrives nice and early and, rather than assuming the form of one of Nintendo's bigger franchises — we got Fire Emblem Engage this time last year — we are instead winding the clock back to 2005 and 2009 respectively, to dive into swish remakes of a pair of cult classic adventures from the DS and Wii.
Another Code: Two Memories (Trace Memory in the US — which you can find reviewed here) and its sequel, Another Code R: A Journey Into Lost Memories, may not have been the most obvious of ways to kickstart a new year, but they are a deep cult cut that have deservedly garnered a following over the years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I skipped over Trace Memory when it was released on DS back in 2005. I wasn’t into the adventuresome puzzle-solving genre at the time because I was boring. So, I got to go into Another Code: Recollection with fresh eyes.


That’s probably fine, because Another Code: Recollection isn’t just a collection of Another Code: Two Memories (Trace Memory) and Another Code: R – A Journey into Lost Memories. Neither is it a remaster that simply heightens the graphics to the Switch’s standards. If you wondered how the puzzle mechanics that were reliant on the DS or Wii hardware got transferred to the Switch, they didn’t. 


Another Code: Recollection is more accurately based on the two Another Code titles. It lies somewhere between a remake and a complete reimagining.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another Code: Recollection is perhaps the best kind of remake. It takes two well-liked yet obscure graphic puzzle adventures in 2005's Trace Memory for DS, and 2009's Another Code: R - Journey Into Lost Memories for Wii (which never launched in the U.S.) and gives them a graphical and mechanical overhaul to make them readily available to a new audience.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they show off Recollection's improvements and additions compared to the originals and discuss why you may not want to sleep on these adventures this time around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fate/Samurai Remnant has been out since September 2023, but it only recently received a demo to entice players who haven't touched the amazing game yet. 


The demo gives you a small slice of what the whole game possesses. It's pretty long, so for some, it won't be enough to fully grasp it. Nevertheless, if you were on the fence about this title, the demo should convince you if it's worth your money. 




I tried out the demo on the Steam Deck, and it's not different from what you're getting in the full game, which should be good news for completionists. It's also worth mentioning that your progress in your demo playthrough can be transferred to the full game.


The demo comes after it receives a teaser trailer letting players know DLC is on the way, and it'll feature characters, including Servants, servants from the main game. 




In my review of the game, I praised it and highlighted how it's inviting to both longtime franchise fans and newcomers. With the free demo, Omega Force has given you yet another reason to try this title.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda has announced The Elder Scrolls: Castles, a new mobile experience from the team behind Fallout Shelter.
Like Fallout Shelter, Castles is a management sim, with Bethesda stating in an X post that “you'll build your own dynasty where every day in our world is a year in the game's world. Citizens are born, they die, rulers change, and can be betrayed.” Players control their own castle over multiple generations of rulers, families, and subjects. Decision-making dictates how well your kingdom operates and how content your subjects are; unhappy citizens may plot to overthrow you. 
Your castle can be expanded with new rooms and items, plus workstations for underlings. It appears to feature a turn-based combat system with players equipping heroes with gear to battle enemies and gather resources to grow their kingdom. Though the game's App Store page states that it includes in-game purchases, it is unclear if Castles is free-to-play or not. 
The Elder Scrolls: Castles has soft-launched in the Philippines and will become available in other regions over the next few months. It is the third mobile game in the series, following The Elder Scrolls: Blades, a traditional RPG, in 2019 and The Elder Scrolls: Legends, a collectible card game, in 2017.]]></summary>

According to Hollywood Reporter, PlayStation Productions and Screen Gems are adapting 2015’s Until Dawn with director David F. Sandburg and writer Gary Dauberman. The original tale revolved around eight teens surviving a fear-filled hell in the middle of a wintry retreat, entrusting their fate with the player.

Apparently, Square Enix is bored of all of us comparing its foam-shooter with Nintendo’s popular ink-shooter.

At first, runners might try to simply finish a game as fast as possible. Then, they might try to fully finish it, or complete certain objectives, or hit credits with limiters on themselves. It's that last bucket that CarcinogenSDA's run of Resident Evil 2 Remake at AGDQ 2024 falls under.


I've been a fan of Carci's speedrunning for a while. His AGDQ 2018 run of Resident Evil 7 is an easy recommendation for anyone who wants to see someone exemplify their mastery of a game by quickly adjusting their run on the fly. Last night at AGDQ 2024, Carcinogen took the stage with one simple, but incredibly difficult, objective: make it to the end of either Leon or Claire's route in Resident Evil…]]></summary>

The service saw some heavy hitters arrive in the first half of the month, including Assassin's Creed Valhalla and the Resident Evil 2 remake. But it's not done yet. More games are coming to Game Pass to round out January.


For fans of psychological horror, one such game is already available to download. Those Who Remain, a story-driven horror game, is now on Game Pass — as of January 16. The game did earn some rather mixed reviews when it launched in 2020 but now sits with a 'Mostly Positive' rating on Steam.

Harmonix released a blog post confirming news that January 25 will see the last batch of DLC released for the 2015 rhythm title. The announcement came as a surprise to fans of the series, and it's sure to get the remaining dedicated players a bit emotional. 




Saying that Rock Band 4's DLC journey began in 2015 isn't quite accurate, though. It really started in 2007 following the release of the original Rock Band.


One of the beautiful things about the Rock Band series is that fans who followed Harmonix across Rock Band, Rock Band 2, Rock Band 3, and Rock Band 4 could bring their song libraries with the…]]></summary>

Coincidentally, the last game I felt this conflicted over was Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, but for dramatically different reasons, as the only things they have in common are the IP and unstable performance.


While the 2022 title was a horde shooter, Owlcat's take on the 40,000 universe is the first CRPG entry. It shares a lot in common with the developer's previous Pathfinder games but stands out in the library. Again, that's in positive and negative ways.


Rogue Trader is a brilliant game, but it could've been fantastic, and that's what's frustrating about it. For every shining quality, there's usually something tacked on detrimental to the overall experience. It's a grim, haunt…]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-01-17T20:28:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thunderful Group is joining the growing list of companies undergoing significant layoffs, as it's announced it will be letting go of about 20% of its staff.


In a press statement, Thunderful Group states that “actions will include both significant staff reductions and evaluation of divestment of non-strategic assets.” It then goes into how much money these cuts will make, which is rather ghoulish. The company states that it employs around 500 people, so a 20% cut will be around 100 people losing their jobs.


“We have found no alternative other than to reduce costs and focus the business on areas with the best future growth and profitability prospects,” said CEO Martin Walfisz in a statement. “It has been difficult to make these decisions, and it saddens me that we will have to say goodbye to many skilled colleagues and partners. Nevertheless, I am convinced that this is a necessary direction for Thunderful and that these changes will make the company a stronger player in the market.”


Thunderful Group has its fingers in a lot of pies, but notably, they are the parent company of Thunderful Publishing, Headup Games, and Rising Star Games, focused on the publishing of indie and alternative games. There are a lot of developers under their umbrellas as well. They didn't extrapolate on what these "non-strategic assets" are that they're looking at divesting, so I can only imagine the anxiety at some of these companies right now.


The changing of the year is a largely arbitrary barrier, but I was hoping 2024 would be a lot quieter when it comes to layoffs. Instead, it seems as though it’s continuing the same momentum with little signs of stopping. With live service games faltering and companies beginning to experiment with generative AI, things could still get worse.

Today, however, the studio announced the end of Rock Band 4 downloadable content.
The news comes more than two years after Harmonix was acquired by Fortnite and Unreal Engine developer Epic Games. Epic has since leveraged the studio's expertise for a side game within Fortnite called Fortnite Festival, which utilizes gameplay similar to the Rock Band.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian CEO Swen Vincke has been reading Ubisoft director of subscriptions Philippe Tremblay's thoughts from yesterday about how players need to "get comfortable" with renting their games as a package, rather than "having and owning" an individual copy. His broad takeaway is: that ain't it, chief. In a social media thread today, Vincke wrote that "it's going to be a lot harder to get good content if subscription becomes the dominant model and a select group gets to decide what goes to market and what not". He feels that "direct from developer to players is the way". As such you shouldn't expect Baldur's Gate 3, Divinity: Original Sin 2 or any other Larian RPGs to join the Game Pass bandwagon anytime soon.

Developed by Lazy Bear Games and published by Riot Forge Games, Bandle Tale lets fans play as their own Yordle in the quirky Bandle City as they craft a plethora of goods for its inhabitants.




A Yordle's life for me


I recently had the opportunity to get a glimpse of the gameplay in Bandle Tale: A League of Legends Story and let me start by saying it is certainly a Lazy Bear Games title. Graveyard Keeper is one of my favorite games and I often find myself going back to it when I'm in the mood for in-depth crafting. Based on what I saw, it appears as though Bandle Tale pushes the massive crafting systems Lazy Bear is known for to the next level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There aren't many quality flight titles to choose from on the Nintendo Switch. But the console's library will be adding one this summer as Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown is officially inbound. 


Bandai Namco dropped a new trailer confirming the news today. The Switch port of the 2019 air combat sim looks solid in trailer form, but we'll have to wait until its July 11 release date to see if it runs as well as its PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One counterparts. 




The Switch iteration of Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown is the Deluxe Edition, which includes a trio of original aircraft sets, three additional single-player missions, two more real-world planes in the F-104C -Avril and the F-4E Phantom II, a music player mode, and added skins and emblems from prior entries in the Ace Combat series. 


Destructoid considered Ace Combat 7 a return to form for the series in our January 2019 review. It was lauded for its meticulous detail of real-world aircraft, ambitious “airborne Metal Gear“ story, and a soundtrack that keeps your adrenaline pumping as you engage in epic aerial combat. 


Four additional DLC packs are coming to Switch post-launch, all of which have already landed on the other consoles previously mentioned. They are the Original Aircraft Series Set, the Experimental Aircraft Series Set, the Cutting-edge Aircraft Series Set, and the Top Gun: Maverick Aircraft Set.


It's unclear whether these post-launch DLC sets will be included as part of the Deluxe Edition package or whether Bandai Namco will sell them as additional packages. But, guessing from the inclusion of the Top Gun: Maverick set, the content will likely be offered at a premium. 


We'll see how the Nintendo Switch version of Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown fares when it takes off on July 11.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When cute crafting RPG Bandle Tale: A League Of Legends Story was first announced at the end of last year, I don't think I really appreciated the fact it was going to be the next game from the devs behind mortuary farming-me-do Graveyard Keeper. I keep turning this fact over in my head as I watch Lazy Bear Games' associate producer Vlada Redko play a portion of Bandle Tale over Discord for me, with creative director Nikita Kulaga and Riot Forge's creative director Rowan Parker telling me about what's happening onscreen in front of me. As Redko explores the whimsical, knitting-themed city of Bandle as one of League Of Legends' tiny fluffy Yordle creatures, it is, to put it lightly, quite the tonal shift from their previous work. But don't let its cute looks fool you.
This is a crafting RPG with a ferociously long set of skill trees to master, with 40-60 hours' worth of new abilities to learn, objects to construct, errands to run, friends to enlist and - crucially - parties to throw. For in the Bandle woods of Runeterra, life's problems are solved by having a good old fashioned boogie, including the rather urgent issue of fixing the world's portal network, which has collapsed in a mysterious accident. It may have a softer, fluffier-looking surface than Graveyard Keeper, but underneath it looks as though there's just as much to dig into here, so here's what I've learned so far ahead of its release on February 21st.

Developed by apparent Macbeth fans Walking Tree Games GmbH, and published by Starbreeze, it's a heavily horror-themed tribe management sim with a roguelike campaign loop, set in what the developers are calling the "Lovecraftian Stone Age", with flagrant disregard for my nerves.

The Maiden’s Rhapsody is an FFXIV event celebrating the final chapter of FFXI, Rhapsodies of Vana’diel. With the theme of the upcoming Dawntrail Alliance Raid series being “Echoes of Vana’diel”, it makes sense to bring this event back for a fifth time this year, despite the fact that its last previous appearance was only in 2022.


During the event, you accompany Remumu, a reporter from the Harbor Herald, while fighting through a series of four event FATEs. Throughout the story, you’ll meet Iroha, the main heroine of the Rhapsodies of Vana’diel in FFXI, helping to restore her memory of the past.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I enjoy Games Done Quick, an organisation that raises money for charity (this year is the Prevent Cancer Foundation) by playing games at peak efficiency. If you've never watched it before, I recommend loading up the Twitch stream at about 1am and sort of gently dissociating while someone plays an 80s NES game you've never heard of. Speaking of, one of the headline acts for this year's stream - which is running through to this Sunday 21st - was Peanut Butter, a shiba inu trained to press buttons on command, "playing" a NES game that came out in 1985. Although Peanut Butter obeyed his training, some technical issues colluded to snatch a world best time from him - but he raised many thousands of dollars, so good for him.
Peanut Butter is the latest high tide line in the efforts to put more weird and difficult hurdles between you and the controls of games when speedrunning or streaming them. And I must ask: where next? A cat? A snapping turtle biting pressure sensors? A Grey parrot to play a game without any input from you at all? Where will this madness end!?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Still the gaming behemoth it's been since it was released over twelve years ago, Minecraft continues to sell in droves. Much of that is its mass appeal of allowing near-infinite build potential. But the recent release of the Planet Earth III DLC probably isn't hurting things, either.


Inspired by the BBC documentary of the same name, the latest Minecraft content brings more of the natural world to the blocky sandbox game. But it goes beyond just pretty animals. A recent post on the official website gives details on what's in the DLC.




For example, there are a number of scenarios for you to take part in. You can become a fur seal who has to "steer clear of predators," or be the shark that's preying on the blubbery pinniped. There's also a chance to become a musk ox or an arctic wolf as you're "transported to the Canadian tundra in spring."


No narration from Sir David Attenborough, as far as I can tell


Oh, there are quite a few of these scenarios for you to take part in. And when you're done frolicking about the place like a spry impala, you can also check out the BBC Planet Earth Field Station hub.


To this day, it's still quite mind-boggling to see how far this game came from its humble beginnings. With the Minecraft movie now in development, there's some life left to be squeezed out of this ungodly successful IP.


The Planet Earth III content is available now for free for Minecraft: Education Edition and on the marketplace for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

Publisher Atari and developer Dreams Uncorporated have revealed a brand-new narrative trailer for the upcoming Lunar Lander Beyond, a revival of the classic 1979 arcade title.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At some point today, Bethesda was scheduled to roll out a big update for Starfield, complete with bug fixes a-plenty. However, there's been a slight change to that, as the studio has had to delay the patch, but hopefully not by much.


According to a recent post on Twitter, the team has "discovered an issue we want to address" before the Starfield update can see the light of day. It doesn't say what this issue actually is, but Bethesda evidently needs a little more time before it can be sent out.




However, it doesn't seem as though we'll be waiting too long. The tweet goes on to say that the developer is "aiming to release it later this week," but they'll "confirm timing when we know for sure."


Delays can be good, right?


Considering the patch was supposed to be out today, and we're already on Wednesday, you'd be forgiven for thinking Bethesda might miss the boat for this week. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though.


Microsoft already wanted the release date for Starfield pushed back a few months, presumably so it could be polished to a more suitable standard. What we got was, what some might consider, one of the least buggy Bethesda games in a long time. Though that might not be the flex it initially sounds like.


As for the game itself, well...things aren't going great for Todd Howard's dream project. Over on Steam, reviews stand at "Mostly Negative" for recent scores and "Mixed" overall. There's every possibility Bethesda can make something of a U-turn, but the (now-delayed) update is going to have to be a very good omen of things to come.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unhinged Studios has officially announced their roguelite deckbuilder, dev_hell based on the soul-crushing experience of working as a programmer in an office environment. It’s set to release on PC this year.


Before getting paid to write bad words, I spent nine years working in I.T. as a technician. That’s not the same as being an office programmer, but it is adjacent. The biggest difference is that people at least understood that I was going to fix their computer. For normal people, programmers just perform whatever magic they’re told to. And if they can’t perform that magic, they have failed.




Dev_hell puts you in the shoes of a new hire at a tech company looking to “change the future.” Not only do you have to program a lot of questionable features and meet the company’s expectations of you, you also need to exert constant positivity and build relationships with your co-workers. Because when shit hits the wall, you may need a few human shields to protect your career. You constantly add to a growing deck of cards that help you do your job better, or at least make it look like you’re doing your job well.


I feel like most people who have experience working in the office will find the trailer to be unsettlingly familiar. Everything from superficial interactions with co-workers to bafflingly ineffective “incentive” programs. It’s absolutely too damned real. Looks like fun!


Dev_hell is coming to PC sometime in 2024.

This review originally went live in 2014, and we're updating and republishing it to celebrate the game's arrival in Switch's Game Boy Advance library via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.

Back in 2001 (2002 in Europe) some players were left feeling short-changed when Golden Sun reached its abrupt ending. Developer Camelot – perhaps better known for the Shining Force series and, more recently, its Mario sports titles – expanded on its original plan and split the game into two parts. Those who’d already invested in the story had to wait nearly a year and a half for part two, Golden Sun: The Lost Age, to witness the proper ending. Fortunately, newcomers to these JRPGs don't have to face the same agonising wait to see the story through to its conclusion.

Blizzard have formally unveiled the brooding action-RPG's Season 3, aka Season of the Construct, which launches at 6pm GMT and 10am PST on January 23rd, and features a new quest line in which you investigate an ancient technology, the Loom, created by the mage Zoltun Kulle, which has now been purloined by the demon Malphas.
Along the way, you'll both fight deadly arcane constructs (fantasy robots), and enlist one called Ayuzhan as your Seneschal Companion. These machinations aren't just devilish, in other words. They are literal machinations, with all manner of automated foe awaiting beneath the deserts of Kehjistan.

Personally, I'm extremely pleased to see they've added a photo mode, for example, as I spent inordinate amounts of time making Lara do creepy side-eye smiles during inappropriate Shadow Of The Tomb Raider scenes. But I'm also heartened to see they've kept in the original tank controls as an optional extra, alongside a more modern control scheme to make them more approachable.

Now Mintrocket have announced their next game and it seems less likely to cause such confusion. It's called Wakerunners, and it's a team-based "battle action game" about heroes smashing at each other.

It'll have a demo in Steam Next Fest next month and there's a teaser trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wakerunners is the next game from developer Mintrocket, which made a name for itself last year with the excellent Dave the Diver. Mintrocket did confirm to us that Wakerunners is being developed by a different internal team (apparently it has a number of projects from distinct teams going at once), but the pedigree is still worth calling out.
As for the game itself, you can check out the game's teaser trailer below.


Technically, the game was soft-revealed in 2022 as Project TB and is a 4v4 and 5vr top-down competitive action game. The game follows a collection of factions trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic earth. The combat leans on a fast-paced system where players glide across the arena using acceleration and deceleration to their advantage as they engage in close-quarters combat. You will apparently be able to swap characters mid-battle, which will obviously affect strategies.

A demo will be available for the game during the next Steam Next Fest, which will include five different modes and seven playable characters. Right now the game is currently only confirmed for PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Embark Studios surprise-launched its free-to-play FPS, The Finals, back in December – Game Informer documented everything that goes into a stealth release like this – and the game has continued to garner a strong fanbase. Now, just a little over a month since its release, Embark is set to release Update 1.5.0 and a new limited-time mode, Solo Bank It, tomorrow, January 17. 
Embark calls this mode an "experimental" one, pitting 12 single players against each other in PvP matches. The first to obtain a total of 40,000 "Cash wins" takes home the win in Solo Bank It. Similar to standard Bank It, which is already in The Finals, contestants earn Cash by collecting and depositing Coins that drop from eliminated players; Coins can also be found in vaults around the map. 
Watch The Finals Update 1.5.0 trailer for yourself below: 


Elsewhere in this update, Embark is fixing plenty of bugs and making balance changes as well. Plus, Update 1.5.0 "comes with a security update to anti-cheat and fair play" and a store update, too. 
Update 1.5.0 and Solo Bank It go live in The Finals tomorrow, January 17.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2K's tennis series is returning after more than a decade of dormancy with TopSpin 2K25, the company announced today. It did so with a quick teaser trailer revealing that it's "coming soon." Its announcement coincides with 2024's first Grand Slam tennis tournament, the Australian Open, which began Saturday, January 13. 
"Today, 2K revealed the return of TopSpin with the teaser trailer for TopSpin 2K25, the next must-play sports game from 2K that fully immerses fans into the world of tennis," a press release reads. It also notes more information about the game is "to come." 
Watch the TopSpin 2K25 announcement teaser for yourself below: 


2K did not reveal a release date or a release window, but given that "25" is in the title, it's likely releasing either this year or the next. The last TopSpin game was released in 2011 with Top Spin 4 during the Xbox 360/PlayStation 3 generation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto V developer Rockstar Games and Alan Wake 2 studio Remedy Entertainment have a history that goes back years, namely due to the two's work on the Max Payne series. However, the companies are at the center of two trademark disputes filed by Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, as first reported by RespawnFirst. In the disputes, Take-Two takes issue with Remedy's new logo it unveiled in April of last year, which features a stylized "R," claiming it's too similar to Rockstar's own "R" logo. 
The trademark disputes – here and here – were filed in the United Kingdom, and Take-Two, based in New York, is named as the "opponent" in it. The disputes were filed on May 11, 2023, which is a month after Remedy unveiled its new logo. 
Notably, despite the trademark dispute, Rockstar and Remedy are working together on a remake package of Max Payne 1 and 2. In October of last year, Remedy said the Max Payne 1 & 2 remake, which is a single game, has "progressed into a production readiness stage."
While waiting to learn more about this trademark conflict, read Game Informer's review of Alan Wake 2, and then watch the official trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI, which Rockstar plans to release in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 2022 World War II horror game Martha is Dead is the latest video game getting a film adaptation. The game’s Italian developer LKA, is partnering with production company Studios Extraordinares to bring the psychological adventure to the big screen.
Martha is Dead is a first-person adventure that follows identical twin sisters, Guilia, the protagonist, and Martha. Set in Tuscany in 1944, during the final stretch of World War II, the sisters are fathered by a Nazi general and have a strained relationship due to the clear favoritism Martha receives from their mother. However, Martha is suddenly found dead, and their mother mistakenly believes Guilia to be Martha, forcing her to assume her late sister’s identity. Supernatural occurrences abound centering on the malevolent entity known as the White Lady.
The film follows the same premise. Studios Extraordinares is led by screenwriter/directors André Hedetoft and Andreas Troedsson, and the company’s website states it’s a “creative powerhouse writing and making high-end action, horror, and science-fiction films from original stories and extraordinary games.” The studio is also working on bringing last year’s sci-fi horror game Fort Solis to TV and film, as well as a movie adaptation of the upcoming horror shooter Veil. 
We didn’t particularly enjoy what Martha is Dead had to offer as a gameplay experience. In his review, editor Wesley LeBlanc scored the experience a 6 out of 10, writing, “LKA’s love of Italy is the only warmth I felt in Martha is Dead. The rest left me feeling as cold as Giulia’s dead sister.” Given the recent success of video game films like The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Five Nights at Freddy's, here’s hoping Martha is Dead can achieve even a fraction of that success. Or, at the very least, we hope it makes for a better movie than a video game.]]></summary>

Prisons will now have multiple floors to police, as well as a whole new inmate behaviour system to navigate along the way that will feed into gang warfare, escapes and other budding management problems. It's coming out surprisingly soon, too, with its reveal trailer dating it for March 26th.

They've published a new trailer to mark the occasion, in which a group of the game's quarantine zone mercenaries squat around a campfire, supping mugs of what probably isn't cocoa, and listening to guitar music. It strikes a fitting note of world-weariness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer GSC Game World will finally release S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl on September 5. The first-person shooter will launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC. 
The studio announced this release date in a quick trailer released today, which also calls September 5 the "final release date," indicating GSC Game World is confident it won't be delaying its long-awaited shooter any longer. The game was set to release in the first quarter of 2024 before today's delay.
Check out the Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl final release date announcement trailer for yourself below: 


Officially confirmed in 2020, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl has taken some time to get off the ground after various starts and stops. Then, following what appeared to be smoother development, the team paused its work in February 2022 due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, where GSC Game World is based. Employees were forced to evacuate their homes in places like Kyiv, which is Ukraine's capital. Some employees even volunteered to fight for Ukraine – developer Vladimir "Fresh" Yezhov was killed in combat in 2022, as reported by GameRant.
In December 2022, GSC Game World returned with a new S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 gameplay trailer, and we've been waiting on the game ever since. It was set to launch in 2023 before it was delayed to Q1 of this year, and now we know it's coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC on September 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer 11 Bit Studio has unveiled the first full look at Frostpunk 2 gameplay. First announced in August 2021, the sequel to the bleak yet popular city-builder is also coming to Xbox and PC Game Pass.
The trailer provides a look at how decision-making appears in-game. The demands you’ll receive from your citizens appear to be as stressful as the first Frostpunk, as you control a Steward overseeing life in a city situated in an unforgiving tundra where resources are precious and everyone has their own ideas about how society should function. How do you ensure everyone gets fed? What does the education system look like? How do you keep the streets clean of literal and criminal filth? Set 30 years after the original game, citizens can vote to pass laws, and these decisions steer the city’s direction toward multiple outcomes and finales.


11 Bit also announced that Frostpunk 2 is launching on PC Game Pass, alongside Steam, The Epic Store, and GOG, in the first half of 2024. The game will also come to Game Pass on Xbox Series X/S at a later date and is targeting PlayStation 5 as well.

But imagine my shock when I re-installed Immortals Fenyx Rising for the somethingth time, and realised that it has been a comfort game for me all along.
This might make me a massive hypocrite. It's a big Ubisoft RPG filled stuff I complain about modern games having, notably a big map of empty space filled with busywork quests and collectibles. But I don't know what to tell you! It requires concentration but not too much, the set dressing all looks great, and it's doing all that AAA stuff with a wink and a smile, so it's sort of fine. It has fourth wall-breaking meta narration! How can I not like it!

As for the game itself, Foamstars is a 4 vs. 4 online multiplayer game where players take on the role of the titular Fomastars of varying classes and abilities to participate in a game called Foamsmash. Rather than simply shooting your opponent, the goal is to coat them with enough foam so that you can slide-kick them to knock them out of the match. The foam also changes the layout of the arena by creating traversable hills and defensive walls, and you can move through your own foam faste…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having spent what feels like an entire lifetime in JRPG Persona 5 Royal, going back to the original Persona 3 is pretty jarring. It's unsurprising given it came out 18 years ago, but exploration is more akin to a slideshow and dungeon-running to a well-rehearsed routine.
But with an hour of Persona 3 Reload under my belt, P3's  remake felt immediately familiar. It's absolutely built for a seamless transition for P5-likers and takes away some of P5 Royal's learnings, too. Unless something disastrous happens when Reload fully releases, I can't ever see myself returning to the original.

Ever since I got my hands on Persona 3 Reload over the summer, I've described it to folks as "Persona 3 redone in the form of Persona 5 Royal." While that may be a gross oversimplification, it's also pretty high praise. Longtime fans of the Persona series point towards Persona 3 as the entry that changed the course of the series, pointing it down the path it's been on for nearly the last two decades. While Persona 3 may be the most important entry from a mechanical perspective, Persona 5 has the most mainstream relevance, particularly in 2024.

Well, that's exactly what early access co-op FPS Contain is going for, where four of you gear up in tactical clobber and clear corners of military chumps and anomalous… rumps? It's a mixture of Rainbow Six, a bit of Stalker, and maybe a touch of Control, with gameplay showing real promise. It's also got me thinking about unexpectedly scary moments in shooters, too.

That title is… Dawnwalker. They’ve also shared a new teaser image, which I think could depict one of two things: a) a vampiric or otherwise supernaturally-inclined hero flying through the air care of a Dishonored-style Blink teleport, sword raised and clawed fingers stretched towards an unseen foe against a blood-red backdrop. Or b) a man with his trousers aflame swinging through the window of a second floor spa while attempting to use his umbrella as a parachute, having received only half a pedicure before the building caught fire.

It's, technically, I suppose, a horror game about manning a call line through a 90s CRT-screen PC, where people will be like "my kitchen is full of droppings that look like coffee grounds, what do?". You look through your list of potential household hazards and select the right one, so your caller gets sent the info on dealing with cockroaches. Except as your week at HSH goes on, your calls start to be less roaches, more "my house smells like death and my dog is acting strangely" or "I can see someone looking through my window at night and hear them breathing heavily."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In February 2022, former designers from CD Projekt Red announced the formation of a new studio called Rebel Wolves. The team revealed its first project would be, unsurprisingly, an RPG, and today, we learned a couple more details about the game, including its title.
The game is called Dawnwalker, and Rebel Wolves describes it as a “story-driven dark fantasy role-playing adventure.” Billed as being the team's dream RPG project, the game has officially entered the alpha stage of development, and Rebel Wolves plans to share more information about it later this year. 
The studio also announced another CD Projekt alumni Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz as the game’s creative director. Tomaszkiewicz work includes Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales.
“We want to craft a world that you will want to explore and dive deep into and tell stories that make you care about the characters,” said Tomaszkiewicz in a press release. “We aim to deliver an experience that will allow for a variety of choices and room for experimentation when replayed. Helping craft this experience with so many talented people will be my mission at Rebel Wolves, and I can't wait for everyone to see what the team has been up to for quite a while now.”
Rebel Wolves didn’t share any more info on Dawnwalker, so questions about its premise, narrative, mechanics, and platforms will go unanswered until hopefully later this year. Until then, the team did release a piece of promotional art, posted above, that should help fuel imaginations of what the team is cooking.]]></summary>

Very soon, in fact.

        <updated>2024-01-15T17:34:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has released Tekken 8’s opening cinematic to whet fans' appetite for the game as its release date draws ever closer. The publisher also confirmed that long-time favorite Eddy Gordo will kick off the roster of Season 1 DLC fighters.
The intro cinematic is impressively rendered and, in true Tekken fashion, utterly absurd. In addition to seeing the main cast throwdown with implausible displays of martial arts, we even see them engage in a full-on battle reminiscent of the Wakanda fight in Avengers: Infinity War. 


The video concludes with the reveal that Eddy Gordo is joining the roster this spring. Since his first appearance in Tekken 3, Eddy has been both beloved and reviled for his extremely effective use of Capoeira, so we're excited to see new tricks he has up his sleeves. 
In a neat behind-the-scenes twist, the trailer shows off some of the motion capture and animation that went into bringing Eddy into the current generation of Tekken. Eddy is the first of four characters that will be added to Tekken 8 throughout the year for purchasers of the Year 1 Season Pass or owners of the Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions of the game in which the pass is included.
Tekken 8 launches on January 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can read our impressions of the game’s Story mode and Arcade mode here.]]></summary>

It's probably officially too far into January to get away with saying Happy New Year now, but stuff it, I'll wish you a good one anyway, as well as a warm welcome back to Letter From The Editor. This month's letter can be considered very much a part two to the one I wrote in November, in which we had a sneaky peek at the behind the scenes process of putting together our annual RPS Advent Calendar (or in regular video game website speak, our big games of the year feature). 
We always have a big old voting barney around November time to decide which games do or don't make the cut in our Advent Calendar (that is: we all submit top ten lists and we count up the votes afterwards), and every year lots of you try and guess which ones will make it over on the RPS Discord. Inevitably, there are only so many slots for what is always a heck of a lot of games put forward, but the key question has always been thus: who voted for what? WELL. For the first time ever, come and find out below as we reveal all.

But, with little over a month to go until the game's release, Square Enix has released a new trailer that teases a climactic fight between protagonist Cloud Strife and his arch-enemy, Sephiroth. 
Running exactly one minute long, this "Destined for Rebirth" trailer features new gameplay, shots of our party of characters like Tifa, Barret, Yuffie, Aerith, and more, and lots of Sephiroth. It also features the game's excellent combat theme, and while some might call it cheesy, it's pretty cool to see shots of Sephiroth and Cloud timed to the rhythm of said theme. 
Check out the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth "Destined for Rebirth" trailer for yourself below: 


Final Fantasy VII Rebirth hits PS5 on February 29, 2024.

Set in 1918, it puts you in charge of a field hospital in northern France, a few minutes drive from the frontline. Here’s how all that works: casualties arrive from the trenches by ambulance or stretcher, and are carried by your medics to a clearing station, where nurses look after them before they’re seen by a doctor. Patients may be lightly or severely injured, but they will all eventually die if they’re left unattended.

You betcha.
Twilight Oracle isn't immune to the kind of counter-intuitive puzzle solves that are sort of inherent to the genre (use pineapple on wallet, etc.), but there's a demo to see for yourself, and I thought it'd be just as well to make more of you aware of it before it comes out on the 30th of January. Also because I wanted to point out that one of the reasons I have been enjoying Twilight Oracle is the colour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Combine the turn-based mech battles of Into The Breach with the rule-changing puzzling of Baba Is You and you have Mobile Suit Baba, whose launch I entirely missed right before Christmas. Pick a squad of mechs to field in different scenarios where you must push, pull, and slam your way to victory. All of which will be so much easier if you rewrite the rules by shunting around syntax blocks. And yes, Baba is piloting a giant Baba-shaped mech.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given the sheer quantity of games releasing on Steam these days, having a neat little elevator pitch for your game can be vital in helping it stand out. For example, if I get an email saying a game is like "Obra Dinn meets such and such" or "Into The Breach but a deckbuilder", that's like personal catnip to me, and can be a handy indicator of whether I should investigate further - maybe watch a gameplay trailer for it, say, or see if it's got a demo. Case in point: this is exactly how I stumbled upon the upcoming Donkey Kong Country-esque platformer Windswept last week, although instead of an email, I saw it on the growing "Your game is too much like..." thread over on Xwitter - which is definitely worth a browse if you have very niche interests in need of a good scratch.

Because Ark: Survival Ascended developers Studio Wildcard and Grove Street Games are promising/threatening to "put the power of unbridled game creation directly in your hands" with the game's next major dev kit update, which will release by the end of January.
This will greatly expand the game's moddability, though concrete details are thin on the ground. It'll ship with a "Mario-inspired" platformer to show you how. There's also a dev kit update planned next week for multiplayer spin-off Ark: The Survival Of The Fittest. This will allow you to "sculpt the ultimate battlegrounds where your fellow ARK survivors will fight to see who will be the ultimate survivor".

Jordon Longbottom faced a private criminal prosecution brought by the Federation Against Copyright Theft but avoided a custodial sentence after the case failed to be brought in a timely fashion. Overcrowding in UK prisons was also taken into consideration, undermining claims that small-time pirates risk custodial sentences.

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for Orion Burger, the classic game by Sanctuary Woods. The engine also adds a few niceties that the original didn't have, such as mouse wheel handling, and using the spacebar to skip walk animations - something the original didn't do properly.
Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game's logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation. And please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, luck be with you. And remember, with the aliens cheating on the tests they set up for you, this will be no easy task.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

Out tomorrow on Steam for £10.23, $11.99 or €11.83 including the 20% launch discount, this first instalment in the Crystal Story series blends the cuddly feel of a 16-bit Zelda with the dream logic of a Yume Nikki. There's a splash of Undertale's crackpot experimentalism to the writing and certain battles, as well. 


Those are big comparisons to invoke, and I don't expect Crystal Story to measure up to them. But it's a lot better than I was expecting from a game whose title had me picturing microtransaction-sodden levelling systems and a pouty elf in a bikini.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers, I have good news and bad news. Good news. My mum got me an incredible hot chocolate maker for Christmas this year, as well as a jumbo-sized box of grated chocolate sachets to use with it. It is, quite honestly, one of the best presents she's ever given me, and it now means I can have perfect hot chocolate, practically on tap, in as little as three minutes. Hotel Chocolat's Velvetiser, you're an absolute beauty. Honestly, it is so much better than anything I could make, or have made, myself. It's fast, easy, wonderfully smooth and properly delicious hot chocolate. Crucially, the machine itself is also dead simple to clean. Gone are the days I have to worry about washing up a pan of semi-encrusted milk afterwards, or faffing about with how many teaspoons of hot chocolate powder to plonk in because I accidentally coughed and sent half of it flying all over the counter.
Bad news. This recent revelation of such effortless, technological ease has instantly kneecapped any excitement or desire I might have had for Kitfox Games' new tea brewing sim they announced at the tail end of last year, or indeed any other kind of drink-based simulation game (of which there seem to be an increasing number of these days). Whereas before I might have revelled in the step-by-step process of making a perfect hot drink, I have now been fully converted to the ways of instant button pressing and time-saving efficiency. After all, why dwell on the manual minutiae when machinery is king?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Titan Forge Games and publisher Hi-Rez Studios have announced Smite 2, a sequel to Smite that is rebuilding the third-person action MOBA from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. There's no release date for the sequel, but Titan Forge Games says it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. Closed early alpha testing will begin this spring. 
The team says Smite 2 will feature a diverse roster of Gods from all sorts of mythological pantheons around the world, and while some playable gods will stay true to how they perform in Smite, others "will have new animations, FX, and even reimagined abilities."

It's come some way since, but its edges are still a little rough, with (usually) minor bugs and limited feedback wrapped up in a design that's influenced, of course, by that vague shimmering ghost of Rogue (and thus is innately bad and you're all just wrong). So yeah, it kinda has problems.
But I like it. Weird, huh?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CES 2024 is drawing to a close, and honestly, I’m not especially sad to see it go. While the Las Vegas tech megashow is probably the closest thing PC gaming hardware has to an E3 (and in some ways surpasses it, given CES still exists), this year’s event has been characterised by an all-too-credulous obsession with AI nonsense. Not the fun/useful DLSS kind that makes your games run faster – more the kind that replaces actual creative work with dubiously-sourced robot media. Icky stuff, even by Vegas standards.
Mercifully, not everyone was there to flog Stable Diffusion boxes and imaginary ChatGPT friends, so there is actually some interesting new kit to look forward to in 2024. I’ve rounded up the highlights here, along with some of the more questionable AI-based showings – because they may well merit discussion, even if that discussion amounts to "Is this a good idea?" followed by "No."

Discord CEO Jason Citron cites overhiring, which has led to the company becoming "less efficient" in how it operates. The layoffs affected people across various departments. 
The Verge obtained an internal memo from Citron sent to employees announcing the layoffs, which have already happened. That memo explained why the layoffs were happening, when affected employees would receive the email telling them they no longer have a job, and follow-up meetings for those who remain at Discord.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sand Land, the video game adaptation of Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama’s manga of the same name, has a release date and a new trailer setting up the story.
First announced during Summer Game Fest last year, Sand Land launches on April 26. The game centers on the Fiend Prince Beelzebub, a demon summoned to take down a corrupt King and his Royal Army by the human Sheriff Rao. Joined by Beelzebub’s chaperone, Thief, the three must also find the Legendary Spring, an artifact capable of ending a worldwide drought that has transformed the environment into a desert. 


The open-world action RPG features plenty of vehicle piloting and combat. Players take control of various tanks and dune buggies outfitted with weapons such as machine guns to mow down threats while traversing the sand-covered terrain. Sand Land is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC. 
If that’s not enough Sand Land for you, the animated series that premiered in Japan last year is launching worldwide exclusively on Hulu this spring. Sand Land: The Series tells a brand-new story that picks up from the events of the 2023 film. Check out the trailer below:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Golden Sun and its sequel, Golden Sun: The Golden Age are joining the Nintendo Switch Online library next week. On January 17, these two classic Game Boy Advance games will be available to play for all Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers. 
If you haven't yet played them before, there's probably someone in your life who has. And there's a good chance they mention it a lot, for good reason, too. Golden Sun is an excellent RPG and its sequel serves up even more of the story and magic-heavy combat. If you aren't familiar with these games, check them out in the trailer below: 


"From the humble village of Vale to the mystical peaks of Mt. Aleph, the Golden Sun game sets magic-wielding young heroes Isaac, Garet, Ivan, and Mia on a quest to prevent the ancient power of Alchemy from being unleashed on their home world of Weyard," a press release reads. "Their adventure takes them through towns, caverns, and dungeons as they face wily enemies, confounding puzzles, and epic challenges that push their magical abilities (Psynergy) to their absolute limits. Along the way, they get help from mysterious creates known as Djinn, who aid the heroes in harnessing their Psynergy to unlock potent spells and unstoppable attacks." 
In the sequel, The Lost Age, which is a direct follow-up to Golden Sun, the story follows Felix, another young magic-wielder with a unique twist. 
Both games feature co-op gameplay, so you can adventure through Vale with a friend if you'd like, but both must have access to the games. 

Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age hit the Nintendo Switch Online-Expansion Pack library on Wednesday, January 17. 
If you're curious about that library, here's every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Sega Genesis, and GBA game available with the subscription. 
Are you going to check out the Golden Sun games next week? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

"New Cycle" is obviously a bit of a self-contradiction, and I suspect that's deliberate - one of the questions the video leaves you with is whether there is "a future beyond survival", or whether we are doomed to just repeat the processes of extraction and gradual building-up, resource overexploitation and encroaching disaster suggested by these 12 jam-packed minutes of in-game footage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It took all of one turn before the insults started flying in our Solium Infernum multiplayer preview session this week. Specifically, they'd been launched straight into the court of League Of Geeks co-founder and studio director Trent Kusters, who was attempting to show us how the game's asynchronous multiplayer mode worked in a six-player match-up - the public playtest for which goes live today, Thursday January 11th, over on Steam. Moments earlier, he'd been walking myself, deputy editor Alice Bee and guides editor Ollie through the basics of this strategy game from hell, telling us about the importance of claiming territory, seeking out places of power to bolster our domain, and how to do battle with our hive-like legion units. But just as we were watching our individual turn orders play out, Kusters announced that Ollie had given him the digital equivalent of a demonic slap in the face, demanding he pay tribute to him, or else…
To his credit, Kusters took it with good humour. "This is the beautiful thing about this game - it's petty high school politics in Hell," he said laughing before graciously deciding to accept the insult at the cost of some of his prestige - the all-important hallmark of how you're perceived within this conclave of warring demons fighting for Satan's empty throne. Personally, I think Ollie's insult would have pierced my exceedingly thin skin instantly if I'd been in the same position, and I'd probably have been torn between declaring a vendetta against Ollie's unjustified affront, or challenging him to a Praetor duel to exact some (hopefully) righteous vengeance. Alas, since we were literally only a turn into this game, none of us were in any position to make good on those options, leaving the only possible outcome as eating it and moving on. It was a smart move on Ollie's part, and one that makes me both terrified and excited to see how our own team multiplayer sessions will play out in the run-up to Solium Infernum's full release on February 14th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are few things the internet is hungrier for than news about the Switch successor. With relative silence from Nintendo, folks have been left to grasp at straws and theorize what it will look like, how it will be played, and when it will be released. Today, thanks to Digital Trends, we might have an answer to that last question, and it came from a rather odd place.
Back in the day, GameShark was known for making cheat code cartridges in video games. You could plug it into your system, download cheat codes, and use them to become the master of games on your N64, PlayStation, or Game Boy. However, in recent years, the company has decided to take a turn in the direction of the company. Renamed "AI Shark," it's now a software-agnostic program designed to provide "personalized hints and assistance that keep up with fast-paced, competitive gaming." What does any of this have to do with the Switch 2? It's all in one sentence at the end of the first paragraph of their press release. 
"The official launch is planned to coincide with the Nintendo Switch 2 in September 2024."
To be clear, Nintendo has offered no official confirmation that this is an accurate launch window, and there are myriad reasons to doubt the validity of the claim. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reports that AI Shark is simply guessing at the Switch console's release date. Regardless, it is an odd statement to make in an official press release, and it will be very interesting to see Nintendo's response, assuming it issues one.
For more Nintendo Switch, check out our episode of All Things Nintendo where we list our most anticipated Switch games, and then read up on how Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown runs on the console.

It's good news for people playing the FromSoftware RPG on Steam Decks, especially those haunted by memories of the game's technical tribulations at launch, some of which were caused by the anti-cheat functionality. It's less great news for the millions hankering for the slightest whisper of new information about Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. But save your pity, above all, for the dozens of videogame news writers - dozens, I tell you! - who must write about Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC at any opportunity, lest the demigods of traffic eat our souls.

Shannon Woodward, the actress who originally portrayed Dina in The Last of Us Part 2, has responded to the live-action casting of Isabela Merced. In addition to a tweet of general support for Merced, Woodward responded to a fan who wondered why she didn't reprise her role in the sequel. In short, it's because of her age.

"Bcs [sic] I am... Much older lol," Woodward's second tweet reads. Much like Ellie's original actress, Ashley Johnson, Woodward is about 20 years older than the character she portrays. Dina's character model is actually based on an entirely different person, Cascina Caradonna, who fits the age range of the character.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a triumphant and impressive return for Ubisoft's thought-dead platforming franchise. You can read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review by following the link, but that review pertains to the console version of the game and does not address a question many players have: how is Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown on Switch? The short answer is that it is solid. Playing on Switch does not feel like a major downgrade from the other versions. For the long answer, check out the video below!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Prince Of Persia subtitles go, The Lost Crown is certainly an evocative one. It conjures up images of forgotten pasts being rediscovered, of wrongs being righted, and power being restored to its rightful balance. They're all promises that Ubisoft Montpellier capably deliver on over the course of its neatly plotted story, and often in more ways than one. But after flinging its hero warrior Sargon around the monster-filled streets of its Mount Qaf citadel for the better part of 20 hours, I'd also like to proffer the following alternatives: Pit Of A Thousand Spikes; The Eternal Death Wheels Of Spinning Blades; or maybe just simply Traps: The Game. These are perhaps more accurate descriptions of the challenges you'll face in The Lost Crown, as Mount Qaf is not a place you're allowed to tread lightly. Death stalks every corner, but that's precisely what makes this dextrously designed Metroid-like such a thrilling platformer. Put away your prejudices, because this is easily the equal of both Moon Studios' pair of Ori games, Hollow Knight and its Metroid genre namesakes.

The Prince of Persia series has a long and storied history going back decades, and I know none of it. The latest, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, from developer Ubisoft Montpellier, has me regretting that because if this game indicates what else awaits me in the franchise, I’ve clearly been missing out. The Lost Crown uses exhilarating platforming, a deep combat loop, and more to create a new Metroidvania classic. While I would like a more compelling story and a few tweaks to its systems, I struggled to pu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paramount+ released the first season of its live-action Halo series back in 2022 and while the initial premiere showed promise, the show was ultimately a letdown, both as the Chief's first foray into the live-action television space and as a Halo story. Now, the subscription streaming service has released the official trailer for Season 2 of Halo: The Series and it promises the fall of Reach, plenty of Covenant and Energy Swords, and more of Master Chief without his helmet on for some reason. 
I'm not completely sold on returning to this series – I didn't even finish the first season – but I'd be lying if I said this trailer didn't pique my interest. Perhaps I'm a sucker for the staples of Halo and the story of Reach, or maybe I have a terrible memory; perhaps it's a combination of both. 
Check out the Season 2 trailer for Halo: The Series for yourself below: 


Paramount+ renewed Halo: The Series for a second season early in the show's first season, so it's clear the streamer is committed to this property for now. Here's hoping the second season fairs better than the first. 
For more, read about Halo: The Series' showrunner's decision to show Master Chief's face in the show, and then read Game Informer's Halo Infinite review. After that, check out this story about how Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries will develop Halo games "now and in the future" even after layoffs that happened at the studio last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I reached the Elden Ring exhaustion point a couple of years ago… and I still don't think I've climbed out of my slump. Yes, I gave the game a Bestest Best badge that I stand by, but I also think it's one of FromSoftware's most taxing soulslike creations. It's so colossal that, by the end of my adventure, I'd had enough of the umpteenth boss. I wanted rid.
With talk of Elden Ring's Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC spinning up as 2024 begins, I've assessed my feelings and come to the conclusion that I'm not as excited as I would've been had the game and its DLC somehow existed a few years ago. To be honest with you, part of me hopes it just ends up being a roguelike. That way I might actually get into it.

"When a local farm in Patchwork, MT is attacked by a group of notorious bandits, Sheriff Sam Judge sets out to bring them to justice by any means necessary and save the hostage they have taken," the teaser's YouTube description reads. "But on his journey, through the mysterious motives of those he pursues, Sam finds himself transported to another world overrun with prehistoric creatures and dinosaurs and must fight for his life to make it back to earth."

As you can see, TeamKill Media is aiming to fill the Dino Crisis-sized hole left in action games right now, and we're here for it.

In fairness, this time the argument is a touch more involved than perennial moaning about backlogs – to whit, “there are too many games and it’s all the pandemic’s fault”. Nacon’s head of publishing Benoit Clerc has argued that the Covid lockdown years have bred too much investment in new games, and that we’re currently reaping the results in the form of an unsustainable glut of releases.

Unlike The Game Awards, which are hosted and produced by Geoff Keighley, with votes from media outlets and the public in some instances, the D.I.C.E Awards are voted on exclusively by game developers. 
Basically, it's the awards show where the people who made the games you played last year determine their favorite games of last year. It's an awards show of The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, with D.I.C.E standing for Design, Innovate, Communicate, and Entertain, and amongst the awards, the academy typically inducts someone into the Academy of Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame – we spoke to Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon about it in 2022.

        <updated>2024-01-11T13:01:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A retailer listing of a "V2 DualSense" controller for the PlayStation 5 has been spotted online, and it boasts an "exceptional" 12-hour battery life. That's a much longer battery life than the standard version of the DualSense controller, which averages between 6 to 10 hours (and many players would argue less). 
More specifically, players spotted a Best Buy Canada retail listing for a "PlayStation 5 V2 DualSense Wireless Controller – White," as reported by Eurogamer. Curiously, this V2 DualSense controller looks identical to the white ones that launched with the PS5. But in the "About This Product" section of the controller, you'll find, "Exceptional 12-hour battery life, on a full charge, supports long gaming sessions." This section also states the controller includes a DualSense charging station that "offers easy click-in charging." 
Game Informer has reached out to PlayStation to ask about this controller and whether or not it's real, and will update this story if it learns more. 
If you're interested in a controller upgrade you can make right now, check out the PS5 DualSense Edge. And if you've ever wondered what it might be like to have a DualSense controller cut in half with a screen placed between the two halves, check out the PlayStation Portal.

It was a fizzing neon labyrinth that was both home to various evil snakes and sort of made of snakes in probably-Freudian ways.
Fortunately, I had a lucid dreaming strategy for escaping from Snake World: relax all my limbs as much as I could, then flail around violently to wake myself up. It doesn't look like this will be an effective gambit in Digested, a bodycam horror game about being stuck on a barren, thinly forested and possibly irradiated island with a giant snake. Your tactical options seem to consist mostly here of running away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Major actors’ union SAG-AFTRA have raised hackles among a number of voice game performers after striking a deal with a company that wants to create AI replicas of actors’ voices for use in games, among other things. While the union claim that their agreement with Replica will allow for a “fair” and “ethical” approach to creating AI voices, it’s clear that a number of actors with credits in games from Baldur’s Gate 3, Mortal Kombat and Starfield to Apex Legends, World of Warcraft and Genshin Impact don’t agree.

        <updated>2024-01-10T18:19:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Naughty Dog and HBO have cast Young Mazino as Jesse for The Last of Us' second season. This follows yesterday's news that Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart, No One Will Save You) will play Abby in the show's second season. 
For the uninitiated, Jesse is one of the characters that Ellie calls a friend in The Last of Us Part II and without spoiling anything, his character goes on quite the journey in the name of friendship. Manzino starred in Netflix's Beef series that aired last year, and he was featured in the music video for "Snooze" by SZA. Other credits include Prodigal Son, Drama High, Trinity's Triump, and Good Boy. 
We're so excited for Young Mazino to step into the shoes of Jesse in @TheLastOfUsHBO Season 2. 🎉 https://t.co/GurthEHRZU
January 10, 2024
Fans of Naughty Dog's Last of Us series on PlayStation eagerly await the second season of HBO's The Last of Us. The first season debuted in January of last year, covering the events of the first game and its Left Behind DLC. HBO quickly confirmed the show would be getting a second season, which is set to premiere next year.
We loved the first season and can't wait to see how it adapts The Last of Us Part II, which is getting remastered later this month. It seems we aren't alone either – The Last of Us' premiere was HBO's second-largest debut since 2010, and viewers stuck around for the entire season. 
The first season of The Last of Us has already won eight Emmy awards, and there are still other Emmys the series is up for when the last night of the awards show airs next week. For more, read Game Informer's review of The Last of Us and then read Game Informer's review of The Last of Us Part II.

It's £100 off today, making the price of admission to the really big monitor show just £699.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 1992 Alone in the Dark served as major inspiration to the original Resident Evil, which received a sequel, which was successfully remade as a third-person shooter 20 years later, which in turn has presumably inspired Alone in the Dark's upcoming remake, which is releasing March 2024. It's a complicated ouroboros, but the good news is it gives us a chance to revisit arguably the original survival horror game in a brand new light with the aid of Hollywood actors.
Join Wesley LeBlanc and me as we play though an early portion of the game and share their thoughts on how this could finally represent Alone in the Dark's chance to shine. For more on the Alone in the Dark remake, head here for a big preview.

It's claimed that the alleged 30-year-old ringleader launched the operation in 2019 and was assisted by people he recruited online. Action of this type is rare in Vietnam and may offer Hollywood a glimmer of hope that a wider crackdown sits somewhere on the horizon.
