        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While ZZZ's servers have demonstrated remarkable stability, occasional downtimes are inevitable. That's why it's crucial to know its scheduled maintenance periods, which can often last a few hours. In this guide, we'll clarify the status of Zenless Zone Zero's servers and how you can verify it yourself.


Are Zenless Zone Zero servers down?


At the time of writing, Zenless Zone Zero servers are down to prepare for Version 1.2. According to a post from the game's official Twitter/X, the downtime will last roughly five hours.

To compensate for this, miHoYo will promptly distribute rewards, including 300 Polychrome for Level 4 or above Proxy players. Remember to check your in-game mail to claim these gifts before they expire. This compensation will be available only while Version 1.2 is active, which concludes at the beginning of November. 


Each ZZZ update is expected to bring more server downtimes, so check back here to see what's next on the horizon.


How to check Zenless Zone Zero server status


Stay informed about ZZZ's server status by following the game's official Twitter/X. This page consistently provides updates on any server issues, downtimes, and upcoming content, ensuring you're always in the know.


Outside this page, there aren't many places to check Zenless Zone Zero's server status. However, given that other Hoyoverse titles like Genshin Impact have been involved, it may receive its own DownDetector section.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LEGO Fortnite's Island Heads are one of the rarest objects in the game, often tying into Weekly Quests. On top of that, its vague instructions offer little insight into what to look for, making it more difficult than it already is. 


So, if you're lost (like I was), here's how to visit a Peely Island Head in LEGO Fortnite.


Where to find Peely Island Head in LEGO Fortnite


Like the Llama Island Head and NaNa Village, there's no universal location that spawns the Peely Island Head. However, I find it best to use a seed from another player to fast-track things a bit more. The key thing you need to look out for is a banana statue, which likely triggers a golem appearance.


I used the seed '13.89.36.54.63' from the Reddit user TatoMcgoo to locate my first statue. The world boasts the quickest way to find the Peely Island Head in LEGO Fortnite, considering that it's not too far from the base. Go to the coordinates '0.84, 4.775, 0.23' to find it atop a hill.

Looking to the left of Haven's Village, you'll quickly see the banana statue from there. But be warned of the formidable golem that lingers there.

As long as you approach the statue, it should mark the completion of the Peely Island Head mission. If you're up for it, you can try to defeat the banana golem to gain some resources. Weapons like the Star Wars lightsaber and the cannon prove effective with it. You should also keep your distance since its spinning attack can be deadly. Then, you can start looting the Island Head's chest to farm additional rewards.


Exchange the Studs you've earned from the mission to obtain cosmetics from the LEGO Pass. Complete more quests to reach the final tier, providing the exclusive Nana Hut build.

I have to admit, there were fewer remasters than I had expected, and even less promotion of the PlayStation 5 Pro (though there was some), and overall it was a better presentation than I had expected. Let's dive into everything shown in the Sony State of Play for September 2024.




Sony State of Play September 2024 Recap


The big reveal of this State of Play is Ghost of Yotei, a follow-up to the hit Sucker Punch action-adventure game Ghost of Tsushima. But there were other gems scattered throughout including a release date for Fantasian Neo Dimension and Monster Hunter Wilds, a couple of remasters, and the oddly-timed release of Palworld on the PS5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a survival crafting game, LEGO Fortnite offers a wide range of materials for recipes and upgrades. One such resource is the Red Rock, a crucial ingredient for crafting powerful weapons. We'll show you how to get Red Rock in LEGO Fortnite and what to use it with.


Where to find Red Rocks in LEGO Fortnite


You can mine Red Rocks anywhere on the LEGO Fortnite's Lost Isles map. They appear similar to the Granite, but you can tell the difference through their coloring. To give you an idea of what to expect, here's an image of the two together (Red Rock on the left and Granite on the right):


Screenshot by Destructoid


Unlike the Granite, there isn't a way to pick up the Red Rock, so you'll need a Pickaxe. Use rarities like Uncommon or Epic on the tool to mine those rocks. Common (wood) is the only one that doesn't work since it doesn't have enough strength as an early material. I recommend farming a whole lot of them to better prepare for future builds.


What to use Red Rocks for in LEGO Fortnite


Red Rock is not just a resource; it's a key to unlocking a world of crafting possibilities in LEGO Fortnite. Use it to craft several Lost Isles recipes, such as the Explorer's Machete, Flint-Knock Pistol, Boom Shield, and Throwing Spear. It'll coat all your tools with a dark red shade, similar to the Red Rock's designs. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


In addition to the gear, furniture also harnesses a few recipes, using the Zesty Single and Double Beds. More designs may be associated with it, but these bunch seem to be the primary ones for builds.


If you're trying to improve your base, you'll need 15 Red Rocks and 10 Mahogany Rods to unlock Village Level 4. It also mandates a few objectives, like the Complete a Pirate Camp. Make sure to have enough residents in your house, too, to satisfy the Upgrade Requirements. In return, you'll earn rewards for your efforts, providing more uses for villagers and animals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sequel to Ghost of Tsushima got a reveal as part of the PlayStation State of Play stream. Ghost of Yotei moves things to 1603 during the popular Sengoku Period of Japan.


It also moves the action to the area around Mount Yotei, which is located in modern day Hokkaido, known as Ezo back in that period. It stars Atsu, who is a protagonist that I’m sure is not going to rankle a very specific and vocal corner of the internet at all.




The gameplay shown off looks very much like Ghost of Tsushima. Lots of tall grass, horseback riding, and swordplay. Atsu has a Shamisen strung across her back and a wolf features heavily. Maybe you’ll be able to play songs for your puppers, I don’t know.


I feel like this is trying to trick me into playing again. I liked Ghost of Tsushima for a while, but it was way longer than it should have been and the open world was very open-worldy, if you know what I mean. Beautiful game, and killing Mongol invaders was a lot of fun for a while, but its depth wasn't enough to support its breadth. If you know what I mean.


Ghost of Yotei is coming to PS5 in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The delightful universe of Astro Bot holds many unique challenges and memorable cameos to discover. To top it off, an upcoming DLC aims to expand its galaxy more with exciting new features. Here's everything you need to know about the Astro Bot DLC release.


Astro Bot DLC release window


According to the PlayStation State of Play, the Astro Bot DLC will launch in Fall 2024. We got a glimpse into some upcoming features, including five new online speedrun levels and 10 VIP Astro Bots. Although the entire roster has yet to be revealed, the announcement unveils two iconic characters: a Helldiver and Stellar Blade's EVE. I'm happy to see that some of my picks for potential future cameos made it to the new update, but we'll still need to wait for the rest.


You may remember the speedruns from Astro's Playroom, where players could quickly go through levels in the network. The Speedrun and Special Bots Add-On trailer shows the upcoming challenges in action, starting with an icy course riddled with traps. You'll need to use your bot's unique abilities here in order to push through the trials and reign victorious on the leaderboards. 




While we don't have an exact release date for the Astro Bot DLC, it should be available soon now that we're approaching the end of the year. Fortunately for us, the add-on will be completely free, so there is no need to bust out your wallet for the speedruns and new bots.

There may even be more hidden secrets to uncover that has not been revealed in the trailer. I'm still hoping for a Prince of Persia bot, but it might just be wishful thinking. Once more information drops, I'll update the guide to provide the deets on the DLC's release date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just three months after MMORPG ArcheAge closed its doors in the West, it appears the world will continue with an action RPG set 50 years later. Developer XLGames and publisher Kakao Games revealed ArcheAge Chronicles as part of today's State of Play.




Look, I'll be honest, I had over 1,000 hours in ArcheAge across its various relaunches and rebrands over the years. So even though I hadn't played in a while, I was sad to see the MMORPG close its doors a few months ago. And while it's cool to see an action RPG that is set in the world of ArcheAge, the MMO wasn't really popular for its world but rather for its innovative sandbox and social mechanics.


I will say though, it certainly looks pretty. According to the team, players will embark on epic adventures with enhanced combat in a vast uncharted world of strategic battles and rich storytelling. Along the way, you'll customize your house, master life skills, and uncover new realms in a dynamic universe. Oh, and it's got online components as well, apparently. Unfortunately, not many details on that just yet.


No sort of release date timeframe was given for ArcheAge Chronicles, and based on the trailer it appears to be a PlayStation 5 exclusive.

I'm so excited for Wilds but until now it only had a 2025 release date, so I assumed it would be mid to late next year. I'm glad that's not the case! Wilds is also getting three unique editions: Standard, Deluxe, and Premium Deluxe. The Delux includes a Deluxe Pack DLC, while the Premium Deluxe includes the Deluxe Pack, two COsmetic DLC packs, and other "premium bonuses".


The trailer also showed off some gameplay including some new monsters, but what caught me by surprise was how much story there appears to be in Wilds, based on the dialogue segments. Which to be honest, I'm all for.


Monster Hunter Wilds is set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on February 28, 2025.

I’m not sure what to say about Dynasty Warriors Origins. If you’re unfamiliar, the series is about fighting hordes of dudes. Like, have you ever gotten stuck in a crowd while leaving a concert? Imagine swinging a sword at that crowd. Except it’s during the Three Kingdoms era of Chinese history. That’s Dynasty Warriors.




I thought that Dynasty Warriors Origins was supposed to be a prequel, but now I’m not so sure. You play as a nameless protagonist and fight alongside other heroes.


Dynasty Warriors Origins is coming to PS5 and PC on January 17, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the PlayStation State of Play stream, Pocketpair announced that Palworld’s release date is right now! Or today! I checked, it’s not up at this exact moment.


Palworld is that Pokemon with guns game. It’s an open-world survival title where you cut down trees and craft stuff. Nintendo is suing its developers for patent infringement. You know the one, right? It sold a kajillion copies because people can’t get enough of cutting down trees to craft an axe.




The PlayStation release was teased, but unless I’m not locked in, I don’t think we knew it was going to be released today. So that’s pretty cool if you haven’t played it elsewhere.


I don't know if I made this clear, but I didn't really dig Palworld. It had nothing to do with its astounding dearth of creativity but rather that, behind its creature enslavement and firepower, it's a rather boilerplate open-world survival games. Those are fun, in moderation. Their micro progression is insidiously addictive by design, and when you get to the bottom of one, you realize you've been eating cotton candy for the past 20 hours: sweet and unsubstantial.


Palworld is available for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and now PS5.

In the trailer, we see the player take on a variety of spooky-looking demons that have literally caused Hell on Earth.




The trailer is giving me somewhat soulslike vibes, but also reminds me both in enemy design and gameplay of Scarlet Nexus. Players will wield a wide range of weapons including swords, spears, and axes as they take on supernatural creatures that have invaded Earth.


Hell is Us is coming to PlayStation 5 in 2025.


This story is still developing and may be updated with more details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you first begin your upgrade journey in Lost Isles, you'll come across a rather peculiar task. The objective enlists travelers to "complete a Pirate Camp" in order to improve the village. Find out how to find a Pirate Camp in LEGO Fortnite, including how to satisfy the quest's requirements.


LEGO Fortnite Complete a Pirate Camp quest guide


To satisfy the Complete a Pirate Camp quest in LEGO Fortnite, you must eliminate all pirates in their hub and loot their chests. But now that begs the question: Where do you find these Pirate Camps? Well, the beach seems to be the quickest way to locate them, as they are easily noticeable with their smoke signals. They'll also appear in other areas, so keep a sharp eye on your surroundings.

Be warned that pirates hanging out by campfire do not count towards this mission. Look for a bunch of houses instead, and you should see those freebooters lounging around. Expect some resistance from them and try to come prepared with suitable weapons, such as the Musket, Flintlock Pistol, and Cannon. Tool upgrades can be helpful, too, so make sure to grab Tomes for maximum damage.


Once you've knocked enough heads, you'll still need to do one last thing to complete the quest. Search for a chest inside one of the buildings and loot it to earn the achievement. If you don't do this step, it won't count towards the Village Level 3 upgrade (even those who eliminate all pirates).

Return to your Village Square, and you'll see a check for the LEGO Fortnite Pirate Camp quest. However, it still requires other minor tasks, like recruiting visitors and crafting a Health Charm. The upgrade also mandates Mahogany Rods and Red Rocks deriving from the new Lost Isle area. Finish and collect them all to maximize your village.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Dripping in Gold theme in Dress to Impress is all about showing off golden clothes, accessories, hair, and more. As long as it's gold, anything is fair game here. If there was ever a time to get extra creative with outfit ideas, this theme is the place for it.

As the name suggests, the Dripping in Gold theme is all about having golden items. If you wear a dress, it should be gold. Any jewelry, hair accessories, and purses you hold will also have gold as their primary color. Having black, white, or other colors as accents help it stand out more, but they shouldn't take away from anything.


When it comes to getting the top score with this theme, you'll want to go for elegant, flashy outfits that are full of gold. Although you can get creative and go for different clothing styles, glamorous dresses and a ton of jewelry are what'll get you that pedestal spot almost every time. Clothing items you get from Dress to Impress codes are also popular with this particular theme, so make sure to take advantage of those as often as possible.


Best Dripping in Gold masculine outfits

Manly men can look good in gold, too. When it comes to dripping in gold for male models in Dress to Impress, a suit, tie, and some stylish shoes are often all you need. You can even experiment and go for a vacation outfit, sporty attire, or pajamas. As long as there's gold, any option is on the table.


Similar to feminine appearance, being flashy and bold but maintaining a clean look is the way to go for getting the top spot. While some would say less is more, that certainly isn't the case for Dripping for Gold, especially if you only have a shirt and pants on. Although trying new clothing types might get you some stars from curious players, having a sleek look with plenty of layers is key if you want that top pedestal spot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The SBC storage is one of the more exciting additions in EA FC 25's Ultimate Team, but it can be slightly confusing for many.


The storage works as an efficient way to store your duplicate untradeables, which can't be sold elsewhere. This space can store up to 100 duplicate cards. But what if you want to move one of those items to solve an SBC or move it to your club? Once you know the process, it becomes an easy job.


How to move a player from SBC storage in EA FC 25


Whenever you open any untradeable pack and get one or more duplicates, they're automatically stored in the storage. At first, there will be a prompt about sending them to SBC storage. You should turn the prompt off, as it can get tedious later in the cycle. If you want to move the card from storage, here's how to do it.


Image via Destructoid



Open any SBC that you want to complete. In this image, I wanted to complete the first task of the David Alaba Flashback objective.


Select a spot.


Press R1/RB to scroll to SBC storage.


Select a card from there. This card will be transferred to the SBC squad. Press on it, and you'll get the option to move the item to your club.


If you want to submit the item in a SBC, keep it where it is.



Image via Destructoid


There's a bug that sometimes prevents you from sending the item to your club. In that case, choose to send the card to the SBC storage once again and rinse and repeat the process mentioned here. That should be the job you wanted to do in the first place.


I love the idea that they have added duplicate storage, and it has made my life easier at the start of a new Ultimate Team. I don't have to bother about shifting the duplicates, and I can also build up a stack of cards for a popular SBC when that arrives in the future in EA FC 25.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Diablo 4, some of the gear pieces you obtain may have the “non-physical damage” trait, but what it means isn’t too straightforward. Is it an affix worth keeping? If so, here’s what it means and what it applies to.


What is non-physical damage in Diablo 4?


Non-physical damage is any damage type that isn’t labeled as physical damage, as straightforward as it sounds. 


For example, if you are leveling a Druid, all the core skills will be labeled as physical damage except for Lightning Storm. If you are equipping gear that gives a bonus to non-physical damage, you want to make sure that skills listed in your class’ tree have any other label than physical.


A class like a Druid will have a mix of the two, so make sure that you aren’t dipping into a damage type that you aren’t casting. It’s always best to specialize in specific damage types so you won't lose out on any bonuses.

Is non-physical damage good?


In many cases, the non-physical damage boost can heavily increase your DPS in Diablo 4. This works exceptionally well for Sorcerers since all of their damage will come from fire, lightning, or cold. These are all examples of non-physical damage.


Most high-tier Sorcerer builds will either make use of the Tal Rasha’s Iridescent Loop, or the Fractured Winterglass because of the strong affixes they have. What they both also have are significant boosts to non-physical damage. 


It’s basically a direct damage upgrade by equipping these items, even if you’re running unoptimized builds that don’t benefit much from their key passives.


Rogues will also benefit from this when imbuing skills. Just know that just because you’re using a projectile attack doesn’t automatically mean it’s non-physical. The skill on your tree will tell you what type of damage it is, even if there is some type of class-specific element.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since August, World of Warcraft guilds have been reporting a troubling bug: their guild banks, where any member of the guild can store resources, items, and even the game's rarest of loot (like mounts), were wiped out. Whether completely emptied or simply missing items, users reported that the fruits of their labor were vanishing into thin air. As of September, Blizzard's response has left many players with their heads in their hands. 


Some items will never be recovered


Community Manager Linxy said in a blogpost over on the Blizzard forums that the core issue was caused by the enabling of cross-realm guilds. As a part of The War Within, many limitations on players' ability to play, trade, and share with each other across both faction and realm were dissolved, making for a more communal experience across the player base. 


But that convenience comes at a cost. "Due to how some of the data was lost, we've reached a point where the result will be an incomplete restoration for some guilds, and we do not have a way to restore the remaining missing items for them," says Linxy. Data loss is a backend developer's worst nightmare, especially when that data could be 19-year-old mounts, collectables, and items not even obtainable in the game anymore. 


The affected community, needless to say, is in shambles. The bug didn't affect everyone, mind you, but those it has have lost, at worst, nearly two decades' worth of stashed items. The best we can hope for is some form of compensation to those affected, but without the data that shows which items were lost, it really isn't going to be possible to get that history back.

How to get Onions in Disney Dreamlight Valley


The main way to get Onions in Disney Dreamlight Valley is to purchase their seeds from Goofy's Stall. They can be bought for 50 Gold Coins each from the Forest of Valor location. Once you've dug a spot for them to grow, place them in the soil and water them. These onion seeds take around an hour to grow and will need to be watered twice. 


There is a chance that there's already an Onion growing within Wall-E's garden, however. If you've finished the little robot's realm in the castle and completed his story quests, you'll gain access to his garden in your valley. This is where he grows all sorts of vegetables and other ingredients. Upgrade this space to maximize your chances of finding an Onion within this batch. 


How to make Arendellian Pickled Herring


The best Onion dish you can make with your newfound ingredient is the Arendellian Pickled Herring because it's a five-star meal. You'll need the following ingredients for it:



Herring


Onion


Garlic


Any sort of spice


Lemon



Garlic grows within the ground of the Forest of Valor. Lemons also grow on trees within the Forest of Valor but you can find them in the Glade of Trust too. Herring can be caught in the waters of Dazzle Beach and Glade of Trust within white puddles.


Once you have all of the ingredients, gather them into a pot inside a kitchen. After making Arendellian Pickled Herring, you can sell it for 532 Gold Coins. However, you may want to save it if you haven't completed all of Elsa's quests yet as she'll request the meal at one point.

Yet, some of these items, like the Prototype Head, will remain mysteriously unused for a good long while. What do you do with it, then?


While the same cannot be said about almost any other item in The Dark Horizon, it's virtually impossible to miss the Prototype Head. Early on in the DLC, you'll be riding a tram that basically crashes onto a poor, unsuspecting bot down below. Being the tenured Traveler that you are, you instinctively tear off its head and lug it around just in case it ends up being useful down the line. And, indeed, it does. Though it takes a while.

Notably, The Dark Horizon map is extremely vertical, and the only way to move about from one island to another is to use glider drones.


Glider drones are, in my book, one of the most interesting new features of Remnant 2: The Dark Horizon. They're not extremely mechanically deep by a long shot, and it's not even hard to get a sense of how to best make use of them. They do, however, massively open up the explorable area and add a huge amount of verticality to what could've been just one more Remnant 2 area. My only real complaint about glider drones is that they're limited to The Dark Horizon's new regions, meaning you won't find them anywhere…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its 2024 Vision Showcase, LEVEL-5 has released the first teaser trailer for the next Yokai Watch! concept, Holy Horror Mansion. The game is described as a ‘Ghost Craft RPG’, and everything we currently know comes direct the trailer itself. 




The game is set to center around Ten Lordland, a boy who lives in a mansion atop an apartment block that is owned by his Grandmother. The apartment block, which is also a portal to the underworld, is filled with spirits that are discovered by Ten after he uses a mysterious camera and one of his nose hairs turns into a green ghost. 


Yes, you read that correctly.

This green ghost is capable of possessing objects and turning them into Yokai-esque monsters, and he doesn’t come into the world alone. His friends, blue and pink ghost, will help to craft unique monsters and create worlds to explore respectively. 


Interestingly, as part of the teaser trailer, a familiar face made a rather unexpected appearance:


Image via LEVEL-5/YouTube


I’m not sure if you’ll remember pen-pineapple-apple-pen, but I sure do; and I definitely wasn’t expecting to see PIKOTARO to show up in a video game trailer, but I’m glad he did. Although having said that, I’ve now got his song stuck in my head and it's not likely to leave for the next week.


Little is known about a potential release date for Holy Horror Mansion just yet, and even less is known about which platforms it will be coming to. If previous Yokai Watch! titles are anything to go by, it’s likely that Holy Horror Mansion will make its home on Nintendo Switch. Depending on the release date, it may even be an early release for the Switch's successor console. 


More information will be coming in the Spring of 2025, according to LEVEL-5 CEO Akihiro Hino, so we only have a few months to wait until we get more details about this bizarrely adorable follow-up to Yokai Watch!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite officially launched on July 21, 2017, making it just over seven years old. While we're a couple of months late to its actual birthday, we're still celebrating it by eating cake, setting off fireworks, and opening gifts. You can even get a few free rewards for finishing every quest.


All Fortnite seventh Birthday event quests


Fortnite's seventh birthday event has six quests you can complete, ranging from eating cake to using the flare gun to set off fireworks. Three rewards are up for grabs, requiring you to finish at least five of the six tasks. Below is every birthday event quest:



Wish the bus driver a Happy Birthday (7)


Throw Birthday Presents or open chests (7)


Travel distance while airborne with balloons from Birthday Medallions (777)


Eat slices of birthday cake (7)


Release or pop balloons (7)


Reveal players by setting off fireworks with the Flare Gun (7)



Screenshot by Destructoid


Fortunately, many of these tasks are straightforward once you get used to a few mechanics. Wishing the bus driver a happy birthday requires you to emote while riding on the Battle Bus, while balloons and birthday cake are located in the same ten areas around the map. 


From here, finding flare guns and birthday presents is luck-based, as they both appear as floor and chest loot. Lastly, the Birthday Medallion is a present reward, so you'll need those to knock out at least two to three tasks.

Completing one of these six quests rewards you with the Birthday Bud emote, while finishing three gives you the Cake Clobberer pickaxe. The grand prize is the Sprinkly Space Cake back bling for completing five quests, so you're allowed to skip one if it's particularly difficult or time-consuming. For me, that was the flare gun one, but it all depends on your luck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Up to 40% of a game's total sales occur in the first month, according to the SSRN Electronic Journal. Consequently, the best strategy for studios is to ensure their titles launch with a bang. Some strategic marketing is necessary to achieve this. Piling up good reviews from critics and gamers is also vital, meaning it's essential for games to launch in a polished state.


Over the years, a few titles have missed the mark terribly, resulting in catastrophic launches. The following list contains some of the worst offenders in gaming history.


2024 addendum


To borrow a common internet adage, it's like Concord read this list and said, "Hold my beer." As such, we felt it would be a good time to add to this list. It felt as though it would remain incomplete without what is currently the most …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If Kylian Mbappe is your favorite footballer and you're wondering how to perform his celebrations in EA FC 25, we have you covered.


Real Madrid fans have another reason to rejoice after Kylian Mbappe joined Los Blancos, making him one of the highest-rated players in EA FC 25.


How to do Kylian Mbappe celebrations in EA FC 25?


In EA FC 25, Mbappe has two iconic celebrations, crossing his arms while standing and one where he knee slides and salutes with two fingers.


To perform the crossing arms celebration, simply:



Hold the L2 button and then press the O button twice (this is for PlayStation controllers)


For Xbox controllers, you can do it by holding the LT button and then tapping the B button twice.



This celebration is also known as "Little Brother", and is closely linked to Ethan Mbappe, a CDM from Ligue 1.


To perform the sliding salute celebration, simply:



Hold the R1 button and then hold the RS to the right (for PlayStation controllers)


Hold the RB button and then hold the RS to the right (for Xbox controllers)



Kylian Mbappe is also a huge Cristiano Ronaldo fanboy and he's known to replicate several of his iconic celebrations, including the Siu.


The French forward is an insane choice for your Ultimate Team in EA FC 25. He is a 91-rated card in-game with 97 Acceleration and Sprint Speed, making him one of the fastest STs in the game.

For those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, summer has come to an end. Fortunately, through the magic of video games — and the video games created by one man in particular — it's never too late to take a little summer holiday...

With the recent English-language release of Spike Chunsoft’s open-world summer simulator, Natsu-Mon, coming hot on the heels of 2022’s Shin-chan: Me and the Professor on Summer Vacation, and the upcoming Shin-chan: Shiro and the Coal Town, the time seemed right to sit down with Natsu-Mon director, game designer, and writer, Kaz Ayabe. We discuss the hard-earned breakthrough in the West of the ‘cosy game’ genre he helped establish in Japan with his long-running series Boku No Natsuyasumi — colloquially known as ‘Bokunatsu’ — made popular on PlayStation, PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation 3.

Professor Layton and the New World of Steam was arguably the big announcement of Level-5's return when it was revealed during a Nintendo Direct last year. And while we still have to wait a bit for the game to launch, we have got a brand new trailer to tide us by.

It looks to blend the old style of maps and side-on conversations with more open environments that you can pan around and examine items in. We also got a few more hints on what the story might entail.

This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the "old world". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks.

Nintendo has announced that it will be ending repairs for the Famicom Classic, Super Famicom Classic, and the New Nintendo 2DS XL in Japan "as our current stock of parts runs out".
Shared by OatmealDome on Bluesky, both the classic "mini" consoles and the late-gen New 2DS XL will continue to be repaired until parts run out. Repairs for the New 2DS XL are still ongoing in North America, at the time of writing this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is the Switch-ing hour upon us?
With all the rumours and speculation about Nintendo's next hardware over the last few weeks (who are we kidding — last few years), the recent 'leak' of prototype pictures has piqued the interest of even the most level-headed Nintendo fans. The images show renders and what appear to be prototype casings for the main console with new, larger Joy-Con variants, plus a shot of a chipless motherboard.
While the fervour for Switch 2 news makes it easy to dismiss this as an elaborate fake — we all remember the oval NX pics based on a Nintendo patent that 'leaked' prior to the Switch's reveal — these images align with the rumours and industry whispers regarding the upcoming console. And yesterday the expert folk over at Digital Foundry shared their opinion: they believe these leaks are "almost certainly" the real deal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, a dangerous and charismatic game has evaded the grasp of many designers. Some say it doesn't exist, that no publisher would ever back it. I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant.

You might want to chuck in that chickens are basically dinosaurs, because their feet have a "Triassic Flange", a (made-up) term that will make you sound authoritative. If you really want to showcase your knowledge, though, you may want to mention that dinosaurs may have actually fought with large swords lodged between their teeth. Dinoblade demonstrates this! And no, they haven't discovered swords alongside dinosaur fossils yet because palaeontologists have been unlucky thus far. "Soon", you tell them.

The company have posted a profit warning, reflecting an 11% decline in operating revenue for the first half of 2024. They've also "paused" two unannounced games in development, and altered other unannounced games to be more appealing to a "wider audience". Beyond that, they're considering "all possible options regarding our roadmap", which sounds just a touch ominous.

Developer Datadyne has revealed the initial trailer for its in-development RPG Forge of the Fae; a gorgeous pixel art title that's boasting some heavy Sea of Stars vibes.
There's no release window for this one yet; Datadyne is launching a Kickstarter campaign very shortly to help facilitate Forge of the Fae's development, but based on the trailer alone, we'd say this one is probably worth keeping an eye on.

If it's none of these things, I would much rather have a shiny turret on spindly steel legs skitter besides me.
Nomada Studios have, incredibly, thrust their hands into my chest cavity and given me a blood-pumping mechanism. Having spent some time with upcoming action-platformer Neva (the game) and Neva (the dog from the game), I have to admit: I did enjoy petting Neva (the dog).

It’s hard not to be moved by the exaggerated kineticism of it all – the magic-enhanced swordfights, the jumping off cliffs and turning into a flying shadow monster, the ability to drift horses. Yes. Yes!
I’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out "It’s just a demo" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.

What’s the equivalent of poison? What are experience points and checkpoints called, although you’re going to call them souls and bonfires anyway? I’ve done this many, many times, but on this occasion there was a surprising twist, one which would have notorious pearl-clutching racist HP Lovecraft spinning in his grave. Enotria: The Last Song’s arcane Soulslike language is actually just Italian.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a remaster of Disney Epic Mickey, a cult classic 3D platformer first released a decade ago on the Wii. In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.
And no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.

In addition to blocking 69 domains associated with the service, the court has ordered Google to "immediately uninstall" Magis TV apps from Android devices. This measure targets apps that users have sideloaded, as MagisTV is not available on the official Google Play store.

Writing of the frigid framing of Clockwork Orange’s atrocities, the film critic Pauline Kael asked: “is there anything sadder - and ultimately more repellent - than a clean-minded pornographer?” The lavishly directed and animated universe of God Of War Ragnarok is far from repellent, but it also feels spiritually squeegeed; a world of pulpy violence so chirpy and chaste as to strain belief that the scars that haunt its reformed anti-hero could have ever been inflicted there.

Reported by Bloomberg as a disagreement over attempts to "spin off the video-game division as an independent entity," the details were nonetheless somewhat scant. A  new report from Rebekah Valentine at IGN has since shed some more light on the walkout, which reportedly involved “disagreements over the direction of the Interactive division, chaotic departures, communication breakdowns, and a perceived lack of leadership transparency.” It’s a thorough account of some messy events I recommend reading in full, but here’s a brief rundown.

He's the star of the just-announced Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii, a game I can only applaud for the brazen straightforwardness of its title. Whatever Sega were drinking when they signed off on Metaphor: ReFantazio, they were not drinking when they signed off on this. They were definitely drinking something, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“We have been sold this myth for a very long time that unions have to be for blue collar workers in an industrial setting in the early 1900s,” Autumn Mitchell tells me. “The very simple definition of a union is just you and your co-workers coming together and forming a collective body. You can do that anywhere.”
A QA tester with Zenimax currently on union leave, Mitchell joined the Communications Workers Of America (CWA) as a full-time organiser after she and her colleagues formed what was, at the time, the biggest union in videogames - ZeniMax Workers United. Now she helps the CWA do what they did for her and her colleagues at Zenimax: provide support, training, resources and guidance for workers in the videogame industry who have decided, for whatever reason, that they want to unionise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm reasonably sure Final Fantasy 16 isn't the longest Final Fantasy I've ever played, but it feels that way, for a multitude of reasons. The major one is that a lot of its quests exist to create distance between places and plot beats. They are overwritten errands such as bringing people lunch or fetching herbs or carrying letters - dessicated, MMO-ish fare, thrust into a moderately enjoyable action-RPG for the sake of incremental worldbuilding and scale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fifteen months on from its PS5 release, Final Fantasy XVI – that actiony RPG of emo-fringed hack ‘n’ slashing and disquietingly sexy Ralph Ineson characters – is now on PC. Enough time, you’d think, to do a proper job of rejigging it with Windows spanners, especially after Final Fantasy XV’s port got so much stick for its lack of features and performance issues.
FFVXI does make some improvements, adopting a full set of DLSS and FSR upscalers and frame generators, and its mouse and keyboard integration feels generally slicker than XV. Sadly, it’s still no first-rate adaptation, neglecting numerous PC features and giving low-end systems an even deeper kick in the plums. Cutting the quality settings can help, as per the guide down below, but overall performance is so up-and-down than you’ll likely never achieve a perfectly smooth ride.

It’s a turn-based battler with an empire-building component in which you play as several emperors in succession, passing on abilities and knowledge to your heir. In what I consider to be a poetic complementary flourish, you can also pass on save data from the demo to the full game. Look, this is what counts as “poetic” just before lunch on a Thursday.

It was a brilliant dystopian scavenging sim in which you searched cellars for bolts while avoiding the attentions of creatures that hate being looked at, or which only move when they're not being looked at, or which look like your friends, from a distance. The developer's next game, Welcome To The Dark Place, is more about hearing. It's an "open-world, auditory text-based adventure" which mostly takes place in pitch blackness.

It's also now got a story expansion, Mask Of Darkness, which came out yesterday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I watched a Youtube video about Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, in which sundry, gesticulating milords of the internet opine that they had "forgot what it's like to be the target audience" for games, hailing the new (and for our money, fairly good) Warhammer 40K shooter as a throwback affair that "oozes masculinity", with no excess feelings or real-life social relevancy. I then combed through several thousand comments below said video, many of which expressed similar longing for the hypothetical Good Old Days, before those wily feminists invaded the medium, transformed every game into a LGBT+ weeping simulator, and threw all the Real Men into a big hole. I did this because I was searching for one particular comment written by somebody claiming to be Matthew Karch, CEO of Space Marine 2 developers Saber Interactive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I’m sure as is the curse of anyone who’s watched the entirety of Peep Show multiple times, I cannot read the name ‘Marko’ without hearing it in a nasally Australian accent, inquiring about cocaine. This is probably a disservice to the hero of colourful metroidvania Marko: Beyond Brave, who a quick goog tells me may be based on Krali Marko - a popular character in the folklore of Studio Mechka’s native Bulgaria. Folk hero or not, Marko certainly has some heroic facial hair: his moustache floweth so bountifully that it can’t be contained in his character portrait. Extremely powerful of him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As per EA’s recent generative AI tugathon, the third game in Respawn’s action adventure Star Wars trilogy has been confirmed again to be in development. According to EA, it’ll be the “final chapter" in the now-trilogy, following 2019’s Jedi Fallen Order and 2023’s Jedi Survivor.
The existence of the game was first confirmed by Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan, during an Ocala Comic Con panel. “We’re working on a third and we’re in the process of doing that right now,” said Monaghan, which is about as straightforward an affirmative as one could want. It was also double-confirmed this February, following news of layoffs at EA, via Eurogamer.

We've already seen a description for the PC version appear briefly on the PlayStation store (of all places). And earlier this year a snoopy fan of the studio who monitors the backend of Rockstar's launcher found similar game descriptions buried amid metadata. Yesterday, that same practice yielded yet another clue - the game's Steam app number.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several Internet Providers, including Verizon, have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to grant Cox Communications' appeal in a landmark piracy liability case. The ISPs stress that the current ruling creates "extortionate pressure" that puts innocent subscribers at risk. A separate brief from Boston College Law School Professor Alfred Yen, also urges the Supreme Court to take on the case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frostpunk 2 was an ambitious gambit. With survival achieved, and the introduction's excellently sinister advisor whispering evil Tory ideas, the whole city you built in Frostpunk is now just the headquarters for a sprawling expansion effort, and your rule is no longer absolute. Rather than retread the same "prepare for ultra-Winter" ground, your biggest obstacle will likely be your own people, now formed into shifting political parties, and looking outward with colonial eyes. The result is a complicated, laborious survival citybuilder that's two parts compelling, and one part frustrating for the wrong reasons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really wanted to like action adventure The Plucky Squire more than I do now, having given its charming 2D to 3D platforming a proper whirl. Yes, it's lovely to look at. Yes, hopping out of a storybook and making friends with an illustration on a coffee mug is cool. And yes, everyone can have a mildly fun time with its puzzles and fights. But that's the problem: who is everyone? At first I thought, "This game is for young kids and that's fine!", given its relative simplicity. Then I hit some puzzles and thought, "Ain't no kid figuring this out".
Then it hit me. It struggles to balance the fine line between being approachable for tiny tots and layered enough for people who've graduated from "goo goo ga ga" to "oo oo aa aa my back hurts". And that's down to how plucky you're allowed to squire at any given time, because it can be surprisingly limited and, sadly, a bit underwhelming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can't travel back to the 1980s. But what if I told you it was possible to gently warp your memories of that time? UFO 50 is a kart of 50 games that once existed for an old computer system, all lovingly restored by a gang of coders. The old console, of course, is a fiction. The LX-I never existed. But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there.

Namely, that the majority of its pre-release buzz has centred around its proximity to Persona, and not its far more entertaining quality of having the most gleefully bizarre RPG enemy design this side of Elden Ring’s horn-tooting orbpeople.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why is every blockbuster video game now some kind of live service game? Speaking as a clueless idiot, the explanation I find most convincing is that it's an attempt to bridge the gap between the returns publishers want from video games, versus how much we're able or willing to pay upfront. "Triple-A" projects now cost exorbitant sums to develop, partly thanks to wider economic inflation, but also because publishers have spent decades teaching players that every sequel has to be More and Shinier. Premium game prices have not risen in proportion, and investors want growth, as they do.
Live service games sneak around this difficulty by dragging out the time we spend playing them. Whether premium or free-to-play, they seek to install themselves as habits by means of regular, planned updates and additions. This is time that can be monetised by way of a subscription model, time in which other products may be sold to you, like skins and paintjobs, and time that becomes a commodity in itself, "engagement", which can be transmuted and exploited to various end. I'm not sure it's ever been expressed this way in any press release boast about longevity, but the unspoken principle/logical extrapolation seems to be that ideally, a live service game should keep us plugged in and plugging away till we die.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strange Scaffold’s newly released FPS I Am Your Beast is very fun for quite a few reasons, but chief among them is a deep appreciation for the poetry of good videogame violence. I’m not using the big P word just to throw out an overly worthy comparison to something we might associate with craft or beauty, but as a nod toward the game’s playful application of what I previously called ‘a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage’ one morning where I had clearly eaten my wordy Weetabix. The way its hurled knives and curb stomps and inexplicable decapitations flow together have an assonant, almost Suessian quality to them.
But it’s also, well, just a bit like Mad Libs. You play as Harding, a man who’s mythical lethality is established very early on. The showing is there in the moment to moment, but the telling is conveyed through cute tricks like how everyone you meet is so deeply afraid of Harding that they loudly keep track of exactly what weapon he’s holding at all times. The Mad Libs comes in through the fact that you can draw Harding a route between A and B, and it’s a given that multiple heads are going to come unstuck from necks along the way. You’re sort of just casually filling in the verbs that seem the most fun to you in the moment. One of the verbs is ‘hornet’. Hornet is a verb now.

Yes, I am the kind of wizard who hurls a bunny rabbit, if there are no boulders to spare.
Happily, it transpires that Proletariat have resurrected their creation and handed it over to posterity in the shape of a free standalone Community Version, available on Itch.io.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In theory, vampires and immersive sims go together as naturally as bats and caves. Immersive sims tend to involve a balance of stealth, acrobatics, raw strength and crafty manipulation, and vampires are celebrated for all of these things. Despite this, actual vampire-themed immersive sims are rare. My list starts with Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines... and sort of ends there. In a devastating betrayal, Arkane Austin's Redfall wasn't an immersive sim but an open world co-op shooter (a not very good one). The much-delayed Bloodlines 2 was recently downgraded from immersive sim to RPG by new developers The Chinese Room. Arkane Lyon's Blade adaptation seems promising, but it's a ways off. 


Here to paper over the immersive vamping gap in the market is Byte Barrel's Trust, "a new first-person shooter with immersive sim elements". It takes place in a world where the vampires are hunted for their blood, which has become an everyday human energy source, used for everything from car batteries to streetlights. The irony! I feel like, in the circumstances, the ideal solution would be for humans to let vampires suck their blood in return for vampires letting humans use their blood for electricity, but that wouldn't make for a very thrilling shooter. Anyway, here's the trailer.

You're constantly repairing corroded doors and swapping out busted engine parts with cobbled-together technology. But maybe this tinkering was a little too much. Our review praised the game for its "trunk loads of atmosphere" but called the constant need to craft stuff "laborious". If you also felt this, then good news. An update now lets you fiddle the difficulty options a generous amount, say developers Ironwood Studios, making the game easier and bringing crafting needs right down.
Buuut... if you thought the opposite - that the game wasn't hard enough - you can now tick a box that makes hitting yourself with the trunk door kill you stone dead.

In between burrito recipes and hymns to the Fujifilm X100v, this gorgeous toylike art tool's gamely turning stretches of balmy meadow into semi-ruined castles, semi-ruined villages and semi-ruined citadels. 
Dreamy and slightly haunted, it's conjured words like "bewitching" and "spellbinding" in the comments sections, too. It makes sense, really. Tiny Glade's a game about making rustic dioramas and then photographing them. It's not hard to imagine some exiled magical person might live in here among the rocks and reeds and wild heather.

Eliot's The Wasteland and Mad Max: Fury Road - a blend of influences that would typically get you kicked out of the Creative Writing Club for being simultaneously too fancy and too obvious, but the game beyond the epigraph looks pretty swish.
It's "a compact and high-density Metroidvania, with a focus on sequence-breaking and playing things out of order". It uses a square aspect display ratio calibrated to give wizened Game Boy enthusiasts the shakes, and is made up of 200 single-screen rooms that "slot into the larger puzzle-box of the world". Also, you play a thorn witch who looks a bit like 1950s Tinkerbell, with a touch of Betty Boop. Here's a trailer.

The latest update for the physics-based open world build-a-car game introduces a mountable theodolite, which lets you stitch together monorail networks you can then ride about on.
If monorails strike you as frivolous, don't worry. It's more of a Shelbyville idea. And in any case, the theodolite also lets you construct networks of pipes, power lines and rail-less tarmac roads - the ready-salted crisp of the road family. It’s a chonky expansion that, in the words of lead developer Ian MacLarty, has only “scratched the surface of where this new system could go”. I am predicting an eventual pivot into either themepark management or factory simulator.

Twenty hours ago I placed my first manufacturer somewhere around here. Back then it represented the state of the art, hatching me a pristine batch of 1.25 computers every minute - now I’ve forgotten where I put the damn thing, after delving into my factory’s guts to hook that piddly yet still useful batch of old relics up to my main production line. I’m building supercomputers now, and the many manufacturers that make those are hungry.
Something is always hungry in Satisfactory, and that hunger pulls you from task to task in a near-seamless and frankly beautiful daze of ever-escalating industry. It is mesmerising and it is fearsome, and after five years of early access it’s finally complete.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in June, Edwin covered One Million Checkboxes, a website with one million checkboxes that players could check or uncheck, with any change visible to all other visitors of the site. It became an obsession for some in the two weeks the website was online, as players fought to fill all the boxes, or undo the work of their peers.

The fight was far more complicated than it seemed, as the developer recently explained, with some players finding ways to encode hidden messages in the checkboxes.

In reality, they were being taken away due to a criminal complaint filed by Hollywood, Canal+, Apple, Amazon, and other rightsholders. Since then, the owners of Uptobox have turned to the legal system, hoping to salvage whatever they can. On Thursday, a Paris court informed the defendants that their servers will not be returned.

All pretty and crunchy and satisfying. It's just a shame it only lasts a week or two before turning into mulch on the pavement. Reminds me of a Regina Spektor lyric: "Leaves become most beautiful when they're about to die". And now, inevitably whatever I write below this will be a lie, because I'll actually spend my weekend listening to old Regina Spektor songs, because she's just the best.
But for now at least, let's keep up the pretense that we're not all lying through our teeth every weekend with these posts. Here's what we're all (allegedly) clicking on this weekend!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In V Rising, you're a fledgling vampire on a mission to become absolute bossferatu of a Gothic open world. You get a Diablo-ish combat system, the ability to shapeshift into a spider, and a whole castle to prance around in, crooning at the moon. I like this premise almost as much as I dislike the fact that V Rising is also a survival game, in which you must fell trees and master a crafting system like a common turnip farmer.


What do we hope for when our interest in a game is almost perfectly balanced by our disinterest? We hope that the developers will treat us to a free-to-play weekend, in which our perhaps-unfounded reservations might be strategically offset by the endorphin rush of not having paid any goddamn money. This, V Rising creators Stunlock have now done. The game is free to download and play on Steam from right now until Monday, 16th September at 5pm UK or 10am PST.

It's an "aggressively random" response to what the developers call the "lock-and-key" philosophy of certain immersive sims. It's also just been Major Updated, with new two player cooperative local and online multiplayer, various quality-of-life tweaks, new recording functionality, and a suite of gameplay changes or fixes to make Larian's eyes water. If you've been holding out for a sim in which "frogs can jump off of other frogs" and "delete that's deleted by delete triggers the delete's deletion as it gets deleted", well, I encourage you to get involved.

For whatever reason, the universe this takes place in doesn't seem to value brushes or those rolly mops. "No", it says, kicking your brush into the sun. "Spray or nay".

The group in question are the Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs, or BEUC, who represent 44 non-governmental consumer organisations from 31 countries, and have been around since 1962. They're accusing the publishers of Fortnite, EA Sports FC 24, Minecraft, Clash of Clans and others of misleading people -  specifically children - with their in-game premium currencies, and breaching European Union consumer protection laws. On a press site that summarises the results of various longer studies, they offer the below broad complaints about the practice.

It is Diddy Kong Racing but all the courses are water slides. It's Cool Runnings but there are 40 penguins instead of four Jamaicans. Okay, that last one is a bit of a stretch. But basically, yes, this brightly coloured free-to-play knockout racer feels like that one Super Mario 64 level where you race the big penguin down a slide, only this time there are a ton of other players trying to beat you to the secret shortcut. It's coming out next week.

My humble contribution is 50/50, a downloadable or browser-based game which I suspect will fill some of you with the deepest aggravation. As the name suggests, it's about cutting things in half - specifically food items, such as fried eggs (easy enough) and candy canes (WTF). You draw a line down each object with your mouse, then click or hit space bar to perform a slice. Then, the game calculates a percentage.  If it's bang-on or very close to 50/50, you'll pass. If not, you'll have to start over. I know: this is how entire days are wasted. Sorry.

The resignations came in the wake of a dispute between Annapurna Interactive president Nathan Gary and Annapurna studio head Megan Ellison. As Bloomberg report, negotiations were taking place to "spin off the video-game division as an independent entity." After failing to reach an agreement, Ellison pulled out of the negotiations, resulting in the resignation of Gary and “other executives.” Further resignations followed, with a reported two dozen other staff leaving the company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There seem to be an infinite number of video game showcase streams these days, each one promising to be full of exciting indie games. Whatever my feelings about the entertainment value of these streams, I can't deny I watch all of them, or that they introduce me to games I might have otherwise missed.

Next on the calendar is the Convegence games showcase on September 26th, which is a new event that - hey, what a twist - promises to feature exciting indie games. It does have some recognisable publishers onboard, including Secret Mode, Thunderful, and Kepler, among others.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier today, Nic covered the full release of Steam Families, a feature which makes it easier for families to share a game library and for parents to manage kids' purchases and playtime on the digital storefront. It's a neat improvement over the old system.

Unfortunately I can't think about anything other than the Steam Families logo, which is pictured above and is clearly a shocked, possibly aghast face. Or so I thought at first. The more I stare at it, the more it seems to reveal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Serie A CEO Luigi De Siervo's dramatic take on Italian football's piracy problems isn't new, likewise his insistence that only coercive action will produce results. "Football is being killed," he said in a recent interview. "However, at the end of this battle we will win. Because it's either them or us." How this will be achieved isn't clear. Pirates keep jumping to new servers and if promises are kept, fans are getting sued next.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are many reasons to play and write about Arco. The Mesoamerican pixelart landscapes, for example - radiant, cloud-hung platters of land with people and buildings reduced to daubs of paint in the foreground. The fact that it's about witnessing and surviving colonial invasion, rather than the more familiar European or North American video game fantasy of searching a New World for plunder.
The ensemble storytelling, with four, successively playable characters setting their own lenses to thickly entangled themes of sorrow, vengeance and growing understanding. The sparse, expressive dialogue, each phrase carefully tucked inside its speech bubble. The music. And the little things at the level of how you move, what you do. When you pick a faraway destination on your map, your character makes the journey screen by screen, which gives you a second to lean back and be a passenger, watching the horizon, at least until you're ambushed by a giant beetle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl. Mere weeks from release after years of delays, plopped in front of me at a cramped, lightly vibrating Gamescom booth, and you still won’t reveal your secrets. I did get to play a brief whizz through GSC Game World’s eerie FPS – enough to feel encouraged, even – but be it time constraints or the darkness of my nighttime raid into the radioactive Zone, I would have liked to have quite literally seen more.
Then again, keeping the mystery intact may have been the point all along. "As a game director, I want to hide everything from the player", GSC’s CEO Ievgen Grygorovych had told me minutes earlier. "I'm fighting with the marketing team because they want to show as much as possible!"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If roller coasters are humanity's way of injecting ourselves with a dose of fear just to stay on our toes, then water parks are our way of turning our old enemy, the sea, into a captive entertainer (or is that aquariums?) Either way, Frontier are hoping to cater for all humankind's quirky day-out desires with Planet Coaster 2, by adding water slides and wave pools to the teacups and train rides of their management sim. I had a short go on it, and while there's no chance two hours of hands-on time could give me a full impression of the building game's suite of creative tools, I was quietly pleased with the jungle-themed pool I nestled into the earth. And with the little shark mascot I hired to patrol it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hollowbody’s introduction is masterful, and not just for a sallow skyline that captures the life-sapping dreariness of British coastlines. The horror nous required to impart unease in the middle of the day are somewhat eased up on when you’ve got all that serotonin-begone drizzle to work with, sure. But this feels more poignant than that. There’s a soulful drearines and utterly heartbreaking inevitability to the vibe here, as your character and rubber suited activist pals try to get the bottom of a horrific incident. It’s got best British indie horror film of the year written all over it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An upcoming "survival experience" from the makers of Eve Online got its first trailer today, teasing spaceships against stellar backdrops. Eve Frontier was previously known as Project Awakening and is set in a faraway sector of the Eve universe. The developer calls it "a sandbox which focuses on self-reliance, skill-based tactical gameplay and third-party development". Huh? Third party development? Oh, I see. It has a bunch of blockchain cryptocurrency horseshit attached to it. Great.
