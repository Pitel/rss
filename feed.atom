The Maw tends to be at low ebb over the Xmas period, because it has a violent allergy to festive cheer. But for the moment, it still clamours for News.


Some game releases we're pondering this week: squad-based RTS Stargate: Timekeepers (12th Dec), Settlers spiritual follow-up Pioneers of Pagonia (13th Dec, early access), anime chainsaw metroidvania Cookie Cutter (14th Dec), "pixel pulp" visual novel Bahnsen Knights (14th Dec), and multiversal metroidvania Trinity Fusion (15th Dec).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original DOOM is 30 years old now. That means it has been a little over thirty years since Nintendo turned down Id's offer to port their games to the PC and began a chain reaction that would result in Carmack, Romero, and co. creating the FPS genre. Thanks, Nintendo! 


I should also thank John Romero since the co-creator and level designer of the original DOOM has just released SIGIL II, an all-new unofficial DOOM campaign completely free of charge. I still haven't had the time to experience the sequel, but, if it is anything like the original SIGIL, chances are that any DOOM fan will enjoy it quite a bit. It's a treat to all fans of the original game, but it also adds a lot of new flavor that even newer players are bound to enjoy.


Image by John Romero


SIGIL II, unofficial DOOM 2 episode, is available now


SIGIL II acts as a new episode in a series, meaning that it features actual story beats. It also features nine new levels, eight new multiplayer arenas, a new OST composed by James Paddock, and new art.


On top of this new release, Romero will also be hosting a live Twitch event today, where he will be joining DOOM's other John co-creator, John Carmack, to discuss the original game. 




It's great to see that DOOM has survived for so long, and not just because of the latest games in the series. The older games are very much alive as well. Just this year, we also saw the release of one of the greatest mods of all time. I'm of course talking about Myhouse.WAD for DOOM II, which I'm just gonna recommend you try getting into fully blind.


If you own the original DOOM, you can now download SIGIL and SIGIL II for free, or buy their incredibly rad old-school big box versions here.

The entire game is pretty much modeled after what you already experienced in the acclaimed 2017 title, and yet we couldn’t begin to list all the fun elements they built upon to turn Tears of the Kingdom into another sensational hit.

Howdy folks, and welcome back to another edition of Box Art Brawl.
Before we get cracking with this week's battle, let's take a look at how we got on last time, hm? Well, it was Batman: Vengeance's turn to kick up a storm, with the European and North American variants of the GBA game going head-to-head in a duel for the ages. It was remarkably close, too, but ultimately the North American version managed to take home the trophy with 52% of the vote.

Together, the pair built id Software and the FPS genre as we know it - before the cracks started to show during the difficult development of Quake, ending their professional partnership.
Yet any lasting acrimony has now dissipated. That became apparent when Romero’s new autobiography, ‘Doom Guy: Life In First Person’, showed up on shelves with a glowing back cover quote from Carmack. The latter praised Romero’s “remarkable memory”, and waxed wistfully about their shared impact on the gaming medium. “For years, I thought that I had been born too late and missed out on participating in the heroic eras of computing,” Carmack wrote. “Only much later did I realise that Romero and I were at the nexus of a new era - the 3D game hackers.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I helped a friend spec out a gaming PC to play Baldur's Gate 3 and other triple-A releases, and we opted for a machine with an RTX 4070 Ti graphics card as that fit within her £2000 budget and allows for excellent performance with gaming monitors up to 4K while leaving enough cash free for a high-end CPU and other nice components. 
Today though, you can pick up a pre-built RTX 4070 Ti gaming PC for way less than that - just £1299 - when you get it from Stormforce Gaming in the UK. This build includes a 12th-gen Core i5 processor, 16GB of DDR4 memory, a 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD and a 750W power supply, all for £500 off its listed price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forget The Walking Dead; now it's The Playing Dead, as The Walking Dead: Betrayal is being pulled from Steam and offering a refund.


The game's being pulled after Skybound Games and Other Ocean Interactive were "not able to find a path to build the spirited community of backstabbers we originally envisioned," the developers said in a blog shared to the game's Steam page. 


The game, which has been available in Early Access since September, never received a full release. It's the second stumble for the otherwise popular Walking Dead franchise this year. The Walking Dead: Destinies, which was released earlier in December, was the subject of minor controversy surrounding its graphics.




What was The Walking Dead: Betrayal?


Announced at San Diego Comic-Con 2023, The Walking Dead Betrayal was a social deduction game that blended elements of The Walking Dead and Among Us. 


Players would work together in teams of Survivors to escape hordes of walkers. However, the social element came into play via "Traitors," Survivors whose goal is to sabotage the team for their own success. 


As of the announcement of its closure, the game sits at a "mixed" rating on Steam, across a meager 111 reviews. Many reviews regard the game as fine, though several lament the waning player base. Others draw attention to the similarities to Other Ocean's previous game, Project Winter, which had a similar gameplay loop.


How to get a refund for The Walking Dead: Betrayal


For players who purchased the game through Steam, getting a refund for The Walking Dead: Betrayal is as simple as requesting one through Steam. 


Users who purchased the game through a retailer will need to contact that retailer. More information is available on the game's store page.

This review originally went live in 2016, and we're updating and republishing it to celebrate the game's arrival in Switch's N64 library via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.

Originally released for the Nintendo 64 in 1998, 1080° Snowboarding was Nintendo's attempt to bring the snowboarding experience to its home console. And the company did a good job: six courses provide a variety of thrills as you hop on a board and tackle the snowy slopes. There are five riders of varying abilities, several boards are available to ride on, and there's the ability to perform some fancy-looking tricks, too. And it still holds up decently all these years later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers may know me as one of Destructoid's local Destiny heads, but right now, we need to talk about the Video Game Awards (VGA). Namely, how Cyberpunk 2077 stole a 2023 award from another game and studio.


On December 7, the VGA named Cyberpunk 2077 the winner of the ceremony's Best Ongoing Game award. This was in spite of the fact that Cyberpunk went up against actual live service titles like Apex Legends, Fortnite, Genshin Impact, and Final Fantasy XIV. 


As some may remember, Cyberpunk 2077 is not an "ongoing game." It's a single-player game and one that was released with disastrous initial results. The launch was so awash with issues that Sony would even quickly remove it from the PSN digital storefront. CD Projekt RED would go on to spend the better part of three years fixing the …]]></summary>

If you have even a passing interest in video games (and we assume that you do, since you have found yourselves here), then you probably will have heard of Did You Know Gaming? Since its launch in 2012, the trivia-focused website and YouTube channel has amassed a huge following, showcasing little-known facts and uncovering lost games that never saw the light of day. Now, the team is turning its attention towards another type of project altogether: a tabletop card game.
Do You Know Gaming?, a collaboration between the DYKG team and Lost in Cult, is a dungeon-crawling trivia game with a 1980s 'big box' feel. On a basic level, the card game lets you choose a character — each of whom has their own special abilities such as health bonuses, increased inventory space etc. — and set out on a quest to collect four Relics. Along the way, you'll encounter monsters who can be damaged by answering gaming trivia questions of varying difficulty, collect loot and take on final bosses. If it sounds like a video game in card form, that's because it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Big Run reward bug is still present.
Earlier this week Nintendo rolled out Version 6.0.1 of Splatoon 3. Although it's failed to fix certain problems associated with the latest Big Run event, apparently there's a patch coming in the future that can hopefully address this problem.
Apart from this, Nintendo has shared its usual list of patch notes, so in case you missed it, here they are in full courtesy of the official support page. Once again, this update hasn't fixed the Big Run reward bug:

The Game Awards 2023 was a huge success for Geoff Keighley this year, but he has received some feedback about the show's treatment of winners, asking them to wrap up their speeches before some of them even got underway.
Nintendo's very own Legend of Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma was seemingly on the receiving end of this as well as many other respected figures within the industry, and now in response to this, the creator and host has responded in a brief message on social media.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Considering that Capcom was ruling the fighting game roost in 1993, Saturday Night Slam Masters is such a low-key production. Street Fighter 2 blended together with a wrestling game sounds like such an amazing concept, but that’s absolutely not what Saturday Night Slam Masters is.


And that’s really weird, considering that one of the grapplers, Gunloc, has a bio that suggests he is related to a famous street fighter while Chun Li appears in the audience. Yet, despite the references that imply it exists in the same universe as Street Fighter 2, Saturday Night Slam Masters is pretty much just a wrestling game. It’s not even a particularly outstanding wrestling game, but it’s still one of my favorite arcade games of all time.


Why?

Well, even if you’re feeling tired from a marathon of game trailers and celebrity appearances, these classic games are still well worth checking out. Also, the trailer for the update features more than a few seconds of gameplay from each game, unlike most of what we saw during The Game Awards. Oh, did I just say that out loud!

"Along the way, we lost quite a few people also, so we want to dedicate this to all the people that we lost," Vincke said, specifically citing lead cinematic artist Jim Southworth, who died last month.


It was a touching moment, the kind that sticks with you from an awards show like this. And at the time, the prompter visible to speech winners displayed "Please wrap it up."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hand me the bug repellent bat-spray, Robin.
When it comes to superhero games, Rocksteady Studios served us up a trio of the very best examples of the genre with its superlative Batman: Arkham Trilogy. Whether you prefer the smaller scale and comparative intimacy of Batman: Arkham Asylum, the vast open world of Arkham City or the Batmobile-powered battles of Arkham Knight, there's a lot of top-notch bat-action for bat-fans to dig into throughout this delightfully dark odyssey.
We've had our fingers crossed for a long time that at least some of the incredible Arkham games would eventually (bat)wing their way onto the Switch and now we've got the entire flipping trilogy to blast our way through. But how do they perform on Nintendo's ageing portable machine? As expected, 2009's Arkham Asylum, which debuted on PS3, plays fairly well. With scaled-back graphics and a 30fps target in the mix, it's a solid port that gets the job done, even if it does with zero panache and a few more stutters and texture pop-in issues than we'd have liked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GRYPHLINE has revealed that the next chapter in the Arknights series will soon make its console debut. A PlayStation 5 version of Arknights: Endfield has been announced, alongside an upcoming technical test for the PC version of the game.


Arknights: Endfield is an RPG that aims to deliver a blend Arknight's signature strategy with real-time combat. In a new trailer shown during The Game Awards, we can see the combat system in action alongside our first glance at the game's boss battles. As of writing, GRYPHLINE has not announced a date for the PS5, PC, or mobile versions of the game. However, players can sign up now for the PC technical test that will begin on January 11.




The PC technical test will have an English user interface and both Mandarin and Japanese voiceover options. The test puts you in the role of the Endministrator of Endfield Industries, who is rumored to show up whenever a crisis hits the company or the wider world of Talos-II. You'll get a chance to explore that world while leading a crew of nine playable characters, exploring the Endfield Industries tech tree, and dipping your toes in the battle system. 


The factory system — which lets you place factory buildings strategically and gain an edge in battle with items manufactured through your automated production line — will also be in play during the test period. Through this system you'll be able to directly impact Talos-II by modifying the terrain and surrounding environments. 


Sign-ups will be live until December 23 at 7:59 p.m. PT.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After winning big last night at The Game Awards and bagging trophies in three major categories, Remedy Entertainment has just announced "The Final Draft" for Alan Wake 2; a major update that not only introduces the New Game Plus mode we've been waiting on, but also unlocks an additional ending to the main story.


With all the intricate plot threads and surrealist narrative developments in Alan Wake 2, a few more playthroughs are definitely in order to wrap your head around Sam Lake's acclaimed sequel. And why start from scratch when you can retain all your equipment and instead contend with more challenging mobs?


The studio is teasing numerous "subtle additions" in the New Game Plus experience, including a Nightmare Difficulty setting and even new manuscript pages and videos. There are also bug fixes and performance optimizations, which might help the demanding game run more smoothly on older PC hardware.  The Final Draft is scheduled to go live on December 11.

How to unlock the New Game Plus mode in Alan Wake 2


It goes without saying that a completed playthrough of the game is required to unlock the New Game Plus, but it looks like the new additions in The Final Draft will also require you to finish the game at least once.


You retain all your Charms and character upgrades, but the weapons will be found in the character's first available shoebox, as opposed to their inventory.


It's unclear if the new ending can be unlocked during your first playthrough, though with two more expansion packs (Night Springs and The Lake House) coming our way in 2024 and beyond, this probably won't serve as the definitive conclusion to the stories of our main protagonists.

Update #2 : Earlier this week, Nintendo announced that it was aware of a bug in Splatoon 3's latest Big Run event which resulted in players receiving the incorrect reward for their efforts. A patch was released earlier today to fix this problem, but it looks like the bug remains.
In a new post from @nintendo_cs (via @OatmealDome), Nintendo confirmed that ver. 6.0.1 has not fixed the bug, but the team is working on another patch to hopefully combat it in the future.

It's a welcome change from dusty radiation or goddamn elves again, and the RPG structure feels flexible and fairly responsive to your actions even before you start picking sides and ideologies. It hasn't quite stolen my heart, but it may well steal some of my christmas.

This review originally went live in 2013, and we're updating and republishing it to mark the game's arrival in Switch's N64 library via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.

The Nintendo 64 and Rare go together like Banjo and Kazooie. The developer was behind several of the stellar titles found on the system, many of which were some of the most original games in history. One of the most unique titles released by the UK-based developer was the 3D action-shooter Jet Force Gemini, which launched in 1999. While Rare had much success in the first-person shooter genre with titles such as GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark, it decided to take a different approach for this title and set about making it a third-person experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During The Game Awards, we learned that The Outlast Trials is wrapping up its time in PC early access and is heading to consoles next March. The game was first announced in 2019 and entered Steam Early Access in May. 
The game is a co-op take on the popular horror series, with up to four players controlling test subjects fighting to survive in a dangerous test facility. Check out its latest trailer below (headphone users beware: it's got a lot of shrieking streamers).

If you're looking for something else, Outer Wilds: Archaeologist Edition is live on Switch. In case you haven't been following along, the Archaeologist Edition is just a fancy "GOTY with DLC" package. It comes with the Echoes of the Eye add-on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 27, but shortly before its release, developer Remedy Entertainment revealed that it would be getting a New Game Plus mode with an alternative narrative and nightmare difficulty, amongst other things. During The Game Awards 2023 last night, Remedy, which picked up three wins during the show, revealed that "The Final Draft" update, which includes the aforementioned New Game Plus mode, goes live next week. 
More specifically, The Final Draft hits Alan Wake 2 on Monday, December 11. It features a new ending to the story of Alan Wake that Remedy says will spark speculation and theory crafting among its most dedicated fans. Plus, there's new lore to find in the form of new videos and manuscript pages. 


"Players will retain all Weapons, Charms, and character upgrades earned during their first playthrough," a blog post about The Final Draft reads. "They should come in handy when you seek the ultimate challenge of trying out the new Nightmare Difficulty level. Brace yourselves for intensified enemies, strategic gameplay, and an adrenaline-pumping experience that will push your skills to the limit." 
You will find all of your unlocked weapons in the first available shoebox for the characters, so don't expect to immediately start the game with all of your weaponry. 
Remedy says The Final Draft update also includes numerous bug fixes and slight performance optimizations that will be further detailed in the complete update notes, which go live alongside the update on Monday. 
The Final Draft update for Alan Wake 2 goes live at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Monday, December 11, on all platforms where you can play the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Game Awards 2023 was a massive night for games, with more than 30 announcements, premieres, and more. It ended with developer Larian Studios taking home the Game of the Year award for its critically acclaimed RPG, Baldur's Gate 3. Shortly after the win, Larian revealed that the game was now available on Xbox Series X/S, meaning it's finally playable on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
 

Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke tweeted, "I had one job and that was to announce this if we won an award – sorry all but happy it's out there," meaning this might have been meant to be an on-stage announcement. Nonetheless, everyone's happy Vincke and the team took the extra time to praise its team of developers and thank fans for the reception during the Game of the Year award acceptance speech instead. 
Xbox players, it’s party time.

Not for the sake of simply disturbing an audience, but instead, they’re stories communicating the more unsettling aspects of humanity — the parts we shy away from or refuse to acknowledge.


Grief, depression, trauma, and pain are all prevailing themes in these narratives, and while they don't aim to shock, they inevitably do. Indies aren't the only titles that attempt this, either, though they often do it best. Multimillion-dollar productions from megacorporations should have the budget to explore here, but it's often a one-person team or a small group weaving the tales that are most impactful.

Prior the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom earlier this year, our heads were full of theories about where Link's latest adventure would fit on the much-discussed timeline. We knew that it would be taking place directly after Breath of the Wild, but where does that put it compared to, say, Ocarina of Time or A Link to the Past?
As it turns out, TOTK did not provide any kind of conclusive answer to this question. There are references to other games dotted about this version of Hyrule, but nothing concrete. Perhaps the game's producer and director, Eiji Aonuma and Hidemaro Fujibayashi would be able to shed some light on the series' chronology, we thought. We were wrong.

The Game Awards 2023 turned out to be a pretty big night for Nintendo, with Switch announcements coming left, right and centre (you can find them all in our round-up). It was also a big one for wins. We have covered a few of those on the site already, but let's all give a big cheer for Pikmin 4, which managed to take home the award for Best Sim/Strategy Game!
The win came in one of Geoff Keighley's award floods, where the host reveals a bunch of winners in one go. This means that there was no acceptance speech (or really a chance to applaud) for Nintendo in this one, but it is a well-deserved win nonetheless.

Towards the end of every year, we all get to enjoy (or in our case, give up our evenings and ruin our fingers to the tune of) one of the gaming industry's biggest events. The Game Awards is not only an awards ceremony - it's a lavish smorgasbord of video game announcements, trailers, and news stretching into the early hours of the morning. At least for us Brits.
In case you don't have the time to sit through the entire multi-hour livestream, we've done the hard work and put together a list of every noteworthy trailer and announcement that was shown at this year's The Game Awards. You can get started reading; I'm just gonna... shut my eyes for a bit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mecha Break is an new multiplayer co-op mech game by Seasun Games that premiered during The Game Awards tonight. Fans of games like Armored Core VI and Zone of the Enders may want to keep it on their radar. 
The game puts you in the cockpit of a variety of mech suits, which you can customize the look and weapons of, to take on other players across a variety of modes. The biggest battlefield is a 48-player battle royale. If you’d rather play alongside friends, a co-op option allows three-to-six players to team up to complete specialized missions. Other destinations include a 3v3 arena mode and a 6v6 battlefield mode. See the game in action below.


Mecha Break currently has no release window or announced platforms.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Upcoming RTS from developer Frost Giant Studios is set to release in Early Access in the Summer of 2024. The PC-exclusive title had its release date revealed alongside a brief gameplay trailer at The Game Awards. Frost Giant Studios first revealed the RTS last year.




The Frost Giant Studios team is made up of RTS developer veterans who have worked on popular titles like Starcraft and Age of Empires. Stormgate will feature an ever-evolving campaign in a science fantasy universe as well as 3-player co-op vs AI, 1v1, and 3v3 matches as well as a map editor. Actor Simu-Liu (Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings) also made an appearance to reveal his character in Stormgate, Warz.


I'm so ready for this. Starcraft was a big part of my childhood and while there have been some good RTS since, nothing has quite captured the Starcraft and Warcraft 3 feeling. 


Stormgate will be released in Early Access on PC in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Dusk Falls, the narrative adventure game about two families linked together by a burglary gone wrong, hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in July of last year. More than a year later, developer Interior/Night is bringing the game to PlayStation, but you'll have to wait just a bit longer to play it.
That's because As Dusk Falls hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on March 7, 2024. Interior/Night announced this news during The Game Awards 2023 tonight. It will also launch on the Epic Games Store and GOG on PC the same day. The studio released a new trailer to celebrate the announcement, and you can check it out for yourself below:


This new PS5 version of As Dusk Falls includes new exclusive features like haptic feedback and touchpad controls. Plus, a new audio description accessibility feature will be available on all platforms in March.
"In this uncompromising crime drama of betrayal, sacrifice, and resilience, players explore the entangled lives of two families across decades, starting in 1998 with a robbery gone wrong in small-town Arizona," a press release reads. "The story can be replayed to discover the vastly different outcomes depending on the decisions taken. As Dusk Falls has an innovative multiplayer mode supporting up to 8 players locally, online, or as a combination of both, using controllers or the companion app for Android or iOS." 
As Dusk Falls won the Games For Impact award at last year's Game Awards. For more about the game, read Game Informer's As Dusk Falls review.

The update,  Rundown 8.0 Duality includes new expeditions, new awful beings to murder you, and new weapons to attempt to stop them. It looks awful in a lovely way. Maybe I'll finally pluck up the courage to give GTFO a proper go, especially as a free trial weekend is running on Steam and the game's discounted too. I'd have to be some sort of coward to ignore that. Some sort of coward who doesn't want to creep and fight through hordes of horrid meatmonsters.

To end The Game Awards, Capcom unveiled the next major entry in the Monster Hunter series. It's called Monster Hunter Wilds and it will be released on multiple next-generation platforms in 2025.
The unfortunate catch here is that there's no mention of Nintendo platforms, but given the series' history, anything could happen. This new game will follow the 20th anniversary celebrations of the Monster Hunter franchise early next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a long night of The Game Awards. Many trailers have been shown for upcoming games, but only one can be the final trailer. Capcom has taken that honor this year by revealing the newest installment in the Monster Hunter series, Monster Hunter Wilds.


As has been a recurring theme during this event, we didn't exactly see a ton of raw gameplay in this trailer. We do, however, see a lot of monsters. Also, some sick mount acrobatics are shown off. And before we know it, a title card is thrown on screen. Clearly this is a teaser just to let us all know this game exists, since that projected date of 2025 is still a ways off from now. Feel free to speculate based on the footage we were shown.




After the trailer, Geoff Keighley brought Monster Hunter series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto to the stage. Despite acknowledging that the game is dated for 2025, Keighley asked Tsujimoto when we might expect to play Monster Hunter Wilds. As one might expect, the answer for when we'll play this video game coming out in 2025 is "2025." However, Tsujimoto clarified that we should expect to learn more about the title during the Summer of 2024.


Monster Hunter Wilds will release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam. This is notable, as the game's predecessor, Monster Hunter Rise, was originally a Nintendo Switch title. The platforms shown indicate that Wilds will be closer in spirit to Monster Hunter World, which will be roughly seven years old by the time Wilds comes out. 


I'm interested to see if games like Monster Hunter Rise on the Switch and Monster Hunter Now on mobile devices drives winds up attracting new audiences to Monster Hunter Wilds once it releases. It's certainly made me pay more attention to the series, so we'll have to see if this strategy pays off when Monster Hunter Wilds debuts two years from now.

According to Larian, the Xbox version of the GOTY will include the newly released Patch 5 which is a very substantial update. 




Those looking to pick up the game digitally can now do so on the Xbox Store. Physical copies will ship early next year. Even though we knew the Xbox version was on the way, it will surely come as a nice surprise for Xbox gamers to finally get the opportunity to jump into this epic game.




With the release, Baldur's Gate 3 is now officially available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

A kick in the dino groin to this year's monster hunting pretender Wild Hearts, perhaps? Who can say. Formally unveiled at tonight's Game Awards, this new Monster Hunter is coming in 2025, and looks to be the jazzed-up successor to Monster Hunter: World. That's not a diss on Rise (which was excellent). Just that it's being developed for PC and consoles first, rather than Switch. And it looks rad as heck. Come and watch the reveal trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the biggest surprises from The Game Awards this year is the surprise release of Final Fantasy 16 DLC titled Echoes of the Fallen. 


The DLC sees the return of Clive Rosfield, and we get brand new chapters to expand on the game's epic tale. The trailers reveal that we'll be getting more of the explosive combat that made the base game so exhilarating to play, though there'll be new enemies to contend with. 


As a PlayStation blog post explains, in addition to new chapters, the DLC brings with it a new level cap, weapons, battles, and accessories. One of the weapons included is the iconic Buster Sword. There's also a musical treat in the form of "the 'Away (1987)' Orchestrion Roll which allows a chip-tune version of the song 'Away' to be played as background music in the hideaway." 


This isn't all that fans are getting, as The Rising Tide is another DLC that will be coming in Spring 2024. Not much has been revealed about it except that it "will bring new challenges and more, including the confrontation between Clive and the legendary Eikon, Leviathan." 


Both DLCs are paid but with all the next content I am tempted to crack open my wallet and return to the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The curtain has closed on another year of The Game Awards, with Baldur's Gate 3 taking home the top prize - Game of the Year - at The Game Awards 2023.


For the biggest names of the night, a few took home a bevy of awards. Baldur's Gate 3 led the charge with 6 trophies, while Alan Wake 2 took home a solid 3 and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom picked up a surprising single trophy.


For a game as tough as this year has been for the actual industry and developers, the games were at least pretty good. Hopefully, the developers who took home some hardware tonight can feel accomplished for all they managed to make this year.


Here are all the winners from The Game Awards 2023, listed in bold, alongside the other nominated titles.

They're called Echoes of the Fallen and Rising Tide, and the former is available to play right now.
Echoes of the Fallen adds new story chapters that takes place before the finale of Final Fantasy XVI. Clive and the gang follow the origins of a mysterious crystal to a strange ruin filled with deadly defenses tied to Eikons and plenty of monsters. Rising Tide is set to launch in Spring 2024 and is a bit more mysterious, but we do see Clive taking on what may be the scariest enemy in all of Final Fantasy: Tonberry King. Oh, and Leviathan pops up too.

Then you might enjoy the just-announced Exoborne, a tactical open world shooter from Sharkmob, the Swedish studio behind Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt. Running on Unreal Engine 5 and set in fictional, near-future Colton County, USA, it's a PvPvE affair in which you roam a big ruined map either alone or as a team, fighting other players, NPCs and renegade "natural" elements. Published by Level Infinite, it'll be a premium game with live service elements and microtransactions, and there's no release date yet. I caught a briefing before today's announcement, and yeah, it looks all right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Open Betas of The Finals has been enough to turn this FPS into a very anticipated multiplayer game. As one of the biggest surprises of The Game Awards, Embark surprise launched the game on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. 


Though we've gotten a sample of it prior, we'll finally be able to see everything the adrenaline-filled shooter has to offer. With the launch of Season 1, you'll get to play in the Las Vegas virtual arena that'll leave you dazzled with its lights and even some unexpected features such as UFOs. 


As Embark has explained, at its core, The Finals is a game show featuring arenas inspired by real-world locations. You're given the freedom to create your own hero and vie for victory. It doesn't hold back when it comes to mayhem-filled fun, and you can show off your skills in environments reactive enough for furniture to be destroyed and buildings to collapse.

The hype behind The Finals


The game's unique premise and gorgeous visuals attracted over 7.5 million players during its Open Beta. Though it was praised by critics and players alike, some technical issues slightly dampened the experience. Embark has acknowledged these hiccups and has paid attention to community requests when tweaking the final release. 




If you're new to The Finals, be prepared for something quite novel. As creative director Gustav Tilleby explains, "The Finals isn’t another battle royale, military sim, or tactical FPS – there are plenty of those out there. It’s an entirely new take on shooters." It's hard to argue against this, as while we've had FPS games with destructible environments before (looking at you BattleBit Remastered), the studio's doing it on a scale that few others would attempt. 


Embark is a relatively young studio, having been founded in 2019. If pulled off correctly, The Finals could be the title that puts the Swedish team on the map.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Game Awards are packed with eager looks at highly anticipated games, but the ceremony is full of plenty of surprises too. One of them is a flashy Metroidvania called Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the debut game from Surgent Studios.
Zau is a boy on a quest to bring his father back from the dead. Guided by Kalunga, the God of Death, he uses his ability as a warrior shaman to defeat the ancestral spirits that roam the land of Kenzera. His main tools are a pair of magical masks; with the Moon mask he can manipulate time and crystalize enemies, and the Sun mask allows him to launch fiery spears. Studio founder Abubakar Salim says that the two masks are reminiscent of the Devil May Cry series with the way they allow the player to flip between ranged and melee modes.

The world is inspired by Bantu lore and imagery, with bright colors and mythical beasts. Additionally, the game will be scored by Nainita Desai, a British composer who made the music for Half Mermaid's Telling Lies and Immortality.
Salim founded Surgent in 2019, but most gamers would currently recognize him as the voice of Bayek from Assassin's Creed Origins. According to him, the passing of his father motivated him to create a new project – he wanted to tell a story of grief in the form of a video game. With assistance from the Ridley Scott Creative Group and Critical Role, five years later, Tales of Kenzera: Zau tells that story.
The trailer ended with the news that Tales of Kenzera: Zau will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on April 23, 2024.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the tenth anniversary since the announcement of No Man’s Sky, Hello Games has revealed their next game, Light No Fire. As is tradition at The Game Awards, it also came with a trailer.


Light No Fire is aiming to be a survival sandbox game set in a massive, procedurally generated open world claimed to be comparative in size to Earth. That’s the planet we live on!




The trailer shows off multiplayer, construction, and all kinds of traversal types on birds and dragons. The order of the day seems to be scale, but there are some cool scenes, like rabbit people bowing for some reason.


Scale is nice, but I’d like to see more about how it will differentiate itself from other survival sandbox games. Particularly No Man’s Sky. It’s a pretty full genre right now, and “big map” isn’t really the selling point it used to be. However, Hello Games has learned a lot from the constant development of No Man’s Sky.


Light No Fire has no announced release window, and the only announced platform right now is PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Need a new co-op heist game to fill the void that Payday 3 may or may not have left in your heart? Developer 10 Chambers may have your back, as their latest project Den of Wolves was unveiled during The Game Awards 2023.


I'm gonna be upfront, I don't know what to say about this trailer. It doesn't really show heist gameplay, so... I'm just going to take 10 Chambers' word that that's the genre of the game. They certainly talk about heists, that's for sure. Something interesting does seem to be going on, and it does apparently involve blowing up a safe. The creator of Payday: The Heist, Payday 2, and GTFO is behind this, so, yeah, that checks out. If you'd like to make more sense of this footage than me, than by all means.




This reveal came on the heels of the Final Chapter update for GTFO. Those who are interested in that title can try it out for free on December 10.


Meanwhile, no release date for Den of Wolves has been shown at this time. However, if you're interested in learning more about this sci-fi co-op heist shooter, you can follow the game on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The First Descendant is a free-to-play looter shooter from Nexon. There have been beta sessions before now, but the game is getting a full, proper launch next Summer. The exact date is up in the air still, but according to a blog post from the developers, it will be announced as soon as they can pin it down. Check out the latest trailer below.


In The First Descendant, you play as, you guessed, Descendants – a group of unique characters that each have distinct abilities and movesets. Your goal is to defend the planet from invaders called Colossi using the game's third-person shooting and RPG mechanics. The new trailer gives us a cinematic look at one of those fights, this time showcasing an entirely new Descendant.
There's no gameplay in this trailer, but the team assures fans that they're working to refine said gameplay, based on feedback from the nearly two million players who checked out their last open beta session. The main purpose of that beta was to test crossplay features, which makes sense, since the game is launching on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. Check it out for free when it launches simultaneously on all of those platforms in Summer 2024.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-12-08T03:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Sharkmob, makers of the battle royale Vampire: The Masquerade- Bloodhunt, have revealed a new open-world extraction shooter called Exoborne.
The game is a tactical shooter set in an apocalyptic Earth that is being torn asunder by extreme forces of nature, such as massive tornadoes and lightning storms. These calamities were somehow caused by the failure of a mysterious program called Project Rebirth, and now players find themselves fighting for survival in an environmentally unstable southwestern U.S. You play as a Reborn, a survivor outfitted in enhanced suits called Exo-Rigs with special weapons and augment your abilities to survive the myriad of threats, both human and elemental. Check out the cinematic trailer below. 


Exoborne drops players into a shared open world where, either alone or in a party of allies, they will scavenge for resources and extract them while fending off other players. The Exo-Rig bestows special abilities, such as the ability to leap very high, and comes outfitted with a grappling hook and even a parachute, which players can use to engage in aerial combat or even ride maelstroms (think Just Cause). 
The gameplay combines PvE and PvP and features an evolving narrative and sidequests that unfold throughout the otherwise multiplayer framework. Between primary tasks, you’ll also engage in dynamic public events and group missions. Powerful forces of nature add a chaotic wrinkle to fights; expect to engage in shootouts while getting swept up by tornados.
Characters, weapons, and Exo-Rigs can be customized with various mods and upgrades using the resources you extract. As a premium live-service game, Sharkmob plans to support Exoborne with various content updates, such as new live events.
Exborne is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and is coming to PC and consoles at an undetermined date.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ten years ago, at Geoff Keighley's awards show (then known as the VGX Awards), the development team at Hello Games revealed No Man's Sky. The ambitious space-exploration title promised a universe of possibilities and has since become the poster child for bouncing back from a challenging launch period.
To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the first teaser trailer, Sean Murray and Hello Games returned to Geoff Keighley's stage, now called The Game Awards, to give a brief retrospective and tease what's next. After a rundown of the last 10 years of active development of No Man's Sky, including several free updates, improvements, and expansions, the trailer teases big plans for 2024, with something that appears to involve more intricate space stations within the game.
Check out the No Man's Sky 10-Year Anniversary Trailer for yourself below: 


No Man's Sky was released in 2016 to mixed reviews but received myriad updates and improvements in the years since, delivering something beyond what was even promised in the lead-up to launch. Today, it is widely praised by critics and fans and is put forward as the foremost model for how to improve a game after a rocky launch.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every once in a while, we get to see a pretty original game take the stage at The Game Awards 2023. And Tales of Kenzera: ZAU certainly seems like it's taking a fresh look at its genre inspirations, bringing something new to action-platforming next April.


Tales of Kenzera: ZAU is from Surgent Studios, under the EA Originals label, working in collaboration with Critical Role. It's a huge list of big names, but the idea itself is really compelling. ZAU is a gorgeous action-platformer with some 'Vania inspiration.




Per a GameSpot interview with the studio, ZAU is story inside a story, as a son lost in grief for his dead father reads a tale about Zau. Zau makes a bargain with the god of death to bring his father back from the dead.


Seems ready to bring on the emotions, but the action and platform-hopping look good too. We'll see how the next EA Original performs next year, too. Tales of Kenzera: Zau is targeting an April 23, 2024 launch on consoles and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don’t Nod, the team behind Jusant and Life is Strange, has a new story-driven adventure game called Lost Records: Bloom & Rage.
The trailer begins rather innocently in 1995 with a group of four young high school friends –  Swann, Nora, Autumn, and Kat – partying together without a care in the world. The video then takes a darker turn with hints that something sinister, and perhaps otherworldly, flipping their lives on their heads. 27 years pass with no contact between the friends, but the secret they swore not to talk about again brings them back together. Lost Records: Bloom & Rage is the first title of Don't Nod's Montreal studio. 


The game is coming in late 2024 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Life is Strange is one of those series that always caught my eye. However, after a certain point, I felt overwhelmed by all the games I'd need to play to catch up. Fortunately, the team at Don't Nod has me covered, because they're teeing up a whole new universe in the upcoming Lost Record: Bloom & Rage.


At first glance, it certainly looks like a new Life is Strange game. It shows some teenagers rocking out, running through the woods, and something involving a burning building. You know, typical teenage stuff. However, there's some sort of void, and afterwards, a cut to the future. What, exactly, happened here, and why does our one character at the end look pretty shaken by it? That's for us to presumably find out.




That mystery will hopefully be solved when Lost Record: Bloom & Rage comes out in late 2024. We don't have a lot to work with here, but it has sparked my curiosity at any rate. We'll update this post as we learn more about this adventure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At The Game Awards, Saber Interactive revealed its single-player action-adventure game Jurassic Park: Survival. Players will return to Isla Nublar which is now filled with living dinosaurs as the game takes place the day after the events of the 1993 Jurassic Park film. In Survival, players will explore the island as they outsmart and interact with the dinosaurs to progress through the island.




It's an interesting decision to take with the IP. I have to admit, I thought it would be more similar to ARK: Survival Ascended with the Survival moniker, but I think this could end up being a fun take if it's done well.


Jurassic Park: Survival will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black Myth: Wukong has received a new trailer at The Game Awards, and if you aren't sold on it yet, this may be what sways you. 


The trailer shows off impressive visuals, along with some of the enemies you'll be facing. It looks like an adventure and a half with beasts of immense size roaming on the ground, in the sky, and underwater. You of course won't be going into it unarmed, as the trailer gives up glimpses of some of the action-packed sword combat. 


The game is inspired by the 1592 Chinese fantasy novel Journey to the West. Though the game seems worth getting excited about, it is not void of controversy, most of it relating to accusations of sexism at Game Science. 


 IGN reports, "several posts have surfaced from Chinese social media site Weibo, written by individuals from the studio, that contain multiple references to genitalia and sexual innuendos." Furthermore, there have been "recruitment posters by the studio, produced in 2015, which featured images and headlines that point to a culture of ingrained sexism in Game Science."


This has resulted in backlash from the gaming community, but seemingly not enough to stop the game from appearing at The Game Awards. Black Myth: Wukong is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dave the Diver publisher Nexon and developer Neople have revealed The First Berserker: Khazan, a single-player action RPG that is the next entry in the long-running Dungeon & Fighter universe. The First Berserker: Khazan stands in stark contrast to the most recent entry in this universe, DNF Duel, a multiplayer fighting game released last year. 
Neople says the DNF series combines the fast-paced, higher-energy action of old-school brawlers with classic RPG elements, all wrapped in an anime-esque art style. However, with The First Berserker: Khazan, players can expect hack 'n' slash combat and plenty of customization. 
Check it out for yourself in The First Berserker: Khazan reveal trailer below: 


"The Pell Los Empire has been saved – at a cost," a press release reads. "After the Great General Khazan and Archmage Ozma defeat the Berserk Dragon Hismar and the Dragon Legion, players will step into the shoes of Khazan as he is falsely accused of treason and exiled beyond the empire."
Neople says in The First Berserker: Khazan, combat takes center stage in Khazan's quest for vengeance against those who orchestrated his downfall, "marked by intense, aggressive, and ever-changing styles of battle." 
To survive, players must master combat, upgrade character skills, and combine weapons and armor (each with unique perks). The more missions cleared, the tougher the bosses, but defeating them and finishing missions earns players powerful gear and abilities. 
The First Berserker: Khazan will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has been in development for a long time; by the time it comes out next year, it will have been nine years since Rocksteady's last game. But after years of secret development and repeated delays, it's finally around the corner, and The Game Awards just gave us our latest look. See for yourself in the trailer below:


The notion of killing the Justice League, some of the most powerful people in the DC universe, has always felt like an impossible task for the Suicide Squad, and the more we see of these corrupted superheroes, the harder it looks. This trailer gives us a look at Green Lantern's arsenal of hard light weaponry, the Flash's speed and lightning bolts, Wonder Woman's lasso of truth, and a shadowy Batman (which is potentially related to Scarecrow's fear gas, though that's just speculation).
Luckily, the Squad is equipped with a wide array of weapons and traversal techniques, making them way more mobile than they would normally be in the comics or movies. We get a good look at new gameplay of them swinging, soaring, and shooting as well, which you can experience solo with AI companions or online with friends.
But the best part of the new trailer? The release date hasn't changed. We can take on the Justice League next year on February 2.]]></summary>

Players are tasked with surviving the relentless pursuit of imperial forces as they navigate numerous conspiracies aimed at killing Khazan as they overcome the harsh environments of the world.

Players explore the open world of Isla Nublar, which teems with a variety of newly escaped dinosaurs in a fully reactive world. Stealth seems to be more emphasized than combat, as players must use their intelligence, skills, and wit to outsmart and avoid John Hammond's prehistoric creations.

Ahead of its release early next year, the studio released a new cinematic trailer to highlight the game's narrative at The Game Awards 2023. 
While Banishers features intense action-RPG gameplay, it's also a Don't Nod game, which means players can expect a heavy emphasis on storytelling. And tonight's trailer speaks to that. 
Check out the latest Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden cinematic trailer for yourself below: 


"New Eden, 1695: Antea and Red are lovers and Banishers, trained spirit-hunters protecting people from lingering specters," a press release reads. "But when tragedy strikes and Antea herself becomes a ghost, will you honor your Banisher oath or sacrifice the living in a desperate bid to bring your beloved back?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hideo Kojima, the director behind Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding, and Jordan Peele, the director of movies such as Get Out and Nope, are making a new cloud-based project for Xbox Game Studios called OD Announced tonight during The Game Awards, the project also stars Sophia Lillis (It) and Hunter Schafer (Euphoria).
In typical Kojima fashion, the trailer doesn't illuminate much. We see several characters reading (and sometimes failing to do so) a tongue twister before Lillis' character screams in horror at what they see behind a door. 
Talking onstage, Kojima was joined by Peele to mostly compliment each other's work. However, Kojima stressed OD is, in fact, a game. But it's also a movie. And apparently something unlike much else. Or so he says. Peele said it was "crazy." I lost the plot after a while.
Anyways, check it out for yourself:




OD isn't the only project Kojima is working on. His studio, Kojima Productions, is also developing a sequel to Death Stranding.]]></summary>

The trailer sees Goku and Vegeta doing the one thing they know how to do: fight each other. The battle escalates to the pair powering up to Super Saiyan Blue, but we also get looks at Freiza and Broly (the new version of him). The game is the next entry in the long dormant Budokai Tenkaichi series and was announced back in March without an official title. 


Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero doesn't have a release date but is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Ninja revealed Rise of the Ronin, its PlayStation 5-exclusive action game, during a State of Play last year. The game made an appearance at The Game Awards 2023 to showcase more of its fast-paced action alongside the news that it will hit PS5 on March 22, 2024. 
In the trailer, we see a Ronin take the steps to save a late-Edo period japan from chaos, dark magic, and more. While the trailer focuses on the game's combat, with trademark Souls-like Team Ninja action at play, it also highlights some of its traversal. Players will get to explore Japan on foot, on horse, and by way of glider.
Check it out for yourself below in the new Rise of the Ronin trailer: 
"Japan at the end of the 19th century was characterized by the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate, a period of oppression and stagnation," the trailer's description reads. "Explore the vast world of late-Edo period Japan by horse and glider, while battling foes using a wide range of weapons and equipment – melee weapons like swords and spears, as well as ranged weapons like firearms and thrown weapons." 
Rise of the Ronin hits PS5 exclusively on March 22, 2024.

In Big Walk, you and your friends will explore an open world full of puzzles and things to discover. According to the Steam page, you'll need to figure out new ways to communicate when you suddenly find yourself speechless. This explains why, in the trailer, we see lots of attempts at communication, from waving arms to holding up certain images.
The aforementioned Steam listing also says "Sit and watch the sunset, or steal your friend’s binoculars and kick them into the ocean." It seems that much like Goose Game, there will be plenty of time for shenanigans. You'll be able to check it out in 2025.]]></summary>

In the trailer, we get confirmation that it's still expected to hit Xbox Series X/S in 2024 alongside a new look at its extremely visceral combat. 
Like previous Hellblade II trailers, we see Senua trudging through some dangerous wilderness. She's not fighting giant monsters this time, though, as instead, she's up against more human-sized enemies. And this trailer gives us the most in-depth look at Hellblade II's combat yet – unsurprisingly, it looks great (and gruesomely realistic). 
Check it out for yourself in the Senua's Saga: Hellblade II gameplay trailer below: 


"The sequel to the award winning Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice sees Senua return in a brutal journey of survival through the myth and torment of Viking Iceland," the trailer's description reads. "Intent on saving those who have fallen victim to the horrors of tyranny, Senua faces a battle of overcoming darkness within and without."
Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S sometime next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced tonight during The Game Awards, Exodus is an upcoming sci-fi game about time dilation. Most notably, it features actor Matthew McConaughey, famous for his roles in True Detective and Dazed & Confused. And while he announced the game on-stage at the show, interestingly, the trailer didn't even feature McConaughey.
Judging by quick looks in the reveal, Exodus is a third-person action adventure. Its main narrative conceit revolves around an alien discovery and a couple experiencing time at different intervals. As the trailer's narrator says, "It was only days for me, but an entire lifetime passed for her."
Check out the reveal trailer below:


Exodus is the first project from Archetype Entertainment.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finji, a studio known for its work on Indie hits like Tunic and Chicory, announced its latest project at The Game Awards today. It's called Usual June, and it tells the story of a girl struggling to balance her summer break with saving the universe. You can watch the reveal trailer below.


Even after watching the trailer, you might not have much of an idea of what the game is about; it's pretty scarce when it comes to concrete information. We see the protagonist (fittingly named June) as she hacks and slashes her way through spectral creatures in a mysterious world. Luckily, the Steam listing for the game provides some context to her actions. Here's a bit of what the developer has to say about the game:
 It sounds like it'll be telling a typical coming-of-age story mashed up with supernatural heroics. In between story beats, players will also be able to experience some "frantic, flexible combat." We'll be able to get a taste of that ourselves when the game drops some time in 2025.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, the team behind the Persona series, Atlus, revealed its next RPG, Metaphor: ReFantazio. Like the Persona franchise, Metaphor: ReFantazio features all the style and substance you'd expect, with excellent UI and font styling. A new trailer released during The Game Awards 2023 reveals it's coming in the fall of next year. 
Studio Zero is handling the development of the title, with Atlus publishing it, and it's clear the team is taking inspiration from Atlus' Persona series, especially its latest, Persona 5. However, despite the visual similarities, Metaphor: ReFantazio is a brand new game set in its own fantasy universe. 
Check out the latest Metaphor: ReFantazio trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, there's plenty to be excited about in this new Atlus IP. Between the fast-paced and stylish turn-based combat, excellent voice acting, and great music from composer Shoji Meguro (whose credits include Persona 3, Persona 4, and Persona 5), Metaphor: ReFantazio is easily one of the most anticipated titles for 2024.
For more about the game, watch the Metaphor: ReFantazio reveal trailer. Read Game Informer's Persona 5 Royal review, and then read Game Informer's Persona 5 Tactica review after that.

Today he announced Pony Island 2: Panda Circus, a new genre-shifting curio described as "a phantasmagorical voyage through time, myth, divinity, and video games." I like that this description is likely wholly earnest and accurate. This news came during the pre-show for Geoff Keighley's Shopping Hour and if a game like this is relegated to the pre-show, I can only assume the main event will include Half-Life 3, Elden Ring 2, and Deus Ex 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motion Twin, the team behind Dead Cells, has revealed its next game and it's an isometric action game called Windblown. Revealed during The Game Awards 2023, Windblown's most striking feature, other than being the next game from the team behind Dead Cells, is its animated art style. 
The game itself drops the 2.5 nature of Dead Cells for a more top-down, isometric approach with 3D action, and it looks great. It's due out on PC early access sometime in 2024. Other platforms were not mentioned. 
Check out the Windblown reveal trailer for yourself below: 


In Windblown, players control a Leaper on a mission to defend the Ark from a "very aggro Vortex." You can absorb memories of fallen warriors, according to Motion Twin, and then put them to good use by infusing their skills into your weapons. Plus, you can take part in all of Windblown's action with up to two friends.

Here's what we saw: a 3D adventure game that turns into a classic-looking 2D point-and-click adventure game. Voice actor and popular internet guy SungWon "ProZD" Cho is in the game during live-action segments. And a whole host of genre-hopping gameplay. It's a lot. 
Check it out for yourself below:


Pony Island 2: Panda Circus is probably going to be released in 2025 or 2026, but the trailer doesn't make it clear. Mullins is coming off the critically beloved and aforementioned Inscryption – one of our favorite games of 2021.]]></summary>

Italy-based developer Avantgarden, the team behind 2017's Last Day Of June and formerly named Ovosonico, is handling the remake and building it in Unreal Engine 5. Original publisher 505 Games is publishing the remake, which hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 28, as well. 
505 Games says original Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons director, Josef Fares, who later founded Hazelight Studios, which won Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2021 for It Takes Two, has endorsed the remake. 
Check out the Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons Remake for yourself in the reveal trailer below: 


"Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons Remake faithfully re-tells the remarkable heart-rending journey of brothers Naia and Naiee as they embark on a quest to save the life of their dying father," a press release reads. "Built on the Unreal Engine 5, every step of the brothers' journey has been painstakingly rebuilt from the ground up for the most immersive story possible, whilst remaining faithful to the original game. 
"As an additional bonus, the classic single-player experience is now also joined by local co-op, allowing friends to each control a brother's actions." 
Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons won a BAFTA for Game Innovation, the Downloadable Game of the Year from the D.I.C.E and Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences awards, and Best Xbox Game as the VGAs after its release. 
Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons Remake hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam, the Epic Game Store, and GOG, on February 28, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launched in May, it immediately became a cultural phenomenon. In addition to spawning countless viral social media posts about the creations of players, it also quickly became the fastest-selling Legend of Zelda title, as well one of the frontrunners for 2023's Game of the Year award. At the time of its launch, producer Eiji Aonuma and director Hidemaro Fujibayashi didn't know what the community reaction would eventually become.
However, now more than a half year removed from the launch of Tears of the Kingdom, I once again caught up with Aonuma and Fujibayashi to break down some of the more discussed moments of Tears of the Kingdom and speak about the evolution of the series. You can read the full interview below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been over two years since it was announced that the 2018 medieval RPG Kingdom Come: Deliverance would be launching on Switch. That silence has finally been broken with the news that the Nintendo port is arriving sometime next year.
The Switch version comes in the form of Kingdom Come: Deliverance - Royal Edition. The port is being handled by Saber Interactive (Warhorse Studios is the original developer) and bundles the base game with all released DLC. It will be available both digitally and physically. There's no new trailer showcasing how the game runs on Switch, but Saber did release a few screenshots of the port. 

Kingdom Come: Deliverance first arrived in February 2018 and stars Henry, the son of a blacksmith who embarks on a quest to fight against invaders to avenge the death of his parents and the destruction of his village. The game is best known for its demanding, realistic gameplay, which has earned it a cult following of dedicated fans while polarizing others.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the release of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in 2022 – read Game Informer's review here – developer Game Freak revealed that the ninth generation of Pokémon would be getting two DLC expansions, just like Pokémon Sword and Shield did. The first installment was called The Teal Mask and it hit Switch on September 13. The second expansion, The Indigo Disk, hits Pokémon Scarlet and Violet next week, on December 14, and to celebrate its arrival, Game Freak and Nintendo released a four-minute trailer today showcasing some of the DLC's highlights. 
In it, we see plenty of starter Pokémon – every starter is returning in The Indigo Disk – and various legendaries, too, like the Johto dogs, the Hoenn legendaries, and much more. We also get a taste of Blueberry Academy, its special Blueberry Quests, unique Pokémon-centric minigames, and a dose of tough double battles against various trainers at the school. 
Check out the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet Indigo Disk DLC trailer for yourself below: 


Elsewhere in the trailer, we also learn of some special upcoming events players can participate in. Until December 21, players can challenge Dialga and Palkia in Tera Raid Battles, and they can collect Darkrai via Mystery Gift, too. Players also have until January 3 to obtain a Master Ball and shiny Lucario via Mystery Gift, and they can take part in three Mass Outbreak events until December 21. 
For more about the games, read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review and then check out our Teal Mask impressions here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in September, Nintendo revealed that the Kingdom Hearts "Sora" Amiibo for the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate line was coming sometime next year. Now, Nintendo has revealed exactly when: February 16, 2024. 
Nintendo revealed the release date late last night, on December 6, with a short video on Twitter showcasing the Amiibo. As expected, it adopts the look of Sora in the first Kingdom Hearts – a fan-favorite – with his trademark smile and keyblade hoisted over the shoulder. 
Check out the Sora Amiibo teaser for yourself below: 
The #SmashBros #amiibo of Sora will be released on 2/16/2024! #KingdomHearts pic.twitter.com/y3zdbaLplz
December 7, 2023
Sora is the last fighter in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate to get an Amiibo, meaning in February, players can finally complete their Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Amiibo lineup. Right before Sora, though, Nintendo will release the Noah and Mio Amiibo from Xenoblade Chronicles 3 on January 19, 2024. Just last month, Nintendo released the Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. 
For more, read Game Informer's Super Smash Bros. Ultimate review and then check out the reveal trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4. Read Game Informer's exclusive interview with Tetsuya Nomura about Kingdom Hearts 4 after that.

This is indeed an extremely Ubisoft game, with all the busywork and go-here-shoot-that roteness that entails, and although it throws some genuinely gorgeous visuals into the bargain, these also come at the cost of steep hardware requirements.
That said, good performance ain’t out of the question, at least not for modern CPUs and graphics cards. It will just take some digging through the graphics menus – digging that I’ve now completed, so join me as my blackened fingers bash out a convenient guide to Frontiers of Pandora’s PC performance and best settings.

In Black Rapture, the Big Bang never happened. I feel 'universe in which the universe never began' is an... unpromising choice for a setting, but I am not an astrophysician, nor very much of a magic-realist, and I know eff-all about jazz.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Moebius built a world that doesn’t exist, but you can understand it. It’s a realist world. A world you can relate you, but it’s not your world,” says Edouard Caplain, art director for Jusant, the meditative tower climbing adventure that is Life Is Strange studio Don’t Nod’s latest game. Moebius was the pseudonym of French artist Jean Giraud, and whose surreal sci-fi and fantasy landscapes, with washes of contrasting colour and impossibly huge structures of soaring rock, have influenced games for years. You can certainly see that influence in Jusant, too: a world you can understand, though it's quite unlike your own. 
RPS slapped on the coveted Bestest Best sticker when reviewing it a few weeks back, calling it “a show don’t tell masterpiece”. A sentiment I can get behind as a long-standing proponent of silent games ever since the Evil Within 2 insisted on puncturing its creepy baroque ambience with consistently stupid dialogue. Jusant comes from a team that know how to write a conversation, though. So why the change of pace this time around?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pour one out for Mimimi Games today, readers. Despite announcing they were shutting up shop following the release of this year's fantastic Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, today marks the grand finale for their stealth strategy masterpiece in the form of a new free Treasure Hunt update, and the release of their two paid expansions. Each brings a brand-new pirate to The Red Marley's undead crew, as well as their own half-dozen story missions to play through spread across islands old and new, and once you've begun each of their respective questlines, they're readily available to play in any of the game's regular plunderings, too. 
Mimimi have kept the identity of these pirates a secret until now, but after playing both DLCs for a big chunk of the last week, I'm confident in saying this is exactly the swansong Shadow Gambit deserves - with one of the expansions in particular bringing a poignant touch of coming full circle on Mimimi's work as a studio. Naturally, spoilers circle these waters like hungry sharks, but if you're resigned to such a fate, let's dive in below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar has released a 90-second GTA 6 trailer! Wowee! No seriously, ignoring my cynicism for a second, it does look really impressive. As I mentioned in our RPS reacts piece, I'm genuinely excited by the prospect of a renewed Vice City and you bet I'll be there for the inevitable five-minute narrated trailer that begins with a person saying, "Welcome to Vice City".
There's no doubt Vice City is going to be dense and chaotic, going by all the twerking and the social media parodies of real life Florida folks. But really, I do hope that Rockstar doesn't just reserve next-gen's horsepower for wildness. I want some peace, some quiet, some innocuous suburbs to laze around in. That would be nice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ultros is one of those games you can't help but pay attention to. Back when it was first revealed in May at Sony's pre-notE3 PlayStation Showcase, its colourful, fever dream visuals from Hotline Miami artist El Huervo instantly made it stand out among all the drab multiplayer shooters jostling for attention. Then, between talk of it being set inside a cosmic uterus known as The Sarcophagus and having to use seeds and plants over successive runs to alter the shape of the map to your whim, it only became more intriguing. Now, after playing almost two hours of this Metroid-y roguelite for myself, there's still a lot about it to take in and digest, but holy moly what a thing to behold at the same time. This is surely going to be one to watch for Metroidvania likers when it comes out on February 13th next year, because cor, this is looking really quite good, folks.

The developers have now shared a bit about how it differs from Hi-Rez's Tribes Ascend, released way back in 2012, which we adored.
Created by a former Hi-Rez subsidiary that includes several of the original Ascend leads, the new shooter retains its celebrated predecessor's emphasis on agility and momentum, but will be a premium game sold for $20 with separately sold cosmetics, rather than a free-to-play affair. It also won't have a singleplayer campaign, much to the probable consternation of Tribes: Vengeance fans, and the indifference of everybody else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the grim darkness of the far future… I will finish my review of Owlcat’s Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader. It turns out that trying to complete an estimated 100-hour RPG during the run-up to The Game Awards is too much for this humble Scriptor. There are still many more tabletop-style planetary maps to discover and plunder, many more character levels to scale, and many more cursed artefacts to tamper with before my protagonist, the closet Chaos worshipper Bruschetta de Plonque, can pronounce herself mistress of the Kronos Expanse - assuming the Inquisition doesn’t claim her first. But after 20 hours of the game, I can absolutely say that I’m looking forward to the next 80. While it doesn’t have the cinematic swagger and raw anecdote-generating capacity of obvious rival Baldur's Gate 3, Rogue Trader has mystique and depth to spare, both in terms of its grotty narrative and its exceedingly busy combat and levelling systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many years, the GOG.com affiliate program has been a great way to support the project. By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.
Earlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.
Unfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.
Since we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.
We still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.
Thank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!

The jungles and the plains might be wonderful to look at, but they're too vast, filled with boring tasks, and overly reliant on level-gating to force a sense of progress. Sure, there's some spectacle in narrow escapes from the nasty humans - and their factories that make the plants droopy - but throughout the rebellion I ditched my bow for a shotgun with extended mags and a muzzle brake. For a game that's all, "the humans are bad", I was ready to defect. At least I would've been able to keep my shotgun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Samsung's Pro Plus Micro SD card is our top memory card recommendation for PC gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck, ROG Ally and Legion Go, and today you can pick up the 512GB version for just $29 at Best Buy. That's a pretty steep reduction from its previous price of $48 and even beats the best Black Friday price we saw this year of $31. 
Note: the photo above shows the 256GB model we tested, but I can confirm this price is for the 512GB size.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Nvidia’s count, there are now 500 games and applications that employ DLSS upscaling and ray tracing visual effects – or "RTX technologies," in GPU superpower speak. While there’s arguably some cheekiness behind that count, as ray tracing in particular is not an RTX-exclusive feature, it is nonetheless quite the feat for a set of tools that launched in subjectively auspicious circumstances back in 2018.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doom scrolling social media looks to have replaced the age-old pasttime of watching TV in GTA 6, which has prompted feelings of alternating despair and increasing irrelevance in me this morning. I barely understand how TikTok works in real-life, let alone a video game pastiche of it, and oh god, how did I get so old and craggy? I'm just here for the nice-looking flamingos, Rockstar, not a 24/7 twerk stream I can access from the palm of my hand. Of course, TV watching may yet have been preserved beyond what we've seen so far in the first trailer for GTA 6, but even if it's been consigned to the bin of modern history, there might yet be one light in the TikTok-esque darkness to make GTA 6's in-game social media network worthwhile. 
Upon closer inspection of the account names seen in the trailer, it's "PlanetLeonidaMan" that gives me hope, because if this isn't a riff on the Florida Man meme, I'll take a dump on a dead possum during rush hour traffic, hurl Oreos at Matthew as we argue over our empty coffee maker (teapot, come on), and try to cross the Atlantic in a hamster wheel vessel to demand some answers.

Born of Bread isn't actually a baking sim. Even better than that: it's some kind of spin on vintage Ninty RPG Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, except that instead of being made of paper, the main character Loaf is made of living dough... but kind of looks like he's made of paper, this being a 2.5D game with flat character art. Look, just watch the trailer while I make myself a sandwich.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back, I had a feeling we'd see a lot of games about nature and plants and the wild coming out over the next few years, as developers and players alike emerged from being shut inside for basically a year like dairy cows during their annual spring turnout. We may not all be not be naturally disposed to it, but there's much to be said for the fleeting, if unbridled happiness that comes from running barefoot into the teeth of the wind or getting caught in a rainstorm without a coat.
Nine times out of ten, you might get wet and have cold fingers, but that one time that you get wet, have cold fingers and feel red-raw and alive is a doozy. A Highland Song, a lone and dangerous jaunt through the Scottish highlands, is trying to capture that feeling, most especially in segments where you sprint across rocks and heather alongside a deer. At these times you leap in time to swelling music, and whoop and yell in spontaneous joy. It's lovely. It's also easy to stumble.
