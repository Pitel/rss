        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jujutsu Odyssey could become the next major Roblox hit from the sphere of anime-based games, and the game already has an official Trello board, along with an active Discord community.


The new launch went live earlier on February 2, 2025, and it draws a massive amount of inspiration from Jujutsu Kaisen. While the Trello board will serve as your go-to guide for information, the Discord server will help you bond with fellow players.


How to join Jujutsu Odyssey's official Discord


Joining the official Discord server is pretty easy, and all you need is a Discord account. Once you've created your account (or signed into your existing one), just click on this link. You'll be able to access all the channels that are present on the server.


The Discord community will be your go-to hub for everything related to Jujutsu Odyssey. This includes participating in general chats with fellow players and being on top of the updates. There's already a dedicated channel for updates, and expect to find a lot of new information in the days to come.




How to follow the official Jujutsu Odyssey Trello


The Trello board's purpose is to provide you with any and all information related to Jujutsu Odyssey. You can visit the Trello board by clicking on this link. There are different cards present on the board to provide you with all the information you might need.


Unlike the Discord server, you can't send any text or add any information on the Trello board. It has a view-only status for all users, but you won't need a Trello account to check out the information. New cards are expected to be added here in the coming weeks once we get new content in the form of future updates.

        <updated>2025-02-02T14:16:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest update of Anime Adventures has introduced the Assassins Contracts Event inside the game, and you can earn different rewards from your grind.


The event has its exclusive token currency, which will help you unlock all the available rewards. The highlights are the new units that are exclusively part of the Assassins Contracts Event. To unlock them, you'll have to earn as many event tokens as possible.


Best ways to farm Assassins Contracts Event tokens in Anime Adventures


The Assassins Contracts Event can be accessed from the main screen of Anime Adventures. You'll find the event icon on the right side of your screen. Once you click on it, you'll find different contracts that are open. These are objectives that you'll have to complete to get the rewards.


You can also create your own game, which can be played with a stranger or exclusively with your friends. Ideally, it will be better to complete the harder contracts as they will offer you better rewards. However, make sure to take on objectives that are feasible for you to complete.




Best ways to use Assassins Tokens in Anime Adventures


To earn Assassins Tokens, you'll have to complete the objectives. These tokens are best used on the event-exclusive banner, which has its own set of limited-time units. Additionally, we might get new items in the shop in the future that will be purchasable using these tokens. Either way, I genuinely feel that using the currency to summon new units will be the best use.


The shining lights of the event banner are the three featured Mythic units: Somber, Killstreak, and Legendary Assassin. If you manage to get lucky and pull a Mythic, there's a 33% chance for one of the three to spawn. There's the usual pity rate as well for those who won't get the rub of good luck.

While it’s endlessly enjoyable to run around with familiar characters, it only gets better when you drag a friend along with you. 


Playing with friends in Island Adventure comes with a long list of benefits, as well as some rewards that are only available through multiplayer. This isn’t anything new for anyone who has played on Apple Arcade prior to the Steam and Nintendo Switch release on January 30, but if you’re new on any platform, here’s how multiplayer works and everything you can get for simply playing with a friend.

If you ever thought monasteries were just devoted to worship, feasting abbots, and choral chants of Ave Maria, The Stone of Madness is set on proving you dead wrong.
This is The Game Kitchen’s first foray into the stealth-tactics genre (a distinctly Spanish obsession we discussed with the devs last year) after the team's stellar work with the Blasphemous Metroidvanias. Two separate campaigns take place in an imposing 1800s Pyrenees monastery, which doubles as an insane asylum. This mountaintop prison offers no redemption, nor escape from earthly woes, for five luckless inmates aiming to escape, or destroy, their captors.

Two covers from the NSO newbie Super Ninja Boy went head-to-head in last week's match-up, and despite us thinking they were both pretty rad, it wasn't a close call. Japan's cover walked away with a comfortable win, taking 67% of the vote and leaving the North American variant with the remaining 33%.

The new location has been added as part of Update 1.6, which went live earlier on February 1. Players will be able to visit this POI and try their luck to find all the new items. To do so, they will have to discover it first, and it's a pretty easy thing to do.


Valentine's Island location in Dig It


The Valentine's Island location is pretty easy to reach from the spawn position. Of course, the name of the island won't be available in the database until you visit it for the first time. Just head straight with a boat, and you'll find the new POI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are plenty of creatures you can catch in Fisch, but landing the secret fish is the hardest task to complete.


So far, there are six secret fish that can be caught inside the game, but they can prove to be stern tests. These six creatures are the hardest ones to catch, and they're not even part of the official bestiary. Let's take a look at how you can obtain them inside the game. Originally, there used to be three of them, but the recent Atlantic and Orcas update have doubled the numbers. 


How to catch all six secret fish in Fisch


As of the latest Oil Rig/Orcas update, there are six fishes to catch.


Fish
Type
Location
Preferred Bait
Season
Weather




Banana Fish
Secret
Ancient Isle
None
Summer
Rain


Long Pike
Secret
Ocean Territory
Insects
Autumn, Spring
Rain


Mustard Fish
Secret
Ocean Territory
Sea Weed
Summer
Rain


Resin
Secret
Mushgrove Swamp
None
None
None


Ancient Kraken
Secret
Atlantis (Kraken's Pool)
Truffle Worm
None
Night


Ancient Orca
Secret
Ocean (Arch)
Shark Head
None
None






The greatest difficulty of getting the secret fish is their spawn rate. They're not part of the official bestiary, which means that you're not supposed to find them inside the game. The Banana Fish, for example, is only meant for admins and partnered content creators. Yet, you might get lucky and land one with the correct setup.


Thankfully, you don't really need the very best rods to land them. You should fully focus on Season, Weather, and Bait, along with the locations. The odds of landing these fish are low, to begin with. Without the preferred setup, it will be next to impossible to catch these creatures, irrespective of your rod and player levels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Hugo Ekitike Future Stars SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete the challenge to unlock a special card in Ultimate Team. 


This is the first time that Ekitike has received a promo item with double playstyle+. To play with the card, you'll have to complete the challenge before the SBC expires from Ultimate Team. Let's take a look at how you can finish the SBC with the cheapest possible prices. 


EA FC 25 Hugo Ekitike Future Stars SBC tasks


The Hugo Ekitike Future Stars SBC has only three tasks, and here are the conditions. 


Task 1 - Top Form 



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 85



Task 2 - France



Min. 1 Players from: France


Min. Team Rating: 86



Task 3 - Bundesliga



Min. 1 Players from: Bundesliga


Min. Team Rating: 87



EA FC 25 Hugo Ekitike Future Stars SBC solutions


Here's a set of solution you can use to complete the latest Future Stars promo SBC. 


Task 1 - Top Form 



Any 10 85-rated items


Any 83-rated TOTW item



Task 2 - France



England 82


Tapsoba 83


Shaw 86


Diaby 83


Alexander-Arnold 86


Pajor 87


Mac Allister 86


Kimmich 86


Bruno Fernandes 87


Grimaldo 86


Xhaka 86



Task 3 - Bundesliga



Bruno 85


Pajor 87


Daly 85


Rice 87


Lavelle 87


Palhinha 85


de Jong 87


Popp 87


Bernardo Silva 88


Bruno Fernandes 87


Gundogan 87



With an overall rating of 89, Ekitike could have been rated higher. The SBC costs almost 200,000 coins, but that's likely due to the inflated market. The card has some really strong aspects. It has two playstyle+, which includes Rapid (one of the best choices in the current meta). He has three role++ as a striker, and has great playstyles. 


With 96 Pace and 90 Dribbling, he will be extremely up top, but you'll need to boost his finishing stats. If you have the fodder to spare and a Bundesliga-based squad, this Ekitike item could be a really underrated option to consider.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Secret Ancient Orca is one of the most elusive catches you can currently complete in Fisch, and it's part of the latest mini-update.


The latest weekend has added an Oil Rig POI in Fisch, along with an Orca Migration Hunt Event. This event will allow you to capture the Ancient Orca, but there are certain strategies you'll have to keep in mind.


Secret Ancient Orca location in Fisch


The Ancient Orca is one of the three available Orca types you can catch in Fisch. It can only be caught during the Orca Migration Hunt Event, and you'll have to travel to the Arch. This location is situated at the following coordinates (XYZ: 1100, 133, -1200).


The Orca Migration Hunt Event is a server event, and it will take place randomly. Additionally, not every hunt will have the Ancient Orca spawning in them. Try to look for "Ancient Orcas Migration (100% Guarantee)" on your screen. Once you find that marker, you'll have to fish in the areas surrounding the Orcas.




Best setup for Ancient Orca in Fisch


The Ancient Orca doesn't have stiff requirements, and they can spawn at any time of the day and in any season/weather. You can pick from a wide set of rods but always go with the one with a good luck boost. The best bait to use is Shark Head Bait, and this applies to every type of Orca.


Once you have got your setup on point, pray to get luck with the server event. Additionally, make sure that you're not fishing too far away from where the Orcas are. With some luck, you should be able to grab yourself a Secret Ancient Orca pretty soon.


The mini-update has also added the Oil Rig POI to the game, but it looks like part of bigger update in the future. You'll be able to meet a host of different NPCs at this location, including Dr. Glimmerfin, who might provide us with a new quest in the near future.

The finals are currently taking place in London as of writing, and you can follow on YouTube and Twitch. Aside from enjoying the finals, you can also get hints about the mystery nation. The task is pretty simple, as you have to use a player from the correct nation to complete the objective. The nation is going to be revealed gradually over the stream, and it's currently hidden.


EA FC 25 Pro Open Finals Mystery Nation solution


If you have completed previous Pro Open Finals Mystery Nation objectives, you'll know what to do. The latest objective went live at 4 p.m. UK time, and here's the task. 



Score three goals using a Finesse Shot with a player from the mystery nation in any UT game mode. The name of the nation will be hinted at during the broadcast of FC Pro Open Finals.




To complete the task, just use a card from the mystery nation and score three goals with finesse shots. You can score the three goals in a single match or across several matches. The objective can also be completed in any available Ultimate Team game mode, including friendlies.


Once you complete the task, you'll get a coin boost, along with a free Premium Electrum Players Pack. So far, EA Sports has taken us on a world tour, and we have had representatives from all continents. So far, the mystery nation is yet to be discovered.


For the finals, our mystery nation is England, and you can use any footballer from the nation to complete the objective.

Afterlove EP, a 'mix-tape visual novel' from the studio behind Coffee Talk, was announced back in 2021, but just one year after its reveal, the team went through something no developer should have to deal with: the sudden and unexpected death of studio founder Mohammad Fahmi.
Fahmi had assembled the team at Indonesian indie studio Pikselnesia with the sole intention of making Afterlove EP and so, after his passing, the team decided to complete development on the game and bring its creator's vision to life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Kitty Island Adventure is filled with beloved Sanrio characters with whom to befriend and interact. Each character has their own quests that need to be completed, allowing you to earn some useful rewards that aid in progression and exploration. 


Hangyodon is likely to be one of the last characters you rediscover after the unfortunate ending to your plane journey. He’s located underwater inside his Comedy Club, and his level 6 friendship quest, called “Comic Relief,” is particularly useful. 


However, to complete this quest, you’ll need to locate the three pieces of a Mermaid Outfit, and in a huge expanse of water, it’s all too easy to overlook the pieces as you swim by.

This new epic tale, which began in 2023 with the release of Fourth Wing, has been a sensation within the BookTok community and beyond, but as they're keen to let everyone know, the romantasy genre has much more to offer than just the story of Violet Sorrengail and Xaden Riorson.


One could argue that some other well-known names in this burgeoning literary tradition do an even better job of setting up a fictional world and the fantastical courtships within it. If you couldn't put Onyx Storm down until those last suspenseful pages, or if you found that the threequel ultimately disappointed you in key regards, then perhaps other names on this list, consisting of the …]]></summary>

1. The Silmarillion (J. R. R. Tolkien)

If you love Tolkien’s world and want to discover more about its origins, then the epic myths and histories of The Silmarillion will definitely draw you in. Unlike The Lord of the Rings, which tells its story from the direct point of view of its characters, The Silmarillion takes place over the course of several thousand years. The tale begins with the creation of Arda, of which Middle-Earth is just a small part. It also details the rise o…]]></summary>

While the series is technically all about chasing dreams and finding treasures, almost everyone has a pretty damn tragic backstory. However, the tearjerkers in the franchise aren't necessarily limited to flashbacks.


During their grand quest to find the titular treasure, Luffy and Co. went through a lot of grief, both individually and as a group. Plenty of these non-flashback experiences are, without a doubt, some of the saddest moments in One Piece. Here are ten moments that will likely make you look out for the onion-chopping ninjas.

With non-con, abuse, and spicy romps aplenty, fans of the genre are always thirsty for more. 


I have to admit that Haunting Adeline and its ilk are not my favorite sub-genre of romance. I prefer something more pure, and while angst is great, I believe there is such a thing as too much. However, I’ve read enough dark, twisted romances in my time to know which books will appeal to readers of Haunting Adeline. 


I mean, if a book comes with trigger warnings included before the story even begins, then you know you’re in for an interesting ride, right? The dark romance sub-genre definitely isn't for everyone, but…]]></summary>

Harry’s departure from Hogwarts at the end of the Half-Blood Prince was a major turning point for the series, and to match this change, EA flipped the formula for its Harry Potter video games completely upside down.

Sure, there are a few bumps here and there; some stuff could use a little polish, and things can slow down at times, but nothing that’s really snuffed out the fun. It’s a unique game with a ton of potential, and with a few tweaks, I think it could be really something special, something that stands outs out in a genre full of repetition.


The Narrative Soup: Hit or Miss

The narrative started with a bang and had me hooked, and then it kind of just... fizzled out over time. The initial world-building was intriguing, and there were some solid mysteries at play.

In a market inundated with Metroidvanias, Laika: Aged Through Blood does something remarkable: it actually tries something new. That’s not to say that recent examples haven’t had a good crack at standing out amongst the crowd — Animal Well is certainly testament to that — but many largely stick to the same rulebook. Laika tears it apart and chucks it into the fires of Mount Doom.
So what makes this one so different? Well, it’s all about the traversal: Laika expertly blends motocross gameplay with more traditional Metroidvania mechanics, doing away with segmented rooms and corridors in favour of sprawling, interconnected landscapes. You’re specifically encouraged to travel at high speeds, launch yourself into the air, and pull off badass flips that will have Trials fans giddy.

Similar to Fisch, your Shovel is the single most important item inside the game. You can improve your Shovel with the help of enchantments, but you can also switch to better ones. Naturally, not every Shovel is equal, and you'll specifically want to look out for the better ones. 


Let's look at how the shovels shape up in terms of their in-game effectiveness and stats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warframe stat lovers, rejoice; the Year in Review just dropped. Similar to things like Spotify Wrapped, Apple Music Replay, and other fun stat pages, the Warframe one is now here.


If you want to know what it is and how you can check yours, see below.


What is the Year in Review?


The Warframe Year in Review is similar to the aforementioned app rewinds. It’ll break down things like your total playtime, your most active month, how many missions you completed, and much more.


It’ll be a long, shareable page that will show graphics as well for all the other following:



Most played Warframe


Other top-played frames


Most used ability


Favorite weapons (Primary, Secondary, Melee)


Focus earned


Favorite Companion


Hours as Drifter or Operator


Total Kills


Total Adversaries vanquished or conquered (Kuva Liches, Sisters of Parvos)


Eidolons killed


Boss kills


Total headshots


Items crafted


Warframes crafted


Forma invested (applied onto weapons, Frames, companions)



At the very bottom of the page, just like other year-end wrapups, you will get a nicely constructed graphic of all these so that you can download them as images and share them on your social media.

How to check your Warframe Year in Review


To check your Year in Review for Warframe, head over to the official Warframe Year in Review website. You will need to log in, and then all your stats will be on display for you to check out. 


Enjoy checking out all the ways you took out Corpus, Grineer, and Infested enemies, and see which of the Gemini Protoframes managed to take over your stats at the end of the year.

To obtain the Brick Rod, you'll need to find and interact with three hidden bricks spread all across Fisch. To help your cause, make sure to own the GPS Device (which can be obtained at Moosewood).

February usually means a couple of things for us Nintendo fans: a disappointing Pokémon Presents showcase, and the first Nintendo Direct of the year (also, a Kirby game is normally right around the corner, but that's not all that important to this discussion).
Pokémon is a no-brainer, obviously, but in the year of our lord 2025, there's every chance that a Direct won't be plonked in our laps in the coming weeks. Why? The Nintendo Switch 2.

Kindly Uncle EA has taken a break from his busy layoff schedule to rustle up a pair of Legacy collections that include a bunch of old expansions. It's the very first time the original Sims has graced a digital retail platform, I believe - it was first released in 2000, back when people used to access the internet using smoke signals and semaphore. Anyway, here's the reveal trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia DLSS 4 has launched under not-terribly-happy circumstances. It’s a mostly AI-powered technology at a time when mistrust in artificial intelligence, fuelled by underbaked applications and anti-creative policies, is at all-time high – not to mention how the new GeForce GPUs it’s released alongside, the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090, have immediately entered 2020-style stock shortage purgatory.
However, having tried it out in a few different games, I suspect time will prove kinder to DLSS 4 than the RTX 50 series launch has been. It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.
Here, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.

Square Enix has announced that Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age - Definitive Edition will be temporarily unavailable on the Switch eShop starting 1st February 2025.
Worry not, though, because it doesn't sound like it'll be gone for very long. In a social media post from the official Dragon Quest account, its reasoning behind the temporary removal is quite simply so it can "make some minor updates to the store listing".

When the Switch launched, its new Joy-Con controllers were dreamy little wonders stuffed with neat tech and surprises.
Unfortunately, the biggest surprise was an unwelcome one - with time, the sticks were prone to drifting on their own accord, and the widespread problem caused many a Switch gamer's opinion to sour. The pads' small size also created problems for anyone with larger hands, with some of us forking out for a Pro Controller or switching to a grip or third-party alternative for handheld play.

That was interesting for showing the benefits of Zen 5's full 512-bit data path support compared to the "double pumped" approach with Zen 4 or optionally used via a BIOS option on Zen 5. AVX-512 continues to prove to be very performant and power efficient with AMD Zen 5 processors unlike with the early generations of AVX-512 on Intel processors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pay it starward.
A few years ago, a little tabletop-RPG-inspired visual novel called Citizen Sleeper arrived on the eShop, expertly crafting an experience that tied together dice-rolling mechanics with a player-driven science fiction narrative. It quickly gained a cult following, leading to a short series of free DLC chapters and the announcement of a sequel. Now that Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is finally here, we’re pleased to report that one-person team Gareth Damian Martin of Jump Over The Age hasn’t lost a step—this new release is everything that the first game was and then some.
Citizen Sleeper 2 cold opens with your conveniently amnesiac character waking up in the clutches of a gangster boss named Laine giving you an angry speech about his claim of ownership over your synthetic body. Before he can literally pull the plug on you and bring about a very swift Game Over, a mysterious ally spirits you away in a small, stolen starship. Your saviour claims to know you and, knowing that Laine will be painting a target on both your backs, you make for a nearby station to hopefully find the resources needed to disappear and earn your freedom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Musi's initial attempt to force Apple to reinstate its music app to the App Store has failed. A California federal court denied a request for a preliminary injunction, ruling that Apple did not act unreasonably or in bad faith when it removed the app following complaints from music industry players and YouTube. The court found that Musi’s proposed injunction would not serve the public interest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The creator of frying pan simulator Arctic Eggs is working on a fishing game that I am certain will replicate the act of angling in an entirely ordinary and accurate fashion. Its approach to hooks, lines, and sinkers will combine the fishing from Animal Crossing, Sega Bass Fishing, and Webfishing, says developer The Water Museum in a post on Bluesky. It may have a splash of Dredge when it comes to inventory management too. Oh, also, a strange man might imply you are "disappointing someone". Nothing to worry about. And the ocean may or may not turn completely red. These decisions have not been finalised. Everything is okay. It is possible the fish are safe to eat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hidden away on NASA's Golden Record, an interstellar archive of music, image and sound, there is a recording of a poem by Charles Baudelaire, Élévation, which describes the astral ascent of the soul. Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out "the vast sorrows and all the vexations" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.

Yes, I'm well aware that "2.5D" and "Soulsvania" are nonsense words, woven by pestilent market forces. Samuel Johnson is turning in his grave, I expect. He has risen from his grave and equipped himself with an ironbound dictionary and is even now making his way through the layers of the English language, hellbent on slaughtering every 'vania yet coined.
But never mind Samuel. Oversized rodents and spiders aside, Mandragora is notable for being written by Brian Mitsoda, writer of the original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines and the former narrative lead for its sequel at Hardsuit Labs, which lives on in the hands of The Chinese Room. Primal have just announced a release date - 17th April. Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't get too comfortable. As an RPG that puts you in the synthetic boots of an escaped robo-person, Citizen Sleeper 2 often has you on the run. It's a crunchy, dicey machine of vibrant world-building that sometimes forgets itself in wandering prose. A compelling universe to sail through, with more habitats and hovels than its predecessor, more stations and stellar gateways. It can't - for me - escape the dense gravity of the first game's compact storytelling and novel character building, no matter how often it funnels you from one space caper to the next. But it has a good time trying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bioware released a statement yesterday. It talked of "turning towards the future". It dreamed of "a more agile, focused studio". Nowhere in the post did the word "layoffs" appear. But this is what the post was actually about. The closest it got to addressing the facts of what happened to an unspecified number of workers is the phrase: "we don’t require support from the full studio." 
It's one of the most disingenuous announcements of job cuts in a recent and plentiful history of job cuts. A weirdly impressive feat from BioWare, considering the last two or three years have seen some spectacular verbal gymnastics from games companies when it comes to shitcanning people. Let's take a look at some of our "favourite" mealy-mouthed press releases in which people have their jobs poetically "sunsetted" rather than, say, dropkicked out the window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The layoff train has come for BioWare. A number of Dragon Age: The Veilguard staff are leaving the celebrated RPG company in the course of plans to become "a more agile, focused studio", as BioWare move ahead with the next Mass Effect game. Posting on Bluesky, senior systems designer Michelle Flamm, producer Jen Cheverie, editor Karin West-Weekes, lead writer Trick Weekes and narrative designer Ryan Cormier have all announced that they're looking for work.


All of which feels like it warrants a mention in general manager Gary McKay's recent blog about BioWare's future, but he comments only that they're "taking the opportunity to reimagine" how BioWare operate between projects, and "have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit." Which is a very slippery way to say that you're making a load of people redundant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mere hours before it’s January 30th release – wait, that’s today! – Sony have finally spilled the beans on system requirements for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, as well as the eye-blistering, GPU-rending special features that more powerful rigs can support. Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.
Granted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looks like they finally got the message. "An account for PlayStation Network will become optional for these titles on PC," said PlayStation in a short and quiet blog post that includes the upcoming PC release for Spider-Man 2, and The Last Of Us Part II. It's been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play Helldivers 2, and later Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after a rough review-bombing but the company didn't seem to fully take the hint. It looks like they've now conceded that, yes, the obligatory sign-up was an unpopular move.

That said, this is the precise extent of the things you can do in the game so far. Build 'n' crash. Every feature fits in this opening paragraph. There's good reason to trust the developers' ability to deliver the rest of this crafting and survival game. But right now, it's all core, no loop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Open world spec op gun-brandisher Phantom Line takes place during a paranormal crisis of such intensity that the outbreak of nuclear war gets relegated to bullet point five on the latest press email. Atomic apocalypse? Ehhh. That's a roadside picnic compared to what S.T.A.L.K.S this alternately Lynchian and Tarkovskian battlefield. You'll wish you'd been dusted by nuclear fire when you're being torn open by some kind of demon puppet in a labyrinth of red curtains.


If you do get torn open by a demon puppet, the good news is that players have a range of artificial bodies to choose from. Among Phantom Line's headline features is the HUSK system, which lets you switch between members of your squad right in the middle of combat. Unless, presumably, the body in question is already occupied by one of your co-op partners. If all this sounds appealing, the even-gooder news is that there's now a demo available via the developer Discord.

Or can you? News comes via Nic himself that modder FrancisLouis, whose previous works include performance-enhancing rejigs of various games (and one that turns the Silent Hill 2 remake’s pipe weapon into a rigid, A-posing wife), has produced Fantasy Optimizer: an overhaul of how FF7 Rebirth handles shaders and streamed visuals. Both Nic and myself have tried it out on our respective rigs, and it works! Mostly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has any genus of graphics card been as dramatically storied as the GeForce XX80s? The RTX 3080 was a thing of beauty, only to be tarnished by the worst wheeler-dealing spree (and crypto mining misappropriation) in PC component history. Then the RTX 4080 rocked up with its laughable £1269 / $1199 price tag, a miscalculation so severe that the RTX 4080 Super looked good – despite hardly being any faster – simply for not repeating it. For the new RTX 5080’s sake, you almost want it to be boring.
It isn’t. But then, neither is it a blood-boiler like the RTX 4080, nor a largely aspirational show-off piece like the RTX 5090. By maintaining the 4080 Super’s course correction on price while tooling up on compelling DLSS 4 improvements, the RTX 5080 is an agreeable GPU from the off. Particularly, if you’ve got the 4K monitor to take full advantage of it.

It is far bigger than it reasonably needs to be, and it's only getting more and more, er, infinite.

Given the scope of the allegations, narrowly focused on a single defendant, the action seems unusually punitive.

Neskôr sa pridali médiá, ktoré sa zamerali hlavne na súperenie Spojených štátov a Číny v oblasti AI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In regular Darkest Dungeon 2, your mind, body and soul are fixed upon the points of a horrible mountain, looming over the inn at the end of every foetid wagon ride. It's sort of Journey for plague doctors, or possibly The Hobbit: Cosmodick Turpin Edition. I enjoy feeling the weight of those distant peaks upon my brain and eyeballs, but it's nice to fire up Kingdoms, the new free DD2 game mode that's launched just today, and have a choice of disasters to trundle toward.  


Over here is an inn being overrun by slathering beastmen. Over there is another, safer inn, but it's inconveniently perched behind a nest of tentacular cultists. In the middle there is you, with the customary DD party of half-dead, half-mad adventurers, equipped with an exciting smorgasbord of sharp edges, cursed artefacts, phobias and diseases. Let us proceed laughing and wailing to the launch trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed publishers Ubisoft are making another round of layoffs as part of wider efforts to persuade their investors to stop yelling at them. They're letting 185 people go across their European operations, and will be closing UK-based Ubisoft Leamington, whose recent projects include supporting development of Star Wars Outlaws and Skull And Bones. All this less than two months after jettisoning the hundreds of people who worked on free-to-play shooter XDefiant.

Space Engineers 2 launches into the starry depths of early access today, although it is currently limited to a single player creative mode. It's the sequel to the sci-fi shipbuilding game we quite enjoyed here at RPS. At this early alpha stage, the not-yet-a-survival-game invites players to create galleons of the galaxy, block by shiny metal block, and then drive those ships into one another at 300 metres per second.

It's a fertilized duck egg, boiled or steamed, in which you can still see the duck embryo as you munch. I'm too old to discover this acquired taste on a gap year, but I'm not too old to waltz down the horror aisle in Itch.io, throwing retro jumpscarers into my basket. Which is where first-person Filipino suspense game Hapunan can be found. You play a young street food vendor hawking the eggs on a quiet corner late at night. Naturally, something alarming is afoot.

First, there was Dynasty Warriors: Origins, which I enjoyed quite a bit. Then Ninja Gaiden 2 Black got a surprise release. Now, we're getting Team Ninja's Rise Of The Ronin this coming March - the 11th to be precise. I'd do a bit about stealth drops but I'm at the point where using game-thematic verbs makes me want to collapse on a bed of caltrops, throat first. Here's a trailer:

It's a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don't know the name of so I'm just going to call a spinny stick.
There are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can't really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I'm not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game. I am devilishly compelled by swing, like a Reefer Madness extra.

I know some of you are old enough to know what a letter opener is, or even to own one. Statistically, most of the RPS readership are Lich Lords. The Maw letter opener differs from regular letter openers in that when you open a letter with it, you will encounter not a letter but a perfect copy of yourself opening a letter in the opposite direction. The two of you must now fight to the death to decide who is the letter-opener and who is the letter. It's yours for a piffling three pints of any available body fluid, but if you don't want to buy a letter opener you can always buy one of this week's new PC games instead.

Instead of winning over $155 million in damages, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a lower court's ruling, awarding a mere $154,400 for the Navy's unauthorized installations of the German company's software.

Jonathan Nash died. That name might not mean anything to you, but Nash was a writer for the much-beloved British games mag Amiga Power in the '90s, and he was influential on the generation of games writers that followed - including several founders of this website. RPS co-founder Kieron Gillen wrote about what made J Nash unique in his newsletter:

When you offer me a five-hour video essay about an obscure adventure game from 1998, I will hide in the closet. But if you idly wonder where the rivers in Skyrim go, I will follow along dutifully like a baby elephant. This is how I ended up spending much of my afternoon watching David Cage characters pissing. One video creator decided to painstakingly count every instance of playable pee time in cinematic adventure game Heavy Rain. This is vital work. This is important work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A performance and settings guide for a ropey PC port of a Final Fantasy game? Sweet, I haven’t done one of these in four whole months. In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.
Yet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.

I don't make the rules, that's just how Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 explains the lack of elders in its very French yet very JRPG world. The fantasy game will see you journey across a dangerous landscape to stop the mad "paintress" who's magically culling humanity at younger and younger ages every year. We've been keeping a weary middle-aged eye on its development, and yesterday it got a release date. It's too late for most of us in the RPS treehouse. But watch the trailer for yourself, maybe you'll make it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good news for anyone eager to meet a big talking catfish. A new trailer for action adventure game South Of Midnight sees players battering monsters from the folklore of the US' Deep South. It shows hero Hazel arguing with her mum before a supernatural hurricane cuts off the family drama and sends Hazel wandering the swamps to encounter giant alligators, giant fish, giant dolls, and giant people. Maybe Hazel is just very small. Either way, it also dangles an important morsel in front of our snapping jaws: a release date. Come see.

Since then, the specialist anti-piracy unit has targeted pirates of all kinds. The Intellectual Property Office's latest Report and Accounts states that PIPCU is funded using millions of pounds from 'IPO surpluses.' That money appears to have been put to work; PIPCU reports reveal successes against large-scale IPTV pirates and in one case, a record-breaking restraint of ill-gotten gains.

It's out right now on Steam and Microsoft's Game Pass service. I'd say it has materialised from the darkness like a ninja, but there are a lot of ninjas in circulation at the minute, and my analogy-jitsu gauge is running dry. So instead, I'm going to say that it has materialised from the darkness like a resurfacing duck, its beak stuffed with pond vegetation. The pond vegetation, here, stands for "tweaks to the weapons upgrade system". Here's a trailer.

I get all excited about sharing details from a preview event for upcoming FPS Doom: The Dark Ages, then it turns out the gameplay reveal video is going public before the embargo anyway. Then the alleged release date allegedly leaks, allegedly. How am I supposed to present myself as a font of knowledge now, Id? Fortunately, we had a roundtable interview afterward with executive producer Marty Stratton and game director Hugo Martin. Sweet, job-justifying details!
Writing up the interview in full would involve typing out the words "awesome", "slaughter", "core pillars", and "iPod" more times than anyone realistically needs to read. Instead, here's a list of every detail I found interesting that isn't already covered in the showcase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We called Amplitude's fiendish and fanciful strategy game Endless Legend the best 4X of 2014, and its hexcellence hasn't dimmed with age. "The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly," breathed a reverential Ollie in 2023. "It's a simply splendid game." Like somebody commenting on the sturdiness of an original Picasso's frame, I will only add that it now runs pretty comfortably on the current least expensive Dell Thinkpad.
Why in Meier's name would Sega choose to sell off the studio behind such a worldly wonder? The answer is lost in time (it's through that link, there), but fortunately, Amplitude endure as an independent - and they've just announced Endless Legend 2 with no less than Hooded Horse as publisher. Here's the announcement trailer.

Between its multiple release date delays in response to Star Wars Outlaws not selling as well as Ubisoft would've liked, and Ubi potentially being bought by Tencent as they clamour for help, there's a sense that Shadows needs to deliver not only a great game, but corporate redemption.
I've now played Shadows for four hours, having dipped into a bit of prologue action, some open world exploration, and a questline as both the hulking Yasuke and the lithe Naoe. Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance. What I played was a lot of comforting Creeding, carried along by a gorgeous interpretation of Edo Japan, and some subtle tweaks to up stealth stakes. Although I do think the two protagonists are a split personality that doesn't quite work for me.

If you were Edwin, Brendy, or myself - which, statistically, you are not - you were writing news articles about one of three aspirant spiritual successors to detective RPG Disco Elysium.

Before that came sci-fi RPG XXX Nightshift, and before that was an unnamed "psychogeographic RPG" from newly formed Longdue. We now know that it's called Hopetown, and Longdue are set to launch a crowdfunding campaign which you can "pre-register" for here, should you wish. Here's the sell:

As I amble into a random village, my eye is caught by what feel like carefully observed period flourishes: a particular arrangement of crops in a sloping field, a woman praying at a shrine by the gate. Some of these sights and sounds unlock codex entries, layering up the pedagogic texture.

Here is a compact selection of ski slopes, each one yodeling the promise of my smooth and exhilarating descent over fresh powder. But wait, someone has littered this Ski Sunday with obstacles, forcing me to run a gauntlet of trees, rocks and rivers. I am thrust headlong into each of these obstacles a dozen times before my withered synapses and tired bones internalise these arboreal teachings and I make it safely to the bottom.

As in life, there is joy to be found in this journey precisely because it is hard. Unlike in life, the camera is often facing backwards while you do it.

        <updated>2025-01-23T14:00:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers, I have spent two full days in the benchmark pits to tell you what you've already guessed: the GeForce RTX 5090 is very fast, too expensive, and laden with more AI tech than Philip K. Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.
Yet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.

They are partnering with a game studio to create a playable adaptation of Macbeth from the point of view of someone examining Lady Macbeth's computer for dirt. Lili looks a lot like the interactive drama popularised by Sam Barlow's Her Story and Telling Lies. Except this has the added twist of being set in contemporary Iran. The game "will see Macbeth’s witches reimagined as hackers, with surveillance cameras and cyber-infiltration putting the player at the heart of the story..." Witchy hackers? I'm in.

Now I think about, you could probably eat quite a lot of custard creams in five months, although less so if you were using your hands to build model robots. Have a trailer. It's got robots in it.

If you encounter them in the street, you should jerk away with a muttered oath, making a sign to avert evil spirits - for these are the scumbags who've decided to develop a city-building game in which all the buildings and building materials are subject to realworld physics. A city-building game that takes place on small, post-apocalyptic islands, where the only way to expand is upward.
"Playing Jenga with human lives" is how they summarise it, the wastrels. Here's a trailer.

The decision to call it quits follows a bust-up within the development team, though this isn't, apparently, why they pulled the plug. Thorson and programmer Noel Berry have found making something "bigger and better" than Celeste exhausting, and have decided to work on smaller projects in future.

I haven't taken a shower in days and a fly has gotten into the cab, buzzing around my ears, anticipating the feast that will come from my sweaty summer death. I just spent nearly an hour driving this tractor to the shop, buying car parts, and rumbling back in the dark. I took my eyes off the road for two seconds to turn on the headlights. It was a mistake. The road curved sharply and I went off a steep bank, tipping my tractor on its side. The door is stuck, the tractor's wheels spin helplessly. There is no recovering from this. I restart the game for the third or fourth time, not knowing whether to laugh or sob.
My Summer Car is as hardcore as they come. It does not simply throw you in at the deep end. It ties you up in a cloth sack with 50 kg of lug nuts and dumps you in the Baltic sea. "Sink or swim!" yells this game at you, but in Finnish, so even that you cannot understand. To a certain kind of person, this is an act of love.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This review contains some story spoilers for the original FF7 and subsequently some elements of Rebirth, but doesn't spoil how Rebirth ultimately reinterprets these elements. 
I argued with myself for several weeks in university about whether to go to a seminar discussing T.S. Eliot's The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn't want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn't kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.
I now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It's all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It's a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like "it would be properly shit if I died right now because I'd really like to see how this pans out". A personal 'never kill yourself' moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.
An RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them? What a time to be alive.

They raised taxes!" you shout and point with one hand, holding a big bag emblazoned "taxes I done stole from the people" with the other. It worked! Now, the members from the other factions that are personally annoyed about taxes will come cull the lion faction down to a more manageable size. Bloody love a bit of politics, me!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many moons ago in the Before Times, a mysterious cataclysm scattered a number of seasoned BioWare developers across the face of heaven. The developers fell upon the mortal planes like comets. Where each landed, a game development studio took root. Inflexion Games. Summerfall Studios. Humanoid Origin. Worlds Untold. Archetype Entertainment.
Summerfall appear to be prospering, but many of the studios founded by former BioWare devs have experienced hard times. In particular, Humanoid Origin and Worlds Untold have respectively closed and "paused operations" without releasing a single game. I'm raising a tentatively congratulatory glass, then, to Yellow Brick Games, a studio founded by former Dragon Age director Mike Laidlaw. The company's debut game Eternal Strands will release on 28th January, and there's now a PC demo.

I wrote about it last year, but that was an older demo build. Things were different then, but the core of this minimalist city builder strategy remains: you'll need to actively train your kingly eyes on your feckless underlings if you want them to do any work. Don't watch the wheat fields, no food. Don't watch the barracks, no knights. You'll need those knights to defend from attacks too. Do you see how it all connects?! Do you?! Please, do your research.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debate continues to rage on the internetworks about whether premium video games, and especially the ones with the largest budgets, need to have higher price tags. This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling State Of Videogaming 2025 report that "some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc."
Picked up by VGC, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the extremely polarised mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The relaxing fish catchin' and scratchcard gamblin' of Webfishing proved itself deeply attractive to anyone looking for an easygoing escape. So it makes sense at least one other developer is looking to apply the same lo-fi principles to their own "hangout game". The simply titled Sledding Game looks like a chill afternoon of standing around on mountains with your mates and going for a big slide downhill every now and again. It's still early in development, as you can tell from the trailer below. But you'll be able to embody penguins, frogs, and polar bears as they drink hot cocoa in log cabins and ragdoll into one another willy-nilly. Other cute animals are to be confirmed, but I am putting my money on an dopey-faced ermine.

Of the new strategy game demos I've spotted so far, the one that interests me most is Calyx, in which you are at war with a mass of alien vegetation, which expands toward your base in a blossoming, suffocating avalanche of green moss and purple tendril. It seems a bit raw at the level of controls and performance, but the concept is very promising: basically, imagine if Creeper World 4 were a bit more like Ground Control. Here's a trailer.

Much like an exhausted hunter applying a carving knife to the flanks of a steaming heap of Rathalos, they shall trim and whittle their prize to its essential organs - hmm, actually we never see the concluding butchery in Monster Hunter games, now that I think of it. You just waft your knife around dramatically while the slaughtered quarry peacefully disappears and chunks of dino component materialise in your inventory.

To wit: why have a lantern, asks FPS Mohrta, when you can have a horrible vulture-esque creature called a lantern beast that lives on your head to light up the dark for you? "Found a good'un," I wrote in Slack shortly after playing Mohrta's Steam demo. "It's so rad and strange!". Well, that's the pitch, reader. It's a "nonlinear FPS game blending action, exploration, and light dungeon crawling". Very rad. Very strange. Nom nom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyclopean: The Great Abyss appears to have glorious dungeon graphics but I can't say for sure because I can't get torches to work. I think your character is supposed to kindle them automatically when you venture into a dungeon - at which point the view switches, classic Ultima-style, from top-down into first-person. My character never deigns to light a torch, however. Possibly this is because, no matter how many torches I loot or buy from the underworld's infrequent traders, my character page always tells me I have none. Is my character eating them? Are they too afraid to light them and expose what those dungeons contain? Do I need to read the manual properly? Or is it just a bug?

News of the project was pieced together by mp1st from several LinkedIn profiles belonging to former employees of studio Thought Pennies. Different sources alternately describe the project as a “multiplatform, social role-playing game" and a "fantasy live-service RPG", although it's possible these refer to different projects from the same time period.

It's the sort of thing you play for five minutes before realising, not unpleasantly, that you are most definitely inside of it now. It has wrapped you all up, and it's going to be quite difficult to escape. Trailer below:

And look, an icy and divisive fan-made map of ye olde Counter-Strike appears among them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sundays are for resting, supposedly, but it can also be for mopping the floors, washing the bedding, and catching up on work because you simply have too much to do.

Remember the Electronic Wireless Show? Two of its hosts, Alice Bell and Nate Crowley, have started a new podcast "about video games (mostly)". It's called Total Playtime and an introductory episode 0 and a Patreon are live now. The third host is Jon Hicks, with whom you may be less familiar, but he used to be my boss and thus may be considered the 5th Beatle of RPS. Anyway, go give it a listen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't think we've ever written about Intravenous 2, but the topdown shooter has been on my radar since its release last year. It's a blend of tactical stealth and frenetic Hotline Miami spraying, and it just got a major update to add Steam Workshop support and a map editor.

The FTC allege that HoYoverse "unfairly marketed loot boxes to children that obscured real costs and misled all players about the odds of obtaining prizes." HoYoverse will also be banned from selling lootboxes to children under 16 without parental consent.

Mělo to mít nějakou jinou "message" než "když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš"? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Cherry's long-awaited metroidvania Hollow Knight: Silksong will be re-revealed in April, if you believe a bunch of frantic reddit posts about cake. The standard practice when writing up such fan theorising is to walk you through it step by step, peeling back the layers like Inspector Clouseau. But I know that you are a busy person, so I will jam it all into a single sentence: a Twitter account purporting to be a Silksong developer has posted a tweet that seemingly predicts the Switch 2 announcement while using a profile picture of some cake taken from a recipe book that was published on 2nd April 2024 which is exactly a year before 2nd April 2025 which is the date of the Nintendo Direct teased in the Switch 2 announcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a lot you can do with a third dimension. Texture. Nativity dioramas. Spheres. Hyper Light Breaker, in expanding from the 2D action of Hyper Light Drifter, chooses to almost entirely remake itself as a free-roaming roguelike, trading post-apocalyptic pixel art for big proc-gen vistas and even more acrobatic swordplay.
Its technical ambition, sadly, ends up undermined by the emptiness of its world, the lack of exploratory pleasure that Drifter nurtured so well, and combat that’s more faithful to the original yet doesn’t quite adapt well enough to 3D. Not to mention it has more than its fair share of early access bugs and, especially in the early stages, balancing missteps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Three-person Danish team The Outer Zone and Frostpunk creators 11-bit studios have announced Death Howl, a very gloomy soulslike deck-builder set in a "stone-age Nordic-inspired" open world that consists of biomes with names like "the Forest of Howling Shadows". Lots of howling round these parts. 


You play a mother, Ro, whose son has been claimed by the Grim Reaper, or whatever they had instead of the Grim Reaper back then - this was, I think, prior to the invention of scythes? And cards? Anyway, while searching for Ro's son, you'll take part in grid- and turn-based battles against a regular cauldron of unspeakables, including disembodied raven heads and what appears to be a huge pair of subterranean lungs. Here's a trailer.

The company have cancelled two online multiplayer games, including one based on God Of War, according to a report by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier. Two different Sony-owned studios were recently told to stop development on their projects. One of those studios is Bluepoint, known for their work on the Demon's Souls remake. They were making the unannounced live service God Of War game, according to Schreier. The other studio is Bend, developers of open world zombie 'em up Days Gone. We don't know what they were working on, aside from the fact it was also to have a live service business model. In any case, both have been canned.
