The good news is the SNK team is "currently looking into the matter". Here's exactly what SNK producer Adam Laatz had to say during an interview with Siliconera when asked about the possibility of an "official English release" of Card Fighters 2:

I'll be honest; I came up with this headline before I thought about what this article would really be about. Because, realistically, what can I say here? "Remember that blockbuster gaming franchise that everyone loves and has just gotten a film adaptation? They should make more of those." It's kind of a "no duh" situation. I'm not the first person to say they liked *good thing* and want another *good thing*. I should probably say something a little more sensational. Okay, fine: Uncharted is an incredibly unique, industry-shaping series that resonated with me powerfully, and we deserv…]]></summary>

Street Fighter 6 was announced late last night, and I can’t stop watching the short trailer that debuted the title. Ryu’s new model looks very impressive, and wow, is he a wide dude. He’s becoming one thick, square, sweaty muscle. Luke, on the other hand, looks way different from his recent debut in SFV, sporting a much more realistic hairstyle and veiny arms that would make John Cena jealous. We have almost no information on the game as of now, but that won’t stop us from thinking about the possibilities of what may come with SF6 or what we want the next big chapter in the series to be.

You may know that Detective Pikachu was a surprisingly high-budget movie with Ryan Reynolds, a lot of CGI, and that uncomfortable scene with a Mr Mime, but you may not have known that it was a spin-off of a 3DS game, because it didn't sell massively well — at least, not in comparison to its bigger older sibling, the Pokémon series.
But there's a sequel in production, aiming for a Nintendo Switch release, that's been going since at least 2019. You might be wondering what happened to it — did it get shuffled quietly off into the shadows after the movie came out? — but it turns out that the game is still in development, it's just been quiet.

WWE 2K22 launches on March 11 and Visual Concepts/2K have slowly begun rolling out roster reveals. Every wrestling fan knows that the quality of the roster makes or breaks any wrestling game but that's become especially crucial for 2K22. The game arrives in the wake of a pandemic era that saw over 100 wrestlers fired by WWE, leaving fans worried and skeptical about who's left to plug up the holes. 
Using 2K’s official roster list, as well as combing through trailers and marketing materials, we’ve put together a list of over 70 confirmed superstars for WWE 2K22. It’s worth noting that 2K’s own roster lacks names that have appeared in trailers while other faces have been confirmed via their character portraits instead of an in-game model. We're also sure you can use this list to connect the dots on who will appear (such as missing tag team partners) that have not been formally announced. We’ll update this list as new wrestlers make the cut. 
Here is the confirmed roster so far with the most recent additions in bold. 
AJ Styles
Akira Tozawa
Angel Garza
Bret Hart
Candice LaRae
Cedric Alexander
Dakota Kai
Faarooq
Fabian Aichner
Jerry Lawler
Jim Neidhart
Jordan Devlin
Kane
Liv Morgan
Mace
Marcel Barthel
Maryse
Natalya
Otis
Papa Shango
R-Truth
Raul Mendoza
Sami Zayn
Santos Escobar
Sonya Deville
Stephanie McMahon
T-Bar
Ted Dibiase
Trent Seven
Trish Stratus
Vince McMahon
Note: Jeff Hardy and Samoa Joe were previously confirmed, but given both have since been released from WWE, there's a good chance they’re no longer in the game.

The impact and standard of Indie games continues to grow, and an anniversary today highlights another title that helped to elevate the medium in recent times.

After a successful Kickstarter campaign and being picked up for publishing the game made its mark on PC, Mac and PS4 on 21st February 2017, and in the following year earned plenty of critical acclaim, sales success and a range of award wins and nominations.

In Resident Evil 6, he tried to do the right thing by telling the American people the truth about what happened in Raccoon City, but he ended up with a craving for human flesh and a fatal case of bullet through the brain.

IGN’s Ryan McCaffery interviewed Halo’s cast and creators and when he popped the million-dollar question, the show's executive producer and 343 Industries Head of Transmedia Kiki Wolfkill confirmed Chief's face will be shown. She explains it as a storytelling necessity by saying, “We set out to tell a character story and a personal story, and once we really got into what that story was, it became clear that you really needed to see the person in the armor and under the helmet. So you will.”
Wolfkill continues by saying, “We absolutely respect both sides of that fence, those who really want to see Chief’s face and …]]></summary>

However, images taken at his home in the Dominican Republic (thanks, Vice) show he was leading an incredibly frugal existence; there's very little furniture and his computer desk sits right next to his refrigerator. At first glance, it doesn't appear to be the home of someone who has apparently made millions from selling piracy devices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Prime’s Fallout TV series has found one of its lead stars. Walton Goggins has been confirmed to star in the show, according to a new report by Deadline on Friday. 
Goggins’ most notable TV roles include portraying Boyd Crowder on the Western crime drama Justified, voicing Cecil Stedmen in Amazon’s hit series Invincible, and Baby Billy Freeman in The Righteous Gemstones. Goggins film credits include The Hateful Eight, Ant-Man and the Wasp, and the most recent Tomb Raider film. His role in Fallout series is unknown, but Deadline reports that he’s rumored to portray a Ghoul, a human mutated by radiation in the Fallout universe. 
The Fallout show, which still has no official title, was first announced in 2020. Besides sharing the same general premise as the games, plot details are practically non-existent but the series is helmed by Amazon Studios and Kilter Films, with Bethesda involved as well. Westworld co-creator Jonathan Nolan (brother of Christopher Nolan) will direct the premiere episode and serves as executive producer. Nolan’s Westworld partner Lisa Joy is also involved along with Geneva Robertson-Dworet (Captain Marvel) and Graham Wagner (Silicon Valley) serving as showrunners. The show is currently in pre-production and has no premiere date. 
If you're looking for more video game series to look forward to, here's a list of upcoming animated adaptations. On the live-action end of things, Paramount+ is getting a spin-off show based on the Sonic the Hedgehog films, and HBO's The Last of Us apparently won't be premiering until next year. There's also a little-known series called Halo debuting next month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Four classic titles included.
A Wonder Boy compilation is coming to Switch, according to a new ESRB rating.
The package will feature four titles: Wonder Boy (arcade), Wonder Boy in Monster Land (arcade), Wonder in Monster World (Mega Drive / Genesis), and Monster World IV (Mega Drive / Genesis). These appear to be straight emulations of the originals, but creature comforts such as screen filters and the ability to rewind the action will also be included. An art gallery will also be part of the collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strike.
For those of us that consider it to be the true sport-sim addiction, rather than the usual FIFA and Madden entries, news that MLB The Show 22 would represent the series' debut on Switch was rather exciting. A PlayStation exclusive for many years, Major League Baseball clearly felt a broader audience was needed and — presumably in license renewal negotiations with Sony — pushed for a multi-format approach. It's developed by Sony San Diego of course, so there was a fair amount of novelty when the 2021 entry arrived on Xbox (on Game Pass, no less, as it will be this year as well).
That was an entry that arrived a little later than normal, no doubt due to the logistical challenges of work-from-home, etc, in 2020, so it's understandable that a Switch port didn't emerge. We honestly thought the idea would quietly disappear, so were pleasantly surprised when the latest entry was not only confirmed for Switch, but announced as fully-featured and cross-platform. The support is such that Nintendo's hybrid has even been included in the 'Tech Test' week, in which servers are stress-tested and various modes put into effect.

Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn famously arose from the ashes of its ill-fated first iteration in 2014. Since then, the MMO has exploded in popularity thanks to several well-received expansions, including its latest, Endwalker. If you somehow thought Square would be slowing down after eight years, you’d be grossly mistaken. During its recent Letter from the Producer Live presentation, the publisher discussed its plans to support the game for the next decade.
It all starts with Patch 6.1, which hits the game in April. It will expand the game’s Trust System, the feature that lets play…]]></summary>

Whereas previous Street Fighter logos have used an eye-catching, two-tone gradient colour scheme (usually yellow and orange), this new logo is very basic:

      Capcom
      
If you were busy doing important things such as sleeping, Capcom announced Street Fighter 6 during the wee hours of the morning following the conclusion of the Capcom Pro Tour. A brief cinematic teaser trailer of Ryu and Street Fighter V upstart Luke is all we have to go on for now in terms of details, but that doesn’t mean we can’t speculate on what we want/expect from the title. So World Warriors, what do you want from Street Fighter 6?
As a Street Fighter fan who grew up loving SF II, was less hot on III, got back on the wagon with IV, and completely skipped V, I’m a bit out of the loop, so I'm not entirely sure myself. I'm confident the gameplay itself will be fine, but the reason I never got around to playing the fifth game was due to its infamously botched launch. SFV released missing desired features (like an arcade/story mode) for so long that I stopped caring and had occupied myself with other fighting games by the time they arrived. So I suppose my number one request for Street Fighter 6 is not to do that again. 
I’d also like to see a completely new art direction. Although I loved SF IV’s aesthetic, which was carried over to a lesser extent in V, I believe it's run its course. A new look would really freshen things up and make it feel like a true sequel. The reveal trailer looked mostly unlike the past two entries, though that could just be for the cinematic. We’ll have to wait for gameplay footage/screenshots to see how Street Fighter 6 truly appears. Oh, and make the game multiplatform this time around with cross-play and all that good stuff. 
Now that my boring requests are out of the way, it’s your turn: what do you want to see in Street Fighter 6?]]></summary>

As game fans, we all believe deeply in going from left to right. If we waste a whole day gaming, and feel like we’ve got nothing done, no one can deny we did at least go from left to right. And if a game’s story is limp and can’t find any import for its platform contrivances, it can at least fall back on the old adage that “it’s the journey (from left to right), not the destination (right)”. Okomotive’s first game was about driving a huge, convoluted truck from left to right. The sheer left-to-right impetus of the whole game was overwhelming. For the follow-up, FAR: Changing Tides, they’ve kept both left and right, but they’ve added down and up, and this will blow your mind.
FAR: Changing Tides is puzzle-flavoured, low-jeopardy exploration in side-scrolling 2.5D. The world of FAR is desolate and ruined. A civilisation, suddenly gone, leaves wreckage of homely communities and steampunky high technology to be explored by your lonesome protagonist. Extreme weather is pushing you from your home, and others have ventured ahead of you, their outcomes bleak. Whereas in FAR: Lone Sails, you geed a massive car rightwards for a faintly nodded-at reason, in FAR: Changing Tides, you will captain a water vessel instead, for an equally vague purpose. Whether you find that kind of storytelling profound or lazy, the imaginative work of the narrative is going to fall to you. There are, however, enough good sets, props and gloriously apt musical cues that if the story isn’t engaging, it’s probably your fault.

Pokémon Legends: Arceus held onto the top spot in the UK charts for three weeks, even holding off one high profile multi-platform release in the process; it's finally been toppled though, with naturally reducing sales combined with the arrival of Horizon Forbidden West on PlayStation 4/5.
Nevertheless it's still been another solid week for Switch titles in the UK charts, with the usual customers like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing: New Horizons holding their own in the top 10. Minecraft in the chart is specifically the Switch version, as a reminder, while Just Dance 22 might as well be - 93% of its sales last week were the Switch version.

Capcom has just announced a new collection of classic titles is coming to Switch, and the pack includes a coin-op game that has remained exclusive to arcades for 26 years.
Red Earth (AKA Warzard) was the first game to use Capcom's CPS-3 arcade hardware (the same tech that famously powered Street Fighter III) and arrived in 1996. It was never ported to any home system at the time, so its inclusion in Capcom Fighting Collection ends a quarter-of-a-century of coin-op exclusivity for the game.

Far: lone Sails was first released in 2018 and it gained quite a fan base – Game Informer gave it an 8.25 in our review – thanks to its unique premise, meditative gameplay, and interesting world design. Developer Okomotive is back with a sequel to it with this year's Far: Changing Tides and it promises to bring all of the environmental puzzles with it. 
This time around, your goal is to move a ship...somewhere. In order to do that, though, you'll need to find new ways to keep the ship powered, discover how to break through an obstacle, and more. In this new installment of New Gameplay Today, your hosts, Game Informer editors Wesley LeBlanc and Ben Reeves, talk about the game's opening 15 minutes and some of the first puzzles in it. 
How does it feel compared to Lone Sails? What's the narrative like thus far? Does Changing Tides bring all of the Limbo and Inside-esque worldbuilding with it that Lone Sails did back in 2018? Wesley and Ben talk through these questions and more in today's New Gameplay Today. Thanks for watching, and be sure to let us know what you think of this upcoming puzzle game from Okomotive, which hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on March 1.]]></summary>

Capcom’s weeklong countdown clock has expired and on the other side is the announcement of Street Fighter 6.
The reveal fittingly came at the conclusion of the Capcom Pro Tour. The cinematic teaser showed a face-off between Ryu and Luke, the final DLC fighter to join Street Fighter V who Capcom previously said would play an important role in the franchise's future. The art style resembles a more traditional 3D look compared to the ink brush style that defined Street Fighters 4 and 5, though this could only be for the trailer and not indicative of the in-game graphics. Unfortunately, nothing else was revealed other than the promise of more information coming this summer.

Shortly after the reveal, Yusuke Hashimoto, the director of Bayonetta 2 who has also worked on the Resident Evil series and God Hand, announced on Twitter that he's among the game's designers. 
Street Fighter 6, the newest entry in the Street Fighter series, has finally been revealed!

But wait, there's more! Capcom also announced the 10-game Capcom Fighting Collection, a bundle of classic and niche fighting games that includes a wealth of Darkstalkers titles. You can read more about that announcement here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nově oznámená verze Relačních rour v0.18 přináší řadu změn – podporu mnoha nových formátů, protokolů a transformací (ASN.1, INI, MIME, YAML, JSON, CBOR, HTML, QR, X11, XPath, XMLTable…). Nová je i podpora datových typů v CSV.

Umožňují pracovat jednotným způsobem s řadou formátů (ASN.1, INI, MIME, YAML, JSON, CBOR, HTML, XML) a vytěžit z nich informace podobným způsobem jako to dělá databázová funkce XMLTable s daty ve formátu XML. Můžeme tak vytáhnout zajímavé informace např. z X.509 certifikátů, e-mailových zpráv nebo (i nevalidních) webových stránek.

Můžeme se napojit na systém X11 a vypsat si otevřená okna, obrazovky či vstupní zařízení nebo zachytávat i generovat události (pohyby myši, stisky kláves).

Z obrázků můžeme načítat čárové a QR kódy a to včetně souřadnic kódu (na obrázku jich může být víc).

Filtry pro čtení a zápis CSV nově podporují datové typy (text, číslo, boolean) a to jak explicitně uložené v CSV, tak jejich autodetekci.

Filtry pro pro práci s INI soubory podporují řadu dialektů (formát INI není standardizovaný) včetně klasických unixových konfiguračních souborů typu klíč=hodnota nebo javovských .properties a MANIFEST.MF souborů.

Relational pipes jsou datový formát pro popis relačních dat + související nástroje, které slouží jako vstupní či výstupní filtry nebo transformace. Myšlenkově navazují na klasické unixové roury (skládání příkazů, každý program dělá jednu věc) a relační databáze.]]></summary>

A new leak has revealed nine new Nintendo-themed Lego sets are on the way, one of which will cost $229.99 – the same amount the NES Lego set retailed for (thanks, VGC).
The sets were discovered as listings on Eugene Toy & Hobby under the codename ‘Leaf’ – the same codename used for all of the products in the line. The listings were taken down shortly after being discovered, but the numbers relate to listings spotted by German Lego fansite Promobricks last year. The site was not aware that the listings were Nintendo-related at that time.

Assembled by a team of former Mana series veterans at Brownies and released on 10th February, Egglia Rebirth is a cracking good RPG on Switch that began life on mobile devices. Egglia, in its initial incarnation, was one of the company's first projects after Shinichi Kameoka left Brownie Brown — the team that worked on the legendary Mother 3 — when it was restructured and renamed by Nintendo.
We recently had a chance to interview Shinichi Kameoka, President and CEO of Brownies, and quiz him on Egglia Rebirth, its journey to Switch, and his involvement with that ever-elusive GBA title mentioned above...

It’s just as well one can never have too many shoot-'em-ups, because, no bones about it, Raging Blasters is absolutely fantastic. A Japan-only release on Switch (though available on Steam) that's magically entirely in English from top to bottom, this is the kind of indie-gaming labour of love that deserves a great lungful of hilltop-screaming. Breakneck paced with rarely any let-up, Raging Blasters is a love letter to Compile shmups that borrows heavily from the likes of Zanac.
Its presentation is superb, from the character designs to the beautifully colourful graphics and racing parallax. There’s a nice weight to the various craft and explosions, complimented by crackling sound effects. While the rolling backgrounds are simple in theme and very reminiscent of Zanac Neo’s opening stage (PS1), their deep-space tech elements are nonetheless rendered with attractive artistic heft and lovely colour casting.

After tackling Metroid in season 1 and then Halo in season 2, Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast turns its gaze to one of Sony's biggest properties: Uncharted. Last week, we kicked things off with Drake's Fortune, and now we move on to Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, the superb sequel that catapulted the franchise into the stratosphere.  
Uncharted 2: Among Thieves launched October 13, 2009, just shy of two years after Drake's Fortune. Now that it had a solid foundation to work with, Naughty Dog set out to create the video game equivalent of a summer blockbuster film. That included eschewing cutscene setpieces in favor of technically impressive gameplay moments that still offered control over the action, such as the game's famous train sequence. The writing and characters shone even brighter, from Nate himself to newcomer Chloe Frazer to everyone's favorite girl next door, Elena Fischer. Uncharted 2 also introduced a surprisingly solid multiplayer mode, rounding out a stellar package that went on to win numerous Game of the Year awards (ours included). 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and IGN Senior Editor Jonathon Dornbush (@jmdornbush) as we unpack the development history and impact of Nathan Drake's magnum opus. 
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel. From there, find the Video Gameography channel under "Community Spaces."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Know By Heart, the new game from Ice-Pick Lodge, makers of Pathologic, is described as a "sentimental adventure." It's about a group of friends reuniting in their provincial Russian hometown, which is rendered with golden hour lighting and inhabited by soft, faceless characters.

The Game Informer staff is busy with all kinds of recent great game releases like Horizon Forbidden West, Dying Light 2, and Lost Ark.

Jill Grodt – With amazing game releases hitting left and right and the weather being absolutely beautiful, this weekend is certainly looking like a good one. I’m planning to explore every inch of the Forbidden West, find new ways to take down big machines, and see if I can spot any familiar landmarks in a San Francisco reclaimed by nature.

In the first 10 minutes of Infernax, I faced a choice to kill or spare someone who asked to die. I chose to kill them, and without a moment’s hesitation, my character’s mace crushed through their skull.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right now, every big games company's shareholders have two questions: 1) can we get rich off NFTs? 2) can we get rich being bought by a larger company? Well, Ubisoft have made their stupid-ass stance on NFTs quite clear, so let's move on to question two. In a recent financial conference call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said they think they're good to stand independent, but if someone had a juicy offer, well, they might think about it. But that's a noncommittal business answer, really, just business as usual.

Cuphead made me shout obscenities at a flower. Its cheerful dragon tempted me to head-butt my television. And the candy princess? Oh, you don’t even want to know. I didn’t appreciate it until much later, but those early maddening hours with Studio MDHR’s run-and-gun platformer were like a kiln, hardening my skills and turning me into the best damned Cuphead player that I could be. That trial by fire is ultimately one of the most satisfying …]]></summary>

Today, the long-anticipated sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, and to celebrate, we're going to stream the early hours of the game. Join associate editor John Carson (AKA the King of Late Night) on Twitch at 2:30 p.m. Central as he jumps into the post-post-apocalyptic world of Horizon Forbidden West.

You may be thinking, "But, John, where's Super Replay? I want to see Marcus be a badass Jedi." I hear you, and I'd like to see that as well. We're giving the Replay crew the day off to enjoy the long holiday weekend, and they'll be back to their usual antics next Friday.
Horizon Forbidden West is the newest game from PlayStation powerhouse studio Guerrilla Games, and the second entry in the Horizon franchise. Set in the distant future where civilization as we know it has crumbled and mechanical beasts roam the land, Horizon follows the adventures of Aloy, who was once a societal outcast, that has become a hero to many of the villages and tribes she meets in Zero Dawn. Forbidden West brings Aloy, well, further west to discover a way to stop a blight that's killing the land and, in turn, what remains of humanity. Check out cool robotic creatures and the beautiful open-world vistas that await Aloy on the stream this afternoon.]]></summary>

Square Enix announced back in December that its Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster would be releasing this February, and now we know it’s coming next week on February 23. Since revealing that release date, Square Enix has released some footage from the remaster and fan response has been mixed. 
Unless you’re talking about this tweet made by the official Final Fantasy Twitter account on February 13, which seemingly nobody was happy about. As you can see in the tweet below, it features an infamous move from Final Fantasy VI where you can use meteor strike to essentially suplex the Phantom Train. In the original release, the train flips over a la like a suplex. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much to my great shame, I never got round to playing Deathloop at the end of last year. Ironically for a game about a never-ending timeloop, I just never had enough minutes to fit it into my schedule. But! I have been rectifying that this week, and cor, it's a bit good, isn't it? I'm particularly enjoying just letting rip with its big chunky guns when I mess up trying to be all sneaky-like. In my painstaking attempt to do a completely clean, blood-free ghost run in Dishonored 2 all those years ago, I'd sort of forgotten just how powerfully satisfying Arkane Lyon's eye for action really is, and I've been having a lot of fun rediscovering this as I beast my way around Blackreef's four main locations. 
As you'd expect from an Arkane game, each one of these maps is absolutely huge, full of nooks and crannies and secret passageways just itching to be exploited as you try and take down all of its slightly mad Eternalist cult leaders in a single cycle. But the thing I've been most intrigued by in Deathloop so far isn't its weird cubby holes or how maps change over time. It's all those huffing great arcade cabinets littered about the place. And some of them look very familiar indeed...

Stealth and patience are crucial to victory in a world where aliens aren't just shambling meat sacks, but a horrifying hivemind that's best tackled quietly.
But after spending a little hands-on time with Extraction's new game mode Spillover, it seems it  does away with what makes the base game tick. You plant bombs, then fend off hordes of aliens. There's something missing here.

Skull & Bones was announced in 2017 and other than a few trailers and gameplay showcases, things have remained mostly quiet on it. In fact, much of the news that has since come out about Skull & Bones has been regarding delays, directors leaving, and more. Just last month, it was revealed that one of the game’s co-directors departed from Ubisoft. 
It seems that Ubisoft is confident Skull & Bones will finally escape the clutches of development hell soon, though, because in the company’s most recent quarterly earnings report, Ubisoft CEO Frédérick Duguet said it could release next fiscal year. More specifically, if Dugu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dirigo Games impressed former RPS neck honcho Adam Smith with Depths Of Fear, and later added  two excellent games to to The Bundle. Syscrusher was a very brief but smooth and exciting shooter, and Stowaway an atmospheric monster horror. Their new game, Kingdom Of The Dead, combines the two; a striking fast paced FPS about a... paranormal vigilante cowboy, I think? It does not sit you down and explain itself, and I actually kind of like that about it.
You're part of, or possibly all of, a kind of 19th century X Files, except instead of talking and analysing the situation, you already know that the way to deal with undead weirdness is to roll up with your revolver and kick its face in. Interesting as the premise is, it's really about blasting around some fun environments for a few hours, and I've enjoyed it more with every level.

WWE 2K’s simulated grappling can be fun, but there’s something satisfying about booking your own shows, managing contracts, and drafting wrestlers, which is why 2K22’s MyGM mode is attractive. I got to sit down with this latest reinvention of the fan-favorite mode, guiding my chosen brand through a 15-week ratings war. 
Conceptually, this mode has always been an interesting conundrum. Pro wrestling is a scripted sport by design, and that includes having characters portray authority figures who run things on TV but have no actual power in real life. That begs the quest…]]></summary>

Nintendo revealed in a tweet late last night that Majora's Mask will hit the service next week on February 25. To help celebrate the news, a new trailer for Majora's Mask was released as well and you can check it out below:

Horizon Forbidden West introduces six skill trees: Hunter, Warrior, Survivor, Trapper, Infiltrator, and Machine Master. Each contains numerous abilities that allow players to sculpt the Aloy of their liking. Whether she’s a melee-focused butt-kicker or a stealth-oriented machine hacker, there’s no wrong answer in terms of what you choose. It can, however, be paralyzing to know where to start. 
Though it’s ideal to focus on maximizing one or two trees, each has staple abilities that every player should have, no matter their playstyle. The best part is these essential s…]]></summary>

Horizon Forbidden West’s new setting is teeming with exotic, dangerous, and never-before-seen machines. We already broke down the fearsome Slitherfang, and Guerrilla divulged some additional details on previously revealed robotic creatures. But, for those who haven’t kept track of the game’s fearsome new faces, here’s a handy round-up of the new machines that have been revealed thus far.

Horizon Forbidden West, Guerrilla Games’ upcoming sequel to its 2017 hit Horizon Zero Dawn, launches this week. And though it’s landing at an unusually busy time for game releases, this follow-up title is at the top of many fans’ most anticipated lists. Horizon Forbidden West appeared on our magazine cover in December, meaning we learned a ton of details about the game. So, there’s a lot to pack into this beefy round-up of everything you need to know before you start Aloy’s next journey. Let’s dive in.

Aloy and company are finally back after five long years in Horizon Forbidden West, and we're streaming the beginning of the game live on Twitch starting at 2:15 p.m. CT!
Click here to watch embedded media
Who will be hosting such an event? We got a good one for you today with Alex Stadnik on the sticks, Ben Reeves chiming in with his experience with the game and his usual brand of street comedy, and Kim "KStar" Wallace giving her impressions as we progress through the opening two hours. Ms. Wallace did the official Game Informer review, and in it, she says: 
"Horizon Forbidden West reaches a new high bar for Guerrilla Games. It does more than surpass its predecessor; it takes Horizon's fiction to captivating places and builds a rich world that rewards you for the effort you put into it. Mostly, it's an entertaining experience, complete with jaw-dropping moments and unforgettable fights."

For those unfamiliar with the Horizon series, the game's star Aloy, a hero born to save a mechanical world from the sins of the past. Our protagonist has delved deep into this world's history to learn of her connections to the woman who kept life going at a great cost thousands of years ago and how that connection makes her the only person on Earth who can prevent a new mechanical apocalypse. Forbidden West continues that tale with a cast of new and familiar faces, a vastly improved combat and movement system, and some of the best graphics we've seen on the PlayStation 5!
Can't get enough Horizon ahead of the game's official release? We've got you covered with the video version of Kim's excellent review, a whole cover hub featuring stories on developer Guerrilla Games' newest experience, and an in-depth conversation about the game on the latest episode of The GI Show!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anime streaming app Crunchyroll has launched on Switch today. 
That's noteworthy for two reasons. One, it adds another streaming service to Switch, a platform with minimal options for watching TV and movies. Switch owners still only have Hulu, YouTube, Funimation, and Pokémon TV to turn to. There’s also Twitch if you prefer watching streamers. Two, it comes after Sony’s billion-dollar acquisition of the service in December 2020, showing that the company has no intention to prevent Crunchyroll from further spreading its wings to other platforms. 
Crunchyroll on Switch, which is powered by Unreal Engine, is the first video app on the console to offer offline viewing. That means you won’t need an internet connection to catch up on Demon Slayer should you decide to fire up the app at the park or on a car ride. Crunchyroll is a subscription service boasting one of the largest anime libraries, even letting fans stream shows the same day they premiere in Japan. 
While a nice addition, the Switch still lacks streaming heavyweights like Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, and others which has been frustrating for owners who want to take advantage of its portability to watch their favorite shows anywhere. If you’re not into anime, that leaves Hulu as the only real option. Hopefully, that changes, but given that the Switch has gone five years without even Netflix, it's probably best not to get your hopes up.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lately, I've not been able to pull myself away from Vampire Survivors, a simple arcade-style game where you fend off hordes of bats and skeletons for as long as you possibly can. Aside from thinking it should've been released 15 years ago, I've come to realise how spiteful it is. This is a game that can't stand it when you're successful, and I respect that.

It's not the cold. It's not even the lack of anything to do. It's that when your main threat is starvation and hypothermia, and your only real tool is stockpiling, it often feels like your fate is already sealed come October, and waiting around to see if you survived or not carries the same sense of slow inevitability that the average RTS or 4X game does past the opening act.
My first village in Timberborn gave me that feeling. Even though its dry season is the opposite of Winter, the ultimate effect was the same. I've played this before, I thought. This is the villagers vs winter game again.
I was a fool. A big, wrong fool.

Long before Techland’s Dying Light series, the developer made waves in the open-world, zombie-slaying community with Dead Island, an unconventional, tropical take on the beloved post-apocalyptic formula. Dead Island boasted a 4-player coop campaign, zany, moddable/craftable weapons that Dying Light is currently known for, and a satisfying balance of horrifying and comedic gameplay. Perhaps you can already see why Dead Island 2 was an exciting prospect for players that wanted a similar experience with updated visuals and mechanics. And despite the radio silence and rumors of development hell, Dead Is…]]></summary>

We at the Electronic Wireless Show podcast like to think of it as Palentine's anyway, because we're all pals and you, our listeners, are all our pals too (including Henry "Vitamin H" Cavill). So today we're talking about our favourite romances in video games, but also our absolute best mates, too.
Sadly Matthew, one of our real life bestest pals, couldn't be here this week. Curiously, it's a much more well-behaved podcast than normal, suggesting that actually the chaotic influence was Matthew all along... Still, Nate updates us on his war gaming models, which are slowly becoming a diorama and/or dolls' house. I also tell him about the final third of a film about an aquarium where all the fish become zombies, called Aquarium Of The Dead. It is not a good film.

It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over-reported toxic workplace culture.

So the expansion will come to Russia too, but EA are delaying the launch one week so they can get their ducks in a line and launch simultaneously worldwide.

      Larian Studios
      
Larian Studios’ Baldur’s Gate 3 will likely be released in 2023 after years of development, including time spent in Early Access. 
This news comes by way of PCGamesN, which recently spoke to Larian head Swen Vincke about the status of the RPG. According to Vincke, the team needs another year of development, but this year will be the last full year required for work on the game.

“We’re going to release it when it’s ready,” Vincke said. “I mean, the main goal here is quality: getting the game at the quality level that it needs to be. That said, we do think we still need a year to do that. But it will be the last year. We’re getting to the end of it.”
When asked about the launch, Vincke told PCGamesN that it’s “probably not this year, but it’s not going to be much later than that.” It sounds like 2022 is off the table, but 2023 is a sure bet. Of course, anything could happen between now and then that could push back release expectations, but it sounds like if things go according to plan, we’ll all be playing the final version of Baldur’s Gate 3 next year. 
In the meantime, read about this Baldur’s Gate 3 update that includes new “game-changing” mechanics, fine-tuned roleplaying, and more, and then check out the Druid class recently added alongside a loaded dice option, better cinematics, and multiplayer functionality. Watch this fantastic cover of Baldur’s Gate 3’s “Down By The River” after that.

I've run some benchmarks of the new EC2 C6a instances looking at how they perform over the prior 2nd Gen EPYC C5a based instances, against the Intel Ice Lake competition over in the M6i stack, and also how the C6a competes with Amazon's own Graviton2-based C6g type.]]></summary>

Did you miss out on Persona 4 when it took the world by storm in 2008? Did you also miss out on its augmented "Golden" edition? I did. Even though the latest version has been miraculously available on the Steam storefront for a little under two years, Persona devotees were disappointed to see the JRPG absent from the Steam Deck's list of supported games. However, the portable PC's latest software update should please any Atlus fans looking to relive their fond memories of playing Golden on the go. Persona 4 is finally Steam Deck compatible.

Rare is bringing more content to Sea of Thieves in 2022 than any year prior, it seems, and it’s mostly doing that by adding new live events called Adventures to keep players enthralled in an ongoing story each month. The first one, Shrouded Islands, is now live in-game and players have from now until March 3 to complete it. 
To help celebrate the release of the first-ever Sea of Thieves Adventure, Rare has released a new gameplay trailer that serves as a primer for Shrouded Islands. You can check it out below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s an old chestnut from gaming mythology - you surely know the one - about the movement in Mario’s 3D ventures being perfected by Shigeru Miyamoto at their very start with Super Mario 64. Core Design managed the same thing with the original Tomb Raider back in 1996, too. Nobody really talks about it now, while the Mario story endures. Possibly because Nintendo didn’t make umpteen identikit sequels over the following decade or splash Mario’s stretchy mug on the cover of The Face. 
Really though, the Italian plumber and English graverobber were equally confident that if all their moves were available right from the start with no unlocking needed then that was enough. Both games were – are still, after a quarter of a century – the Platonic ideal of their characters. And they had bloody good swimming sections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skateboarding sim Session has added a lot in the past two years, but also lost some of its ragdoll charm. Since last year's total physics overhaul, you no longer bail with every failed trick, instead teleporting off your board in a strange, stiff way that saves time but (for me at least) replaces one unrealistic motion with another, less funny one. I want to get that gripe out of the way, because otherwise it's still gunning to be the sim for darksliding anoraks. 
The next update will add two new areas, which I got to try out recently, and some new pro skater faces. If you can ignore the frequent wacky physics hiccups and the rigid, nonplussed reaction your character has when they should, by all rights, be landing flat on their face, you'll find a surprisingly chill skating game. It's less about hoarding points with as many tricks as possible and more about pushing languidly around a city as viewed through a seasoned kickflipper's fisheye goggles.

        <updated>2022-02-16T22:55:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While it feels like we've been hearing about the TV series based on The Last of Us for quite some time, it looks like the show is further down the road than we realized. In an interview with Deadline, HBO and HBO Max chief content officer Casey Bloys revealed the show is set to debut as early as next year.
“It’s not going to air in 2022 — they are still shooting in Canada. I imagine you will see it in ’23,” said Bloys to Deadline. "Craig [Mazin] did Chernobyl for us, he is a fantastic writer and director. What I’ve seen looks amazing, so I’m excited for it, but it will not be in ’22." While it's unfortunate that we won't see The Last of Us adapted this year, it sounds like everything is very much still in production and on track to be completed by sometime in 2023.
Another interesting quote from the interview came from Deadline asking whether The Last of Us was seen internally as the next Game of Thrones. To which Bloys replied, "There is no next Game of Thrones. I’ve been here long enough that I’ve been through, what’s the next Sopranos, what’s next Game of Thrones, now what’s next Succession. There is no next Game of Thrones.” 
The Last of Us follows Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) as they try to survive in a post-apocalyptic world. Not only are the horrific zombie-like Infected an ever-present threat, but so too are other remaining humans scratching and clawing to stay alive or stay in power. The duo must traverse the United States to deliver Ellie to a promised destination. Other cast members include Anna Torv as Tess, Nick Offerman as Bill, Murray Bartlett as Frank, Gabriel Luna as Tommy, and Merle Dandridge as Marlene.]]></summary>

"What games should I get for my PlayStation 5?" This is the question we've been asked the most since Sony's new generation of gaming arrived last November. People want to see what games are the best showpieces of PlayStation 5's power, and also which ones take their beloved medium to new heights. Although the PlayStation 5 is still young, it has already amassed a nice library of games, including a few titles that you can't play anywhere else.

Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin may be a weird spin for the series, but one traditional staple remains present: the Job system. 
Jobs are basically roles you can assign to each party member that determine what abilities and weapons they utilize. Stranger of Paradise boasts 27 jobs and three of them are brand new to the series. The PlayStation Blog provides a rundown of what some of these jobs entail, including the ones exclusive to the title.
The jobs unique to Stranger of Paradise are Breaker, Void Knight, and Tyrant.  
Breaker lets players wield the legendary sword Zantetsuken (famously wielded by classic FF summon Odin) to smash through defenses and potentially land one-hit kills. Square describes this as a trickier playstyle to master but one that can have big payoffs.
Void Knight allows you to counter enemy magic attacks, either by absorbing and converting them to MP or turning back against their casters.  
Tyrant buffs your normal attacks with elemental attributes to devastate enemies vulnerable to a particular element. 
Other classes revealed so far include Swordsman (which protagonist Jack begins as), Dark Knight, Black Mage, Sage, Ninja, Paladin, and Thief. At their core, these jobs function the way old-school fans would assume but expect a more action-oriented slant. For example, Sage lets you quickly swap between white and black magic for some fast-paced spellcasting.
You can read more details on each revealed class by visiting the PlayStation Blog. Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin launches March 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You can watch the latest Frank Sinatra-themed trailer here.]]></summary>

Sony San Diego has revealed that its upcoming baseball game, MLB The Show 22, will be getting a technical test starting tomorrow, February 17, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch. 
It’ll begin at 10 a.m. PST and will last until February 23 at 10 a.m. PST giving players in the U.S. and Canada a week to try out the game ahead of its April 5 release. As for what to expect, the technical test seems primarily focused on stress testing MLB The Show 22’s online servers and functions.

“We want to deliver the best version possible of MLB The Show 22 and to do that, we need everyone’s help to stress the servers, online matchmaking, cross-platform play, online co-op, and more in addition to gathering feedback on gameplay,” Sony San Diego writes in the description of its trailer for this announcement. “The best news? No need to sign up [as] it’s open to everyone eligible.” 
You need only to download the technical test to participate and if you’re planning to play on a PlayStation console, you can download it right now so that when it’s live tomorrow, you’re all set to hit the mound. Because co-op is enabled, you can play 2vs or 3v3 online. Plus, because the test is open to all, you can post whatever you want from it on social media. 
This technical test is especially exciting because it’s the first chance to play MLB The Show 22 on Switch. This year’s baseball game from Sony San Diego is the first time an MLB The Show game will be released on a Nintendo platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The huge new patch released for Cyberpunk 2077 yesterday is mostly a good'un, bringing the dystopian RPG closer to the game it should have been 14 months ago. But Update 1.5 might be bad news for players with older PCs. CD Projekt Red have officially ended support for Nvidia GeForce 700 series graphics cards, and announced plans to end Windows 7 support later this year. This isn't immediately bad, but the game could end up breaking on affected computers in the future.

I had to buy new carpet recently, and Carpet Man told me that the only shade of carpet anyone wants nowadays is grey, resting one hand on his hip and the other on a pile of pile. He seemed weary, but livened up as I picked through some beige.
Eventually I decided on corn, a warm yellow to keep things light and breezy. To both my relief and, I think, the relief of the Carpet Man, it wasn't grey. The shade that, for whatever reason, most people like to walk on. One that tires Carpet Man and reminds me of Lost Ark, an MMO that's supremely popular for some reason. No matter how chic it may be right now, I can't see it being a permanent fixture in my life.

One, "Network Extensions 3", violates the Steam Subscriber Agreement by "discriminating against specific Steam users" blocking them from using it, Colossal Order say. Another mod, "Update From Github", aimed to circumvent the Steam Workshop entirely by allowing updates to mods to be installed directly form Github while "making changes to existing Workshop subscriptions without the user's knowledge."

Complicating matters somewhat is a sea of rumours about what else the mods contained, and a series of counter-allegations about Colossal Order from the creator of the mods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur’s Gate’s most famous barbarian wasn’t actually a barbarian at all. Technically speaking, Minsc was a ranger - a man of the woods who just happened to spin into a rage during battle, hitting friend or foe for extra damage, while ignoring blows that would fell a tree. It was a classification that came with its benefits: since every ranger was entitled to an animal companion, Minsc had justification for his connection to Boo, the “miniature giant space hamster” that lived in his inventory. But the primary reason for the misnomer was a gap in the rules of Dungeons & Dragons.


“Second edition didn’t have the barbarian class,” remembers lead designer James Ohlen. “Baldur’s Gate 2 used third edition classes, but by then, it was too late.”


Larian Studios, the current custodians of the series, don’t have any such issues. Working with D&D’s fifth edition, which has full and flavoursome rules that allow players to embody barbarians, the developers have adapted the class for use in Baldur’s Gate III. It’s a typically meticulous transposition that holds true to the tabletop game’s definition of what makes a barbarian boil: “More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.”

Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams, by That's Nice Games, is a jigsaw game that came to Steam last December. No, more than that. It is a doing-a-jigsaw game. A jigsaw sim.
See, most jigsaw games - and I idly toy with the idea of playing a bit of any new one I find on Steam, before realising that is a fool's errand - are just kind of 2D, put together this flat JPEG of a flower that I have cut into triangles. There's no tactile pleasure to be had. But Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams is a little one bed mezzanine flat in which you do puzzles - on the floor, on the kitchen table, on the rug - and each puzzle piece is a little 3D thing you can pick up and drop and turn around.

        <updated>2022-02-15T15:08:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple of weeks back, I interviewed the creator of Left 4 Dead and general PC gaming multiplayer grandee Mike Booth about his VR tabletop game Demeo. In virtual reality, Demeo seeks to recreate the feeling of playing a TRPG strategy game, huddled around a table with three pals and a load of cheesey crisps. Soon, though, you won't need a headset to play it, as Demeo is also getting a standalone PC version. I got invited for a little hands-on of the PC build, and thought that since I am a tabletop-game-playing person, it'd be interesting to bring Ed along with me. Ed likes multiplayer PC games more than me, but in the kind of kill-streak, headshot, battle-royale way. Thus, as a team, we are perfectly poised to assess how Demeo stacks up as a co-op PC game.
We played a single level in Demeo's first adventure module, The Black Sarcophagus, although when it launches in early access a complete game will stretch to three. Demeo will also have all the other adventures released for the VR version, including the most recent forest-set Roots Of Evil, but The Black Sarcophagus placed us in a creepy stone dungeon and/or crypt. The goal was to find the monster carrying the crypt key, remove the key by force, and then unlock door to the next level. Our team of four was completed by Tommy Palm, CEO and founder of Resolution games (and owner of a truly top-tier cardigan) and producer Gustav Stenmark (no cardigan visible sadly, but he seemed cool). Here's how we got on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Easily one of the standout PC reveals from last year's Game Awards, Dune: Spice Wars is an upcoming real-time 4X strategy game about everyone's favourite doomed sand planet. Based on Frank Herbert's acclaimed novel and made by the same folks behind Northgard and Wartales, Dune: Spice Wars will see players step into the boots of one of four factions when it launches in early access later this spring, and I've had a chance to see how one of them works in action. 
In a hands-off presentation, developers Shiro Games showed us how the (sadly Chalamet-less) Atreides family will be going about their fight to control Arrakis' most coveted substance - the all-important spice melange - although players will also be able to choose from the shady Harkonnen clan at launch, plus two more unannounced factions that will be revealed in the coming weeks. There's a lot to take in, but if you've been waiting for a Dune game to succeed the 1992 RTS epic that was Dune II: Battle For Arrakis, well, you better pull your head out of the sand and strap on your hydro-cycling stillsuit. The battle for this year's best strategy game is about to get spicy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Total War: Warhammer 3 is an extremely hard game to review in isolation. It’s utterly massive in itself, with eight hulking single player campaigns at launch, not to mention a greatly expanded range of multiplayer and PvE skirmish options. But that’s just the start of it. For indeed, just like beloved Warhammer villain Ebeneezer Scrooge, any attempt to form an opinion on this game has to contend not just with the present, but with the bedevilments of its past and future to boot.


While it is very much a game you can buy and enjoy on its lonesome, TWW3 is perhaps better considered as the last, grand instalment of a game whose release began nearly eight years ago with Total War: Warhammer. It’s a genuinely epic construction; a proper Pillars-Of-The Earth-level feat of game development. And here’s where the future sticks the boot in. Because while the last stones of this electric cathedral have been lowered into place, the phone line to God hasn’t been wired in yet.

Well, 1.32m were in-game, but they might not have been playing. Server problems continued after launch with long queues for some. Publishers Amazon say they're working on it, including planning to create a whole new extra European server region.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frankly I feel a bit odd writing a post that amounts to “14-year-old rendering tech works better than 20-year-old rendering tech”, but Lost Ark – 2022’s biggest surprise hit so far – has only recently come around to the benefits of DirectX 11. While it’s the default rendering option in the western version that launched last week, the original South Korean version went years with just DirectX 9 to its name, and the press build that I used for performance testing (and Ed is using for his review-in progress) remains locked to DX9. Despite the fact that, as I’ve confirmed from testing the release build as well, DX11 provides a tidy performance gain over its predecessor.

It's surprising how well the same design still works when the letters are replaced by numbers, and you're instead relying on your ability to add, subtract, multiply and divide. 

That's what you're doing in Nerdle, which is Wordle for maths fans.

Players were still experiencing issues with missing characters after downloading the new patch, however, and so servers have been taken offline "to get this resolved."
An earlier tweet from the Lost Ark account said that as compensation for the delays they "will add 3 days of Crystalline Aura to all players who log in to the game between launch and 9 AM PT [5 PM UTC] on 2/13 as a small thank you."

As I got turned to mulch by a mechanical chariot, split in two by an ulcerated lizard, and bullied by a beast man, I simply... gave up. I said to myself, "I'll come back to this later. Yeah", with that final "yeah" escaping from my lips like a wisp of steam from a kettle.
The game boiled me alive, but its open world accommodated these feverish outbursts far better than previous Souls games. There were vast swathes of map to help bring my temperature back down from simmer to sparkling. One thing troubled me, though, and that was the rate at which I'd zip between bosses in-between distractions. It felt like I lacked the focus needed to keep up with Elden Ring's open world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's tempting to think that a city builder should focus on covering more ground, simulating a wider range of those elements in a bid for authenticity, or comprehensiveness.
Power To The People takes the other approach. You're the decision maker of an energy company, tasked solely with providing electricity to towns you have no control over. Do a good job and you'll make enough money to scale up alongside the village/town/city. For such a simple premise it's surprisingly good at engaging the part of your brain that covers strategy and puzzles. Considering that power lines are normally an annoying hassle in games that simulate them at even a basic level, I'm also impressed by how entertaining it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whenever a game like Lost Ark comes out, it shows the public is still hungry for something that looks and sounds and plays even a tiny bit like Diablo. Lost Ark does provide what is the crudest part of the appeal of something like Diablo - i.e. a thousand chittering enemies flying at you at once as you vaporise them with minimal clicking - but I wouldn't say it's a lovingly crafted version of it. Like the difference between the Wicked Witch in Snow White and a Halloween costume in a plastic bag labelled Legally Distinct Evil Magic Stepmother. But there are also things I appreciate about Lost Ark in general, and its version of [flaps hands] whatever this is.
In the spirit of Lost Ark's slightly older (one might even say dated?) sensibilities, I'm going to break it down like I'm reviewing the game in a 90s game mag, separating the game into its constituent parts - just as one can remove the egg from a cake after baking it. Although I should make it clear I'm not doing our proper Lost Ark review. That honour falls to Ed, who is more plugged in to modern MMORPGs than I am. I'm just here to talk about how Lost Ark does and does not compare to Diablo - specifically Diablo II, because that's the best one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just for a second, as you hit the apex of a particularly audacious jump, the bottom end of Dying Light 2’s audio drops out. It’s as if bass were a grounded concept you’d momentarily left behind - an earthy comfort for mortals. Then the tumble begins, and you’d better have already picked out a nice, safe spot to land. This is the irresistible dichotomy of the parkour game, as first defined by Mirror’s Edge in 2008 - an invitation to soar, with the understanding that true freedom doesn’t come for free. Height is earned, momentum is managed, and mistakes are punished with a 30 foot plunge.
Perhaps you’ve seen footage of Dying Light 2’s rooftop running and wondered, “How much of that is me?” In a medium where climbing systems are typically automated rather than simulated, and first-person control tends to end at the waist, it’s natural to suspect that what you’re seeing is a fancy set of animations, triggered by pointing your character in a given direction and holding down the parkour key. I’m here to tell you that Dying Light 2 is not that game: it’s the real deal. It is, among many other things, Mirror’s Edge.

But also quite sad? My weird relationship with this game has taught me the value of an ending, though. It doesn't know how to end things, but it's also remarkably good at it when it does.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by how much Matthew made me laugh with his withering assessment of the MacGuffin in the film Red Notice being an egg, this week the Electronic Wireless Show podcast is all MacGuffin, all the time. We discuss some of our favourite examples of the plote device in question to be found in video games, which of course leads to some interesting discussions about what even is a MacGuffin. Can a MacGuffin be intangible? No, probably not.
We discuss whether any MacGuffin is improved by replacing it with an egg (yes), why a lot of games have souls as MacGuffins, and what our own personal MacGuffins would be. Plus! Impressions of Henry "Vitamin H" Cavill, and sensational new character Sir Terence Plunder. Will Sir T become a podcast regular? Only time will tell. There is no Cavern Of Lies this week, but in a shocking turn of events it's because Nate forgot, not because I forgot. Hooray!

He may be referring to his own pockets, but it can't be a coincidence that he's perfectly summed up yet another of my early hands-on sessions with FromSoftware's action-RPG Elden Ring.
That's because I've now been able to return to the starting area of Limgrave, this time on PC and with unfettered access to all the nooks and crannies we'll be exploring in just a couple of weeks time - and I found it to be richer and more vast than, well, it had ever been. FromSoftware have tweaked some things and removed some barriers from last year's closed network test, so in a single six-hour excavation, I discovered just how ambitious this game really is. Limgrave is way bigger than I first thought. Here's what I found.

It looks better than many of the garbage PC ports they were releasing a few years ago. Check out the trailer yourself below.

Sadly, in both the review build I tested and at launch, even the highest quality DLSS setting looked uncharacteristically lower-res. It was still worth using, especially if you fancied clambering over Villedor’s rooftops at 4K or with ray tracing effects, but there was a nagging sense that DLSS can do better. And now it can, for Dying Light 2’s 1.04 update is live, and sharpens Nvidia’s upscaling tech to close that gap between the rendering and native resolutions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lost Ark is a new free-to-play MMORPG that is notable because a) it is a hack 'n' slash grind that makes it a bit like a free version of Diablo, b) I have no idea what is happening at any given point in time while playing it, instead drowning in a soup made of words like 'destiny', and c) the player characters look like they work at a sex dungeon. Specifically work at, rather than participate in. They serve drinks and clean wipe-down sofas for minimum wage, and they don't particularly want to be wearing a latex catsuit, but here we are. 
For example, I'm pretty sure my gunslinger character works at a steampunk cowboy themed erotique parlour. I actually quite enjoy her attack style, a sort of hyper-aggressive DPS that allows her to switch between three different gun stances (pistols, shotgun and rifle). The dual pistols in particular come with a load of crowd-control AOE attacks like explosions and spinning  bullets firing smaller bullets, or something. And while there is some kind of story involving demons and a war and bits of stone (something something destiny), my gunslinger's quest is, currently, the single-minded pursuit of a pair of trousers.
